Research design: Feasibility study involving single case experimental design with two participants. Methods and procedures: TBI Express is an established program for improving social interactions between people with TBI and their CPs. To improve access to the program, we developed a modified version called TBIconneCT that can be delivered via videoconferencing. Two participants with TBI and their CPs completed TBIconneCT training. Outcome measures included exchange structure analysis of conversation samples, blinded ratings of conversation samples and self-report measures. Main outcomes and results: The study indicated positive change on blinded ratings of conversation and self-reported measures for both participants. Exchange structure analysis conducted on session-by-session data did not demonstrate treatment effects due to variability during baseline.

Social skills training groups have been developed to provide an evidence-based practice to target these difficulties. However, several barriers exist to implementing these groups within real-world settings, including community mental health clinics serving children with autism spectrum disorders. Our article identifies these barriers and poses potential solutions to overcoming these obstacles. Specifically, we share adaptations to the implementation of a social skills curriculum in order to meet the needs of an urban, underserved, economically challenged, and diverse population; tailor the curriculum to meet the individual needs of each participant; and facilitate generalization of the learned skills to different settings, most notably the school setting. Effectiveness of these adaptations was measured through assessing parent, teacher, and child perspective of social skills, emotion regulation skills, and anxiety at preintervention, postintervention, and follow-up time points. It is our hope that the adaptations implemented in this setting can be translated to inform social skills groups in other similar settings.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 4, 'authors': [{'authorId': '117942031', 'name': 'Jennifer S.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10‐session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods Sixty‐eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent‐, child‐, and clinician‐reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10‐week follow‐up. Results Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow‐up. Conclusions This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD.

One novel approach is to train parents to use evidence-based interventions for their child with ASD via telehealth. Pilot work examining the efficacy of one such program, ImPACT Online, demonstrated a high rate of parent program engagement, low attrition, and associated gains in parent learning and child social communication. Objective The objective of this study was to conduct an open trial of ImPACT Online to better understand its dissemination potential. Methods We examined the reach and representativeness of families who registered (n=36) compared to families who were referred (n=139) to the open trial for one referral site. We then compared the demographics of all families who enrolled in the open trial (n=112) to families who enrolled in one of two controlled trials of the same program (n=50). We also examined metrics of program engagement for the open and controlled trials, the relationship between program engagement and changes in parents’ intervention knowledge, and program evaluation for the participants in the open trial. Results In total, 25.8% (36/139) of the parents who were given information about the program at their child’s diagnostic feedback session registered with the program. The parents who enrolled in the open (OT) and controlled trials (CT), respectively, were similar in gender (OT: 84.8% (95/112); CT: 88% (44/50), female), marital status (OT: 80.4% (90/112) ; CT: 69.6% (32/46), married), education (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 54.0% (27/50), college degree or higher), and employment status (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 65.3% (32/49), employed outside the home). The child participants were similar in terms of gender (OT: 83.0% (93/112); CT: 76.0% (38/50), male) and race and ethnicity (OT: 38.4% (43/112); CT: 24.0% (12/50), minority). However, the mean chronological age of the child participants in the open trial group was significantly higher (Mean=60.0 months) than in the controlled trial group (Mean=43.0 months), with t160=5.22, P<.001. Parents in the open trial engaged with the program at a significantly lower rate than the controlled trial, F3,81=21.14, P<.001. Program engagement was significantly associated with gains in parent intervention knowledge across both the groups, beta=.41, t=2.43, P=.02. Participants in the open access trial evaluated the program highly, but several barriers were noted.

This is the first controlled trial examining video-teleconferencing to remotely deliver behavioral parent training to the home setting with a live therapist. Method: Racially/ethnically diverse children ages 3–5 years with disruptive behavior disorders, and their caregiver(s), using webcams and parent-worn Bluetooth earpieces, participated in a randomized trial comparing Internet-delivered parent–child interaction therapy (I-PCIT) versus standard clinic-based PCIT (N = 40). Major assessments were conducted at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Linear regressions and hierarchical linear modeling using maximum-likelihood estimation were used to analyze treatment satisfaction, diagnoses, symptoms, functioning, and burden to parents across conditions. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses found 70% and 55% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, showed “treatment response” after treatment, and 55% and 40% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, continued to show “treatment response” at 6-month follow-up. Both treatments had significant effects on children’s symptoms and burden to parents, and many effects were very large in magnitude. Most outcomes were comparable across conditions, except that the rate of posttreatment “excellent response” was significantly higher in I-PCIT than in clinic-based PCIT, and I-PCIT was associated with significantly fewer parent-perceived barriers to treatment than clinic-based PCIT. Both treatments were associated with positive engagement, treatment retention, and very high treatment satisfaction.

The supply of child and adolescent psychiatrists is insufficient for the number of children in need of services and is not anticipated to grow. This calls for novel approaches to mental health care. Telemental health (TMH) offers one approach to increase access. TMH programmes serving young people are developing rapidly and available studies demonstrate that these services are feasible, acceptable, sustainable and likely as effective as in-person services. TMH services are utilized in clinical settings to provide direct care and consultation to primary care providers (PCPs), as well as in non-traditional settings, such as schools, correctional facilities and the home. Delivery of services to young people through TMH requires several adjustments to practice with adults regarding the model of care, cultural values, participating adults, rapport-building, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Additional infrastructure accommodations at the patient site include space and staffing to conduct developmentally appropriate evaluations and treatment planning with parents, other providers, and community services. For TMH to optimally impact young people’s access to mental health care, collaborative models of care are needed to support PCPs as frontline mental health-care providers, thereby effectively expanding the child and adolescent mental health workforce.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 88, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7757965', 'name': 'Nicole Gloff'}, {'authorId': '6995270', 'name': 'Sean R LeNoue'}, {'authorId': '4857034', 'name': 'D.

This paper draws on information gathered from carers and adults with a disability living in a rural area in New South Wales (NSW), Australia to determine the extent to which people living in rural areas may receive a person-centred therapy service. Methods: As part of a larger study in rural NSW into the delivery of therapy services, focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 78 carers and 10 adults with a disability. Data were analysed using constant comparison and thematic analysis. Results: Three related themes emerged: (i) travelling to access therapy; (ii) waiting a long time to get therapy; and (iii) limited access to therapy past early childhood. The themes overlaid the problems of recruiting and retaining sufficient therapists to work in rural areas. Conclusions: Community-based rehabilitation principles offer possibilities for increasing person-centred therapy services. We propose a person-centred and place-based approach that builds on existing service delivery models in the region and involves four inter-related strategies aimed at reducing travel and waiting times and with applicability across the life course. Implications for Rehabilitation Therapy service delivery in rural and remote areas requires: Place-based and person centred strategies to build local capacity in communities. Responsive outreach programs working with individuals and local communities. Recognition of the need to support families who must travel to access remotely located specialist services. Innovative use of technology to supplement and enhance service delivery.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 94, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145984868', 'name': 'A.

Telemedicine increases access to psychological interventions by linking the child and the clinician using videoconferencing (VC). The current study evaluated an 8-week, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for childhood depression either face-to-face (F2F) or over VC. The telemedicine setup included two PC-based PictureTel systems at 128 kilibits per second (kbps). Success was defined by (1) decreasing depressive symptoms at similar rates in both the VC group and the F2F group and (2) demonstrating the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial in telemental health. Children were assessed for childhood depression using the mood section of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present Episode (K-SADS-P). Twenty-eight children were randomized to either F2F or VC treatment. The participants completed the K-SADS-P and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) at pre- and post-treatment. The CBT treatment across the two conditions was effective. The overall response rate based on post-evaluation with the K-SADS-P was 82%. For the CDI total score, both the Time and the Group by Time effects were significant (p < 0.05). The interaction effect reflected a faster rate of decline in the CDI total score for the VC group. The study serves as a model for building on past research to implement a randomized controlled trial.

Boredom is considered as a main unpleasant emotional state at the workplace, which could lead to stress, depression and decreased well-being. Boredom is related to the situation at hand and may lead to decreased performance. We frame the situation by connecting socio-emotional and cognitive conflict and individual differences to shed light onto the function of boredom. We look at the relation of boredom to theoretically connected emotions and their regulation. We conducted an online experiment in a virtual workplace setting (N = 57). We induced a socio-emotional and cognitive conflict situation by using a socially interactive agent which shames participants. Individual differences were operationalised through social identity and self-consciousness. We tested how social identity (predictor) and self-consciousness (moderator) influence cognitive appraisal of threat (mediator) and boredom (outcome). The results revealed that self-consciousness moderates the effect of social identity on cognitive appraisal of threat which then mediates the effect of social identity on boredom.",2021,0,0,"{'name':

2,ea8467e1d26f472a5fc8579d0fc8372149283acc,Socially Supported by an Embodied Agent: The Development of a Virtual-Reality Paradigm to Study Social Emotion Regulation,"Social emotion regulation, which can be understood as the intentional efforts by one person to regulate emotions of another person, is something we encounter and benefit from every day, and becomes especially important when a person is unable to handle an emotion or an emotional event by themselves. A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations. The school environment and the character of the friendly student also have the potential to be adapted for follow-up experiments on additional aspects of social emotion regulation for a variety of contexts.",2022,63,0,{'volume': '3'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-3.313366174697876, -2.7898108959198, -1.46319580078125, 3.06809663772583, 0.12631890177726746, 2.1955008506774902,

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR.

Animal and human studies on neural pathways underlying social buffering typically examined physiological reactions or regional brain activations. However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings.

One dimension of context that has significance for emotion regulation is the nature of the relationship between interactive partners. This review provides an organized account of existing empirical evidence assessing emotion regulation within close relationships across the life span. Specifically, the reviewed research includes studies examining parent-child relationships, sibling relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships in relation to emotion regulation. The review highlights evidence concerning how relationship processes influence emotion regulation. Based on the current state of the literature, future directions for research in this area are recommended. This review seeks to advance a more nuanced approach to the study of the social processes associated with emotion regulation. An argument is made for how building upon research concerning the relationship context as a basis for emotion regulation can further elucidate theorizing on the determinants of emotion regulation.

But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions.

An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 76, 'citationCount': 22, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2742204', 'name': 'B.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 102, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5983047', 'name': 'Dario Bombari'}, {'authorId': '2284257', 'name': 'M.

In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes."", 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 3650, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Social stress was elicited in 66 adolescent girls (Mage = 15 years) using a spontaneous public-speaking task. Mother-daughter dyads reported their relationship quality, and physical closeness was manipulated by having mothers either touch or not touch their daughter's hand during the performance.

3,cda3111ecc721560f95c4e1e81380116aedbacf3,Current Challenges and Advances in Computational and Artificial Agent Modeling for the Simulation of Affective Social Learning and Regulation of Motivated Behaviors,"Psychological science aims at understanding the development and interplay of hidden psychological mechanisms (cognitive, affective, and social) and their causal role in observable behaviors, both in adaptive and maladaptive contexts. It is thus relevant, though highly challenging, to develop computational models and artificial agents derived from psychological theories allowing investigators to explore and test hypotheses through simulations. This chapter reviews and discusses current modeling challenges and advances that are relevant to the understanding and simulation of affective social learning and the development of adaptive and motivated behaviors. The hope is that the chapter will encourage dialogue and the sharing of perspectives with developmental and clinical psychologists. The chapter emphasizes the importance of modeling the complex integration of multiple interacting mechanisms, including processes analogous to the imagination and subjective experience, in order to understand the development of appraisal, emotions, emotion regulation, and their roles in adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.",2022,0,0,{'name': 'The Oxford Handbook of Emotional

4,ae6dd87b2197fa3c58a7bfe15b3eccbfade019f8,The Effect of the Secret Agent Society Group Program on Parent-Teacher Agreement Regarding Children’s Social Emotional Functioning,"Differences in social-emotional processing and functioning characterize children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Anxiety Disorders. These can contribute to difficulties forming friendships and secondary challenges such as academic underachievement, depression, and substance use in adolescence. To be optimally successful, interventions typically require parents and teachers to have a shared understanding of a child’s social-emotional needs and use consistent support strategies across home and school environments. However, research is yet to examine the effect that clinic-based programs have on parent-teacher agreement regarding children’s social-emotional functioning. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first published study to explore this. A sample of eighty-nine youth (aged 8 to 12 years) with ASD, ADHD, and/or an Anxiety Disorder participated in the Secret Agent Society Program. The Social Skills Questionnaire and Emotion Regulation and Social Skills Questionnaire were administered to parents and teachers at pre-program, post-program, and six-month follow-up. Parent-teacher agreement was assessed at each time point. Pearson Product Moment correlations and intraclass correlations indicated that parent-teacher agreement on the measures of children’s social-emotional functioning improved over time. These findings suggest that clinic-based programs can contribute to key stakeholders developing a shared understanding of children’s social-emotional needs. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.",2023,33,0,"{'name': 'Behavioral Sciences', 'volume': '13'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

In particular, self-control is a construct that has been shown to predict academic outcomes, though much debate on this point exists. Although largely unexamined, inconsistent findings could stem from the fact that related surveys are often scored by multiple raters (e.g., teachers and parents), especially when administered at a young age when students cannot respond to items themselves. Yet little is known about (a) how much parent and teacher self-control ratings overlap and (b) what student characteristics like race and socioeconomic status are associated with inconsistencies. In this study, we use data from a widely used measure of early self-control with parent and teacher forms. We use these data to examine the impact of rater discrepancies on our understanding of students' self-control. Results show relatively low agreement between parents and teachers, with some evidence that discrepancies are associated with student race.

This prospective longitudinal study included 2,121 children, ages 3–5 at baseline, from the general population in a mid-sized Swedish municipality. Results show both stability and change in social skills. Stable low social skills increased the risk for poor school performance, while stable high social skills increased the chance for good school performance in primary school. With some notable gender differences, both individual and family factors were significant predictors of stable low and stable high paths of social skills during early childhood. Practice or Policy: Whether the goal is to improve children’s social skills or their performance in school, this study provides important clues for prevention. We identified several potential targets for interventions to promote early social skills development, which may in turn promote positive school performance. It is also notable that there seem to be gender differences in which factors are important, indicating the need for gender-differentiated interventions.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 106, 'citationCount': 8, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3622477', 'name': 'Louise Frogner'}, {'authorId': '31668727', 'name': 'Karin Hellfeldt'}, {'authorId': '1381339096', 'name': 'Anna-Karin Ångström'}, {'authorId': '3882921', 'name': 'Anna-Karin Andershed'}, {'authorId': '32524433', 'name': 'Å.

However, substantial disagreement has been found between informants. Specifically, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tend to overestimate their competencies, also known as “positive (illusionary) bias.” This study compared parent, teacher, and adolescent ratings of ADHD and other behavioral symptoms in a sample of 114 adolescents with ADHD. Further, the effect of cross-informant disagreement (CID) on treatment outcomes was investigated in a subsample of 54 adolescents who had undergone a training and coaching intervention. Overall, there was moderate agreement among informants. Parent and adolescent ratings were more strongly correlated with each other than with teacher ratings. The strongest discrepancy was found between teacher and adolescent ratings on prosocial behavior.

Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task.

An interaction between emotional encoding context and accuracy of source memory revealed that successful retrieval of emotional context was associated with activity in left amygdala, and a left frontotemporal network including anterior insula, prefrontal cortex and cingulate.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

Many families face geographical, financial and temporal barriers however, which prohibit the accessibility of these face-to-face interventions (Kazdin & Blase, 2011). The present study explored whether a parent-directed variant of the Secret Agent Society (SAS) Programme (Beaumont, 2006) could be an effective and feasible intervention to overcome accessibility barriers, and remediate social and emotional skills of children with an ASD. Seventy child-parent dyads were recruited across Eastern Australian States and randomised to one of two parent-directed programmes: the SAS condition (n = 35) or the CIA condition (an active control; n = 35). Parents in both conditions received brief training and ongoing weekly support sessions via Skype to assist with programme delivery. Measures were completed at pre-intervention, post-intervention (10 weeks) and at six-week follow-up (16 weeks). Results suggested that children in the SAS condition improved significantly more than the CIA condition on parent-rated social and emotional skills, teacher-rated social skills, knowledge of emotion management strategies for anxiety as well as reduced parent-reported problem behavior at post-intervention. In addition a significant pre-post reduction in parental psychological distress was recorded for parents in the SAS condition but not the CIA condition. At the six-week follow-up, knowledge of anger management strategies were significantly greater for the SAS condition relative to the CIA condition. Furthermore, all gains were maintained relative to baseline, however, a reliable assessment of skill maintenance at school was obscured by a low return-rate of teacher-questionnaires at follow-up. Overall, the present study provided preliminary evidence that a parent-directed social and emotional skills intervention can be an effective ‘light touch’ alternative for families facing accessibility barriers to evidence-based face-to-face interventions.

7,d5f2245011dfd06236544f0dcce492722d476ae9,Emergent behaviours in multi-agent systems with Evolutionary Game Theory,"The mechanisms of emergence and evolution of collective behaviours in dynamical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) of multiple interacting agents, with diverse behavioral strategies in co-presence, have been undergoing mathematical study via Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT). Their systematic study also resorts to agent-based modelling and simulation (ABM) techniques, thus enabling the study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters, and alternative virtual games. This paper summarises some main research directions and challenges tackled in our group, using methods from EGT and ABM. These range from the introduction of cognitive and emotional mechanisms into agents’ implementation in an evolving MAS, to the cost-efficient interference for promoting prosocial behaviours in complex networks, to the regulation and governance of AI safety development ecology, and to the equilibrium analysis of random evolutionary multi-player games. This brief aims to sensitize the reader to EGT based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines and the engineering of prosocial behaviours in dynamical MAS, with impact on our understanding of the emergence and stability of collective behaviours. In all cases, important open problems in MAS research as viewed or prioritised by the group are described.",2022,54,10,{'name': 'AI Communications'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

Here, we develop a theory of participation and compliance with respect to an explicit commitment formation process and to institutional incentives where individuals, at first, decide whether or not to join a cooperative agreement to play a one-shot social dilemma game. Using a mathematical model, we determine whether and when participating in a costly commitment, and complying with it, is an evolutionarily stable strategy, resulting in high levels of cooperation. We show that, given a sufficient budget for providing incentives, rewarding of commitment compliant behaviours better promotes cooperation than punishment of non-compliant ones. Moreover, by sparing part of this budget for rewarding those willing to participate in a commitment, the overall level of cooperation can be significantly enhanced for both reward and punishment.

This process is costly, and it is thus important to optimize the overall spending. This problem can be mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem where one wishes to minimize the cost of providing incentives while ensuring a minimum level of cooperation, sustained over time. Prior works that consider this question usually omit the stochastic effects that drive population dynamics. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of this optimization problem, in a finite population and stochastic setting, studying both pairwise and multi-player cooperation dilemmas. We prove the regularity of the cost functions for providing incentives over time, characterize their asymptotic limits (infinite population size, weak selection and large selection) and show exactly when reward or punishment is more cost efficient. We show that these cost functions exhibit a phase transition phenomenon when the intensity of selection varies. By determining the critical threshold of this phase transition, we provide exact calculations for the optimal cost of the incentive, for any given intensity of selection. Numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate analytical observations. Overall, our analysis provides for the first time a selection-dependent calculation of the optimal cost of institutional incentives (for both reward and punishment) that guarantees a minimum level of cooperation over time. It is of crucial importance for real-world applications of institutional incentives since the intensity of selection is often found to be non-extreme and specific for a given population.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 66, 'citationCount': 22, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35225892', 'name': 'M.

Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects. \n \n \nThis article is part of the special track on AI and Society. \n \n \n\xa0', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 28, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

Whether real or not, a belief in this narrative may be detrimental as some stake-holders will feel obliged to cut corners on safety precautions, or ignore societal consequences just to “win”. Starting from a baseline model that describes a broad class of technology races where winners draw a significant benefit compared to others (such as AI advances, patent race, pharmaceutical technologies), we investigate here how positive (rewards) and negative (punishments) incentives may beneficially influence the outcomes. We uncover conditions in which punishment is either capable of reducing the development speed of unsafe participants or has the capacity to reduce innovation through over-regulation. Alternatively, we show that, in several scenarios, rewarding those that follow safety measures may increase the development speed while ensuring safe choices. Moreover, in the latter regimes, rewards do not suffer from the issue of over-regulation as is the case for punishment.

In response, ethical principles and codes of conduct have been proposed to meet the escalating demand for this responsibility to be taken seriously. As yet, however, few institutional innovations have been suggested to translate this responsibility into legal commitments which apply to companies positioned to reap large financial gains from the development and use of AI. This paper offers one potentially attractive tool for addressing such issues: the Windfall Clause, which is an ex ante commitment by AI firms to donate a significant amount of any eventual extremely large profits. By this we mean an early commitment that profits that a firm could not earn without achieving fundamental, economically transformative breakthroughs in AI capabilities will be donated to benefit humanity broadly, with particular attention towards mitigating any downsides from deployment of windfall-generating AI.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 267, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1435765036', 'name': ""Cullen O'Keefe""}, {'authorId': '119127731', 'name': 'P.

However, whenever antisocial punishment, whereby defectors punish cooperators, is available, this antisocial behavior outperforms social punishment, leading to the destruction of cooperation. In this paper, we use evolutionary game theory to show that this antisocial behavior can be efficiently restrained by relying on prior commitments, wherein agents can arrange, prior to an interaction, agreements regarding posterior compensation by those who dishonor the agreements. We show that, although the commitment mechanism by itself can guarantee a notable level of cooperation, a significantly higher level is achieved when both mechanisms, those of proposing prior commitments and of punishment, are available in co-presence. Interestingly, social punishment prevails and dominates in this system as it can take advantage of the commitment mechanism to cope with antisocial behaviors. That is, establishment of a commitment system helps to pave the way for the evolution of social punishment and abundant cooperation, even in the presence of antisocial punishment.\n \n', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

Providing incentives tends to be costly, so it is important to find effective and efficient policies for the combined use of rewards and penalties. Most studies of cooperation, however, have addressed rewarding and punishing in isolation and have focused on peer-to-peer sanctioning as opposed to institutional sanctioning. Here, we demonstrate that an institutional sanctioning policy we call ‘first carrot, then stick’ is unexpectedly successful in promoting cooperation. The policy switches the incentive from rewarding to punishing when the frequency of cooperators exceeds a threshold. We find that this policy establishes and recovers full cooperation at lower cost and under a wider range of conditions than either rewards or penalties alone, in both well-mixed and spatial populations. In particular, the spatial dynamics of cooperation make it evident how punishment acts as a ‘booster stage’ that capitalizes on and amplifies the pro-social effects of rewarding. Together, our results show that the adaptive hybridization of incentives offers the ‘best of both worlds’ by combining the effectiveness of rewarding in establishing cooperation with the effectiveness of punishing in recovering it, thereby providing a surprisingly inexpensive and widely applicable method of promoting cooperation.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 136, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3187743', 'name': 'Xiaojie Chen'}, {'authorId': '2110618737', 'name': 'Tatsuya Sasaki'}, {'authorId': '2781829', 'name': 'Å.

Intention recognition can also use past experience from a database of past interactions, not necessarily with the same agent. Bayesian Networks BN can be employed to dynamically summarize general statistical evidence, furnishing heuristic information to link with the situation specific information, about which logical reasoning can take place, and decisions made on actions to be performed, possibly involving actions to obtain new observations. This situated reasoning feeds into the BN to tune it, and back again into the logic component.

The success of IR is grounded on the free exploitation of unconditional cooperators while remaining robust against unconditional defectors.

Here we address explicitly this issue, characterizing the dynamics emerging from a population of intention recognizers. We derive a Bayesian network model for intention recognition in the context of repeated social dilemmas and evolutionary game theory, by assessing the internal dynamics of trust between intention recognizers and their opponents. Intention recognizers are then able to predict the next move of their opponents based on past direct interactions, which, in turn, enables them to prevail over the most famous strategies of repeated dilemmas of cooperation, even in presence of noise.

We find that decisions within small groups under high risk and stringent requirements to success significantly raise the chances of coordinating actions and escaping the tragedy of the commons. We also offer insights on the scale at which public goods problems of cooperation are best solved. Instead of large-scale endeavors involving most of the population, which as we argue, may be counterproductive to achieve cooperation, the joint combination of local agreements within groups that are small compared with the population at risk is prone to significantly raise the probability of success.

Human communication is grounded in fundamentally cooperative, even shared, intentions. In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.

However, which of these “big three” health behaviors most strongly predicts mental health and well-being, and their higher-order relationships in predictive models, is less known. This study investigated the differential and higher-order associations between sleep, physical activity, and dietary factors as predictors of mental health and well-being in young adults. Method In a cross-sectional survey design, 1,111 young adults (28.4% men) ages 18–25 from New Zealand and the United States answered an online survey measuring typical sleep quantity and quality; physical activity; and consumption of raw and processed fruit and vegetables, fast food, sweets, and soda, along with extensive covariates (including demographics, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, and health conditions) and the outcome measures of depressive symptoms [measured by the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D)] and well-being (measured by the Flourishing Scale). Results Controlling for covariates, sleep quality was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms and well-being, followed by sleep quantity and physical activity. Only one dietary factor—raw fruit and vegetable consumption—predicted greater well-being but not depressive symptoms when controlling for covariates. There were some higher-order interactions among health behaviors in predicting the outcomes, but these did not survive cross-validation. Conclusion Sleep quality is an important predictor of mental health and well-being in young adults, whereas physical activity and diet are secondary but still significant factors.

With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 102, 'citationCount': 209, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46217950', 'name': 'A.

We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers. Through a thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '22858671', 'name': 'M.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise.

After reviewing some literature related to retrieval process, repetition is one effective way to promote retrieval process. Since repeated encounters of the words facilitate the students to access the words-related information in their mind, repetition activity will be the effective solution for this context. The spaced repetition as proposed by Baddley (1990) can be appropriate for this context since learners will not be bored about the repetition.

Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on consumers or healthcare professionals; involved a conversational agent using any unconstrained natural language input; and reported evaluation measures resulting from user interaction with the system. Studies were screened by independent reviewers and Cohen’s kappa measured inter-coder agreement. Results The database search retrieved 1513 citations; 17 articles (14 different conversational agents) met the inclusion criteria. Dialogue management strategies were mostly finite-state and frame-based (6 and 7 conversational agents, respectively); agent-based strategies were present in one type of system. Two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was cross-sectional, and the remaining were quasi-experimental. Half of the conversational agents supported consumers with health tasks such as self-care. The only RCT evaluating the efficacy of a conversational agent found a significant effect in reducing depression symptoms (effect size d\u2009=\u20090.44, p\u2009=\u2009.04). Patient safety was rarely evaluated in the included studies. Conclusions The use of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities for health-related purposes is an emerging field of research, where the few published studies were mainly quasi-experimental, and rarely evaluated efficacy or safety. Future studies would benefit from more robust experimental designs and standardized reporting.

However, current findings are lacking as to whether the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and cortical regions are involved in the learning effect when subjects retrieve associative memory, and whether their activations differentially change over time due to learning experience. To address these issues, we designed an fMRI experiment in which face-scene pairs were learned once (L1) or six times (L6). Subjects learned the pairs at four retention intervals, 30-min, 1-day, 1-week and 1-month, after which they finished an associative recognition task in the scanner. The results showed that compared to learning once, learning six times led to stronger activation in the hippocampus, but weaker activation in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as well as anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC). In addition, the hippocampal activation was positively correlated with that of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and negatively correlated with that of the vLPFC when the L6 group was compared to the L1 group. The hippocampal activation decreased over time after L1 but remained stable after L6.

However, until recently, the impact of emotion regulation difficulties for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received little attention. We investigated emotion regulation difficulties from the perspective of those who would experience the sequelae. This included parents, teachers, and psychologists. Method Seven focus groups with parents, teachers, and psychologists, and 7 interviews with adolescents and young adults with ASD were conducted. Results Across the groups, participants discussed their triggers of distressing emotions, difficulties with emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and the consequences of their distressing emotions. Both depression and anxiety were perceived as the most experienced distressing issues with the greatest consequences. Conclusions The implications of the themes revealed in the interviews and focus groups are discussed in light in previous literature and may help to inform future interventions.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 15, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6731644', 'name': 'D.

We report on interviews with 27 parents and a diary study with a separate 28 families examining these transitions. These families turn on screens primarily to facilitate parents' independent activities. Parents feel this is appropriate but self-audit and express hesitation, as they feel they are benefiting from an activity that can be detrimental to their child's well-being. We found that families turn off screens when parents are ready to give their child their full attention and technology presents a natural stopping point. Transitioning away from screens is often painful, and predictive factors determine the pain of a transition. Technology-mediated transitions are significantly more successful than parent-mediated transitions, suggesting that the design community has the power to make this experience better for parents and children by creating technologies that facilitate boundary-setting and respect families' self-defined limits."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 99, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2749233', 'name': 'Alexis Hiniker'}, {'authorId': '83550719', 'name': 'Hye-Ji Suh'}, {'authorId': '3396372', 'name': 'Sabina Cao'}, {'authorId': '1738606', 'name': 'J.

The role that storytelling played, even before the discovery of writing, in the diffusion of knowledge, in the construction of interpersonal relationships and in the birth of new societies, is well known. Without doubt writing is the earliest “technology” invented by man, through which culture and knowledge have been passed down over time, after having been transmitted orally for a long time. According to Barthes and Duisit (1975), in fact, storytelling begins with the same story of the human race, almost as if to represent an ontogenetically distinctive trait of the species, which unites homo sapiens with the homo digitalis of today’s society (Montag & Diefenbach, 2018). Other authors (Kenyon et al., 1996) argue that men and women not only have stories to tell, but that they are the stories they tell.

9,ba07c5f29871ce669a0a3493c351e29255ca252a,The boomerang effect: How nurses’ regulation of patients’ affect associates with their own emotional exhaustion and affective experiences.,"Recent research has shown that the intentional regulation of others’ affect has effects not only on the target (e.g., a patient) of the regulation, but also on the agent (e.g., a nurse). In particular, the use of intentional interpersonal affect regulation strategies has been found to predict employees’ emotional exhaustion (EEx). Use of affect-worsening strategies is associated with an increase in EEx, whereas the effect of using affect-improving strategies is less clear. Another relevant consequence of interpersonal affect regulation is its effect on affective experiences, which is one of the main determinants of job attitudes. This study tests the relationships between the interpersonal affect regulation strategies that nurses use to regulate their patients’ affect and the nurses’ EEx and affective experiences. A longitudinal 2-wave field study was conducted in sample of nurses. Participants completed a questionnaire on 2 different occasions, 2 months apart (Time 1 [T1], Time 2 [T2]). Of the 141 participants at T1, 103 also completed the survey at T2. Longitudinal hierarchical regression analyses showed that using affect-worsening strategies was a significant predictor of nurse’s EEx, whereas using affect-improving strategies did not significantly predict their EEx. For affective experiences, use of affect-worsening strategies was related to nurses experiencing low-activation negative affect (e.g., feeling depressed); whereas affect-improving strategies was related to them experiencing low-activation positive affect (e.g., feeling calm). Results support the view that intentional regulation of patients’ affect needs to be considered not only in relation to the patients’ perception of service quality but also from the perspective of nurses’ well-being.",2016,0,15,"{'name': 'International Journal of Stress Management', 'pages': '1-13', 'volume': '25'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-3.2190184593200684, -2.0822982788085938,

Prior research applies text-based sentiment analysis and emotional response generation to improve CAs’ emotional intelligence. However, acoustic features in speech containing rich contexts are underexploited. In this work, we designed and implemented an emotionally aware CA, called HUE (Heard yoUr Emotion) that stylized responses with emotion regulation strategies and empathetic interjections. We conducted a user study with 75 participants to evaluate their perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) of HUE by having them observe conversations between people and HUE in different emotional scenarios. Our results show that participants’ PEI was significantly higher with the acoustic features than without.",2021,47,9,{'name': 'Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in

Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition).

In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004).

However, this problem has not been studied in large-scale conversation generation so far. In this paper, we propose Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM) that can generate appropriate responses not only in content (relevant and grammatical) but also in emotion (emotionally consistent). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM addresses the factor using three new mechanisms that respectively (1) models the high-level abstraction of emotion expressions by embedding emotion categories, (2) captures the change of implicit internal emotion states, and (3) uses explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary. Experiments show that the proposed model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion.\n \n', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 624, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144751955', 'name': 'Hao Zhou'}, {'authorId': '1730108', 'name': 'Minlie Huang'}, {'authorId': '50615630', 'name': 'Tianyang Zhang'}, {'authorId': '145213540', 'name': 'Xiaoyan Zhu'}, {'authorId': '2149124481', 'name': 'Bing-Qian Liu'}]}, {'paperId': 'b44b751db2b6f6ef662f517e9a01e055c6e337a8', 'title': 'Automatic speech emotion recognition using recurrent neural networks with local attention', 'abstract': 'Automatic emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task which relies heavily on the effectiveness of the speech features used for classification.

Mimicry increased empathy toward the Palestinians, irrespective of participants' feelings toward the Palestinians prior to the experiment. Further, mimicked participants who reported a priori negative feelings toward Palestinians expressed more sympathy toward their Palestinian virtual interaction partner, rated themselves as closer to him, and perceived the interaction as more harmonious compared to participants in a counter-mimicry condition.

Different strategies may be adopted to achieve successful emotion regulation, ranging from attentional control (e.g., distraction) to cognitive change (e.g., reappraisal). However, there is only scarce evidence comparing the different regulation strategies with respect to their neural mechanisms and their effects on emotional experience. We, therefore, directly compared reappraisal and distraction in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with emotional pictures. In the distraction condition participants performed an arithmetic task, while they reinterpreted the emotional situation during reappraisal to downregulate emotional intensity. Both strategies were successful in reducing subjective emotional state ratings and lowered activity in the bilateral amygdala. Direct contrasts, however, showed a stronger decrease in amygdala activity for distraction when compared with reappraisal. While both strategies relied on common control areas in the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex was selectively activated for reappraisal. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate and large clusters in the parietal cortex were active in the distraction condition. Functional connectivity patterns of the amygdala activation confirmed the roles of these specific activations for the 2 emotion regulation strategies.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 508, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2197918', 'name': 'Philipp Kanske'}, {'authorId': '39587811', 'name': 'J.

11,43aa34ddf1778454248eb8500f22fa4079593a81,Understanding Emergent Behaviours in Multi-Agent Systems with Evolutionary Game Theory,"The mechanisms of emergence and evolution of collective behaviours in dynamical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) of multiple interacting agents, with diverse behavioral strategies in co-presence, have been undergoing mathematical study via Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT). Their systematic study also resorts to agent-based modelling and simulation (ABM) techniques, thus enabling the study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters, and alternative virtual games. This paper summarises some main research directions and challenges tackled in our group, using methods from EGT and ABM. These range from the introduction of cognitive and emotional mechanisms into agents' implementation in an evolving MAS, to the cost-efficient interference for promoting prosocial behaviours in complex networks, to the regulation and governance of AI safety development ecology, and to the equilibrium analysis of random evolutionary multi-player games. This brief aims to sensitize the reader to EGT based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines and the engineering of prosocial behaviours in dynamical MAS, with impact on our understanding of the emergence and stability of collective behaviours. In all cases, important open problems in MAS research as viewed or prioritised by the group are described.",2022,88,0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2205.07369'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

All agents have a tag, and they gain or lose trust in other tags as they interact with other agents. This trust in different tags determines their trust in other players and groups. In contrast to other models in the literature, our model does not use tags to determine the cooperation/defection decisions of the agents, but rather their migration decisions. Agents decide whether to cooperate or defect based purely on social learning (i.e. imitation from others). Agents use information about tags and their trust in tags to determine how much they trust a particular group of agents and whether they want to migrate to that group. Comprehensive experiments show that the model can promote high levels of cooperation and trust under different game scenarios, and that curbing the migration decisions of agents can negatively impact both cooperation and trust in the system. We also observed that trust becomes scarce in the system as the diversity of tags increases.

Using a mathematical model, we determine whether and when participating in a costly commitment, and complying with it, is an evolutionarily stable strategy, resulting in high levels of cooperation. We show that, given a sufficient budget for providing incentives, rewarding of commitment compliant behaviours better promotes cooperation than punishment of non-compliant ones. Moreover, by sparing part of this budget for rewarding those willing to participate in a commitment, the overall level of cooperation can be significantly enhanced for both reward and punishment.

This process is costly, and it is thus important to optimize the overall spending. This problem can be mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem where one wishes to minimize the cost of providing incentives while ensuring a minimum level of cooperation, sustained over time. Prior works that consider this question usually omit the stochastic effects that drive population dynamics. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of this optimization problem, in a finite population and stochastic setting, studying both pairwise and multi-player cooperation dilemmas. We prove the regularity of the cost functions for providing incentives over time, characterize their asymptotic limits (infinite population size, weak selection and large selection) and show exactly when reward or punishment is more cost efficient. We show that these cost functions exhibit a phase transition phenomenon when the intensity of selection varies. By determining the critical threshold of this phase transition, we provide exact calculations for the optimal cost of the incentive, for any given intensity of selection. Numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate analytical observations. Overall, our analysis provides for the first time a selection-dependent calculation of the optimal cost of institutional incentives (for both reward and punishment) that guarantees a minimum level of cooperation over time.

Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects. \n \n \nThis article is part of the special track on AI and Society. \n \n \n\xa0', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 28, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

This anxiety is further energised by an AI race narrative that makes people believe they might be missing out. Whether real or not, a belief in this narrative may be detrimental as some stake-holders will feel obliged to cut corners on safety precautions, or ignore societal consequences just to “win”. Starting from a baseline model that describes a broad class of technology races where winners draw a significant benefit compared to others (such as AI advances, patent race, pharmaceutical technologies), we investigate here how positive (rewards) and negative (punishments) incentives may beneficially influence the outcomes. We uncover conditions in which punishment is either capable of reducing the development speed of unsafe participants or has the capacity to reduce innovation through over-regulation. Alternatively, we show that, in several scenarios, rewarding those that follow safety measures may increase the development speed while ensuring safe choices. Moreover, in the latter regimes, rewards do not suffer from the issue of over-regulation as is the case for punishment.

Establishing a prior commitment or agreement in terms of posterior benefits and consequences from those engaging in it provides an important mechanism for securing cooperation. Resorting to methods from Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT), here we analyse how prior commitments can also be adopted as a tool for enhancing coordination when its outcomes exhibit an asymmetric payoff structure, in both pairwise and multi-party interactions. Arguably, coordination is more complex to achieve than cooperation since there might be several desirable collective outcomes in a coordination problem (compared to mutual cooperation, the only desirable collective outcome in cooperation dilemmas). Our analysis, both analytically and via numerical simulations, shows that whether prior commitment would be a viable evolutionary mechanism for enhancing coordination and the overall population social welfare strongly depends on the collective benefit and severity of competition, and more importantly, how asymmetric benefits are resolved in a commitment deal. Moreover, in multi-party interactions, prior commitments prove to be crucial when a high level of group diversity is required for optimal coordination.

As yet, however, few institutional innovations have been suggested to translate this responsibility into legal commitments which apply to companies positioned to reap large financial gains from the development and use of AI. This paper offers one potentially attractive tool for addressing such issues: the Windfall Clause, which is an ex ante commitment by AI firms to donate a significant amount of any eventual extremely large profits.

We propose using social simulations, game theory, population dynamics, and studies with people in virtual or real environments (with robots) where both agents and humans interact. This research will constitute the basis for establishing the foundations for the new field of Pro-social Computing, aiming at understanding, predicting and promoting pro-sociality among humans, through artificial agents and multiagent systems.\n \n', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 53, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145136631', 'name': 'Ana Paiva'}, {'authorId': '144438218', 'name': 'F.

To achieve this goal, analytical and numerical methods from evolutionary game theory are employed to identify the conditions for which enhanced cooperation emerges within the context of the iterated prisoners dilemma. Guilt is modelled explicitly as two features, i.e. a counter that keeps track of the number of transgressions and a threshold that dictates when alleviation (through for instance apology and self-punishment) is required for an emotional agent. Such an alleviation introduces an effect on the payoff of the agent experiencing guilt. We show that when the system consists of agents that resolve their guilt without considering the co-player's attitude towards guilt alleviation then cooperation does not emerge. In that case those guilt prone agents are easily dominated by agents expressing no guilt or having no incentive to alleviate the guilt they experience. When, on the other hand, the guilt prone focal agent requires that guilt only needs to be alleviated when guilt alleviation is also manifested by a defecting co-player, then cooperation may thrive. This observation remains consistent for a generalised model as is discussed in this article. In summary, our analysis provides important insights into the design of multi-agent and cognitive agent systems where the inclusion of guilt modelling can improve agents' cooperative behaviour and overall benefit."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 32, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1747400', 'name': 'L.

Friedman was focused on the infrastructure of communications and technology-the new web-based platform that allows business to follow the hunt for lower costs, higher value and greater efficiency around the planet seemingly oblivious to the boundaries of nation states. Hadfield peels back this technological platform to look at the 'structure that lies beneath'--our legal infrastructure, the platform of rules about who can do what, when and how. Often taken for granted, economic growth throughout human history has depended at least as much on the evolution of new systems of rules to support ever-more complex modes of cooperation and trade as it has on technological innovation. When Google rolled out YouTube in over one hundred countries around the globe simultaneously, for example, it faced not only the challenges of technology but also the staggering problem of how to build success in the context of a bewildering and often conflicting patchwork of nation-state-based laws and legal systems affecting every aspect of the business-contract, copyright, encryption, censorship, advertising and more. Google is not alone. A study presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2011 found that for global firms, the number one challenge of the modern economy is increasing complexity, and the number one source of complexity is law. Today, even our startups, the engines of economic growth, are global from Day One. Put simply, the law and legal methods on which we currently rely have failed to evolve along with technology. They are increasingly unable to cope with the speed, complexity, and constant border-crossing of our new globally inter-connected environment. Our current legal systems are still rooted in the politics-based nation state platform on which the industrial revolution was built. Hadfield argues that even though these systems supported fantastic growth over the past two centuries, today they are too slow, costly, cumbersome and localized to support the exponential rise in economic complexity they fostered. While everything else in the economy strives to become cheaper, sleeker and faster, our outdated approach to law hampers the invention of new products, the development of new business models, the structuring of global supply chains, the management of the risks posed by complex technologies, the evolution of financial, ecological, and other systems, as well as the protection of people and businesses as they and their products travel around the globe. They also fail to address looming challenges such as global warming and the reduction of poverty and oppression in the developing countries that are the backyard of global business. The answer to our troubles with law, however, is not the one critics usually reach for--to have less of it. Recognizing that law provides critical infrastructure for the cooperation and collaboration on which economic growth is built is the first step, Hadfield argues, to building a legal environment that does more of what we need it to do and less of what we don't. Through a sweeping review of first the invention and then the evolution of law over thousands of years of human development and the ways in which rule systems have consistently adapted to higher levels of complexity, Hadfield stresses that the state-based legal systems governing us today are not the only way to build the planks of a legal platform. Going back to fundamentals, she shows how historically, law's primary purpose has been to help societies to cope with the essential issues of trust, commitment, risk-allocation, and distribution that we face in coordinating cooperative ventures. While nation-state laws will never disappear, the time has come for us to supplement our legal infrastructure with rules developed on the same global platform as our economy. Hadfield offers a model for a more market- and globally-oriented legal system that fosters greater participation of end-users, market actors, and other non-governmental entities. Combining an impressive grasp of the empirical details of economic globalization with an ambitious re-envisioning of our global legal system, Rules for a Flat World promises to be a crucial and influential intervention into the debates surrounding how best to manage the evolving global economy."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 58, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40051700', 'name': 'Gillian K.

However, whenever antisocial punishment, whereby defectors punish cooperators, is available, this antisocial behavior outperforms social punishment, leading to the destruction of cooperation. In this paper, we use evolutionary game theory to show that this antisocial behavior can be efficiently restrained by relying on prior commitments, wherein agents can arrange, prior to an interaction, agreements regarding posterior compensation by those who dishonor the agreements. We show that, although the commitment mechanism by itself can guarantee a notable level of cooperation, a significantly higher level is achieved when both mechanisms, those of proposing prior commitments and of punishment, are available in co-presence. Interestingly, social punishment prevails and dominates in this system as it can take advantage of the commitment mechanism to cope with antisocial behaviors. That is, establishment of a commitment system helps to pave the way for the evolution of social punishment and abundant cooperation, even in the presence of antisocial punishment.\n \n', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

Providing incentives tends to be costly, so it is important to find effective and efficient policies for the combined use of rewards and penalties. Most studies of cooperation, however, have addressed rewarding and punishing in isolation and have focused on peer-to-peer sanctioning as opposed to institutional sanctioning. Here, we demonstrate that an institutional sanctioning policy we call ‘first carrot, then stick’ is unexpectedly successful in promoting cooperation. The policy switches the incentive from rewarding to punishing when the frequency of cooperators exceeds a threshold. We find that this policy establishes and recovers full cooperation at lower cost and under a wider range of conditions than either rewards or penalties alone, in both well-mixed and spatial populations. In particular, the spatial dynamics of cooperation make it evident how punishment acts as a ‘booster stage’ that capitalizes on and amplifies the pro-social effects of rewarding.

In addition, we show that in both cases, with or without commitments, apology works only if it is sincere, i.e. costly enough. Most interestingly, our model predicts that individuals tend to use much costlier apology in committed relationships than otherwise, because it helps better identify free-riders such as fake committers: ""commitments bring about sincerity\'.

Intention recognition can also use past experience from a database of past interactions, not necessarily with the same agent.

The success of IR is grounded on the free exploitation of unconditional cooperators while remaining robust against unconditional defectors.

We derive a Bayesian network model for intention recognition in the context of repeated social dilemmas and evolutionary game theory, by assessing the internal dynamics of trust between intention recognizers and their opponents.

Here, we introduce an evolutionary dynamics approach to a broad class of cooperation problems in which attempting to minimize future losses turns the risk of failure into a central issue in individual decisions. We find that decisions within small groups under high risk and stringent requirements to success significantly raise the chances of coordinating actions and escaping the tragedy of the commons. We also offer insights on the scale at which public goods problems of cooperation are best solved. Instead of large-scale endeavors involving most of the population, which as we argue, may be counterproductive to achieve cooperation, the joint combination of local agreements within groups that are small compared with the population at risk is prone to significantly raise the probability of success.

In contrast with previous results, the present formula is valid at all intensities of selection and for any initial condition. We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of cooperators in finite populations, and study the interplay between intensity of selection and the remnants of interior fixed points in infinite populations, as a function of a given initial number of cooperators, showing how this interplay strongly affects the approach to fixation of a given trait in finite populations, leading to counterintuitive results at different intensities of selection.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 495, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3040005', 'name': 'A.

As such, there is a huge range of work that the book could cover – from distributed software agents to cellular automata. A more accurate gloss of the actual content of the book comes in the introductory chapter – ‘designing problem solving devices inspired by social insects’ (p.23). Within this more circumscribed \x8eeld, the book provides fairly comprehensive coverage of recent research developments. It thus constitutes an excellent resource for researchers in the \x8eeld or for those wishing to familiarize themselves with current approaches e.g. it would be an ideal introduction for a doctoral student wanting to enter this area. But why and how should social insects inspire methods for problem solving? The introduction (Chapter 1) claims the critical concepts are self-organization and stigmergy. Self-organization is more or less self-explanatory – the idea that some kind of global coherence in structure or behaviour can emerge from purely local interactions. As such it is not a new concept (as the authors recognize, much of the theoretical work in this area comes from physics) nor is it evident that it applies to all social insect behaviour. For example, it could be argued that the idea (discussed in Chapter 5) of a template – a structure in the environment that organises the local activity towards a constrained result – is a global mechanism in much the same way as a centralized plan. However it is true that much of the success and \x8fexibility of social insect behaviour does seem to be the emergent result of local actions. Insect swarms provide an existence proof of the potential power of self-organizing systems. They can also provide speci\x8ec ideas as to the kinds of local interactions to implement. If termites can build a huge, well-structured nest, and ants alternate their activities dynamically to increase colony ef\x8eciency, then it should be possible to copy their local behaviours to achieve comparable global results. Stigmergy may be a less familiar term but refers to one important mechanism for successful self-organization: how agents’ effects on their environment can feed back to modify each others’ and their own behaviour. A good example discussed at length in Chapter 4 is distributed clustering. A simple agent behaviour of picking up isolated objects and dropping them when another object is encountered leads to the formation of initial small clusters that can effectively guide the further development of larger ones. These ideas have become an attractive (some might say seductive) alternative to more conventional ‘centralized’ approaches to problem solving. By providing an overview, this book allows some assessment of how successful this approach has been, as discussed further below. The presentation is nicely structured, with each chapter taking a different example of insect social behaviour – foraging, task allocation, brood sorting, self-organization and templates, nest building and co-operative transport – and presenting \x8erst the biological data, then models proposed to explain it, then the generalization of such models to solve analogous problems such as routing in Connection Science, Vol. 14, No. 2, 2002, 163–164', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 2923, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144145429', 'name': 'B.

Human communication is grounded in fundamentally cooperative, even shared, intentions. In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.

Many of the results we obtain remain valid in more general settings (e.g., when the dynamic has an aggregate tendency toward favoring more fit strategies, but not necessarily as strongly as the replicator dynamic). We next turn to asymmetric evolutionary games (\x9012.17), which have the surprising property, a property that is extremely important from the point of view of understanding real-world evolutionary dynamics, that strictly mixed Nash equilibria are never asymptotically stable but are often neutrally stable, leading to generically stable orbits (the Lotka-Volterra model has orbits, but it is not generic, as small changes in the coefficients lead to the equilibrium being either a stable or an unstable focus). In asymmetric games, the limit points of dynamic processes are generally Nash equilib-271', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 1212, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145012155', 'name': 'R.

Such stepwise adaptation can occur through individual learning or through natural selection, the basis of evolution. Since the work of Maynard Smith and others, it has been realized how game theory can model this process. Evolutionary game theory replaces the static solutions of classical game theory by a dynamical approach centered not on the concept of rational players but on the population dynamics of behavioral programs. In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the self-regulation of social and economic behavior, and of the closely related interactions among species in ecological communities. Replicator equations describe how successful strategies spread and thereby create new conditions that can alter the basis of their success, i.e., to enable us to understand the strategic and genetic foundations of the endless chronicle of invasions and extinctions that punctuate evolution. In short, evolutionary game theory describes when to escalate a conflict, how to elicit cooperation, why to expect a balance of the sexes, and how to understand natural selection in mathematical terms. \n \n Comprehensive treatment of ecological and game theoretic dynamics \n Invasion dynamics and permanence as key concepts \n Explanation in terms of games of things like competition between species', 'year': 1998, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 4950, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144012376', 'name': 'J.

Metacognitive Events Classification in Human-Agent Interactions,"For an agent, either human or artificial, to show intelligent interactive behaviour implies assessments of the reliability of own and others’ thoughts, feelings and beliefs. Agents capable of these robust evaluations are able to adequately interpret their own and others’ cognitive and emotional processes, anticipate future actions, and improve their decision-making and interactive performances across domains and contexts. Reliable instruments to assess interlocutors’ mindful capacities for monitoring and regulation - metacognition - in human-agent interaction in real-time and continuously are of crucial importance however challenging to design. The presented study reports Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA) experiments in order to access and evaluate metacognitive dispositions and attitudes of participants in human-agent interactions. A typology of metacognitive events related to the ‘verbalized’ monitoring, interpretation, reflection and regulation activities observed in a multimodal dialogue has been designed, and serves as a valid tool to identify relation between participants’ behaviour analysed in terms of ISO 24617-2 compliant dialogue acts and the corresponding metacognitive indicators.",2022,37,0,,"{'model':

It can also be applied to others, in which case it is known as mentalizing. Both kinds of metacognition have implicit and explicit forms, where implicit means automatic and without awareness. Implicit metacognition enables us to adopt a we-mode, through which we automatically take account of the knowledge and intentions of others. Adoption of this mode enhances joint action. Explicit metacognition enables us to reflect on and justify our behaviour to others. However, access to the underlying processes is very limited for both self and others and our reports on our own and others' intentions can be very inaccurate. On the other hand, recent experiments have shown that, through discussions of our perceptual experiences with others, we can detect sensory signals more accurately, even in the absence of objective feedback. Through our willingness to discuss with others the reasons for our actions and perceptions, we overcome our lack of direct access to the underlying cognitive processes.

In this review, we consider progress in characterizing the neural and mechanistic basis of these related aspects of metacognition—confidence judgements and error monitoring—and identify crucial points of convergence between methods and theories in the two fields. This convergence suggests that common principles govern metacognitive judgements of confidence and accuracy; in particular, a shared reliance on post-decisional processing within the systems responsible for the initial decision. However, research in both fields has focused rather narrowly on simple, discrete decisions—reflecting the correspondingly restricted focus of current models of the decision process itself—raising doubts about the degree to which discovered principles will scale up to explain metacognitive evaluation of real-world decisions and actions that are fluid, temporally extended, and embedded in the broader context of evolving behavioural goals.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 450, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144927959', 'name': 'N.

Research over the past 20 years or so has revealed that many symptoms associated with schizophrenia can be interpreted as a result of poor “metacognition”, first defined as the ability to think about ones mental operations, which in our understanding more specifically refers to the ability to reflect upon mental states of oneself and others, and to flexibly entertain this knowledge in social interaction and problemsolving (termed “mastery”). The latter aspect implies that metacognitive dysfunction is putatively critical to explain social impairment. Method: The present article reviews the evidence for a link between metacognitive deficits in schizophrenia and poor social functioning. Results: Metacognition including its subcomponents such as self-reflectivity, empathetic perspective-taking and mastery are profoundly linked with awareness of illness and social functioning in schizophrenia. The impact of metacognition on awareness of illness and social functioning seems to be partially independent of neurocognitive functioning.

Two ideas seem to be prevalent in the literature concerning the notion of dimension: (1) dimensions correspond to different types of information; and (2) a dimension is formed by a set of mutually exclusive tags. In DAMSL, for instance, the terms \x93dimension\x94 and \x93layer\x94 are used sometimes in the sense of (1) and sometimes in that of (2). We argue that being mutually exclusive is not a good criterion for a set of dialogue act types to constitute a dimension, even though the description of an object in a multidimensional space should never assign more than one value per dimension. We define a dimension of dialogue act annotation as an aspect of participating in a dialogue that can be addressed independently by means of dialogue acts. We show that DAMSL dimensions such as Info-request, Statement, and Answer do not qualify as proper dimensions, and that the communicative functions in these categories do not fall in any specific dimension, but should be considered as \x93general-purpose\x94 in the sense that they can be used in any dimension.

MARTINEZ is an associate professor in the Department of Education at the University of California, Irvine. THE DISCOVERY and theoretical elaboration of metacognition constitute a major breakthrough in recent decades of cognitive research. While it is always best to begin with definitions, a concept as complex as metacognition demands that our initial definition be provisional. This definition will become more detailed and complete as our understanding grows. Many teachers would describe metacognition, quite acceptably, as ""thinking about thinking."" But I would propose a more precise definition: metacognition is the monitoring and control of thought. In this article, I seek to clarify the concept of metacognition and to present ideas about how metacognitive ability can be taught. Metacognition serves many diverse functions, as does language. Consider what the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein had to say about language: ""Think of the tools in a tool-box: There is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails, and screws. The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects."" (1) The toolbox is an equally apt metaphor for metacognition. To give a sense of the breadth of metacognitive functioning, I have identified three major categories of metacognition: metamemory and metacomprehension, problem solving, and critical thinking. While this simple taxonomy does not exhaust the many types of metacognition, it does communicate the broad role of the process in important cognitive endeavors. Metamemory and metacomprehension. I have grouped these two concepts together because both refer to an understanding of one\'s own knowledge state. To grasp metamemory, think about being asked if you are able to name the planets of our solar system in order of their distance from the sun. Now, you either can or cannot do so. But your answer to the question might be yes or no in either case. That is, you can be accurate or inaccurate in your appraisal of your own knowledge. Is this accuracy important? Yes, it is. Research has shown that this self-insight has predictive power for subsequent learning. (2) Metacomprehension is a similar concept with similar importance to learning. Comprehension during reading or listening can be either good or poor. But independent of learners\' true comprehension is whether they realize that their comprehension is good or poor. This appraisal can sometimes be very inaccurate. You can easily imagine a student reading a textbook page and not understanding it--and moreover not realizing that he does not understand it. Believing that one understands when one does not is a serious and common error. But even more serious is when students don\'t even consider whether they comprehend but simply take notes or read mechanically. Problem solving. This almost exclusively human pursuit is a significant category of cognitive activity. Problem solving is exercised daily, often continuously, especially in a complex society where following established rules and procedures is not enough to succeed. Problem solving can be defined simply as the pursuit of a goal when the path to that goal is uncertain. In other words, it\'s what you do when you don\'t know what you\'re doing. Scientific research is a form of problem solving; so is teaching. Neither of these enterprises is algorithmic. Both involve continuously generating possibilities, weighing those options, exploring subsets of options, and evaluating the results. Herbert Simon used the metaphor of finding your way through a maze to describe this process. Problem solving certainly involves cognition. But more is required: constantly stepping back mentally to appraise and rework plans by asking such questions as, What am I trying to accomplish? What are the most promising pathways? Is my strategy working? Critical thinking. Like problem solving, critical thinking encompasses a lot of what human beings do--or at least potentially can do. …', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 4, 'citationCount': 350, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144950035', 'name': 'Michael E.

The observational study involved the video-recording of 582 metacognitive or self-regulatory ‘events’ within Foundation Stage settings. The two experimental studies replicated in different learning domains the classic study of Sylva, Bruner and Genova (1976), which contrasted the problem-solving performance of 3- to 5-year-old children who had experienced a ‘taught’ and ‘play’ condition.Evidence from the present studies reported and other studies supports the view that play, and particularly pretence or symbolic play, which might be with objects or other children, is particularly significant in its contribution to the development of children as metacognitively skilful, self-regulated learners. Evidence from the observational study indicated that child-initiated playful activities, in small groups without adult supervision, supported the greatest proportion of self-regulatory behaviours. The experimental studies suggested that the experience of the ‘play’ condition was particularly effective in preparing the children for effortful, problem-solving or creative tasks which require a high level of metacognitive and self-regulatory skill.Metacognitive and self-regulatory development is crucially important in the development of academic skills which involve intentional learning, problem-solving and creativity. An understanding of the relationship between pretend or symbolic play and self-regulation is also helpful in providing clear guidelines for adults working with young children as regards their role in supporting and encouraging play in educational contexts.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 137, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2113522', 'name': 'D.

Metacognition refers to higher order thinking that involves active control over the cognitive processes engaged in learning. Because metacognition plays a critical role in successful learning, it is important to study metacognitive activity and development to determine how students can be taught to apply their cognitive resources through metacognitive control. The term ""metacognition"" is most often associated with John Flavell (1979), who proposed that metacognition consists of both metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive experiences or regulation. Flavell further divides metacognitive knowledge into knowledge of person variables, task variables, and strategy variables. Most definitions of metacognition include both knowledge and strategy components. Most individuals of normal intelligence engage in metacognitive regulation when confronted with an effortful cognitive task, but some are more metacognitive than others. The most effective approaches to metacognitive instruction involve providing the learner with both knowledge of cognitive processes and strategies and experience or practice in using both cognitive and metacognitive strategies. The study of metacognition has important implications for instructional intervention. (Contains 16 references.)

Although the focus of this chapter is on the metacognitive aspects of learning and memory -which throughout the chapter will be called metammoryboth the overall approach and many of the points apply as well to other aspects of cognition. Emphasis is placed on some shortcomings in previous research on memory that have been commented on by several prominent investigators.

The older subjects studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were, that is, they showed perfect recall. The younger children studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were not. In another study, elementary school children were asked to help the experimenter evaluate the communicative adequacy of verbal instructions, indicating any omissions and obscurities (Markman, 1977). Although the instructions were riddled with blatant omissions and obscurities, the younger subjects were surprisingly poor at detecting them. They incorrectly thought they had understood and could follow the instructions, much as their counterparts in the study by Flavell et al. (1970) incorrectly thought they had memorized and could recall the items. Results such as these have suggested that young children are quite limited in their knowledge and cognition about cognitive phenomena, or in their metacognition, and do relatively little monitoring of their own memory, comprehension, and other cognitive enterprises (see, e.g., Brown, 1978; Flavell, 1978; Flavell & Wellman, 1977; Kreutzer, Leonard, & Flavell, 1975; Flavell, Note 1, Note 2, Note 3; Markman, Note 4).

Over the course of the last 20 years, multiple researchers have studied sensory and motor connections within the amygdala in trying to understand the ultimate role of this structure in pain perception and descending control of pain. A number of investigators have been using cell-type specific manipulations to probe the underlying circuitry of the amygdala. As data have accumulated in this research space, we recognized a critical need for a single framework to integrate these data and evaluate emergent system-level responses. In this manuscript, we present an agent-based computational model of two distinct inhibitory neuron populations in the amygdala, those that express protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) and those that express somatostatin (SOM). We utilized a network of neural links to simulate connectivity and the transmission of inhibitory signals between neurons. Type-specific parameters describing the response of these neurons to noxious stimuli were estimated from published physiological and immunological data as well as our own wet-lab experiments. The model outputs an abstract measure of pain, which is calculated in terms of the cumulative pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive activity across neurons in both hemispheres of the amygdala. Results demonstrate the ability of the model to produce changes in pain that are consistent with published studies and highlight the importance of several model parameters. In particular, we found that the relative proportion of PKCδ and SOM neurons within each hemisphere is a key parameter in predicting pain and we explored model predictions for three possible values of this parameter. We compared model predictions of pain to data from our earlier behavioral studies and found areas of similarity as well as distinctions between the data sets. These differences, in particular, suggest a number of wet-lab experiments that could be done in the future.",2021,48,8,"{'name': 'PLoS Computational Biology', 'volume': '17'}","{'model': 'specter_v1',

This increase is often attributed to the “accumulation of damage” known to occur in many biological structures and systems. The aim of this paper is to describe a generic model of damage accumulation and death in which mortality increases exponentially with age. The damage-accumulation process is modeled by a stochastic process know as a queue, and risk of dying is a function of the accumulated damage, i.e., length of the queue. The model has four parameters and the main characteristics of the model are: (i) damage occurs at random times with a constant high rate; (ii) the damage is repaired at a limited rate, and consequently damage can accumulate; (iii) the efficiency of the repair mechanism decays linearly with age; (iv) the risk of dying is a function of the accumulated damage. Using standard results from the mathematical theory of queues it is shown that there is an exponential dependence between risk of dying and age in these models, and that this dependency holds irrespective of how the damage-accumulation process is modeled. Furthermore, the ways in which this exponential dependence is shaped by the model parameters are also independent of the details of the damage accumulation process. These generic features suggest that the model could be useful when interpreting changes in the relation between age and mortality in real data. To exemplify, historical mortality data from Sweden are interpreted in the light of the model. The decrease in mortality seen between cohorts born in 1905, compared to those born in 1885, can be accounted for by higher threshold to damage. This fits well with the many advances made in public health during the 20th century.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 12, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47375699', 'name': 'A.

The underlying features supporting cell-type-specific function in the CeA, however, remain unknown. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute mouse brain slices and biocytin-based neuronal reconstructions, we demonstrate that neuronal morphology and relative excitability are two distinguishing features between Som+ and PKCδ+ neurons in the laterocapsular subdivision of the CeA (CeLC). Som+ neurons, for example, are more excitable, compact, and with more complex dendritic arborizations than PKCδ+ neurons. Cell size, intrinsic membrane properties, and anatomic localization were further shown to correlate with cell-type-specific differences in excitability. Lastly, in the context of neuropathic pain, we show a shift in the excitability equilibrium between PKCδ+ and Som+ neurons, suggesting that imbalances in the relative output of these cells underlie maladaptive changes in behaviors. Together, our results identify fundamentally important distinguishing features of PKCδ+ and Som+ cells that support cell-type-specific function in the CeA.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 25, 'authors': [{'authorId': '10243088', 'name': 'A.

Nevertheless, a relationship between radiation (dose and dose rate) and response (e.g., incidence, onset and progression) remains incompletely understood, raising the need for a risk-predictive mathematical model. We here report for the first time an in silico model for cataractogenesis. First, a simplified cell proliferation model was developed for human lens growth based on stem and progenitor cell proliferation as well as epithelial-fiber cell differentiation. Then, a model for spontaneous cataractogenesis was developed to reproduce the human data on a relationship between age and cataract incidence. Finally, a model for radiation cataractogenesis was developed that can reproduce the human data on a relationship between dose and cataract onset at various ages, which was further applied to estimate cataract incidence following chronic lifetime exposure. The model can serve as the foundation for further development of the risk-predictive model for cataractogenesis along with additional considerations of various biological mechanisms and epidemiological datasets.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34506995', 'name': 'T.

Agent‐based modeling is well suited to translating into a computational model the knowledge generated from basic science research, particularly with respect to translating across scales the mechanisms of cellular behavior into aggregated cell population dynamics manifesting at the tissue and organ level. This capacity has made agent‐based modeling an integral method in translational systems biology (TSB), an approach that uses multiscale dynamic computational modeling to explicitly represent disease processes in a clinically relevant fashion. The initial work in the early 2000s using agent‐based models (ABMs) in TSB focused on examining acute inflammation and its intersection with wound healing; the decade since has seen vast growth in both the application of agent‐based modeling to a wide array of disease processes as well as methodological advancements in the use and analysis of ABM. This report presents an update on an earlier review of ABMs in TSB and presents examples of exciting progress in the modeling of various organs and diseases that involve inflammation.

The spino-(trigemino-)parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway is one of the principal pathways mediating signals from nociception-specific ascending neurons to the central amygdala, a limbic structure involved in aversive signal-associated emotional responses, including the emotional aspects of pain. Recent studies suggest that the right and left central amygdala play distinct roles in the regulation of nociceptive responses. Using a latent formalin inflammatory pain model of the rat, we analyzed the right–left differences in synaptic potentiation at the synapses formed between the fibers from the lateral parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala neurons as well as those in the c-Fos expression in the lateral parabrachial nucleus, central amygdala, and the basolateral/lateral amygdala after formalin injection to either the right or left side of the rat upper lip. Although the single-sided formalin injection caused a significant bilateral increase in c-Fos-expressing neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus with slight projection-side dependence, the increase in the amplitude of postsynaptic excitatory currents and the number of c-Fos-expressing neurons in the central amygdala occurred predominantly on the right side regardless of the side of the inflammation. Although there was no significant correlation in the number of c-Fos-expressing neurons between the lateral parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala in the formalin-injected animals, these numbers were significantly correlated between the basolateral amygdala and central amygdala. It is thus concluded that the lateral parabrachial nucleus-central amygdala synaptic potentiation reported in various pain models is not a simple Hebbian plasticity in which raised inputs from the lateral parabrachial nucleus cause lateral parabrachial nucleus-central amygdala potentiation but rather an integrative and adaptive response involving specific mechanisms in the right central amygdala.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 79, 'citationCount': 28, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48839790', 'name': 'Yuta Miyazawa'}, {'authorId': '50300406', 'name': 'Yukari Takahashi'}, {'authorId': '40447710', 'name': 'A.

These 2 nuclei are asymmetrically involved in somatic pain modulation; pain-like responses on both sides of the body are preferentially driven by the right CeA, and in a reciprocal fashion, nociceptive somatic stimuli on both sides of the body predominantly alter molecular and physiological activities in the right CeA. Unknown, however, is whether this lateralization also exists in visceral pain processing and furthermore what function the left CeA has in modulating nociceptive information. Using urinary bladder distension (UBD) and excitatory optogenetics, a pronociceptive function of the right CeA was demonstrated in mice. Channelrhodopsin-2–mediated activation of the right CeA increased visceromotor responses (VMRs), while activation of the left CeA had no effect. Similarly, UBD-evoked VMRs increased after unilateral infusion of pituitary adenylate cyclase–activating polypeptide in the right CeA. To determine intrinsic left CeA involvement in bladder pain modulation, this region was optogenetically silenced during noxious UBD. Halorhodopsin (NpHR)-mediated inhibition of the left CeA increased VMRs, suggesting an ongoing antinociceptive function for this region. Finally, divergent left and right CeA functions were evaluated during abdominal mechanosensory testing. In naive animals, channelrhodopsin-2–mediated activation of the right CeA induced mechanical allodynia, and after cyclophosphamide-induced bladder sensitization, activation of the left CeA reversed referred bladder pain–like behaviors.

However, the local circuits of the CeL are not fully understood and have only recently begun to be explored in detail. Here, we characterized the intrinsic circuits in the CeL using paired whole-call patch-clamp recordings, immunohistochemistry, and optogenetics in C57BL/6J wild-type and somatostatin-cre (SOM-Cre) mice. Our results revealed that throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the CeL, neurons form inhibitory connections at a rate of ∼29% with an average amplitude of 20 ± 3 pA (at −40 mV). Inhibitory input from a single neuron is sufficient to halt firing in the postsynaptic neuron. Post hoc immunostaining for protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) in wild-type mice and paired recordings in SOM-Cre mice demonstrated that the most common local connections were PKCδ(−) → PKCδ(−) and SOM(+) → SOM(+). Finally, by optogenetically activating either SOM(+) or SOM(−) neurons, we found that almost all neurons in the CeL were innervated by these neuronal populations and that connections between like neurons were stronger than those between different neuronal types.

Identifying the extent to which depression remains causally associated with ongoing physical discomfort during chronic pain, or becomes independent of it, is an important problem for basic neuroscience and psychiatry. Difficulty in distinguishing between effects of ongoing aversive sensory input and its long-term consequences is a significant roadblock, especially in animal models. To address this relationship between localized physical discomfort and its more global consequences, we investigated cellular and behavioral changes during and after reversing a mouse model of neuropathic pain. Tactile allodynia produced by placing a plastic cuff around the sciatic nerve resolved within several days when the cuff was removed. In contrast, the changes in elevated O-maze, forced-swim, Y-maze spontaneous alternation and novel-object recognition test performance that developed after nerve cuff placement remained for at least 3 weeks after the nerve cuffs were removed, or 10–15 d following complete normalization of mechanical sensitivity. Hippocampal neurogenesis, measured by doublecortin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, was also suppressed after nerve cuff placement and remained suppressed 3 weeks after cuff removal. FosB expression was elevated in the central nucleus of the amygdala and spinal cord dorsal horn only in mice with ongoing allodynia. In contrast, FosB remained elevated in the basolateral amygdala of mice with resolved nociception and persisting behavioral effects.

Some believe that thalamic and cortical neurons transmitting information about the conditioned stimulus (CS) to the lateral amygdala (LA) serve a relay function. Others maintain that thalamic and/or cortical plasticity is critically involved in fear conditioning. To address this question, we developed a large-scale biophysical model of the LA that could reproduce earlier findings regarding the cellular correlates of fear conditioning in LA. We then conducted model experiments that examined whether fear memories depend on (1) training-induced increases in the responsiveness of thalamic and cortical neurons projecting to LA, (2) plasticity at the synapses they form in LA, and/or (3) plasticity at synapses between LA neurons. These tests revealed that training-induced increases in the responsiveness of afferent neurons are required for fear memory formation. However, once the memory has been formed, this factor is no longer required because the efficacy of the synapses that thalamic and cortical neurons form with LA cells has augmented enough to maintain the memory.

Indeed, CeL contains neurons exhibiting positive (CeL-On) or negative (CeL-Off) responses to fear-inducing conditioned stimuli (CSs). In mice, these cells differ in their expression of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) and physiological properties. CeL-Off cells are PKCδ(+) and late firing (LF), whereas CeL-On cells are PKCδ(-) and express a regular-spiking (RS) or low-threshold bursting (LTB) phenotype. However, the scarcity of LF cells in rats raises questions about the correspondence between the organization of CeL in mice and rats. Therefore, we studied the PKCδ expression, morphological properties, synaptic responsiveness, and fear conditioning-induced plasticity of rat CeL neurons. No PKCδ(+) LF cells were encountered, but ≈20-25% of RS and LTB neurons were PKCδ(+). Compared with RS neurons, a higher proportion of LTB cells projected to central medial amygdala (CeM) and they had fewer primary dendritic branches, yet the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by lateral amygdala (LA) stimulation was similar in RS and LTB cells. In contrast, LA-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) had a higher amplitude in LTB than RS neurons. Finally, fear conditioning did not induce plasticity at LA inputs to RS or LTB neurons. These findings point to major species differences in the organization of CeL. Since rat LTB cells are subjected to stronger feedforward inhibition, they are more likely to exhibit inhibitory CS responses than RS cells.

The amygdala is involved in the processing of mood disorders, fear, and the emotional‐affective components of pain. Hemispheric lateralization of pain processing in the amygdala has recently been brought to light because, independently of the side of the peripheral injury, the right central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) showed higher neuronal activity than the left in models of inflammatory pain. Although the CeA has been called the ‘nociceptive amygdala’, because of its high content of nociceptive neurones, little is known about changes in its neuronal function in vivo, under NP conditions. Herein, we quantified CeA spontaneous and evoked activity in rats subjected to spinal nerve ligation (SNL), under isoflurane anaesthesia, following application of mechanical and thermal stimuli to widespread body areas. We found that spontaneous and stimulus‐evoked neuronal activity was higher in the left CeA at 2 and 6\u2003days after SNL induction and declined afterwards, whereas activity in the right CeA became dominant at 14\u2003days after surgery, independently of the side of surgery. We also observed that systemic injection of pregabalin, which is widely used in patients with NP, reduced CeA spontaneous and stimulus‐evoked neuronal activity. Overall, we observed that peripheral nerve injury produced asymmetric plasticity in ongoing and evoked activity in the left and right CeA. Remarkably, at 14\u2003days after SNL induction, enhanced evoked activity in the right CeA persisted compared to short‐term increases in activity in the left CeA.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that changes in CNS processing are key to the development of chronic bladder pain conditions but little is known regarding the underlying cellular, molecular, and neuronal mechanisms. Using a mouse model of distention-induced bladder pain, we found that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a critical site of neuromodulation for processing of bladder nociception. Furthermore, we demonstrate that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) activation in the CeA induces bladder pain sensitization by increasing CeA output. Thus, pharmacological activation of mGluR5 in the CeA is sufficient to increase the response to bladder distention. Additionally, pharmacological blockade or virally mediated conditional deletion of mGluR5 in the CeA reduced responses to bladder distention suggesting that mGluR5 in the CeA is also necessary for these responses. Finally, we used optogenetic activation of the CeA and demonstrated that this caused a robust increase in the visceral pain response. The CeA-localized effects on responses to bladder distention are associated with changes in extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in the spinal cord.

Normal functions of the intact amygdala and prefrontal cortex are required for emotion-based decision-making that relies on the ability to assess risk, attribute value, and identify advantageous strategies. We tested the hypothesis that pain-related cognitive deficits result from amygdala-driven impairment of medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) function. To do this, we used electrophysiological single-unit recordings in vivo, patch clamp in brain slices, and various behavioral assays to show that increased neuronal activity in the amygdala in an animal model of arthritis pain was accompanied by decreased mPFC activation and impaired decision-making. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition (with a corticotropin-releasing factor 1 receptor antagonist) of pain-related hyperactivity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but not central amygdala (CeA), reversed deactivation of mPFC pyramidal cells and improved decision-making deficits. Pain-related cortical deactivation resulted from a shift of balance between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission. Direct excitatory transmission to mPFC pyramidal cells did not change in the pain model, whereas polysynaptic inhibitory transmission increased. GABAergic transmission was reduced by non-NMDA receptor antagonists, suggesting that synaptic inhibition was glutamate driven. The results are consistent with a model of BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of mPFC neurons. In contrast to the differential effects of BLA versus CeA hyperactivity on cortical-cognitive functions, both amygdala nuclei modulate emotional-affective pain behavior. Thus, this study shows that the amygdala contributes not only to emotional-affective but also cognitive effects of pain.

Individual CeLC neurons were recorded extracellularly before and after induction of an arthritis pain state in anesthetized rats. Brief innocuous and noxious test stimuli were applied to peripheral tissues ipsi- and contralateral to the recording site. A monoarthritis was induced in the ipsi- or contralateral knee by intraarticular injections of kaolin and carrageenan.

In the present study, we demonstrate that endogenous molecular changes in the amygdala play a crucial role in modulating long-lasting peripheral hypersensitivity associated with persistent inflammation and we further identify the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a molecular substrate underlying this behavioral sensitization. Using the formalin test as a mouse model of persistent inflammatory pain, we show that activation of ERK in the amygdala is both necessary for and sufficient to induce long-lasting peripheral hypersensitivity to tactile stimulation. Thus, blockade of inflammation-induced ERK activation in the amygdala significantly reduced long-lasting peripheral hypersensitivity associated with persistent inflammation, and pharmacological activation of ERK in the amygdala induced peripheral hypersensitivity in the absence of inflammation. Importantly, blockade of ERK activation in the amygdala did not affect responses to acute noxious stimuli in the absence of inflammation, indicating that modulation of nociceptive responses by amygdala ERK activation is specific to the persistent inflammatory state. Altogether, our results demonstrate a functional role of the ERK signaling cascade in the amygdala in inflammation-induced peripheral hypersensitivity.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 196, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5953396', 'name': 'Y.

After an overview of simulation approaches in financial economics, we first give a summary of the Donangelo–Sneppen model of monetary exchange and compare it with related models in economics literature. Our selective review then outlines the main ingredients of some influential early models of multi-agent dynamics in financial markets (Kim–Markowitz, Levy–Levy–Solomon). As will be seen, these contributions draw their inspiration from the complex appearance of investors' interactions in real-life markets. Their main aim is to reproduce (and, thereby, provide possible explanations) for the spectacular bubbles and crashes seen in certain historical episodes, but they lack (like almost all the work before 1998 or so) a perspective in terms of the universal statistical features of financial time series. In fact, awareness of a set of such regularities (power-law tails of the distribution of returns, temporal scaling of volatility) only gradually appeared over the nineties. With the more precise description of the formerly relatively vague characteristics (e.g. moving from the notion of fat tails to the more concrete one of a power law with index around three), it became clear that financial market dynamics give rise to some kind of universal scaling law. Showing similarities with scaling laws for other systems with many interacting sub-units, an exploration of financial markets as multi-agent systems appeared to be a natural consequence. This topic has been pursued by quite a number of contributions appearing in both the physics and economics literature since the late nineties. From the wealth of different flavours of multi-agent models that have appeared up to now, we discuss the Cont–Bouchaud, Solomon–Levy–Huang and Lux–Marchesi models.

As a related CeA function is the expression of hypoalgesia induced by conditioned stimuli or systemic morphine administration, we examined postsynaptic opioid modulation of neurons in each major CeA subdivision. Following electrophysiological recording, biocytin‐filled neurons were precisely located in CeA regions identified by chemoarchitecture (enkephalin‐immunoreactivity) and cytoarchitecture (DAPI nuclear staining) in fixed adult rat brain slices. This revealed a striking distribution of physiological types, as 92% of neurons in capsular CeA were classified as late‐firing, whereas no neurons in the medial CeA were of this class. In contrast, 60% or more of neurons in the lateral and medial CeA were low‐threshold bursting neurons. Mu‐opioid receptor (MOPR) agonists induced postsynaptic inhibitory potassium currents in 61% of CeA cells, and this ratio was maintained in each subdivision and for each physiological class of neuron. However, MOPR agonists more frequently inhibited bipolar/fusiform cells than triangular or multipolar neurons. A subpopulation of MOPR‐expressing neurons were also inhibited by delta opioid receptor agonists, whereas a separate population were inhibited kappa opioid receptors (KOPR). The MOPR agonist DAMGO inhibited 9/9 CeM neurons with projections to the parabrachial nucleus identified by retrograde tracer injection. These data support models of striatopallidal organization that have identified striatal‐like and pallidal‐like CeA regions. Opioids can directly inhibit output from each subdivision by activating postsynaptic MOPRs or KOPRs on distinct subpopulations of opioid‐sensitive neurons. J. Comp.

It remains to be investigated how the diverse innervation patterns are generated and how these spatially complicated, but synaptically specific wirings are achieved. Here, we asked whether a particular cell type obeys a specific branching and bouton arrangement principle or differs from others only in average morphometric values of the morphological template common to nonpyramidal cells. For this purpose, we subclassified nonpyramidal cells within each physiological class by quantitative parameters of somata, dendrites, and axons and characterized axon branching and bouton distribution patterns quantitatively. Each subtype showed a characteristic set of vertical and horizontal bouton spreads around the somata. Each parameter, such as branching angles, internode or interbouton intervals, followed its own characteristic distribution pattern irrespective of subtypes, suggesting that nonpyramidal cells have the common mechanism for formation of the axon branching pattern and bouton arrangement. Fitting of internode and interbouton interval distributions to the exponential indicated their apparent random occurrence. Decay constants of the fitted exponentials varied among nonpyramidal cells, but each subtype expressed a particular set of interbouton and internode interval averages. The distinctive combination of innervation field shape and local axon phenotypes suggests a marked functional difference in the laminar and columnar integration properties of different GABAergic subtypes, as well as the subtype-specific density of inhibited targets.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 56, 'citationCount': 193, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3580433', 'name': 'F.

Observations were compared with details of neuron morphology available from Golgi‐stained tissue to determine whether peptide immunoreactivity was associated with specific cell types in the central nucleus. The lateral subdivision (CL) of the central nucleus contained mainly medium‐sized, densely spiny neurons. Larger, pyramiform spiny neurons; medium‐sized, sparsely spinous neurons; and small, aspinous cells were also present in CL.

No obvious morphological differences were evident among medium spiny neurons containing different peptides. In the medial subdivision, substance P, neurotensin, somatostatin, and CRF were present within pyramiform, sparsely spinous neurons with long dendrites. Galanin immunoreactivity in the medial subdivision was associated with moderately spiny, pyramiform neurons and a larger, aspinous, polygonal neuron.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the rat CN using Nissl, Klüver‐Barrera, and Golgi techniques suggests that it consists of four subdivisions. The medial subdivision (CM), which is closely associated with the stria terminalis, is narrow caudally but enlarges near the rostral pole of CN. Most neurons in CM have long dendrites that branch sparingly and have a moderate number of dendritic spines. A smaller number of CM neurons have thick dendrites with virtually no spines. Lateral to CM is the lateral subdivision (CL) which appears round in coronal sections. Neurons of CL have a very dense covering of dendritic spines and resemble medium‐size spiny neurons of the striatum. Area X of Hall contains spiny neurons similar to those of CL and spine‐sparse neurons that resemble medium‐size spine‐sparse cells of the striatum. Since area X encapsulates the lateral aspect of CL, it is termed the lateral capsular subdivision (CLC) of CN. The lateral capsular subdivision enlarges rostrally and is divided into dorsal and ventral portions by a laminar extension of the putamen. Near the rostral pole of CN a small region of tightly packed, intensely stained neurons is interposed between CL and CM. Golgi preparations reveal that this intermediate subdivision (CI) of CN contains neurons similar to those of CM. The lateral subdivision, CLC, and CM correspond, in part, to subdivisions recognized in previous Nissl studies. The intermediate subdivision has not been recognized as a distinct subdivision in previous investigations. This is the first Golgi study to recognize differences in neuronal morphology in particular subdivisions of the rat CN. The correlation of Nissl and Golgi preparations has permitted a more accurate determination of the boundaries and total extent of each subdivision than the use of Nissl techniques alone.', 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 79, 'citationCount': 328, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49501031', 'name': 'A.

The Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) protocol for describing Individual-and Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is now widely accepted and used to document such models in journal articles. As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design ratio-nale, the model’s underlying narrative, and the means by which the model’s fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model.

A big challenge in Emotion modeling is to establish the complex personal system of an intelligent agent or machine in a quasi‐physical and quasi‐sociological way, so that it rationally responds to emotions and behaviors by different internal and external stimuli with concurrency. For this purpose, an emotion classification model is presented for the audio‐visual external stimuli based on an improved long short‐term memory network. Then, based on Gross's emotional regulation theory, a hidden Markov model is constructed to imitate the process framework of human emotional cognition and personalized emotional regulation and expression, so as to realize the machine's intuitive and reasonable response to stimuli with concurrency. In this article, a framework of machine personalized artificial emotion simulation is preliminarily constructed, which provides a new model for human–computer interaction, in order to provide a

Multicloud is a high-performance secure computing platform, which combines multiple cloud providers for data processing, and the distributed multicloud platform ensures the security of data to some extent. Based on multicloud and task scheduling in IoT, this article constructs a many-objective distributed scheduling model, which includes six objectives of total time, cost, cloud throughput, energy consumption, resource utilization, and balancing load. Furthermore, this article presents a many-objective intelligent algorithm with sine function to implement the model, which considers the variation tendency of diversity strategy in the population is similar to the sine function.

However, the traditional recommendation algorithms cannot meet user's fast and accurate recommended requirements in the IoT environment. In the face of a large-volume data, the method of finding neighborhood by comparing whole user information will result in a low recommendation efficiency. In addition, the traditional recommendation system ignores the inherent connection between user's preference and time. In reality, the interest of the user varies over time. Recommendation system should provide users accurate and fast with the change of time. To address this, we propose a novel recommendation model based on time correlation coefficient and an improved K-means with cuckoo search (CSK-means), called TCCF. The clustering method can cluster similar users together for further quick and accurate recommendation. Moreover, an effective and personalized recommendation model based on preference pattern (PTCCF) is designed to improve the quality of TCCF. It can provide a higher quality recommendation by analyzing the user's behaviors. The extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets of MovieLens and Douban, and the precision of our model have improved about 5.2 percent compared with the MCoC model.

To tackle this problem, a hybrid multi‐objective cuckoo search under‐sampled software defect prediction model based on SVM (HMOCS‐US‐SVM) is proposed to solve synchronously above two problems. Firstly, a hybrid multi‐objective cuckoo search with dynamical local search (HMOCS) is utilized to select synchronously the non‐defective sampling and optimize the parameters of SVM. Then, three under‐sampled methods for decision region range are proposed to select the non‐defective modules. In the simulation, the three indicators, including the false positive rate (pf), the probability of detection (pd), and G‐mean, are employed to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm.

As the amount of MVs is explosively increasing, it has become an important task to develop new techniques for effective MV analysis, retrieval, and management. By stimulating the human affective response mechanism, affective video content analysis extracts the affective information contained in videos, and, with the affective information, natural, user-friendly, and effective MV access strategies could be developed. In this paper, a novel integrated system (i.MV) is proposed for personalized MV affective analysis, visualization, and retrieval. In i.MV, we not only perform the personalized MV affective analysis, which is a challenging and insufficiently covered problem in current affective content analysis field, but also propose novel affective visualization to convert the abstract affective states intuitive and friendly to users. Based on the affective analysis and visualization, affective information based MV retrieval is achieved. Both comprehensive experiments and subjective user studies on a large MV dataset demonstrate that our personalized affective analysis is more effective than the previous algorithms. In addition, affective visualization is proved to be more suitable for affective information-based MV retrieval than the commonly used affective state representation strategies.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 106, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1776581', 'name': 'Shiliang Zhang'}, {'authorId': '1689702', 'name': 'Qingming Huang'}, {'authorId': '1696610', 'name': 'Shuqiang Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2153576035', 'name': 'Wen Gao'}, {'authorId': '144876831', 'name': 'Q.

For some film genres (Horror, Action, etc), the segments with high emotion intensity have the most possibilities to be video highlights. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical structure for emotion categories and analyze emotion intensity and emotion type by using arousal and valence related features hierarchically. Firstly, High, Medium and Low are detected as emotion intensity levels by using fuzzy c-mean clustering on arousal features. Fuzzy clustering provides a mathematical model to represent vagueness, which is close to human perception. After that, valence related features are used to detect emotion types (Anger, Sad, Fear, Happy and Neutral). Considering video is continuous time series data and the occurrence of a certain emotion is affected by recent emotional history, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to capture the context information. Experimental results shows the movie segments with high emotion intensity cover over 80% of the movie highlights in Horror and Action movies and the hierarchical method outperforms the one-step method on emotion type detection.

For such workflows, it is important to maximize the overall throughput to provide good quality of service. However, most of the existing scheduling algorithms are designed for scheduling of a single complex scientific workflow instance and are not efficient enough for scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows. To address this problem, we propose a throughput maximization strategy (TMS), which contains two specific algorithms for scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows at the instance and task levels, respectively. The first algorithm called Opposite Average Load tries to maximize the overall throughput by pursuing the overall load balance at the instance level, whereas the second algorithm called Extended Min–Min tries to further maximize the overall throughput at the task level by increasing the utilization rate of resources within each local autonomous group. The comparison and simulation performed on Swinburne Decentralized Workflow for Grid (SwinDeW‐G), a peer‐to‐peer‐based grid workflow environment, demonstrate that our strategy can improve the overall throughput significantly over existing scheduling algorithms when scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows.

15,2efc155454c0904e695e553fd6c033a4d08d126b,Development and validation of the Interpersonal Emotion Regulation for Couples Scale (SIERC) in the Spanish population,"
 Antecedents
 Interpersonal emotional regulation (IER) is the deliberate attempt to influence others’ emotions. There is not enough research on IER in the context of romantic couples.
 
 
 Aim
 The aim of the present study was to develop and validate an instrument to assess couples’ IER and understanding its functioning at both an individual and dyadic level.
 
 
 Method
 Participants were 764 adults and 91 dyads. Three studies were carried out: first, to study the psychometric properties of the scale and its validity; second, to understand the functioning of the scale at a dyadic level; third, to analyse the predictive capacity of the instrument.
 
 
 Results
 Our 11-item scale has four factors: observe, ask, validate, and soothe feelings. These factors are doubly evaluated: as an agent (SIERC-A) and as a target (SIERC-B). The scale showed good psychometric properties and adequate internal consistency. It presents convergent validity with emotional competences, and divergent validity with emotional dysregulation and insecure attachment. At a dyadic level, there is an actor-partner effect of IER on couple adjustment. Finally, IER seems to predict relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and life satisfaction.

dimensions of emotion regulation and, more specifically, to the features of attempted support transactions that shape the outcomes of enacted support. We conducted 2 autobiographical recall studies to investigate receivers' evaluations of intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation interactions, to ascertain the number of dimensions required to capture variation in those evaluations, and then to examine associations of those dimensions with perceived benefits of the interactions. To do so, we developed a new questionnaire, the Interpersonal Regulation Interaction Scale (IRIS). In Study 1 (n = 390), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the IRIS yielded 4 dimensions, which we labeled responsiveness, hostility, cognitive support, and physical presence. Each dimension was uniquely associated with perceived benefits of receiving interpersonal emotion regulation. In Study 2, we collected multiple, diverse samples (ns = 199-895) and found support for the replicability and generalizability of key findings from Study 1, including the factor structure and associations with perceived benefits. In summary, across 2 studies and multiple, diverse samples, we identified 4 conceptually and practically important dimensions of receivers' evaluations of interpersonal emotion regulation interactions and developed a brief measure that taps interaction variability in these dimensions.

As a result, prior research has failed to systematically investigate whether individuals’ emotional and behavioral responses to perceived rejection differ as a function of the role of the potential rejector. In the present study, a total of 481 participants read two scenarios describing hypothetical situations in which rejection by a specific individual (i.e., significant other, friend, or acquaintance) was ambiguous. After each scenario, participants rated the extent to which they would be likely to anticipate (a) experiencing various negative emotions (e.g., upset) and (b) engaging in various behavioral responses (i.e., act friendly, retaliate, complain, avoid) to the potential rejector. Overall, the potential of being rejected by another person with whom one has a close and valued relationship (i.e., a significant other and, to a lesser degree, a friend) was associated with heightened negative emotion and a heightened likelihood of engaging in an active response, either prosocial (i.e., act friendly) or antisocial (i.e., retaliate or complain). In contrast, potential rejection by an acquaintance was associated with relatively little negative emotion and relatively little desire to engage the other (i.e., avoid). In sum, the participants’ relationship with specific individuals was found to influence both the intensity of their anticipated negative emotional response to ambiguous rejection and the pattern of their anticipated behavioral response to the potential rejectors.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40110284', 'name': 'Tucker L.

The underlying processes of this link and the couple interplay between attachment and well‐being are notably less explored. Using a dyadic framework, this study examines both couple members' emotion regulation strategies as potential mediators of this link.

Analyses were performed using the actor–partner interdependence mediation model that distinguishes between intrapersonal and interpersonal influences. Results Results showed that controlling for relationship length, there was an intrapersonal indirect effect of attachment avoidance on psychological well‐being through emotion suppression. Moreover, interpersonal indirect effects were found (a) with individual attachment avoidance being associated with partner's psychological well‐being through own emotion expression and (b) individual's attachment anxiety being associated with partner's psychological well‐being through both own's emotion expression and partner's emotion suppression.

Although this research has traditionally focused on men who strongly adhere to traditional gender norms, men who negatively evaluate themselves as falling short of these norms (a construct termed masculine discrepancy stress) have proven to be at increased risk of IPV perpetration. Likewise, men experiencing problems with emotion regulation, a multidimensional construct reflecting difficulties in effectively experiencing and responding to emotional states, are also at risk of IPV perpetration. In the present research, we tested the hypothesis that the link between discrepancy stress and IPV perpetration is mediated via difficulties in emotion regulation. Three hundred fifty-seven men completed online surveys assessing their experience of discrepancy stress, emotion-regulation difficulties, and history of IPV perpetration. Results indicated that discrepancy-stressed men’s use of physical IPV was fully mediated by emotion-regulation difficulties.

In the recent years there are strong movement for shifting from ability and aptitude testing to competence testing. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to process emotion-laden information competently, and to use it to guide cognitive activities like problem solving and to focus energy on required behaviors. According to Mayer and Salovey model EI involves four main abilities: a) to perceive accurately, appraise, and express emotion, b) to access and/or generate feelings when they facilitate thought, and c) to understand emotions and emotional knowledge ; and d) the ability to regulate emotions to promote emotional and intellectual growth (Mayer & Salovey, 1997, p. 5). Using that model of emotional intelligence self-reported instrument ESCQ (Taksic, 2001) consists of three subscales with appropriate psychometric properties was constructed. The subscales are measure of co-called trait emotional intelligence and are labeled ability to: a) perceived and understands emotions (PU), b) express and label emotions (EL), and c) manage and regulate emotions (MR). The results of series of studies demonstrated that ESCQ could be mentioned as an indicator of emotional competence in various situations: a) the highest correlation was obtained between trait emotional intelligence of supervisors and followers rating of their quality of supervising (leadership ; r=0.61), b) correlation between ESCQ and self perceived (un)competence was r=-0.33, and the highest was with MR subscale (r=-0.41), c) significant correlation was between the ESCQ and a school achievement.

SIMPSON AND W STEVEN RHOLES, EDS.: Attachment Theory and Close Relationships. The Guilford Press, New York, 1998, 438 pp., $50.00, ISBN 1-57230-102-3. Attachment theory, as first espoused by John Bowlby, became a pervasive theoretical influence on clinicans and researchers working with children, parents, and families. The work of Mary Ainsworth introducing the methodology of the Strange Situation made it possible to observe parent-child dyads and assess the type of relationship. The categories of secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-anxious attachment, later extended to include disorganized attachment, were ways of describing different attachment patterns. According to Bowlby, attachment paradigms are encoded in internal working models, the theorized basis for developing attachment systems. Both Bowlby and Ainsworth assumed internal working models formed in early childhood persisted throughout life and continued to be vital into maturity, and beyond maturity into old age. The concept of internal working models was used to account for continuity in relationships and transmission of trauma between generations. Can the attachment model be extended meaningfully to adult relationships and development throughout a lifetime? The purpose of this intriguing and informative synthetic volume edited by Jeffrey Simpson and Steven Rholes is to orient us to important theoretical and empirical advances that have taken place in the area of adult attachment during the last decade. They distinguish two components within attachment theory. The first component is normative and attempts to explain stages of development through which nearly all human beings pass. A second component is focused on individual differences and attempts to explain stable deviations from modal behavioral patterns. Simpson and Rholes note the study of individual differences has dominated research for adults as well as children. The authors distinguish two traditions emanating from the study of individual differences. The first tradition, the nuclear family tradition, is exemplified by the work of Mary Main and her colleagues. They developed the Adult Attachment Interview to predict the Strange Situation behavior of respondents' children. The peer/romantic partner tradition, on the other hand, focuses on contemporary views and perceptions of current life partners. These studies utilize self-report questionnaires, accessing a more conscious domain of feelings. In this book, Simpson and Rholes focus almost exclusively on research and clinical work utilizing self-report measures. They recognize that the two traditions of research diverge not only in methodology, but also in generalizability of results. …"", 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 159, 'authors': [{'authorId': '32043538', 'name': 'S.

However, due to its sufficient reliability, a great deal of unique variance remains.

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR.

17,12b4d66926317199bdefa781333edbbe5e91ab6c,On the rationality of emotion regulation,"ABSTRACT Much of the recent work in psychology (and affective science) has shown that humans regulate their emotions nearly constantly, sometimes well and sometimes poorly. I argue that properly regulating one’s emotions displays emotional rationality, and failing to do so displays emotional irrationality. If an agent feels an emotion that is obviously problematic for the agent to feel and she is aware that it is problematic, then the agent ought to regulate her emotions in future similar situations. To capture this aspect of emotional rationality, I introduce the concept of imprudence, which is meant to capture a familiar way that we assess each other’s emotions, despite the fact that it has yet to be a factor in the literature on emotions in philosophy, psychology, or affective science.",2021,43,1,"{'name': 'Philosophical Psychology', 'pages': '453 - 473', 'volume': '34'}","{'model':

To address such variation, we focused on cognitive reappraisal and considered the effects of goals (i.e., what people are trying to achieve) and tactics (i.e., what people actually do) on outcomes (i.e., how affective responses change). To examine goals, we randomly assigned participants to either increase positive emotion or decrease negative emotion to a negative stimulus. To examine tactics, we categorized participants' reports of how they reappraised. To examine reappraisal outcomes, we measured experience and electrodermal responding. Findings indicated that (a) the goal of increasing positive emotion led to greater increases in positive affect and smaller decreases in skin conductance than the goal of decreasing negative emotion, and (b) use of the reality challenge tactic was associated with smaller increases in positive affect during reappraisal. These findings suggest that reappraisal can be implemented in the service of different emotion goals, using different tactics. Such differences are associated with different outcomes, and they should be considered in future research and applied attempts to maximize reappraisal success. Researchers have identified many types of emotion regulation strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression; Gross & Thompson, 2007). Contrasting these strategies has led to important insights about differences among emotion regulatory but has deemphasized the variability that exists within any given strategy, such as those occasioned by differing goals (i.e., what people are trying to achieve) or tactics (i.e., what people actually do). One promising target for examining within-strategy variation is cognitive reappraisal, which refers to altering emotions by changing the way one thinks. Successful reappraisal influences many aspects of emotional responding, including self-reported negative has been notable variation in reappraisal success across studies. For example, reappraisal may be impaired in those with depression Zaldivar, 2009). Variability in these findings may be due to the relative freedom that participants are given to enact reappraisal. Two potentially important sources of variation are (a) the emotion goals pursued during reappraisal and (b) the specific tactics used to reappraise. Studies of unrestricted reappraisal indicate that there may be two different emotion goals that lead to successfully regulated negative emotion (McRae et al. One route may involve the up-regulation of positive emotion (implicated neurally by activation in the ventral striatum), and the other may involve the down regulation of negative emotion (implicated by decreased activation in the amygdala and …"", 'year': None, 'referenceCount': 23, 'citationCount': 306, 'authors': [{'authorId': '38264874', 'name': 'Kateri McRae'}, {'authorId': '4222958', 'name': 'Bethany G.

Disgust has recently been riding a swell of scholarly attention, especially from those in the cognitive sciences and those in the humanities in the midst of the ""affective turn."" Kelly proposes a cognitive model that can accommodate what we now know about disgust. He offers a new account of the evolution of disgust that builds on the model and argues that expressions of disgust are part of a sophisticated but largely automatic signaling system that humans use to transmit information about what to avoid in the local environment. He shows that many of the puzzling features of moral repugnance tinged with disgust are by-products of the imperfect fit between a cognitive system that evolved to protect against poisons and parasites and the social and moral issues on which it has been brought to bear.

On all trials, gaze was directed to a circumscribed area of the pictures. Even with gaze held constant across conditions, increase reappraisals led to higher ratings of emotional intensity, greater corrugator activity, and greater autonomic arousal. In addition, decrease reappraisals led to lower ratings of emotional intensity and lower corrugator activity, the latter of which held only when gaze was directed to arousing information.

As I imagine the tyrant, his relation to his obsession is like a psychotic\'s relation to his delusion: he is able, and prepared, to organize everything else around it, but at the expense of a loss of his grip on reality, on the world.

According to one proponent of this view, when we reason about probability we fall victim to “inevitable illusions” (Piattelli-Palmarini 1994). Other proponents maintain that the human mind is prone to “systematic deviations from rationality” (Bazerman & Neale 1986) and is “not built to work by the rules of probability” (Gould 1992). It has even been suggested that human beings are “a species that is uniformly probability-blind” (Piattelli-Palmarini 1994). This provocative and pessimistic interpretation of the experimental findings has been challenged from many different directions over the years. One of the most recent and energetic of these challenges has come from the newly emerging field of evolutionary psychology, where it has been argued that it’s singularly implausible to claim that our species would have evolved with no “instinct for probability” and, hence, be “blind to chance” (Pinker 1997, 351).

What is meant by such talk? In one sense, explicated in this paper, to call an emotion appropriate is to say that the emotion is fitting: it accurately presents its object as having certain evaluative features. For instance, envy might be thought appropriate when one's rival has something good which one lacks. But someone might grant that a circumstance has these features, yet deny that envy is appropriate, on the grounds that it is wrong to be envious. These two senses of 'appropriate' have much less in common than philosophers have supposed. Indeed, the distinction between propriety and correctness is crucial to understanding the distinctive role of the emotions in ethics. We argue here that an emotion can be fitting despite being wrong to feel, and that various philosophical arguments are guilty of a systematic error which we term the moralistic fallacy."", 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 19, 'citationCount': 471, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1410845292', 'name': ""Justin D'arms""}, {'authorId': '143601261', 'name': 'Daniel Jacobson'}]}, {'paperId': 'abaf98484421cc93aec66aaf8dfad23d7e2312e8', 'title': 'The Rationality of Emotion', 'abstract': 'A cylindrically shaped coil of resistance wire constitutes a source of infrared radiation which is located within a reflector comprised of a curved reflector section having a reflecting surface shaped to resemble an axially bisected rotationally symmetrical paraboloid, and a cylindrical reflector section which extends from an open side of the curved reflector section.

The contemplated effects of the actions are represented as a transition operator that hopefully transforms the present state into a more desirable future state. As a case study, the model is applied to the self-regulation of glycemia in type-2 diabetes. An outline for the extension of the model to multi-agent, multidimensional self-regulation is also suggested.",2013,34,0,"{'name': 'Cybernetics and Systems', 'pages': '627 - 640', 'volume':

The Report sets out to answer the following broad questions: What is systems thinking and how can researchers and policy-makers apply it? How can we use this perspective to better understand and exploit the synergies among interventions to strengthen health systems? How can systems thinking contribute to better evaluations of these system-level interventions? This Report argues that a stronger systems perspective among designers implementers stewards and funders is a critical component in strengthening overall health-sector development in low- and middle-income countries.

Although rich on competency, these agents are entirely oblivious to their users' situational and emotional context today and incapable of adjusting their interaction style and tone contextually. To this end, we present a mixed-method study that informs the design of a situation- and emotion-aware conversational agent for kinetic earables. We surveyed 280 users, and qualitatively interviewed 12 users to understand their expectation from a conversational agent in adapting the interaction style. Grounded on our findings, we develop a first-of-its-kind emotion regulator for a conversational agent on kinetic earable that dynamically adjusts its conversation style, tone, volume in response to users emotional, environmental, social and activity context gathered through speech prosody, motion signals and ambient sound. We describe these context models, the end-to-end system including a purpose-built kinetic earable and their real-world assessment. The experimental results demonstrate that our regulation mechanism invariably elicits better and affective user experience in comparison to baseline conditions in different real-world settings.",2019,29,16,"{'name': '2019 8th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)', 'pages': '725-731'}",,"[{'authorId': '51897025', 'name': 'Shin Katayama'}, {'authorId': '2005305', 'name': 'Akhil Mathur'}, {'authorId': '2914691', 'name': 'M.

However, a filter bank that is designed from perceptual evidence is not always guaranteed to be the best in a statistical modelling framework where the end goal is for example emotion classification. This has fuelled the emerging trend of learning representations from raw speech especially using deep learning neural networks. In particular, a combination of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have gained great traction for the intrinsic property of LSTM in learning contextual information crucial for emotion recognition; and CNNs been used for its ability to overcome the scalability problem of regular neural networks. In this paper, we show that there are still opportunities to improve the performance of emotion recognition from the raw speech by exploiting the properties of CNN in modelling contextual information. We propose the use of parallel convolutional layers to harness multiple temporal resolutions in the feature extraction block that is jointly trained with the LSTM based classification network for the emotion recognition task.

However, there are some problems existing in traditional methods: 1) They treat HAR as a single label classification task, and ignore the information from other related tasks, which is helpful for the original task. 2) They need to predesign features artificially, which are heuristic and not tightly related to HAR task. To address these problems, we propose AROMA (human activity recognition using deep multi-task learning). Human activities can be divided into simple and complex activities. They are closely linked. Simple and complex activity recognitions are two related tasks in AROMA. For simple activity recognition task, AROMA utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract deep features, which are task dependent and non-handcrafted. For complex activity recognition task, AROMA applies a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn the temporal context of activity data. In addition, there is a shared structure between the two tasks, and the object functions of these two tasks are optimized jointly. We evaluate AROMA on two public datasets, and the experimental results show that AROMA is able to yield a competitive performance in both simple and complex activity recognitions. 1', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 84, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3455336', 'name': 'Liangying Peng'}, {'authorId': '1409961430', 'name': 'Ling Chen'}, {'authorId': '51062697', 'name': 'Zhenan Ye'}, {'authorId': '2153910663', 'name': 'Yi Zhang'}]}, {'paperId': 'fb758b82d64c41e0204bcf48a87df58b6c0d00a7', 'title': 'Earables for Personal-Scale Behavior Analytics', 'abstract': 'The rise of consumer wearables promises to have a profound impact on peoples lives by going beyond counting steps.

Most previous studies have explored the roles of SARs as instructors, learning aides, and social-skills trainers, focusing on the learning, language, and social impairments associated with ASD. This article addresses aspects of empathy and emotion regulation (ER) impairments, which are important underlying factors for many atypicalities manifested in ASD. We discuss the design of our robot's emotional capabilities, its emotion-based action library, and the algorithm it uses to regulate a user?s emotions.

The setup consists of a number of sensory stations, together with robotic agents that navigate the stations and interact with the stimuli as they are presented. These stimuli are designed to resemble real world scenarios that form a common part of one's everyday experiences. Given the strong interest of children with ASD in technology in general and robots in particular, we attempt to utilize our robotic platform to demonstrate socially acceptable responses to the stimuli in an interactive, pedagogical setting that encourages the child's social, motor and vocal skills, while providing a diverse sensory experience.

Children with autism have impaired social communication and social interaction skills which make it difficult for them to participate in many different forms of social and collaborative play. Our proof-of-concept 10-week, long term study demonstrates how a humanoid robot can be used to foster and support collaborative play among children with autism. In this work, KASPAR operates fully autonomously, and uses information on the state of the game and behavior of the children to engage, motivate, encourage, and advise pairs of children playing an imitation game. Results are presented from a first evaluation study which examined whether having pairs of children with autism play an imitative, collaborative game with a humanoid robot affected the way these children would play the same game without the robot. Our initial evaluation involved six children with autism who each participated in 23 controlled play sessions both with and without the robot, using a specially designed imitation-based collaborative game. In total 78 play sessions were run. Detailed observational analyses of the children's behaviors indicated that different pairs of children with autism showed improved social behaviors in playing with each other after they played as pairs with the robot KASPAR compared to before they did so.

Individuals with either condition can appear uncaring towards others. This study set out to compare and contrast directly boys with psychopathic tendencies and boys with ASD on tasks assessing aspects of affective empathy and cognitive perspective taking. The main aim of the study was to assess whether a distinct profile of empathy deficits would emerge for boys with psychopathic tendencies and ASD, and whether empathy deficits would be associated with conduct problems in general, rather than psychopathic tendencies or ASD specifically. Methods Four groups of boys aged between 9 and 16 years (N = 96) were compared: 1) psychopathic tendencies, 2) ASD, 3) conduct problems and 4) comparison. Tasks were included to probe attribution of emotions to self, empathy for victims of aggression and cognitive perspective-taking ability. Results Boys with psychopathic tendencies had a profile consistent with dysfunctional affective empathy. They reported experiencing less fear and less empathy for victims of aggression than comparison boys. Their cognitive perspective-taking abilities were not statistically significantly different from those of comparison boys. In contrast, boys with ASD had difficulties with tasks requiring cognitive perspective taking, but reported emotional experiences and victim empathy that were in line with comparison boys. Boys with conduct problems did not differ from comparison boys, suggesting that the affective empathy deficit seen in boys with psychopathic tendencies was specific to that group, rather than common to all boys with conduct problems. Conclusions Although both groups can appear uncaring, our findings suggest that the affective/information processing correlates of psychopathic tendencies and ASD are quite different. Psychopathic tendencies are associated with difficulties in resonating with other people’s distress, whereas ASD is characterised by difficulties in knowing what other people think.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 512, 'authors': [{'authorId': '152339451', 'name': 'A.

The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the current knowledge in developmental and affective neuroscience with an emphasis on the perception of pain in others. It will be argued that human empathy involves several components: affective arousal, emotion understanding and emotion regulation, each with different developmental trajectories. These components are implemented by a complex network of distributed, often recursively connected, interacting neural regions including the superior temporal sulcus, insula, medial and orbitofrontal cortices, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as autonomic and neuroendocrine processes implicated in social behaviors and emotional states.

21,7cc71e4c0bb39c2d3ff3cd039c5e62f726f6d493,"MARSSI: Model of Appraisal, Regulation, and Social Signal Interpretation","Understanding emotions of others requires a theory of mind approach providing knowledge of internal appraisal and regulation processes of emotions. Multi-modal social signal classification is insufficient for understanding emotional expressions. Mainly, because many communicative, emotional expressions are not directly related to internal emotional states. Moreover, the recognition of the expression's direction is neglected so far. Even if social signals reveal emotional aspects, the recognition with signal classifiers cannot explain internal appraisal or regulation processes. Using that information is one approach for building cognitive empathic agents with the ability to address observations and motives in an empathic dialogue. In this paper, we introduce a computational model of user emotions for empathic agents. It combines a simulation of appraisal and regulation processes with a social signal interpretation taking directions of expressions into account. Our evaluation shows that social signal sequences can be related to emotion regulation processes. Their recognition and using appraisal and regulation knowledge enables our agent to react empathically.",2018,81,20,{'pages': '497-506'},,"[{'authorId': '48785659', 'name': 'Patrick Gebhard'}, {'authorId': '2375527', 'name': 'T.

A typical work-flow includes the manual annotation (also called coding) of social signals in multi-modal corpora of considerable size. For the involved annotators this defines an exhausting and time-consuming task. In the article at hand we present a novel method and also provide the tools to speed up the coding procedure. To this end, we suggest and evaluate the use of Cooperative Machine Learning (CML) techniques to reduce manual labelling efforts by combining the power of computational capabilities and human intelligence. The proposed CML strategy starts with a small number of labelled instances and concentrates on predicting local parts first. Afterwards, a session-independent classification model is created to finish the remaining parts of the database. Confidence values are computed to guide the manual inspection and correction of the predictions. To bring the proposed approach into application we introduce NOVA - an open-source tool for collaborative and machine-aided annotations. In particular, it gives labellers immediate access to CML strategies and directly provides visual feedback on the results. Our experiments show that the proposed method has the potential to significantly reduce human labelling efforts.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 90, 'citationCount': 15, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6164138', 'name': 'J.

We present evidence for the idea that people mimic contextualized emotions rather than simply expressive muscle movements.

Er geht von der Annahme aus, dass die Emotionsentstehung einer umfassenden sozialen Prägung unterliegt und mit charakteristischen Handlungstendenzen einhergeht. Darauf aufbauend wird das Argument entwickelt, dass vor allem mimisches emotionales Ausdrucksverhalten dazu beiträgt, strukturwirksame Handlungs- bzw. Interaktionsmuster zu generieren. In einem ersten Schritt wird gezeigt, dass die Enkodierung emotionalen Ausdrucksverhaltens einerseits auf physiologischen Grundmustern beruht, andererseits aber in Abhängigkeit der sozialen Umwelt ausgeprägte „Dialekte“ entwickelt. Analog zu diesen Nuancen, so verdeutlicht der zweite Schritt, entsteht die Fähigkeit, mimisches Ausdrucksverhalten zu dekodieren. Dadurch verlaufen reziproke Attributionen von Emotion, Situationsbewertung und Handlungstendenz umso effektiver, je näher sich Akteure im sozialen Raum sind. Diese Verschränkung führt, so zeigt der dritte Schritt, zu einer präziseren interindividuellen Übertragung von Emotionen innerhalb sozialer Einheiten, die eine entsprechende interindividuelle Angleichung von Emotionen und Handlungstendenzen wahrscheinlicher macht. Auf diese Weise tragen Emotionen zur Genese strukturierter Interaktionen und zur Entstehung sozialer Ordnung bei. Summary This contribution investigates functions of emotion in social interaction and their role in the emergence and reproduction of social structures and social order. It assumes that the elicitation of emotion is fundamentally dependent on the social environment and that emotions go hand in hand with characteristic action tendencies. On this basis, it is argued that the facial expression of emotion is particularly implicated in generating patterns of social action and interaction. First, it is shown that the encoding of facial expression combines hard-wired physiological principles on the one hand and socially learned aspects on the other, leading to more fine-grained and socially differentiated “dialects” of emotional expression. Second, it is argued that the decoding of facial expression is contingent upon this combination, so that reciprocal attributions of emotional states, situational interpretations, and action tendencies are more effective within rather than across social units. Third, this conjunction affects the conditions for emotional contagion, which is shown to be more effective within social units exhibiting similar encoding and decoding characteristics and thus aligns emotions and action tendencies in a coherent, yet socially differentiated fashion. Taken together, these interactional processes show that emotions facilitate the structuring of social interaction and the emergence of social order.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 105, 'citationCount': 15, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7401740', 'name': 'C.

This paper focuses on the development of a computing algorithm that uses both audio and visual sensors to detect and track a user's affective state to aid computer decision making. Using our multistream fused hidden Markov model (MFHMM), we analyzed coupled audio and visual streams to detect four cognitive states (interest, boredom, frustration and puzzlement) and seven prototypical emotions (neural, happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear and surprise). The MFHMM allows the building of an optimal connection among multiple streams according to the maximum entropy principle and the maximum mutual information criterion.

This is crucial in a modeling task in which the available evidence usually varies with the user and with each particular interaction.

The evidence from 5 studies supported these two claims. The nonverbal behavior of embarrassment was distinct from a related emotion (amusement), resembled the temporal pattern of facial expressions of emotion, was uniquely related to self-reports of embarrassment, and was accurately identified by observers who judged the spontaneous displays of various emotions. Across the judgment studies, observers were more accurate and attributed more emotion to the embarrassment displays of female and AfricanAmerican targets than those of male and Caucasian targets. Discussion focused on the universality and appeasement function of the embarrassment display. Since universal facial expressions of a limited set of emotions were first documented (Ekman & Friesen, 1971; Ekman, Sorenson, & Friesen, 1969; Izard, 1971), sparse attention has been given to facial expressions of other emotions.

The ability to infer others' beliefs, desires, and intentions from their facial expressions should be especially important in interdependent decision making when people make decisions from beliefs about the others' intention to cooperate. Five experiments tested the general proposition that people follow principles of appraisal when making inferences from emotion displays, in context. Experiment 1 revealed that the same emotion display produced opposite effects depending on context: When the other was competitive, a smile on the other's face evoked a more negative response than when the other was cooperative. Experiment 2 revealed that the essential information from emotion displays was derived from appraisals (e.g., Is the current state of affairs conducive to my goals? Who is to blame for it?); facial displays of emotion had the same impact on people's decision making as textual expressions of the corresponding appraisals. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 used multiple mediation analyses and a causal-chain design: Results supported the proposition that beliefs about others' appraisals mediate the effects of emotion displays on expectations about others' intentions.

Although these models are successful in emotion classification, a number of practical and theoretical drawbacks limit the range of possible applications. In this paper, the authors suggest the adoption of an appraisal perspective in modeling emotion recognition. The authors propose to use appraisals as an intermediate layer between expressive features input and emotion labeling output. The model would then be made of two parts: first, expressive features would be used to estimate appraisals; second, resulting appraisals would be used to predict an emotion label. While the second part of the model has already been the object of several studies, the first is unexplored. The authors argue that this model should be built on the basis of both theoretical predictions and empirical results about the link between specific appraisals and expressive features.

Nico Frijda discusses the motivational and neurophysiological preconditions for emotions, and the ways in which emotions are regulated by the individual. Considering the kinds of events that elicit emotions, he argues that emotions arise because events are appraised by people as favorable or harmful to their own interests. he takes an information-processing perspective: Emotions are viewed as outcomes of the process of assessing the world in terms of one's own concerns, which, in turn, modify action readiness. This analysis leads him to address such fundamental issues as the place of emotion in motivation generally and the discrepancy between the functions of the emotions and their often irrational and disruptive character.

This has led to a truly interdisciplinary, mutually beneficial partnership between emotion research in psychology and in computational science, of which this volume is an exemplar. To understand this partnership and its potential for transforming existing practices in emotion research across disciplines and for disclosing important novel areas of research, we explore in this chapter the history of work in computational models of emotion including the various uses to which they have been put, the theoretical traditions that have shaped their development, and how these uses and traditions are reflected in their underlying architectures. For an outsider to the field, the last 15 years have seen the development of a seemingly bewildering array of competing and complementary computational models. Figure 1.2.1 lists a ‘family tree’ of a few of the significant models and the theoretical traditions from which they stem. Although there has been a proliferation of work, the field is far from mature: the goals that a model is designed to achieve are not always clearly articulated; research is rarely incremental, more often returning to motivating theories rather than extending prior computational approaches; and rarely are models contrasted with each other in terms of their ability to achieve their set goals. Contributing to potential confusion is the reality that computational models are complex systems embodying a number of, sometimes unarticulated, design decisions and assumptions inherited from the psychological and computational traditions from which they emerged, a circumstance made worse by the lack of a commonly accepted lexicon even for designating these distinctions. In this chapter, we lay out the work on computational models of emotion in an attempt to reveal the common uses to which they may be put and the underlying techniques and assumptions from which the models are built. Our aim is to present conceptual distinctions and common terminology that can aid in discussion and comparison of competing models. Our hope is that this will not only facilitate an understanding of the field for outside researchers but work towards a lexicon that can help foster the maturity of the field towards more incremental research. In characterizing different computational models of emotion, we begin by describing interdisciplinary uses to which computational models may be put, including their uses in improving human–computer interaction, in enhancing general models of intelligence, and as methodological tools for furthering our understanding of human behaviour. We next discuss how models have been built, including the underlying theoretical traditions that have shaped their development. These differing theoretical perspectives often conceptualize emotion in quite different ways, emphasizing different scenarios and proposed functions, different component processes, and different linkages between these components.

Are there activities that computers can engage in that actively draw people into relationships with them? What are the potential benefits to the people who participate in these human-computer relationships? To address these questions this work introduces a theory of Relational Agents, which are computational artifacts designed to build and maintain long-term, social-emotional relationships with their users. These can be purely software humanoid animated agents--as developed in this work--but they can also be non-humanoid or embodied in various physical forms, from robots, to pets, to jewelry, clothing, hand-helds, and other interactive devices. Central to the notion of relationship is that it is a persistent construct, spanning multiple interactions; thus, Relational Agents are explicitly designed to remember past history and manage future expectations in their interactions with users. Finally, relationships are fundamentally social and emotional, and detailed knowledge of human social psychology--with a particular emphasis on the role of affect--must be incorporated into these agents if they are to effectively leverage the mechanisms of human social cognition in order to build relationships in the most natural manner possible. People build relationships primarily through the use of language, and primarily within the context of face-to-face conversation. Embodied Conversational Agents--anthropomorphic computer characters that emulate the experience of face-to-face conversation--thus provide the substrate for this work, and so the relational activities provided by the theory will primarily be specific types of verbal and nonverbal conversational behaviors used by people to negotiate and maintain relationships. This work also provides an analysis of the types of applications in which having a human-computer relationship is advantageous to the human participant. In addition to applications in which the relationship is an end in itself (e.g., in entertainment systems), human-computer relationships are important in tasks in which the human is attempting to undergo some change in behavior or cognitive or emotional state. One such application is explored here: a system for assisting the user through a month-long health behavior change program in the area of exercise adoption. This application involves the research, design and implementation of relational agents as well as empirical evaluation of their ability to build relationships and effect change over a series of interactions with users.

In this chapter, we consider more complex models. The key generalization is to represent the hidden state in terms of a set of random variables, instead of a single random variable.1 Similarly we can represent the observations in a factorized or distributed manner. We can then use graphical models to represent conditional indepencies between these variables, both within and across positions in the sequence. Sequential data comes in two main forms: temporal (time-series) data, which is generated sequentially by some causal process, and sequence data (e.g., bio-sequences or natural language), where we are more agnostic about the generating mechanism. For modelling time-series data, it is natural to use directed graphical models, which can capture the fact that time flows forward. Arcs within a time-slice can be directed or undirected, since they model “instantaneous” correlation. If all arcs are directed, both within and between slices, the model is called a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). (The term “dynamic” means we are modelling a dynamic system, and does not mean the graph structure changes over time.) DBNs are quite popular because they are easy to interpret and learn: because the graph is directed, the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of each node can be estimated independently. In this chapter, we will focus on DBNs. For modelling atemporal sequence data, it is possible to use directed or undirected graphical models. Much of our discussion of offline inference in temporal models is also applicable to atemporal models. The online inference methods we discuss can be applied to temporal models, but can also be used for sequential learning of static models, which is useful if the data is non-stationary or too large for batch methods. We will not discuss learning (parameter estimation and model selection) in this chapter, since the techniques are just simple extensions of the methods for learning static models. Also, we defer discussion of sequential decision making (control/ reinforcement learning problems) to Chapter ??.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 95, 'citationCount': 118, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2056417995', 'name': 'Kevin P.

A main feature of the proposed model of rational component concerns its interaction between rationality, personality and emotions, mainly in the goal selection and action selection processes and in the rational state evolution. Such evolution takes place in two ways: implicitly, the behavior of the rational component changes according to the current emotional state; explicitly, the emotional knowledge is encoded as facts in the working memory of a production system. The paper describes each component of the rational module, its mechanisms, its inputs and its outputs and how the interactions with emotions and personality are realized. Our research aims are directed toward applications of emotional agents to multimodal environments, with particular interest in intelligent interaction and communication by means of music, dance, movements of robots, visual media and in general applications where non-verbal communication mechanisms are the main communication channels between human and machines.

While the assumptions and perspectives adopted in these areas often differ in substantial ways, many planning problems of interest to researchers in these fields can be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and analyzed using the techniques of decision theory. This paper presents an overview and synthesis of MDP-related methods, showing how they provide a unifying framework for modeling many classes of planning problems studied in AI. It also describes structural properties of MDPs that, when exhibited by particular classes of problems, can be exploited in the construction of optimal or approximately optimal policies or plans. Planning problems commonly possess structure in the reward and value functions used to describe performance criteria, in the functions used to describe state transitions and observations, and in the relationships among features used to describe states, actions, rewards, and observations. Specialized representations, and algorithms employing these representations, can achieve computational leverage by exploiting these various forms of structure. Certain AI techniques -- in particular those based on the use of structured, intensional representations -- can be viewed in this way. This paper surveys several types of representations for both classical and decision-theoretic planning problems, and planning algorithms that exploit these representations in a number of different ways to ease the computational burden of constructing policies or plans.

The set of abilities that allow an individual to infer these hidden mental states based on observed actions and behavior has been called a “theory of mind” (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). Existing models of theory of mind have sought to identify a developmental progression of social skills that serve as the basis for more complex cognitive abilities. These skills include detecting eye contact, identifying self-propelled stimuli, and attributing intent to moving objects. \nIf we are to build machines that interact naturally with people, our machines must both interpret the behavior of others according to these social rules and display the social cues that will allow people to naturally interpret the machine's behavior. \nDrawing from the models of Baron-Cohen (1995) and Leslie (1994), a novel architecture called embodied theory of mind was developed to link high-level cognitive skills to the low-level perceptual abilities of a humanoid robot. The implemented system determines visual saliency based on inherent object attributes, high-level task constraints, and the attentional states of others. Objects of interest are tracked in real-time to produce motion trajectories which are analyzed by a set of naive physical laws designed to discriminate animate from inanimate movement. Animate objects can be the source of attentional states (detected by finding faces and head orientation) as well as intentional states (determined by motion trajectories between objects). Individual components are evaluated by comparisons to human performance on similar tasks, and the complete system is evaluated in the context of a basic social learning mechanism that allows the robot to mimic observed movements.

The current study evaluated the effectiveness of two variants of the Secret Agent Society social skills program for children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (HFASD) in a mainstream school context. Sixty-nine students aged 7–12 took part in one of two different 10-week versions of the program (structured versus unstructured) to determine their relative effectiveness. Results suggested that both program variants led to improvements in emotion regulation abilities, social skills, and behavior at school and home, maintained at 6-week follow-up. However, the structured intervention generally led to superior treatment outcomes. These results suggest that improvements in social–emotional functioning can be achieved for students with HFASD through time-limited school-based interventions. Limitations of this study and directions for future research are discussed.",2015,16,60,"{'name': 'Psychology in the Schools', 'pages': '390-402', 'volume': '52'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

Each group met over a period of 12–16 weeks for a minimum of one 1½‐hour weekly session aimed at promoting key areas of social interaction and understanding, supported by home‐based practice. Results Significant gains were achieved in comparison with a normative population, and individual parent ratings showed marked and sustained changes in the key areas targeted in the group sessions. Conclusion Social communication in children and adolescents with ASD can be enhanced through the use of a groupwork intervention addressing social interaction and understanding.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 100, 'authors': [{'authorId': '8762298', 'name': 'T.

This meta-analysis of 55 single-subject design studies examined the effectiveness of school-based social skills interventions for children and adolescents with ASD. Intervention, maintenance, and generalization effects were measured by computing the percentage of non-overlapping data points. The results suggest that social skills interventions have been minimally effective for children with ASD. Specific participant, setting, and procedural features that lead to the most effective intervention outcomes are highlighted, and implications for school personnel are discussed.

A second interest was to evaluate whether more intensive parent involvement would increase the child's ability to manage anxiety outside of the clinic setting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeventy-one children aged ten to twelve years were recruited to participate in the anxiety programme. All children were diagnosed with AS and the presence of anxiety symptoms was accepted on parent report via brief interview. Children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: intervention for child only, intervention for child and parent, wait-list control.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe two intervention groups demonstrated significant decreases in parent-reported anxiety symptoms at follow-up and a significant increase in the child's ability to generate positive strategies in an anxiety-provoking situation. There were a number of significant differences between the two interventions to suggest parent involvement as beneficial.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe sample of children with AS in this study presented with a profile of anxiety similar to a sample of clinically diagnosed anxious children. The intervention was endorsed by parents as a useful programme for children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and exhibiting anxiety symptoms, and active parent involvement enhanced the usefulness of the programme.

Children who received a diagnosis of autism (n 40) or AS (n 19) on a diagnostic interview when they were 4 to 6 years of age were administered a battery of cognitive and behavioural measures. Families were contacted roughly 6 years later (at mean age of 12 years) and assessed for evidence of psychiatric problems including mood and anxiety disorders. Compared with a sample of 1751 community children, AS and autistic children demonstrated a greater rate of anxiety and depression problems. These problems had a significant impact on their overall adaptation. There were, however, no differences in the number of anxiety and mood problems between the AS and autistic children within this high-functioning cohort. The number of psychiatric problems was not correlated with early autistic symptoms but was predicted to a small extent by early verbal/non-verbal IQ discrepancy scores. These data indicate that high-functioning PDD children are at greater risk for mood and anxiety problems than the general population but the correlates and risk factors for these comorbid problems remain unclear.', 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 926, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2110610515', 'name': 'Joseph A.

24,87ca974d8923f69a0db67482bd3307621daf5e26,Using interpersonal affect regulation in simulated healthcare consultations: an experimental investigation of self-control resource depletion,"Controlled Interpersonal Affect Regulation -the process of deliberately influencing the internal feeling states of others- occurs in a variety of interpersonal relationships and contexts. An incipient corpus of research shows that interpersonal affect regulation can be characterized as a goal-directed behavior that uses self-control processes which, according to the strength model of self-regulation, consumes a limited resource that is also used by other self-control processes. Using interpersonal affect-improving and affect-worsening regulation strategies can increase agent's resource depletion but there is reason to think that effects will partially rely on target's feedback in response to the regulation. Using a healthcare paradigm, an experiment was conducted to test the combined effects of interpersonal affect regulation use and patient feedback on healthcare workers' resource depletion, measured as self-reported experienced and expected emotional exhaustion, and persistence on a self-regulation task. Medical students (N = 78) were randomly assigned to a 2(interpersonal affect regulation: affect-worsening vs. affect-improving) × 2(patients' feedback: positive vs. negative) factorial between-subjects design and given instructions to play the role of doctors in interactions with two professional actors trained to act as patients. Analysis of covariance showed that affect-worsening was more depleting than affect-improving for all measures, whereas the recovery effects of positive feedback varied depending on strategy type and measure. The findings confirm the characterization of interpersonal affect regulation as potentially depleting, but suggest that the correspondence between the agent's strategy and the target's response needs to be taken into consideration. Use of affect-improving and positive feedback showed positive effects on self-rated performance, indicating that interpersonal affect regulation is relevant for organizational as well as personal

We propose that failure to effectively regulate emotions can result from difficulties with the self-regulatory tasks of (i) identifying the need to regulate, (ii) deciding whether and how to regulate, and (iii) enacting a regulation strategy. Next we review evidence that a technique traditionally associated with regulating behavioural goals (forming implementation intentions or “if-then” planning) can help to overcome these difficulties. Meta-analysis indicated that forming implementation intentions is effective in modifying emotional outcomes, with a large effect relative to no regulation instructions (k = 21, N = 1306 d + = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.20) and a medium-sized effect relative to goal intention instructions (k = 29, N = 1208, d + = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.65).

In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3).

The impact of these requirements on the emotions employees display, their well-being, and their clients' satisfaction has been explored in previous research. Emotional requirements have been characterized as organizationally-based expectations (e.g., Brotheridge & Lee, 2003), formal and informal organizational rules (e.g., Cropanzano, Weiss & Elias, 2004), occupational norms (e.g., Rafaeli & Sutton, 1987; Smith & Kleinman, 1989) and job-based demands (Brotheridge & Lee, 2002). Although all these definitions assume some kind of shared source for perceptions of emotional requirements, it remains unclear to what extent these different sources contribute and to what extent the requirements are shared by different units, teams and individuals in the organization. The present study analyses the perception of emotional requirements from a survey of ninety-seven Primary Health Care teams composed of general practitioners, nurses and administrative staff (N = 1057). The relative contribution of different sources of variance (team, organizational, and occupational) to perceived emotional requirements and the effects on employees’ job satisfaction and well being are examined.

In this article, we focus on physicians as professionals who are expected to be empathic caregivers. They engage in such emotional labor through deep acting (ie, generating empathy-consistent emotional and cognitive reactions before and during empathic interactions with the patient, similar to the method-acting tradition used by some stage and screen actors), surface acting (ie, forging empathic behaviors toward the patient, absent of consistent emotional and cognitive reactions), or both. Although deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when immediate emotional and cognitive understanding of patients is impossible. Overall, we contend that physicians are more effective healers--and enjoy more professional satisfaction--when they engage in the process of empathy. We urge physicians first to recognize that their work has an element of emotional labor and, second, to consciously practice deep and surface acting to empathize with their patients.

Norms and test-retest reliability are presented. Factor analysis of the scale revealed that self-consciousness has three components: public, private, and social anxiety. The relationships among these three factors are examined. The scale was found useful in research on social behavior, and its implications for research and therapy are discussed. Self Jawareness is a central concept in several divergent approaches to behavior and life. In psychoanalysi s, increased awareness of the self is both a tool and a goal. Self-examination enables the person to recognize his unconscious thoughts, motives, and defenses; one result of the therapy is increased insight, i.e., greater self-awareness. Rogerian therapy, existential analysis, and a variety of other insight therapies have also emphasized the importance of attending to and understanding one\'s inner thoughts and feelings. Relatively newer traditions, such as transactional analysis, encounter groups, and sensitivity training, have stressed the value of ""getting in touch with oneself"" and recognizing how one\'s behavior affects others. The quest for self-insight may also be seen in the widespread interest in the practice of meditation. Previous interest in self-awarenes s has derived from either a therapeutic orientation or a philosophical approach to life. Recently, self-awareness has been approached from an entirely different perspective—that of social psychology. Argyle (1969) has speculated about the impact of self ^awareness on social interaction, and Duval and Wicklund (1972) have elaborated an entire theory of selfawareness. Laboratory research generated by Duval and Wicklund\'s theory has examined both the effects of stimuli that direct attention toward the self (mirrors and cameras) Allan Fenigstein is now at Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio, and Michael F.

Among the variety of negative emotions, anger poses a particularly detrimental consequence on interpersonal relationships and mental health, whether expressed or not. The constructive expression of anger and trial of revision has been the recent focus of an effective method of anger regulation. However, the most effective tactic is contingent on the interpersonal relationship with the agent of arousal, as norms pertaining to emotional expression may differ depending on the level of intimacy or power distance. Thus, the present study examined the moderating effect of relational variables with the agent of anger arousal. A native anger regulation scale suggested a five-factor structure: Emotional expression, Constructive expression, Expression toward third person, Suppression, and Reappraisal attempt. To confirm the moderating effects of interpersonal relations, evaluations of past anger-arousing experiences between two conditions, one toward a non-intimate target with higher status, and another toward an intimate target with equal status, were compared. Results suggested that Reappraisal attempt had a positive effect on relationship evaluation in the non-intimate, higher status condition, while constructive expression had a positive effect in the intimate, equal status condition. Further examination of relationship factors, content of anger experience, and other moderating factors was discussed.",2008,53,1,"{'name': 'Journal of Surgical Research', 'pages': '89-106', 'volume': '15'}",,"[{'authorId': '48387042', 'name': 'Takuya Yoshida'}, {'authorId': '2869384', 'name': 'Jiro Takai'}]","[{'paperId': '6365d9c611ca2c69f470b212e99308c2b471e05c', 'title': 'ON THE ORIGINS OF HUMAN EMOTIONS A SOCIOLOGICAL ENQUIRY INTO THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN AFFECT Jonathan H.

Analyses indicate that social domain and status differences are such powerful predictors of emotional expression that they eclipse the influence of other individual characteristics, most notably the gender of both the individual and the target of the anger. Moreover, the status mechanism governing emotional expression does not vary across work and family settings.

In defining aggressive drive, a distinction is made between expressive aggression and hostile aggression which is illustrated in the difference between the desire to ""hit"" and the desire to ""hurt."" Hostile aggression is assumed to be a learned drive whose primary antecedents are past exposure to punishment and present threats to self-esteem. Several procedures for reducing aggression other than performance of an aggressive response are described and the function of diverse measures responsive to changes in expressive aggression, aggressive drive, and aggressive response strength, particularly when evaluating the consequences of an aggressive act, are analyzed. The general problems to which this paper is addressed are the functional properties of an aggressive act and the mechanisms by which aggression is reduced. We will be particularly concerned with the following hypothesis which is central to the theoretical analysis presented by Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer, Sears, Ford, Hovland, and Sollenberger (1939) in the frustration-aggression monograph: ""The expression of an act of aggression is a catharsis that reduces the instigation to all other acts of aggression [p. 53]."" There are three terms or phrases in this hypothesis which require further explication in order to ascertain its theoretical implications and the empirical operations which would be appropriate to a test of this hypothesis.

26,f5fd33af7c5be2af49ca4b8172e25cde136069fc,RAISE: Robotics & AI to improve STEM and social skills for elementary school students,"The authors present the design and implementation of an exploratory virtual learning environment that assists children with autism (ASD) in learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills along with improving social-emotional and communication skills. The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students’ varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash™, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent’s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent’s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state. The paper provides exploratory findings of the first 2 years of this 5-year scaling-up research study. The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability. Therefore, findings are reported as changes within subjects instead of across subjects. While these exploratory observations serve as a basis for longer term research on a larger population, this paper focuses less on student learning and more on evolving technology in AIC and supporting students with ASD in STEM environments.",2022,57,5,{'volume': '3'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-0.764626681804657, -0.6734055280685425, 0.23559126257896423, 4.57924747467041,

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders vary considerably according to variables such as index subject characteristics, study setting, sampling frame, diagnostic methods used, as well as country of geographic origin. To date, most studies comprise clinical or treatment referral samples in tertiary care or subjects enrolled in clinical trials and genetic cohort collections. Such samples carry the potential for overestimation of both the frequency and severity of psychiatric comorbidity. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases restricted to population-based study publications in the English between May 1, 2015, and May 31, 2020. A comprehensive keyword list was generated to investigate co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. A wide range of DSM-5 based disorders such as anxiety, mood, ADHD, intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder, eating/feeding, gender dysphoria and sleep-wake disorders were assessed. Initial search revealed a total of 1674 articles after removal of duplicates. Two independent researchers conducted a parallel-blinded screening process to identify the eligible studies based on titles and abstracts; 39 studies were analyzed in the current review. The main findings show prevalence estimates of 22.9% (95% CI: 17.7- 29.2) for intellectual disability; 26.2% (22-31) for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 11.1% (8.6-14.1) for anxiety disorders; 19.7% (11.9-30.7) for sleep disorders; 7% (5.2- 9.3) for disruptive disorders; 2% (1.3- 3.1) for bipolar disorders; 2.7% (1.8- 4.2) for depression; 1.8% (0.4–8.7) for obsessive-compulsive disorder; and 0.6% (0.3–1.1) for psychosis. Psychiatric comorbidity in population-based studies is lower than in clinical and referred samples. However, our results also indicate that the frequency of psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with ASD in the population context is considerable, without the influence of referral bias implicit in clinical and treatment samples. There is a need for better targeted diagnostic tools to detect psychiatric comorbidity in children and youth in future population-based studies, as an essential component in providing care as well as new insights into the nature and mechanisms of its underlying associations.

The integration of social robots to support learners has already shown promise to benefit the learning process in this area. In this paper, we focus on the applicability of an adaptive robotic tutor in a university setting. To this end, we conducted a long-term field study implementing an adaptive robotic tutor to support students with exam preparation over three sessions during one semester. In a mixed design, we compared the effect of an adaptive tutor to a control condition across all learning sessions. With the aim to benefit not only motivation but also academic success and the learning experience in general, we draw from research in adaptive tutoring, social robots in education, as well as our own prior work in this field. Our results show that opting in for the robotic tutoring is beneficial for students. We found significant subjective knowledge gain and increases in intrinsic motivation regarding the content of the course in general. Finally, participation resulted in a significantly better exam grade compared to students not participating. However, the extended adaptivity of the robotic tutor in the experimental condition did not seem to enhance learning, as we found no significant differences compared to a non-adaptive version of the robot.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '151110885', 'name': 'Melissa Donnermann'}, {'authorId': '11715171', 'name': 'Philipp Schaper'}, {'authorId': '2117313647', 'name': 'Birgit Lugrin'}]}, {'paperId': 'b0f94c3cd564840471487fe2fcfa72ad350997ca', 'title': 'Facial Expression Recognition By Using a Disentangled Identity-Invariant Expression Representation', 'abstract': 'Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a challenging task because many factors of variation such as pose, illumination, and identity-specific attributes are entangled with the expression information in an expressive face image. Recent works show that the performance of a FER algorithm can be improved by disentangling the expression information from identity features. In this paper, we present Transfer-based Expression Recognition Generative Adversarial Network (TER-G AN) that combines the effectiveness of a novel feature disentanglement technique with the concept of identity-invariant expression representation learning for FER. More specifically, TER-GAN learns a disentangled expression representation by extracting expression features from one image and transferring the expression information to the identity of another image. To improve the feature disentanglement process and to learn an identity-invariant expression representation, we introduce a novel expression consistency loss and an identity consistency loss that exploit expression and identity information from both real and synthetic images.

However, whether this could be demonstrated using more realistic facial emotion recognition stimuli and applied to autistic females was unclear. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed online self-report measures of autism spectrum condition severity and alexithymia, and afacial emotion recognition deficit that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition severity, were associated with less accurate facial emotion recognition. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy. However, alexithymia (and autism spectrum condition severity) was not associated with speed of emotion processing. The findings are primarily discussed with the theoretical view that perceiving and experiencing emotions share the same neural networks, thus being able to recognise one’s own emotions may facilitate the ability to recognise others’. This study is in line with previous similar research on autistic males and suggests impairments in facial emotion recognition in autistic females should be attributed to co-occurring alexithymia. Lay abstract Research with autistic males has indicated that difficulties in recognising facial expressions of emotion, commonly associated with autism spectrum conditions, may instead be due to co-occurring alexithymia (a condition involving lack of emotional awareness, difficulty describing feelings and difficulty distinguishing feelings from physical bodily sensations) and not to do with autism. We wanted to explore if this would be true for autistic females, as well as to use more realistic stimuli for emotional expression. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed self-report measures of autism spectrum condition traits and alexithymia and completed a visual test that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition features, were associated with less accuracy in identifying emotions. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy.

The purpose of this review is to configure primarily qualitative and mixed methods findings from studies meeting our selection and quality criterion to answer the review question: How do robotic construction kits function as computational manipulatives in P–12 STEM education? Our synthesis of the literature has resulted in four key insights that are new to the field. First, RCKs have a unique double application: They may be used for direct instruction in robotics (first-order uses) or as analogical tools for learning in other domains (second-order uses). Second, RCKs make possible additional routes to learning through the provision of immediate feedback and the dual modes of representation unique to RCKs. Third, RCKs support a computational thinking learning progression beginning with a lower anchor of sequencing and finishing with a high anchor of systems thinking. And fourth, RCKs support evolving problem-solving abilities along a continuum, ranging from trial and error to heuristic methods associated with robotics study. Furthermore, our synthesis provides insight into the second-order (analogical) uses of RCKs as computational manipulatives in the disciplines of physics and biology.

The findings of the current study support the authors’ theoretical model of peer group interaction processes for individuals with ASD, and have implications for both social skills training and the development of peer awareness and sensitivity.

According to this theory, the affective meaning of emotions, behaviours, objects, and other entities can be assessed and projected onto a three dimensional space of evaluation, potency, and activity. This concept was applied to events occurring in the environment of an affective agent in order to study the dynamics of emotional changes caused by these events. Several appraisal processes were used to effectively analyze the affective impact of the occurred events and to interpret them in terms of the three dimensions of the affect control theory. A fuzzy automata framework was investigated and found to be a good fit to represent the dynamics of changes in the affective states and to effectively picture the transitions between different emotional response levels. Based on the results obtained from conducted experiments, we can argue that the proposed model has the potential to be used in predicting the emotional changes in (human/virtual) agents as a result of the occurrence of emotion-triggering events. Furthermore, it would appear that the proposed model has the capability to be used as the kernel of an extended system developed for reverse engineering events, and to generate and apply those in-favor of emotion regulation process.",2016,110,2,"{'name': '2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)', 'pages': '1797-1804'}",,"[{'authorId': '9458014', 'name': 'Ahmad Soleimani'}, {'authorId': '1763459', 'name': 'Ziad Kobti'}]","[{'paperId': 'a40958c8b276b1f62d047fe3eb02ca44a41892b6', 'title': 'Applying a Text-Based Affective Dialogue System in Psychological Research: Case Studies on the Effects of System Behaviour, Interaction Context and Social Exclusion', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 94, 'citationCount': 11, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1735402', 'name': 'M.

The importance of social networks and the implications of contagion theory', 'abstract': 'Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 47(4) It is well recognised that mood and behaviour are significantly influenced by social and environmental circumstances. In particular, social contagion theory hypothesises that emotions can behave like infectious diseases spreading through groups of intimates in social networks (Hill et al., 2010), leading to population clusters with higher rates of mood symptoms. Hazell (1993) used the same infectious disease model to describe the potential clustering of adolescent suicide. Until recently, the social transmission of mood and behaviour has been hard to track. The complex and dynamic nature of human relationships makes it difficult to quantify the effect of mood contagion at a population level. Using sophisticated social network analysis of large datasets, such as the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Christakis and Fowler (2012) have examined the structural and qualitative architecture of social networks and the dynamic changes that took place over a 32-year period in the FHS. Utilising complex mathematical modelling, they were able to assess how the social architecture of a community influenced the incidence and spread of a variety of health and behavioural outcomes in Framingham, Massachusetts. Emotional contagion is often considered to be transient but the FHS studies found the effects could be long term and profound. Obesity, smoking, alcohol use, depression, loneliness and happiness spread through the web of relationships within broader social networks, with effects occurring over decades (Cacioppo et al., 2009; Christakis and Fowler, 2007, 2008; Fowler and Christakis, 2008; Rosenquist et al., 2010, 2011). Using this unique longitudinal dataset of the FHS, the studies showed that there was a social contagion component for mood including depression, loneliness and happiness (Christakis and Fowler, 2008, 2012; Hill et al., 2010; Rosenquist et al., 2011). Their model (Christakis and Fowler, 2012) specifically demonstrated that these social health effects were not just a selection effect in that ‘birds of a feather flock together’ or that there was a shared environmental exposure. Depressed people not only sought out others with depressive symptoms, but also they changed each other’s mood over extended periods of contact. Interestingly, they found that ‘friends of a friend of a friend’ (up to three degrees of separation) were influenced by the contagious spread of mood (Hill et al., 2010; Rosenquist et al., 2011). Of particular importance was the finding that friends were significantly more influential than family members in the spread of mood, especially among women (Rosenquist et al., 2011). This latter finding of the more marked influence of peers compared to family members is somewhat surprising and certainly warrants further investigation. Positive and negative emotional states behaved much like infections, gradually spreading through social networks (Hill et al., 2010). The effects were cumulative, with increased risks associated with the number of contacts with low or positive mood. Contagion of mood states likely relates to a combination of the spread of ideas, behaviours and affect. The precise mechanism is not known but it likely has both unconscious and conscious elements. The unconscious element could relate to automatic mimicry (Hatfield et al., 1993) and the mirror neuron system (Ocampo and Kritikos, 2011). Through afferent feedback, the receiver feels the sender’s expressions, and this leads towards emotional convergence (Hatfield et al., 1993). The conscious component could be due to shared communication styles such as co-rumination, especially amongst young women (van Zalk et al., 2010). Peer influence mechanisms in the adolescent literature include engaging in high-status behaviours, matching the social norms of a valued or desired group, engaging in behaviours that are reinforced by peers and engaging in behaviours that contribute to a favourable self-identity (Brechwald and Prinstein, 2011). People may also adjust their communication styles based on social comparison in order to dynamically fit the social environment (Barsade 2002; van Zalk et al., Is depression contagious?

Design Longitudinal social network analysis. Setting Framingham Heart Study social network. Participants 4739 individuals followed from 1983 to 2003. Main outcome measures Happiness measured with validated four item scale; broad array of attributes of social networks and diverse social ties. Results Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network, and the relationship between people’s happiness extends up to three degrees of separation (for example, to the friends of one’s friends’ friends). People who are surrounded by many happy people and those who are central in the network are more likely to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25% (95% confidence interval 1% to 57%). Similar effects are seen in coresident spouses (8%, 0.2% to 16%), siblings who live within a mile (14%, 1% to 28%), and next door neighbours (34%, 7% to 70%). Effects are not seen between coworkers. The effect decays with time and with geographical separation. Conclusions People’s happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they are connected.

The impact on learning and instruction is explained as a process of changing perceptions and concerns about the value of using technology to support their learning. We build on models of innovation-decision processes and attributes of adoption of innovation and concern-based adoption.

We have used computational modelling techniques to do so, more specifically, the reinforcement learning paradigm. Emotion is modelled as artificial affect, a measure that denotes the positiveness versus negativeness of a situation to an artificial agent in a reinforcement learning setting. We have done a range of different experiments to study the effect of affect on learning, including the effect on learning if affect is used to control the exploration behaviour of the agent and the effect on learning when affect is communicated by a human (though real-time analysis of that human’s facial expressions) to a simulated robot. We conclude that affect is a useful concept to consider in adaptive agents that learn based on reinforcement learning and that in some cases affect can indeed help the learning process. Further, affective modelling in this way can help understand the psychological processes that underlie influences of affect on cognition.

The input features are a combination of seg-mental and suprasegmental acoustic information; feature sets are selected from a 21-dimensional feature set and applied to the fuzzy classiﬁer. Our fuzzy inference system is designed through a data-driven approach. The design of the fuzzy inference system has two phases: one for initialization for which fuzzy c-means method is used, and the other is ﬁne-tuning of parameters of the fuzzy model. For ﬁne-tuning, a well known neuro-fuzzy method are used.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 13, 'citationCount': 1188, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

At the basic level of the emotion hierarchy one finds the handful of concepts (love, joy, anger, sadness, fear, and perhaps, surprise) most useful for making everyday distinctions among emotions, and these overlap substantially with the examples mentioned most readily when people are asked to name emotions (Fehr & Russell, 1984), with the emotions children learn to name first (Bretherton & Beeghly, 1982), and with what theorists have called basic or primary emotions.

Fear, produced by stimuli that are associated with painful events, results in defensive behavior and the inhibition of pain and pain-related behaviors. On the other hand, pain, produced by injurious stimulation, motivates recuperative behaviors that promote healing. In this model injurious stimulation, on the one hand, and the expectation of injurious stimulation, on the other hand, activate entirely different motivational systems which serve entirely different functions. The fear motivation system activates defensive behavior, such as freezing and flight from a frightening situation, and its function is to defend the animal against natural dangers, such as predation. A further effect of fear motivation is to organize the perception of environmental events so as to facilitate the perception of danger and safety. The pain motivation system activates recuperative behaviors, including resting and body-care responses, and its function is to promote the animal's recovery from injury. Pain motivation also selectively facilitates the perception of nociceptive stimulation. Since the two kinds of motivation serve different and competitive functions, it might be expected that they would interact through some kind of mutual inhibition. Recent research is described which indicates that this is the case. The most important connection is the inhibition of pain by fear; fear has the top priority. This inhibition appears to be mediated by an endogenous analgesic mechanism involving the endorphins. The model assumes that fear triggers the endorphin mechanism, thereby inhibiting pain motivation and recuperative behaviors that might compete with effective defensive behavior."", 'year': 1980, 'referenceCount': 213, 'citationCount': 770, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1764443', 'name': 'R.

These papers cover a broad \nspectrum of topics related to the theory of fuzzy sets, ranging from its mathematical aspects to applications in human cognition, communication, decisionmaking, and engineering systems analysis. Basically, a fuzzy set is a class in which there may be a continuum of grades of membership as, say, in the class of long objects. Such sets underlie much of our ability to summarize, communicate, and make decisions under uncertainty or partial information. Indeed, fuzzy sets appear to play an essential role in human cognition, especially in relation to concept formation, pattern classification, and logical reasoning. \nSince its inception about a decade ago, the theory of fuzzy sets has evolved in many directions, and is finding pplications in a wide variety of fields in which the phenomena under study are too complex or too ill defined to be analyzed by conventional techniques. Thus, by providing a basis for a systematic approach to approximate reasoning, the theory of fuzzy sets may well have a substantial impact on scientific methodology in the years ahead, particularly in the realms of psychology, economics, law, medicine, decision analysis, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence. \nThe U.S.-Japan Seminar on Fuzzy Sets was sponsored by the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program, with the joint support of the National Science Foundation and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

This model integrates several traditional approaches to modeling cultural evolution into a common conceptual framework. This framework depicts cultural evolution as a process of dual inheritance. At the micro-evolutionary level there is a population of individuals, each described in terms of a set of behavioral traits. Traits are passed from generation to generation at this level by means of a number of socially motivated operators. At the macro-evolutionary level, individuals are able to generate ""mappa"" that generalize on their experience. These individual mappa can be merged to form group mappa and these group mappa can be generalized and specialized using a variety of generic and problem specific operators. A specific implementation of Cultural Algorithms is described using Genetic Algorithms to represent the population space and Version spaces (or lattices) to represent the set of possible schemata that can be produced via generalizations on the population space. Individual and group mappa are defined as subspaces within the lattice. It is shown how the addition of a belief space to the traditional Genetic Algorithm framework can affect the rate at which learning can take place in terms of the modifications that it produces in the traditional schema theorem for Genetic Algorithms.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 6, 'citationCount': 540, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1680381', 'name': 'R.

The Affect Grid is potentially suitable for any study that requires judgments about affect of either a descriptive or a subjective kind. The scale was shown to have adequate reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity in 4 studies in which college students used the Affect Grid to describe (a) their current mood, (b) the meaning of emotion-related words, and (c) the feelings conveyed by facial expressions. Other studies are cited to illustrate the potential uses of the Affect Grid as a measure of mood.

The Affect Grid is potentially suitable for any study that requires judgments about affect of either a descriptive or a subjective kind. The Affect Grid is a single-item scale. Our aim was for an instrument that would be short and easy to fill out and that could, therefore, be used rapidly and repeatedly. Currently available scales of affect are multiple-item checklists or questionnaires that are too time-consuming or too distracting for some purposes. In particular, they do not lend themselves to continuous or quickly repeated observation. They are awkward in dealing with the rapid fluctuations of affect that occur, for example, in response to music, or for all we know, to many everyday emotion-laden events. In repeated-meas ures designs, subjects tiring of the same checklist may eventually become less conscientious or, in longitudinal studies, drop out of the study. Researchers who have wanted something quick and simple have sometimes resorted to homespun measures—with resulting uncertainty as to precisely what is being measured and how well. The Affect Grid is shown in Figure 1. The subject is asked to take several minutes beforehand to learn precisely how to use it.

Measuring such subjective data as reactions to color, heat, light, and sound would seem to be an almost impossible task; indeed, until now there has been no theory around which the research in this field could be organized. This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities.

A linguistic variable is defined as a variable whose values are sentences in a natural or artificial language. Thus, if tall, not tall, very tall, very very tall, etc. are values of height, then height is a linguistic variable. Fuzzy conditional statements are expressions of the form IF A THEN B, where A and B have fuzzy meaning, e.g., IF x is small THEN y is large, where small and large are viewed as labels of fuzzy sets. A fuzzy algorithm is an ordered sequence of instructions which may contain fuzzy assignment and conditional statements, e.g., x = very small, IF x is small THEN Y is large. The execution of such instructions is governed by the compositional rule of inference and the rule of the preponderant alternative.

We evaluate the spread of long-term emotional states across a social network. We introduce a novel form of the classical susceptible – infected –susceptible disease model which includes the possibility for 'spontaneous' (or 'automatic') infection, in addition to disease transmission (the SISa model). Using this framework and data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provide formal evidence that positive and negative emotional states behave like infectious diseases spreading across social networks over long periods of time. The probability of becoming content is increased by 0.02 per year for each content contact, and the probability of becoming discontent is increased by 0.04 per year per discontent contact. Our mathematical formalism allows us to derive various quantities from the data, such as the average lifetime of a contentment 'infection' (10 years) or discontentment 'infection' (5 years). Our results give insight into the transmissive nature of positive and negative emotional states. Determining to what extent particular emotions or behaviours are infectious is a promising direction for further research with important implications for social science, epidemiology and health policy. Our model provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviours, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs. 1. INTRODUCTION Social network effects are of great importance for understanding human behaviour. People interact with different numbers of individuals and with some individuals more than others, and this affects behaviour in fundamental ways. Investigations from diverse fields, including sociology , economics, physics, mathematics and public health, have studied social networks, both to understand their structure and their affect on social dynamics. 2009) have been shown to be influenced by network contacts (reviewed in Jackson 2009). Other behaviours such as college GPA (Sacerdote 2001) and crime (Glaeser et al. 1996; Haynie 2001) have been related to peer effects. Recently, social networks have been studied as determinants of health (reviewed by Smith & Christakis 2008), ranging from determining the patterns of infectious disease spread (Keeling & Eames 2005) …"", 'year': None, 'referenceCount': 14, 'citationCount': 49, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3209818', 'name': 'A.

The impact of the environment on the frontal lobe is of great relevance since the so-called Executive Functions (EF) are developed there. EFs are in charge of planning, anticipating, executing behavior and emotional regulation. Developing of intervention strategies that favor prosocial behaviors in children by promoting listening, dialogue, decision, and transcendence could generate changes in behavior and benefits processes related to executive functions. The Education by Experience (ExE) Model focuses on addressing issues related to respect, commitment, coexistence in harmony, gender equality, human rights, care for nature, health, and well-being, taking into account the school as an agent of change through the participation of students, teachers and parents. 
  
Method. The objective of this study was to know the effect of the ExE intervention program on the EFs of childhood and adolescence in the Mexican state of Hidalgo. A total of 316 boys, girls, and adolescents aged 8 to 15 (142 men and 174 women), 4th, 5th, and 6th grade of primary school and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade of secondary school, both from public schools, participated. Participants were selected by simple random sampling and assigned to one of the two experimental groups or to the control group. A pre-post pre-experimental type design was used with three groups (Experimental Group A, Experimental Group B, and Control Group). The recommendations and guidelines of the Code of Ethics of the Psychologist were followed. The evaluation consisted of applying a battery of neuropsychological instruments suitable for the Mexican child and adolescent population, known as BANFE-2, for its acronym in Spanish. The experimental and replica group received training in 10 of the components of the EXE model. Subsequently, the data were analyzed.  
  
Results. The measurements of the neuropsychological tasks of the EFs carried out before and after participating with the ExE Model allowed to identify that the children of the primary and middle school presented improvements in EFs mainly related to the orbitomedial region and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The most obvious changes were observed in the primary school participants, where there were statistically significant differences between the pre and post-evaluation of the experimental groups, which were not observed in the control group. These improvements are linked in primary school participants to the identification and regulation of emotions, while in middle school adolescents, the changes are related to the ability to plan, organize and solve problems. In both primary and middle schools, it is observed that the effect size index ranges from low to moderate. 
  
Discussion and Conclusion.  The students who participated in the ExE program showed an increase in the scores in executive functions tasks, specifically in those obtained in the orbitomedial and dorsolateral subscales, which are related to the identification and regulation of emotions. This study allows us to recognize the impact of the ExE educational model as a preventive strategy and facilitator of personal and social resources with positive results in the tasks of executive functions. Finally, the role of teachers as facilitating agents of change and the advantages of implementing a model based on values as a strategy for the promotion of well-being in educational settings is discussed.",2022,0,0,{'name': 'Electronic Journal of Research in Education Psychology'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-2.628859519958496, -2.542764186859131, -2.7157819271087646,

29,abe921cdec4a653106f6b3bd552f172d6f58b430,An intelligent assistant to provide social support to informal caregivers of people with dementia: Alzaid Assistant,"More than 50 million people live with dementia worldwide and it is expected to reach 82 million in 2030 and 150 million in 2050. Most of these people are cared for by informal caregivers at home, i.e. people who are not paid for their work and who are usually family members without professional training. The lack of skills and knowledge necessary to carry out this work causes stress and leads to increased levels of overload, anxiety, and depression in informal caregivers. This paper presents work in progress on the design of an intelligent assistant (IA), named Alzaid Assistant, for informal caregivers of people with dementia (PwD). This IA aims to promote social support in informal caregivers of PwD by providing them with information and strengthening coping strategies for problem solving and emotional regulation to reduce levels of overload, anxiety, and depression. Particularly, the phases of requirements elicitation, design, implementation, and preliminary validations are presented. A high-fidelity prototype of the IA was evaluated by 20 participants using a questionnaire based on the technology acceptance model to assess the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Alzaid Assistant was perceived as quite likely useful and quite likely easy to use by potential users.",2022,39,0,"{'name': '2022 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and

Proper nutrition and good eating behavior show promise for preventing and slowing the progression of ADRD and consequently improving patients with ADRD’s health status and quality of life. Most ADRD care is provided by informal caregivers, so assisting caregivers to manage patients with ADRD’s diet is important. Objective This study aims to design, develop, and test an artificial intelligence–powered voice assistant to help informal caregivers manage the daily diet of patients with ADRD and learn food and nutrition-related knowledge. Methods The voice assistant is being implemented in several steps: construction of a comprehensive knowledge base with ontologies that define ADRD diet care and user profiles, and is extended with external knowledge graphs; management of conversation between users and the voice assistant; personalized ADRD diet services provided through a semantics-based knowledge graph search and reasoning engine; and system evaluation in use cases with additional qualitative evaluations. Results A prototype voice assistant was evaluated in the lab using various use cases. Preliminary qualitative test results demonstrate reasonable rates of dialogue success and recommendation correctness. Conclusions The voice assistant provides a natural, interactive interface for users, and it does not require the user to have a technical background, which may facilitate senior caregivers’ use in their daily care tasks. This study suggests the feasibility of using the intelligent voice assistant to help caregivers manage patients with ADRD’s diet.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 19, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2116823876', 'name': 'Juan Li'}, {'authorId': '123041694', 'name': 'Bikesh Maharjan'}, {'authorId': '2077526566', 'name': 'Bo Xie'}, {'authorId': '34394575', 'name': 'Cui Tao'}]}, {'paperId': '81ee28c026d1bcf5ef1d0f6e7832930d5936d912', 'title': 'A single mindfulness session with informal caregivers of seniors living with dementia: a pilot qualitative descriptive study', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 4, 'authors': [{'authorId': '84561447', 'name': 'F.

Due to the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, caregivers face challenging in-home care situations that lead to a range of negative health outcomes such as anxiety and depression for the caregivers and nursing home placement for PWD. Supporting Family Caregivers with Technology for Dementia Home Care (FamTechCare) is a multisite randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of a telehealth intervention on caregiver well-being and PWD behavioral symptoms. The FamTechCare intervention provides individualized dementia-care strategies to in-home caregivers based on video recordings that the caregiver creates of challenging care situations. A team of dementia care experts review videos submitted by caregivers and provide interventions to improve care weekly for the experimental group. Caregivers in the control group receive feedback for improving care based on a weekly phone call with the interventionist and receive feedback on their videos at the end of the 3-month study. Using linear mixed modeling, we will compare experimental and control group outcomes (PWD behavioral symptoms and caregiver burden) after 1 and 3 months. An exploratory descriptive design will identify a typology of interventions for telehealth support for in-home dementia caregivers. Finally, the cost for FamTechCare will be determined and examined in relation to hypothesized effects on PWD behavioral symptoms, placement rates, and caregiver burden.

All the authors and investigators of dementia studies who provided us more specific data from their work. foreword Today, over 46 million people live with dementia worldwide, more than the population of Spain. This number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 2050. Dementia also has a huge economic impact. Today, the total estimated worldwide cost of dementia is US $818 billion, and it will become a trillion dollar disease by 2018. This means that if dementia care were a country, it would be the world's 18th largest economy, more than the market values of companies such as Apple (US$ 742 billion), Google (US$ 368 billion) and Exxon (US$ 357 billion). In many parts of the world, there is a growing awareness of dementia, but across the globe it remains the case that a diagnosis of dementia can bring with it stigma and social isolation. Today, we estimate that 94% of people living with dementia in low and middle income countries are cared for at home. These are regions where health and care systems often provide limited or no support to people living with dementia or to their families. The 2015 World Alzheimer Report updates data on the prevalence, incidence, cost and trends of dementia worldwide. It also estimates how these numbers will increase in the future, leaving us with no doubt that dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and other causes, is one of the biggest global public health and social care challenges facing people today and in the future. The two organisations we lead are ADI, the only worldwide federation of Alzheimer associations and global voice on dementia, and Bupa, a purpose-driven global health and care company that is the leading international provider of specialist dementia care, caring for around 60,000 people living with dementia each year. Together, we are committed to ensuring that dementia becomes an international health priority. We believe national dementia plans are the first step towards ensuring all countries are equipped to enable people to live well with dementia, and help to reduce the risk of dementia for future generations. There is now a growing list of countries which have such provision in place or which are developing national dementia plans, but it's not enough.

Few studies have tested the association of coping and health longitudinally. Method: This study examined factors associated with the use of coping strategies over time and their associations with physical and mental health outcomes in a population-based sample of 226 dementia caregivers in Cache County, Utah, USA. Caregivers annually completed the Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a health interview. Care-recipient cognitive and functional abilities were obtained using the Mini-Mental State Exam and the Clinical Dementia Rating. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Results: Caregivers most frequently identified providing care as a problem (37.6%). Linear mixed models of caregiver coping strategies found that the use of most strategies were stable except for increasing Avoidance among adult child caregivers (β = 0.14, p = 0.048). On average, increased Wishful Thinking (β = 2.48, p < 0.001) or Blames Self (β = 1.06, p = 0.002) was associated with higher anxiety scores. Increased use of Blames Others among males (interaction, β = 0.28, p = 0.02) and greater use of Wishful Thinking among younger caregivers (interaction, β = −0.01, p = 0.01) were associated with more caregiver health conditions.

One hundred twenty-five family carers of people with Alzheimer's disease completed the Brief COPE at time 1, 92 (82.9% of eligible carers) a year later, and 74 (77.1%) 2 years later. Internal consistencies were good for emotion-focused, problem-focused, and dysfunctional subscales (&agr; = 0.72, 0.84, 0.75). Test-retest reliability over a year was demonstrated for emotion-focused, problem-focused, and dysfunctional subscales among carers in whom burden scores did not change significantly (r = 0.58, r = 0.72, r = 0.68; p < 0.001).

Prevention Dementia is defined as a decline in cognitive function from baseline. It is a syndrome caused by a variety of disorders, the most common of which are Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. The incidence and prevalence of dementia increase with age. It is estimated that by the year 2047, more than 9 million Americans will have some form of it (1). Institutionalization is ultimately required for many patients with dementia, and 67% die in nursing homes (2). Although there is currently no cure for most forms of dementia, research findings and accumulated clinical experience support a set of practices that serve to maximize the function and overall well-being of patients with dementia and their caregivers. What medical interventions or health behaviors can help patients prevent dementia? Although there are several risk factors for different types of dementia, data supporting the effectiveness of specific preventive measures are limited. Hypertension Untreated hypertension in mid-life and later is a proven risk factor for both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia (3). A number of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that treating hypertension reduces the risk for dementia. A large, placebo-controlled RCT with 2418 participants demonstrated that treating systolic hypertension in patients over the age of 60 years reduced the incidence of dementia by 50%, from 7.7 cases to 3.8 cases per 1000 patient-years (4). Another placebo-controlled RCT with 6106 participants showed that treating hypertension with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril with or without the thiazide diuretic indapamide reduced the incidence of recurrent stroke with dementia by 34% and of recurrent stroke with any cognitive decline by 45% in patients with past stroke or transient ischemic attack (5). Hypercholesterolemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hypercholesterolemia, particularly in mid-life, is associated with an increased incidence of both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, (6), and case-control studies have shown an association between use of cholesterol-lowering medications and reduced incidence of dementia (7). Diabetes has been shown in both longitudinal cohort and case-control studies to be an independent risk factor for vascular dementia (8, 9). However, as with hypercholesterolemia, there are no trials that demonstrate that treating diabetes prevents dementia. Lifestyle Modifications Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk for stroke, although the evidence for an association with Alzheimer disease is mixed (10). Head injury earlier in life has been shown in a number of epidemiologic studies to be associated with dementia later in life (11). Finally, physical inactivity, both in mid-life and later, has been associated with an increased risk for dementia in both retrospective and prospective studies 12, 13). Thus, counseling patients to quit smoking; engage in behaviors to reduce the risk for head injury, such as wearing seat belts and bike helmets; and be physically active may reduce the risk for dementia. Medications Clinicians should regularly review the medication regimens of elderly patients and minimize use of medications that can cause cognitive impairment, such as benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, barbiturates, and other sedative-hypnotics. A number of studies have shown that elderly patients taking benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics perform more poorly on cognitive tests than those not taking these medications (14). Because inflammation is present in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease and epidemiologic evidence links use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) earlier in life to a lower risk for Alzheimer disease (15), some have questioned whether NSAIDs might prevent dementia. However, prospective studies to date have not shown a protective effect of NSAIDs, and they are not recommended for prevention of dementia (16). Significant epidemiologic evidence links mid-life estrogen use to a lower incidence of dementia later in life (17). However, in prospective prevention trials, including the large Women\'s Health Initiative Memory Study, use of estrogen plus progestin for prevention of dementia was associated with an increased incidence of dementia, as well as other medical complications (18). Clinical Bottom Line: Prevention Although there are few data to support specific measures to prevent dementia, clinicians should treat cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes, and encourage smoking cessation and regular exercise. They should also counsel patients about avoiding head injury and avoid prescribing medications that can alter cognitive function. Neither NSAIDs nor estrogen should be recommended for prevention of dementia. Screening Should clinicians screen for dementia? The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against widespread screening for dementia in elderly patients (19). However, many patients with dementia in the primary care setting, even those in more advanced stages of the disease, remain undiagnosed despite having routine general medical care (20). Moreover, patients referred to dementia specialists after ""screening"" have been diagnosed at an earlier stage of illness than those referred from physicians or families (21). Therefore, given the high prevalence of dementia and its associated morbidity, the clinician should consider secondary case-finding measures for dementia in elderly patients with unexplained functional decline, deterioration in hygiene, questionable adherence to medication regimens, or new-onset psychiatric symptoms. What methods should clinicians use when looking for dementia? When looking for dementia in elderly patients, clinicians should use a standardized screening instrument together with a brief history from the patient and a knowledgeable informant. The screening instrument should be easy to use, demonstrate high sensitivity, be widely available, and be supported by normative population data relevant to the patient. Two examples of such instruments are the Mini-Mental Status Examination (22) and the Mini-Cog (23). Clinical Bottom Line: Screening There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening asymptomatic people for dementia. However, clinicians should be alert for unexplained functional decline, deterioration in hygiene, questionable adherence to medication regimens, or new-onset psychiatric symptoms in elderly patients and use standardized instruments, such as the Mini-Mental Status Examination or the Mini-Cog, to look for cognitive dysfunction in such patients. Diagnosis What elements of the history are most important in evaluating patients with suspected dementia? Clinicians should use the patient\'s history to characterize the cognitive deficits, generate a differential diagnosis, and attempt to determine the cause of the dementia. This is best accomplished by identifying medical, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms that may be clues to the cause of the cognitive problems and detailing their order of appearance, severity, and associated features. In the case of cognitive difficulties, it is mandatory to try to obtain collateral information from a knowledgeable informant, because cognitive dysfunction can impair the patient\'s ability to serve as an accurate reporter. It is often easier to collect this information, as well as information about psychiatric symptoms, without the patient present. In taking the history, it is critical for clinicians to be knowledgeable about the differential diagnosis and natural history of the most common types of dementia (Table 1). For example, in classic Alzheimer disease, early symptoms are dominated by difficulties with short-term memory, subtle language and visuospatial perception difficulties, and changes in executive function with significant reductions in efficiency and organizational abilities of which the patient may or may not be aware. Symptoms begin insidiously and are slowly progressive. Overall level of alertness remains unimpaired. Patients or families may not label these difficulties as memory problems per se but may instead report multiple repetitions of questions or conversations with no recollection of previous discussions, increased forgetfulness manifested by losing objects or becoming confused while shopping, or simply overall increased disorganization and decreased efficiency. Symptoms are often first noticed or reported at the time of a life change, such as the death of a spouse or a move into a new residence. See the Box for clinical diagnostic criteria for definite and probable Alzheimer disease (24). Clinical Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease (AD) Definite AD: Clinical criteria for probable AD plus histopathology confirmation Probable AD: Dementia by clinical examination and standardized instrument (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination) Deficits in >2 areas of cognition Progressive cognitive decline Normal levels of consciousness Onset between age 40 and 90 years No other cause Supportive factors, including positive family history, cerebral atrophy on neuroimagining, normal electroencephalogram and lumbar puncture Table 1. Differential Diagnosis of Cognitive Difficulties Many elderly patients report minor cognitive problems, such as mild forgetfulness, difficulty remembering names, and mildly reduced concentration. In patients without dementia, these symptoms are typically sporadic, do not worsen significantly over time, are easily compensated for, and do not affect function. In contrast, in early dementia, the symptoms insidiously become established as a pattern, worsen over time, are difficult to compensate for, and eventually affect speech fluency and hamper the performance of routine activities, such as meal prepa', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 792, 'authors': [{'authorId': '8049385', 'name': 'D.

30,aa008b73649f7c708826e470788aec4db0c37724,Emotional and Physical Distress Relief Using a Novel Endorphinergic Formulation,"While the endogenous opioid system has generally been associated with regulation of pain, it also modulates the experience of distress and may play a central role in many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Decades of preclinical research on the analgesic effects of endogenous opioids, i.e., endorphins, suggests that opioid receptors have plastic bimodal (inhibitory/excitatory) properties that may explain conflicting findings in clinical research. An exploratory study with 60 healthy volunteer participants, using a cold pressor-induced pain paradigm, found evidence that a combination of a nutraceutical agent that enhances endorphin release (Endorphin Enhancer) with one that switches opioid receptors from an excitatory to inhibitory mode (Opioid Receptor Switcher) not only increases pain tolerance but also reduces emotional and physical distress. This discovery led to clinical application of a critically formulated endorphinergic treatment in 203 case studies over a two-year period. Findings revealed the remarkable clinical efficacy and safety of this treatment in the relief of chronic emotional and physical distress, including anxiety, anger, depression, cravings, and hyperalgesia, as well as enhancement of well-being, productivity, mental clarity, relationships, and an adaptive response to life’s stresses. These studies provide new insights into the role of endogenous opioid system imbalances in the development, treatment, and prevention of dysfunctional emotional and physical distress. We postulate that an Endorphinergic Distress Syndrome (EDS) consists of abnormal endorphin levels together with opioid receptors predominately in their excitatory mode. EDS may account for many core distress symptoms associated with chronic anxiety, addictions, pain, as well as affective personality, autism spectrum, attention-deficit, and distress-related medical problems. Our research has led to new endorphinergic formulations, combining Endorphin Enhancers, such as caffeine, with Opioid Receptor Switchers, such as n-acetylcysteine, for the relief of emotional and physical distress. Our studies also provide a novel method to reverse the anxiogenic effects of caffeine and related hyperexcitatory substances.",2013,53,2,"{'name': 'Journal of Behavioral and Brain Science', 'pages': '441-453', 'volume': '3'}",,"[{'authorId': '2071675367', 'name': 'S.

Many clinical distress symptoms show similarities to the excitatory autonomic withdrawal effects in chronic opioid-dependent animals and humans, as well as to the “quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome” evoked in naive rodents shortly after acute systemic injection of cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE) inhibitors. These symptoms result from excessive excitatory opioid receptor signaling and increased endorphin release. Pharmacologic analyses of the remarkably plastic bimodal (excitatory/inhibitory) signaling functions of opioid receptors have utilized microelectrode recordings from opioid-sensitive neurons in tissue cultures of mouse sensory ganglia and hot-water tail-flick assays in mice. These studies led to development of specific chemical formulations that switch opioid receptor signaling from an excessively excitatory to a normal inhibitory mode. Critical combinations of cAMP-PDE inhibitors that release endorphins plus specific agents that switch opioid receptors from excitatory Gs-coupled to inhibitory Gi/Go-coupled signaling were shown to attenuate hyperalgesia and distress evoked by diverse chemical stressors in mouse tail-flick assays. Both the “quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome” in naive rodents as well as the excitatory withdrawal effects in chronic, opioid-dependent animals and humans may be manifestations of a common Endorphinergic Distress Syndrome (EDS). We suggest that many distress symptoms are caused by EDS, a dysfunctional imbalance in the endogenous opioid system, consisting of abnormal endorphin levels, together with opioid receptors predominately in their excitatory mode. Therefore, concomitantly enhancing endogenous opioid release and switching excessive excitatory opioid receptor signaling to inhibitory signaling can attenuate these distress symptoms. Trials of a critically formulated oral preparation, containing both endorphin enhancers and opioid receptor switchers, have resulted in long-term anxiolytic efficacy and enhanced calm and mental clarity in large numbers of individuals with distress symptoms.

The effects of oxycodone (0, 5, and 20 mg/70 kg, orally) were compared, using a within-session cumulative dosing procedure, on the first and fifth days of the ‘daily’ dosing phase to assess for tolerance; active oxycodone was administered on the second and fourth days of the daily dosing phase. Changes in the effects of oxycodone were also compared when the medication was only administered on the first and the fifth day of a 5-day ‘intermittent’ dosing phase; placebo medication was administered on the second and fourth days of the intermittent dosing phase. A 9-day ‘washout’ period occurred between phases during which no medication was administered. Healthy volunteers (N=10) with no history of drug dependence or current drug use participated in this outpatient study. Analgesia was assessed using the cold pressor test, pain and drug effects were measured using a variety of questionnaires, and pupil diameter was monitored as an index of physiological effects. When administered daily, no differences were observed in oxycodone-induced analgesia between the first and the fifth days, but tolerance did develop to some of the positive subjective effects of oxycodone. In contrast, oxycodone-induced analgesia and participant ratings of some positive subjective drug effects were greater on the fifth compared with the first day of the intermittent dosing phase. No differences in the miotic effects of oxycodone between the first and the fifth days of either dosing phase were detected. Although obtained under limited experimental conditions, these findings suggest that tolerance may not develop to the analgesic effects of therapeutic doses of oxycodone under short-term daily dosing conditions, even though some of its subjective effects may decrease. These data also suggest that intermittent administration may enhance the analgesic effects of oxycodone, while also increasing some of the drug’s positive subjective effects related to abuse liability.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6398058', 'name': 'Z.

Other research suggests that children diagnosed with ASD can be classified into subpopulations based on various factors, including gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities and immune function. Methods This study analyzes parental report data collected using a 90-item online questionnaire from 387 parents or primary caregivers of children diagnosed with ASD on the efficacy of the GFCF diet. Parents reported on their child's GI symptoms, food allergy diagnoses, and suspected food sensitivities, as well as the degree and length of their diet implementation. Results Overall, diet efficacy among children whose parents reported the presence of GI symptoms, food allergy diagnoses, and suspected food sensitivities included greater improvement in ASD behaviors, physiological symptoms, and social behaviors compared with children whose parents reported none of these symptoms, diagnoses, or sensitivities (P < 0.05). Parental report of strict diet implementation, indicated by complete gluten/casein elimination and infrequent diet errors during and outside of parental care, also corresponded to improvement in ASD behaviors, physiological symptoms, and social behaviors (P < 0.05).

Alcohol, Legal Drug of Choice The brain is agnostic to the law and responds similarly to legal and illegal drugs of abuse. Like cocaine and amphetamine, alcohol causes release of endogenous opioids (the small peptides endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins) in the so-called reward centers of the brain. To start to understand what might cause some people to drink more than others, Mitchell et al. measured the endogenous opioids released by one drink in groups of light and heavy drinkers. The single drink was able to release more opioid in the reward centers of the heavy drinkers, suggesting that individual differences in this region might contribute to excessive drinking. The authors determined the release of transmitters deep within the brain indirectly by monitoring displacement of a radioactive μ opioid receptor agonist by PET scanning. The more opioid that was released, the lower the radioactive signal, as it was diluted in the area of the receptor. Alcohol triggered release in two brain areas, the orbitofrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens, both of which have been implicated in registering reward stimuli in rodents and humans. In addition to being larger in the heavy drinkers, the amount of ligand released in the orbitofrontal cortex was correlated with the subjects’ feelings of being intoxicated. From this relationship, the authors concluded that these endogenous opioids are closely tied to the effects of alcohol that could lead to abuse. People with orbitofrontal cortices or nucleus accumbens that are particularly responsive to alcohol—releasing large amounts of opioids—may get more pleasure out of each drink, possibly leading to more frequent consumption of this legal drug of abuse. Excessive consumption of alcohol is among the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. Although ethanol modulates a variety of molecular targets, including several neurotransmitter receptors, the neural mechanisms that underlie its rewarding actions and lead to excessive consumption are unknown. Studies in animals suggest that release of endogenous opioids by ethanol promotes further consumption. To examine this issue in humans and to determine where in the brain endogenous opioids act to promote alcohol consumption, we measured displacement of a radiolabeled μ opioid receptor agonist, [11C]carfentanil, before and immediately after alcohol consumption in both heavy drinkers and control subjects. Drinking alcohol induced opioid release in the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex, areas of the brain implicated in reward valuation. Opioid release in the orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens was significantly positively correlated. Furthermore, changes in orbitofrontal cortex binding correlated significantly with problem alcohol use and subjective high in heavy drinkers, suggesting that differences in endogenous opioid function in these regions contribute to excessive alcohol consumption. These results also suggest a possible mechanism by which opioid antagonists such as naltrexone act to treat alcohol abuse.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 205, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49121709', 'name': 'Jennifer M.

The authors investigated the role of the endogenous opioid system and mu-opioid receptors in emotion regulation in borderline personality disorder.\n\n\nMETHOD\nMu-opioid receptor availability in vivo (nondisplaceable binding potential, or BP(ND)) was measured with positron emission tomography and the selective radiotracer [(11)C]carfentanil during neutral and sustained sadness states in 18 unmedicated female patients with borderline personality disorder and 14 healthy female comparison subjects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients showed greater regional mu-opioid BP(ND) than did comparison subjects at baseline (neutral state) bilaterally in the orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, and nucleus accumbens and in the left amygdala, but lower BP(ND) in the posterior thalamus. Sadness induction was associated with greater reductions in BP(ND) (endogenous opioid system activation) in the patient group than in the comparison group in the pregenual anterior cingulate, left orbitofrontal cortex, left ventral pallidum, left amygdala, and left inferior temporal cortex. Patients showed evidence of endogenous opioid system deactivation in the left nucleus accumbens, the hypothalamus, and the right hippocampus/parahippocampus relative to comparison subjects. Correlations of baseline measures with the Dissociative Experiences Scale and endogenous opioid system activation with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDifferences exist between patients with borderline personality disorder and comparison subjects in baseline in vivo mu-opioid receptor concentrations and in the endogenous opioid system response to a negative emotional challenge that can be related to some of the clinical characteristics of patients with borderline personality disorder.

There is existing data that support the importance of β-endorphin neurotransmission in mediating depression. As for PTSD, however, the data is thus far circumstantial. The studies described herein used diverse techniques, such as biochemical measurements of β-endorphin in various brain sites and behavioral monitoring, in two animal models of depression and PTSD. We suggest that the pathways for stress-related psychiatric disorders, depression and PTSD, converge to a common pathway in which β-endorphin is a modulating element of distress.

Therapeutic trials with naltrexone].', 'abstract': 'The opioid hypothesis suggests that childhood autism may result from excessive brain opioid activity during neonatal period which may constitutionally inhibit social motivation, yielding autistic isolation and aloofness (Panksepp, 1979). This hypothesis has now received strong support and is currently based on three types of arguments: (1) similarity between autistic symptomatology and abnormal behaviors induced in young animals by injections of exogenous opioids, such as increasing social aloofness and decreasing social vocalization; (2) direct biochemical evidence of abnormalities of peripheral endogenous opioids being reported in autism and (3) therapeutic effects of the long lasting opioid receptor blocking agent naltrexone in autism. In this article, we give description of open and double-blind studies of naltrexone in autism. Naltrexone has been tested in several open studies. We performed an open trial with naltrexone in 2 autistic girls, displaying serious self-injurious behavior, reduced crying and a marked preference for salty and spicy foods, symptoms that could be related to a dysfunction of the opioid system. With dosages of 1 mg/kg/day, we observed an immediate reduction of hyperactivity, self-injurious behavior and aggressiveness, while attention improved. In addition, social behaviors, smiling, social seeking behaviors and play interactions increased (Leboyer, Bouvard et Dugas, 1988). Campbell et al.

He notes several different groups using narcotic drugs for differing reasons: “neurotic individuals” seeking relief from anxiety; “psychopaths” seeking a state of elation; “normal individuals” seeking relief from physical pain; and “psychotic individuals” seeking relief from depressive feelings. Since this paper is particularly concerned with this latter group, who seem to use narcotic drugs (in this case, methadone) in the self-treatment of various psychotic symptoms, it will be useful to review some of the relevant literature prior to and subsequent to our initial observations in 1973. Many of the earlier clinical observations on the antipsychotic actions of morphine and methadone have later been more firmly founded in pharmacologic theory with the discovery and investigation of the actions of endorphins. This will be briefly discussed later in this paper and is being more thoroughly discussed in other presentations at this conference. Wellisch et al. cite Nyswander’s writingS that opiates had been used in Europe to treat manic depressive psychosis and melancholia prior to the introduction of neuroleptic drugs. Others have provided anecdotal reports of similarly using morphine to attempt symptomatic control of severe psychotic symptoms in an age when the psychopharmacologic armamentarium of psychiatry contained only a few drugs, including opiates, barbiturates, and other sedatives such as chloral hydrate. These drugs were used to initially calm very disturbed patients but were not used in an ongoing manner to control psychotic symptoms. Wellisch et a1.2 report that in treating over 1500 patients in their drug detoxification section: “among these patients have been numerous individuals who were using heroin for its tranquilizing and ‘antipsychotic’ properties.” They cite Chein’s finding 6 of 22 out of 52 addicts studied were psychotic or borderline psychotic.

Equally, if the one­to­one model, typical of the tutor in a classic teaching situation, was initially seen as the reference, the class today is seen more and more not just as a more economical solution, but as a device offering advantages also from an educational point of view. Two further aspects have entered the pedagogical debate and are influencing the project design: a greater attention to the dialectic between teaching and learning, and to in­itinere regulation. Shulman (1987) and the movement promoted by him, teacher thinking, have highlighted the importance of teachers’ thought and have shown how teaching does not derive from learning in a deterministic way. On the other hand research in a Francophone context on practical analysis has underlined how many teachers’ decisions made in itinere cannot be defined during the project design, but may de­ pend on the evolution of the system and on the structural coupling (Varela, 1996; Begg, 2002; Proulx, 2008) between subject and environment, or rather, in the case of education, between teacher, student and class. What guidance can we draw from this for ITSs?

A study by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that, when compared to students from 70 countries, 15-year-olds from the United States averaged 15th in reading skills, 17th in science, and 25th, or below average, in mathematics (OECD 2010). The same report also shows the United States falling behind in student enrollment and graduation (Zeitvogel 2010). On the subject of higher education, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa’s Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses (2011) has garnered significant attention for arguing that most college students make little progress in higher order learning during their four-plus years in school. Many fear that America’s youth are not being adequately prepared for the needs of the new global economy and that they will be unable to compete with the innovations coming from China, India, and other foreign markets. Fingers have been pointed at many different factors in attempts to assign responsibility for these educational difficulties: a lack of funding from federal and state governments; mismanagement by school administrations; No Child Left Behind and high-stakes testing; ill-trained or entrenched teachers and teachers’ unions; the influence of new technology on student attitudes and learning abilities; a consumer mentality that views education as a commodity; a loss of traditional values in education; and the list goes on. According to long-time science educator and educational researcher Joseph D. Novak, the root of the problem is the lack of a unified theory of learning that serves as the basis for systematic reform of educational methodology. In this revised edition of his 1998 Learning, Creating, and Using Knowledge, Novak marshals a significant body of practical and theoretical research to support his concept of “meaningful learning” as a unified theory of education that can radically improve learning on all levels, from early childhood to corporate development. The improvements he seeks are not merely quantitative gains in test scores but qualitative changes in the ways humans construct, integrate, and apply knowledge in academic and business settings. While recognizing the challenges to widespread change, Novak is ultimately optimistic about the possibilities for a full-fledged revolution in learning that will empower individuals and companies to harness human creativity and improve the human condition. Novak bases his ideas on David Ausubel’s “Assimilation Learning” Theory, which holds that meaningful learning occurs when the learner negotiates between knowledge previously gained and newly acquired. This active engagement on the part of the learner results not in the rote memorization of facts but the construction and reconstruction of complex cognitive frameworks. By integrating information into a hierarchical structure that demonstrates the relationship between concepts, the learner develops a deeper understanding of knowledge; the process of learning accelerates as he or she can adapt these cognitive frames to incorporate additional information and new levels of complexity. In turn, the learner can apply his or her knowledge in more effective and more creative ways. For Novak, Ausubel’s theory provides a powerful foundation upon which to build a comprehensive theory of education. He expands Ausubel’s primarily cognitive focus to include', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 9, 'citationCount': 398, 'authors': [{'authorId': '14088276', 'name': 'R.

Such systems can be very sophisticated, including support for 3D avatars and speech analysis and synthesis. However, all of them present only a text area allowing the user to input her sentences. No doubt, an interaction involving also the natural language can increase the comfort of the user with respect to common interfaces using only graphical widgets. However, multi-modal communication must be preferred in all those situations when the user and the system have a tight interaction.

32,cfe5e45bc666ff03a17e1cc09807547393a6f2f5,Risk Factors and Prevention Strategies for Postoperative Opioid Abuse,"Worldwide, 80% of patients who undergo surgery receive opioid analgesics as the fundamental agent for pain relief. However, the irrational use of opioids leads to excessive drug dependence and drug abuse, resulting in an increased mortality rate and huge economic loss. The crisis of opioid overuse remains a great challenge. In this review, we summarize several key factors in opioid abuse, including race, region, income, genetic factors, age and gender, smoking and alcohol abuse, history of chronic pain and analgesic drug abuse, surgery, neuropsychiatric illness, depression and antidepressant use, human factors, national policies, hospital regulations, and health insurance under treatment of pain. Furthermore, we present several prevention strategies, such as perioperative measures, opioid substitutes, treatment of the primary illness, emotional regulation, use of opioid antagonists, efforts of the state, hospitals, doctors and pharmacy benefit managers, gene therapy, and vaccines. Greater understanding and better assessment are required of the risks associated with opioid abuse to ensure the safety and analgesic effects of pain treatment after surgery.",2019,131,45,"{'name': 'Pain Research & Management', 'volume': '2019'}",,"[{'authorId': '1937348581', 'name': 'Shuai Zhao'}, {'authorId': '1936934824', 'name': 'Fan Chen'}, {'authorId': '2063969567', 'name': 'Anqi Feng'}, {'authorId': '93773903', 'name': 'W.

However, opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADEs) are common and have been associated with worse patient outcomes. Objectives To examine the incidence of ORADEs in patients undergoing hospital-based surgical and endoscopic procedures and to evaluate the association of ORADEs with clinical and cost outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants In this retrospective study of clinical and administrative data, ORADEs were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes for known adverse effects of opioids or by opioid antagonist use. Multivariable regression analysis was used to measure the association of ORADEs with outcomes after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The setting was 21 acute care hospitals in a large integrated health care delivery system. Participants were 135 379 patients (aged ≥18 years, admitted from January 1, 2013, to September 30, 2015) who underwent surgical and endoscopic procedures and were given opioids. Exposure Opioid use, reported as morphine milligram equivalent doses. Main Outcomes and Measures Opioid-related adverse drug events and their association with inpatient mortality, discharge to another care facility, length of stay, cost of hospitalization, and 30-day readmission. Results Among 135 379 adult patients in this study (67.5% female), 14 386 (10.6%) experienced at least one ORADE. Patients with ORADEs were more likely to be older, of white race/ethnicity, and male and have more comorbidities. Patients with ORADEs received a higher total dose of opioids (median morphine milligram equivalent dose, 46.8 vs 30.0 mg; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and for a longer duration (median, 3.0 vs 2.0 days; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In adjusted analyses, ORADEs were associated with increased inpatient mortality (odds ratio [OR], 28.8; 95% CI, 24.0-34.5), greater likelihood of discharge to another care facility (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.7-3.0), prolonged length of stay (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.8-3.4), high cost of hospitalization (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.4-3.0), and higher rate of 30-day readmission (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4). ORADEs were associated with a 2.9% increase in absolute mortality, an $8225 increase in cost for the index hospitalization, and a 1.6-day increase in length of stay for the index hospitalization.

Design, Setting, and Participants This US national longitudinal study assesses a cohort of patients aged 18 to 64 years who were Medicaid beneficiaries and experienced nonfatal opioid overdoses. The Medicaid data set included the years 2001 through 2007. Death record information was obtained from the National Death Index. Data analysis occurred from October 2017 to January 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures Crude mortality rates per 100 000 person-years were determined in the first year after nonfatal opioid overdose. Standardized mortality rate ratios (SMR) were estimated for all-cause and selected cause-specific mortality standardized to the general population with respect to age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Results The primary cohort included 76 325 adults and 66 736 person-years of follow-up. During the first year after nonfatal opioid overdose, there were 5194 deaths, the crude death rate was 778.3 per 10 000 person-years, and the all-cause SMR was 24.2 (95% CI, 23.6-24.9). The most common immediate causes of death were substance use–associated diseases (26.2%), diseases of the circulatory system (13.2%), and cancer (10.3%). For every cause examined, SMRs were significantly elevated, especially with respect to drug use–associated diseases (SMR, 132.1; 95% CI, 125.6-140.0), HIV (SMR, 45.9; 95% CI, 39.5-53.0), chronic respiratory diseases (SMR, 41.1; 95% CI, 36.0-46.8), viral hepatitis (SMR, 30.6; 95% CI, 22.9-40.2), and suicide (SMR, 25.9; 95% CI, 22.6-29.6), particularly including suicide among females (SMR, 47.9; 95% CI, 39.8-52.3).

OBJECTIVES To examine the influence on morphine dose requirements and adverse events in the postoperative period of four SNP [opioid receptor mu1 (OPRM1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1) ex-21 and ex-26, catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT)] in candidate genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. DESIGN A single centre prospective study. SETTING University Hospital, Paris, France, from 2 January 2007 to 15 November 2011. PATIENTS A total of 438 white adults scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery (spine, hip and knee) under general anaesthesia. The main exclusion criteria were receiving opioids for chronic pain, nonopioid drugs within 2 days prior to surgery, pregnancy, renal insufficiency, sleep apnoea obstruction syndrome, morbid obesity, severe hepatic impairment, cognitive dysfunction. INTERVENTIONS Assays of plasma concentrations of morphine and metabolites (morphine 3-glucuronide and morphine 6-glucuronide) were performed and common polymorphisms in four candidate genes [OPRM1 A118G rs1799971; P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) T3435C (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582); COMT Val 158 Met (rs4680)] were analysed. Morphine was titrated by staff in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) and in the ward patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was used for 24\u200ah. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The dose of morphine required to achieve pain relief and the influence of SNP in genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and kinetics on morphine dose requirements. Secondary endpoints were the concentrations of morphine, morphine 6-glucuronide and morphine 3-gluguronide, the proportion of patients requiring a rescue analgesic and the proportion of morphine-related adverse events. RESULTS A total of 404 patients completed the study to final analysis. The mean\u200a±\u200aSD morphine dose to achieve pain relief was 15.8\u200a±\u200a8.8\u200amg in the PACU and 22.7\u200a±\u200a18.6\u200amg during patient-controlled intravenous administration. Morphine-related adverse events were observed in 37%. There was no relationship between any genetic polymorphisms and morphine dose, morphine 3-gluguronide and morphine 6-glucuronide concentration, morphine-related adverse events or pain level. In the PACU only, P-glycoprotein polymorphisms (ex-21; ex-26) were significantly associated with morphine concentration but the prediction of the model was poor (R2\u200a=\u200a0.04) CONCLUSION No major relationship has been demonstrated between SNP of OPRM1, ABCB1, COMT and morphine requirement, pain level or adverse effects in the postoperative period.

Objective To assess population-level PRO response after lumbar spine surgery, and develop/validate a prediction tool for PRO improvement. Design, Setting, and Participants This statewide multicenter cohort was based at 15 Washington state hospitals representing approximately 75% of the state’s spine fusion procedures. The Spine Surgical Care and Outcomes Assessment Program and the survey center at the Comparative Effectiveness Translational Network prospectively collected clinical and PRO data from adult candidates for lumbar surgery, preoperatively and postoperatively, between 2012 and 2016. Prediction models were derived for PRO improvement 1 year after lumbar fusion surgeries on a random sample of 85% of the data and were validated in the remaining 15%. Surgical candidates from 2012 through 2015 were included; follow-up surveying continued until December 31, 2016, and data analysis was completed from July 2016 to April 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures Functional improvement, defined as a reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score of 15 points or more; and back pain and leg pain improvement, defined a reduction in Numeric Rating Scale score of 2 points or more. Results A total of 1965 adult lumbar surgical candidates (mean [SD] age, 61.3 [12.5] years; 944 [59.6%] female) completed baseline surveys before surgery and at least 1 postoperative follow-up survey within 3 years. Of these, 1583 (80.6%) underwent elective lumbar fusion procedures; 1223 (77.3%) had stenosis, and 1033 (65.3%) had spondylolisthesis. Twelve-month follow-up participation rates for each outcome were between 66% and 70%. Improvements were reported in function, back pain, and leg pain at 12 months by 306 of 528 surgical patients (58.0%), 616 of 899 patients (68.5%), and 355 of 464 patients (76.5%), respectively, whose baseline scores indicated moderate to severe symptoms.

However, opioids have many non‐analgesic effects, including direct and indirect effects on cancer cells and on anti‐tumour immunity (NK cells, macrophages and T‐cells). Direct effects on immune cells are manifested via opioid and non‐opioid toll‐like receptors, whereas indirect effects are manifested via the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Opioids can also decrease/alter immune cell infiltration into the tumour micro‐environment. Animal models have shown that this is not a class effect, in that morphine and fentanyl suppress NK cell cytotoxicity; buprenorphine does not affect NK cell cytotoxicity, whereas tramadol increases NK cell cytotoxicity, reducing metastasis. In healthy individuals, morphine suppresses and fentanyl enhances NK cell cytotoxicity. In patients undergoing surgery, fentanyl decreased and tramadol increased NK cell cytotoxicity; clinical outcomes were not determined. Meta‐analyses of opioid‐sparing surgical studies report an association between improved recurrence‐free and/or overall survival with regional/neuraxial anaesthesia compared with systemic opioids. In patients receiving opioids for non‐surgical cancer‐related pain, morphine has variable effects on immunity; clinical outcomes were not assessed. Although there is a potential association between systemic opioid administration and shorter survival in cancer patients with a prognosis of months to years, studies have not been designed to primarily assess survival, as a consequence of which causality cannot be apportioned.

Methods: Total hip/knee arthroplasties (N = 512,393 and N = 1,028,069, respectively) from the Premier Perspective database (2006 to 2016) were included. Analgesic modes considered were opioids, peripheral nerve blocks, acetaminophen, steroids, gabapentin/pregabalin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, or ketamine. Groups were categorized into “opioids only” and 1, 2, or more than 2 additional modes.

The number of prescribers, opioid claims, beneficiaries, and days supplied as well as the type of opioid and geographic location of prescribers were extracted and analyzed. The top 1% of dermatologists prescribing opioids were identified and compared with a random sample of the same size among the remaining dermatologists based on sex, geographic location, type of practice, and time in practice. A systematic literature review was conducted to estimate the outcome of opioid prescribing practices on the exposed population. Main Outcome and Measures Practice characteristics, epidemiologic factors, and consequences of opioids prescribed by dermatologists. Results Of the 12 537 dermatologists in the study, 5305 (42.3%) prescribed no opioid claims, 5408 (43.1%) prescribed 1 to 10 opioid claims, and 1824 (14.5%) prescribed more than 10 opioid claims. Among dermatologists prescribing at least 10 opioid claims, a mean of 1.0 opioid claims was given to each beneficiary, with a supply lasting a mean of 4.4 days.

Conclusions Each refill and week of opioid prescription is associated with a large increase in opioid misuse among opioid naive patients. The data from this study suggest that duration of the prescription rather than dosage is more strongly associated with ultimate misuse in the early postsurgical period. The analysis quantifies the association of prescribing choices on opioid misuse and identifies levers for possible impact.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 434, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4083144', 'name': 'G.

The NIH reported that in 2015, 2.6 million Americans suffered from opioid use disorder (OUD), which caused US$78.5 billion in healthcare, law enforcement, and lost productivity costs for prescription opioids alone [1]. A 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that approximately 13 million Americans had misused opioids, including heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl, one or more times in the preceding year [2]. Most strikingly, the incidence of opioid‐related overdose deaths has quadrupled since 1999, with no signs of slowing. Currently, more than 90 Americans die each day from opioid overdose [3]. While the statistics are grim, an increasing commitment and more resources to develop new and efficient therapies for OUD gives hope for effectively combating the drug crisis. Earlier this year, the NIH launched a scientific initiative to combat OUD emphasizing three research areas: improvement of overdose‐reversal interventions; new treatments for opioid addiction; and alternative strategies to safely manage chronic pain [1].\n\nA promising approach for treating addiction is immunopharmacotherapy: vaccination against a drug of abuse to induce a tailored antibody response, which prevents the drug from entering the brain and eliciting its psychoactive effects. Vaccines against heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl addiction have already shown great success in preclinical evaluation, but have yet to enter clinical trials. This commentary discusses the clinical potential for opioid vaccines along with the experimental and societal aspects that have so far prevented the development of this approach.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on risk factors associated with the intensity of arthralgias in typical acute episodes of the disease. Although a number of studies have reported on risk factors associated with the development of the chronic stage of the disease, smoking habits have not been analyzed. Smoking is an interesting factor to consider since it is the main environmental risk factor for the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a similar disease to CHIKV in many aspects. In the present study, 140 patients infected with CHIKV were assessed for risk factors associated with severe arthralgia intensity in the acute phase (pain of 9/10 on the visual analog scale of 0-10) and moderate to severe intensity (according to the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3) 3.5 months after infection in patients that experienced the chronic phase of the disease. Women and smokers were 2- to 3-times more likely to experience severe pain in the acute and chronic stages. Likewise, the presence of severe arthralgia during the acute disease phase resulted in a 4-fold increased risk for entering the chronic phase. Smoking was a more important risk factor in males compared with females. Smoking resulted in a 20-fold increased risk for severe arthralgia during the acute phase in men, as well as a 10-fold increased risk for developing chronic disease with moderate-to-severe pain 3.5 months after the acute stage. The presence of rash, headache, muscular weakness or conjunctivitis in the acute phase, the presence of diabetes and age >40 years were considered significant risk factors due to their influence on illness progression. In conclusion, smoking and female sex were the main risk factors associated with development of severe joint pain in the acute and chronic phases of Chikungunya fever. These risk factors are similar to those associated with the development and severity of RA, possibly because the two diseases share pathophysiological mechanisms, including elevated interleukin-6 levels.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 19, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1391234449', 'name': 'I.

Overdose is now the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States (3). In 2015, the number of overdose deaths involving prescription or illicit opioids exceeded 33000, the highest number on record (2). Opioid overdose is frequently treated with naloxone in out-of-hospital settings by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel and laypersons. Although recommendations, guidelines, and protocols are available to inform use of naloxone in out-of-hospital settings, uncertainties exist with regard to the optimal dosing and route of administration and management after successful reversal of opioid overdose (46). A recent concern is whether current dosing guidelines are sufficient for reversing overdose involving highly potent synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and fentanyl analogues (2, 711). The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence on 1) the effects of route of administration and dosing of naloxone in persons with suspected opioid overdose in out-of-hospital settings on mortality, reversal of overdose symptoms, and harms, and 2) the need for transport to a health care facility after naloxone reversal. This review was conducted as part of a systematic review that was nominated to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Methods Detailed methods and data for this review, including the analytic framework, key questions, search strategies, inclusion criteria, study data extraction, and quality ratings, are available in the full report (12). The protocol was developed using a standardized process (13) with input from experts and the public and is registered in the PROSPERO database (14). The analytic framework used to guide this review is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Analytic framework. * Patients with confirmed or suspected opioid overdose who exhibit altered mental status, miosis, or respiratory distress and are treated in out-of-hospital settings by emergency medical services personnel. Administration of naloxone hydrochloride via intranasal, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection (including naloxone autoinjector). Question 1 addresses comparisons involving route of administration and dose. Question 2 addresses comparisons involving dose titration to varying degrees of return of consciousness (intermediate outcome). We addressed the following key questions: 1. For patients with confirmed or suspected opioid overdose, what are the comparative benefits and harms of out-of-hospital administration of naloxone using intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intranasal routes of administration? 1a. For patients with confirmed or suspected opioid overdose who receive naloxone in out-of-hospital settings, what are the comparative benefits and harms of different intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intranasal doses of naloxone? 2. For patients with confirmed or suspected opioid overdose in out-of-hospital settings, what are the comparative benefits and harms of titration of naloxone until the patient resumes sufficient spontaneous respiratory effort versus until the patient regains consciousness? 3. For patients with confirmed or suspected opioid overdose in out-of-hospital settings treated with multiple doses of naloxone (including those who do not improve after an initial dose of intranasal naloxone), what are the effects on benefits and harms of differences in the timing of repeated dosing? 4. For patients with confirmed or suspected opioid overdose in out-of-hospital settings who regain sufficient spontaneous respiratory effort and are alert and oriented after naloxone administration, what are the benefits and harms of transport to a health care facility versus nontransport? Data Sources and Searches A research librarian searched multiple electronic databases, including Ovid MEDLINE (1946 through September 2017), PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL. We also reviewed reference lists, searched ClinicalTrials.gov (through September 2017), contacted representatives of federal agencies involved in naloxone or opioid overdose research, reviewed medical and statistical reviews on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Web site, and reviewed materials presented at a recent FDA meeting (15) on naloxone dosing (1621). Study Selection Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles against prespecified eligibility criteria. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing different routes of administration, doses, or dosing strategies for naloxone and studies on the effects of transport or nontransport after successful reversal of opioid overdose with naloxone in out-of-hospital settings. Naloxone could be administered by EMS personnel, other health care providers, or laypersons. We also included studies on dosing and routes of administration in emergency department (ED) settings. We included uncontrolled longitudinal studies of patients who were successfully treated for opioid overdose with naloxone in the field and were not transported to a health care facility; this was a protocol modification due to no controlled studies of transport versus nontransport. Outcomes were mortality, reversal of overdose symptoms (based on adequate spontaneous respiratory effort or level of consciousness), time to reversal of symptoms, recurrence of symptoms, cardiac or respiratory arrest, other clinical sequelae of overdose (such as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema), function, quality of life, health care use, and harms (such as drug withdrawal, combativeness, or injury to the person administering naloxone). For key question 4, additional outcomes were rates of linkage to treatment for opioid use disorder and subsequent opioid overdoses. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment One investigator extracted details about the design, year, setting, country, sample size, eligibility criteria, population and clinical characteristics, intervention characteristics (route of administration, dose or concentration, time to initial and repeated dosing, and training and background of personnel administering the drug), funding source, and results. A second investigator verified extractions for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed risk of bias for each study as low, moderate, or high using criteria adapted from the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews (13) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (22). Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Data Synthesis and Analysis We constructed evidence tables with study characteristics, results, and risk-of-bias ratings for all included studies and summary tables to highlight the main findings. Given the small number of studies for each key question and clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the studies, we determined that meta-analysis was not indicated and synthesized studies qualitatively. We graded the strength of evidence (SOE) for each key question and comparison for prioritized clinical outcomes (mortality, time to reversal of symptoms, recurrence of symptoms, respiratory or cardiac arrest, rates and severity of drug withdrawal, and combativeness) using the approach described in the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews (13). One investigator performed initial SOE assessments, and final ratings were determined by consensus among the entire team. Role of the Funding Source This project was funded under contract no. HHSA290-2015-00009-I from the AHRQ, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Staff from the AHRQ assisted in developing the scope and key questions. A representative from the AHRQ served as a Contracting Officer's Technical Representative and provided technical assistance during the conduct of the full evidence report and comments on draft versions of the report. The AHRQ did not directly participate in the literature search, determination of study eligibility criteria, data analysis, or interpretation. Results Literature Searches The literature flow diagram (Figure 2) summarizes the search and selection of articles. Database searches resulted in 1934 potentially relevant articles. After dual review of abstracts and titles, we selected 200 articles for full-text dual review and determined that 13 studies met inclusion criteria (Appendix Tables 1, 2, and 3) (2335). No study reported funding from manufacturers of naloxone. Figure 2. Evidence search and selection. * Other sources include prior reports, reference lists, referrals from experts, and gray literature.

Objective To determine the effect of perioperative gabapentin on remote postoperative time to pain resolution and opioid cessation. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of perioperative gabapentin was conducted at a single-center, tertiary referral teaching hospital. A total of 1805 patients aged 18 to 75 years scheduled for surgery (thoracotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, total hip replacement, total knee replacement, mastectomy, breast lumpectomy, hand surgery, carpal tunnel surgery, knee arthroscopy, shoulder arthroplasty, and shoulder arthroscopy) were screened. Participants were enrolled from May 25, 2010, to July 25, 2014, and followed up for 2 years postoperatively. Intention-to-treat analysis was used in evaluation of the findings. Interventions Gabapentin, 1200 mg, preoperatively and 600 mg, 3 times a day postoperatively or active placebo (lorazepam, 0.5 mg) preoperatively followed by inactive placebo postoperatively for 72 hours. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was time to pain resolution (5 consecutive reports of 0 of 10 possible levels of average pain at the surgical site on the numeric rating scale of pain). Secondary outcomes were time to opioid cessation (5 consecutive reports of no opioid use) and the proportion of participants with continued pain or opioid use at 6 months and 1 year. Results Of 1805 patients screened for enrollment, 1383 were excluded, including 926 who did not meet inclusion criteria and 273 who declined to participate. Overall, 8% of patients randomized were lost to follow-up. A total of 202 patients were randomized to active placebo and 208 patients were randomized to gabapentin in the intention-to-treat analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.7 [11.7] years; 256 (62.4%) women and 154 (37.6%) men). Baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Perioperative gabapentin did not affect time to pain cessation (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82-1.33; P\u2009=\u2009.73) in the intention-to-treat analysis. However, participants receiving gabapentin had a 24% increase in the rate of opioid cessation after surgery (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.54; P\u2009=\u2009.05). No significant differences were noted in the number of adverse events as well as the rate of medication discontinuation due to sedation or dizziness (placebo, 42 of 202 [20.8%]; gabapentin, 52 of 208 [25.0%]). Conclusions and Relevance Perioperative administration of gabapentin had no effect on postoperative pain resolution, but it had a modest effect on promoting opioid cessation after surgery. The routine use of perioperative gabapentin may be warranted to promote opioid cessation and prevent chronic opioid use. Optimal dosing and timing of perioperative gabapentin in the context of specific operations to decrease opioid use should be addressed in further research.

Roughly half of these deaths are attributable to prescription opioids. Federal and state governments have only recently begun to grasp the magnitude of this public health crisis. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released their Guidelines for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. While not comprehensive in scope, these guidelines attempt to control and regulate opioid prescribing. Other federal agencies involved with the federal regulatory effort include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and the Department of Justice. Each federal agency has a unique role in helping to stem the burgeoning opioid misuse epidemic. The DEA, working with the Department of Justice, has enforcement power to prosecute pill mills and physicians for illegal prescribing. The DEA could also implement use of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), currently administered at the state level, and use of electronic prescribing for schedule II and III medications. The FDA has authority to approve new and safer formulations of immediate- and long-acting opioid medications. More importantly, the FDA can also ask pharmaceutical companies to cease manufacturing a drug. Additionally, state agencies play a critical role in reducing overdose deaths, protecting the public safety, and promoting the medically appropriate treatment of pain. One of the states’ primary roles is the regulation of practice of medicine and the insurance industry within their borders. Utilizing this authority, states can both educate physicians about the dangers of opioids and make physician licensure dependent on registering and using PDMPs when prescribing controlled substances. Almost every state has implemented a PDMP to some degree; however, in addition to mandating their use, increased interstate sharing of prescription information would greatly improve PDMPs’ effectiveness. Further, states have the flexibility to promote innovative interventions to reduce harm such as legislation allowing naloxone access without a prescription. While relatively new, these types of laws have allowed first responders, patients, and families access to a lifesaving drug. Finally, states are at the forefront of litigation against pharmaceutical manufacturers. This approach is described as analogous to the initial steps in fighting tobacco companies.

Despite increased utilisation of opioids, the safety and efficacy of long-term use of these compounds for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) remains controversial. This overview of Cochrane Reviews complements the overview entitled 'High-dose opioids for chronic non-cancer pain: an overview of Cochrane Reviews'.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo provide an overview of the occurrence and nature of adverse events associated with any opioid agent (any dose, frequency, or route of administration) used on a medium- or long-term basis for the treatment of CNCP in adults.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane Library) Issue 3, 2017 on 8 March 2017 to identify all Cochrane Reviews of studies of medium- or long-term opioid use (2 weeks or more) for CNCP in adults aged 18 and over. We assessed the quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR criteria (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) as adapted for Cochrane Overviews. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the outcomes using the GRADE framework.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included a total of 16 reviews in our overview, of which 14 presented unique quantitative data. These 14 Cochrane Reviews investigated 14 different opioid agents that were administered for time periods of two weeks or longer. The longest study was 13 months in duration, with most in the 6- to 16-week range. The quality of the included reviews was high using AMSTAR criteria, with 11 reviews meeting all 10 criteria, and 5 of the reviews meeting 9 out of 10, not scoring a point for either duplicate study selection and data extraction, or searching for articles irrespective of language and publication type. The quality of the evidence for the generic adverse event outcomes according to GRADE ranged from very low to moderate, with risk of bias and imprecision being identified for the following generic adverse event outcomes: any adverse event, any serious adverse event, and withdrawals due to adverse events. A GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence for specific adverse events led to a downgrading to very low- to moderate-quality evidence due to risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision.We calculated the equivalent milligrams of morphine per 24 hours for each opioid studied (buprenorphine, codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, levorphanol, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tapentadol, tilidine, and tramadol). In the 14 Cochrane Reviews providing unique quantitative data, there were 61 studies with a total of 18,679 randomised participants; 12 of these studies had a cross-over design with two to four arms and a total of 796 participants. Based on the 14 selected Cochrane Reviews, there was a significantly increased risk of experiencing any adverse event with opioids compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.66) as well as with opioids compared to a non-opioid active pharmacological comparator, with a similar risk ratio (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33). There was also a significantly increased risk of experiencing a serious adverse event with opioids compared to placebo (RR 2.75, 95% CI 2.06 to 3.67). Furthermore, we found significantly increased risk ratios with opioids compared to placebo for a number of specific adverse events: constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, hot flushes, increased sweating, nausea, pruritus, and vomiting.There was no data on any of the following prespecified adverse events of interest in any of the included reviews in this overview of Cochrane Reviews: addiction, cognitive dysfunction, depressive symptoms or mood disturbances, hypogonadism or other endocrine dysfunction, respiratory depression, sexual dysfunction, and sleep apnoea or sleep-disordered breathing. We found no data for adverse events analysed by sex or ethnicity.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nA number of adverse events, including serious adverse events, are associated with the medium- and long-term use of opioids for CNCP. The absolute event rate for any adverse event with opioids in trials using a placebo as comparison was 78%, with an absolute event rate of 7.5% for any serious adverse event. Based on the adverse events identified, clinically relevant benefit would need to be clearly demonstrated before long-term use could be considered in people with CNCP in clinical practice. A number of adverse events that we would have expected to occur with opioid use were not reported in the included Cochrane Reviews. Going forward, we recommend more rigorous identification and reporting of all adverse events in randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews on opioid therapy. The absence of data for many adverse events represents a serious limitation of the evidence on opioids. We also recommend extending study follow-up, as a latency of onset may exist for some adverse events."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 84, 'citationCount': 213, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6160524', 'name': 'C.

Some 6% to 8% of opioid-naïve patients undergoing noncancer procedures develop new persistent opioid use; however, it is unknown if a similar risk applies to patients with cancer. We sought to define the risk of new persistent opioid use after curative-intent surgery, identify risk factors, and describe changes in daily opioid dose over time after surgery. Methods Using a national data set of insurance claims, we identified patients with cancer undergoing curative-intent surgery from 2010 to 2014. We included melanoma, breast, colorectal, lung, esophageal, and hepato-pancreato-biliary/gastric cancer. Primary outcomes were new persistent opioid use (opioid-naïve patients who continued filling opioid prescriptions 90 to 180 days after surgery) and daily opioid dose (evaluated monthly during the year after surgery). Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for new persistent opioid use. Results A total of 68,463 eligible patients underwent curative-intent surgery and filled opioid prescriptions. Among opioid-naïve patients, the risk of new persistent opioid use was 10.4% (95% CI, 10.1% to 10.7%). One year after surgery, these patients continued filling prescriptions with daily doses similar to chronic opioid users ( P = .05), equivalent to six tablets per day of 5-mg hydrocodone. Those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy had modestly higher doses ( P = .002), but patients with no chemotherapy still had doses equivalent to five tablets per day of 5-mg hydrocodone. Across different procedures, the covariate-adjusted risk of new persistent opioid use in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was 15% to 21%, compared with 7% to 11% for those with no chemotherapy. Conclusion New persistent opioid use is a common iatrogenic complication in patients with cancer undergoing curative-intent surgery. This problem requires changes to prescribing guidelines and patient counseling during the surveillance and survivorship phases of care.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 263, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40033166', 'name': 'J.

Although gabapentin is widely perceived as safe, drug-induced respiratory depression has been described when gabapentin is used alone or in combination with other medications. Because gabapentin and opioids are both commonly prescribed for pain, the likelihood of co-prescription is high. However, no published studies have examined whether concomitant gabapentin therapy is associated with an increased risk of accidental opioid-related death in patients receiving opioids. The objective of this study was to investigate whether co-prescription of opioids and gabapentin is associated with an increased risk of accidental opioid-related mortality. Methods and findings We conducted a population-based nested case–control study among opioid users who were residents of Ontario, Canada, between August 1, 1997, and December 31, 2013, using administrative databases. Cases, defined as opioid users who died of an opioid-related cause, were matched with up to 4 controls who also used opioids on age, sex, year of index date, history of chronic kidney disease, and a disease risk index. After matching, we included 1,256 cases and 4,619 controls. The primary exposure was concomitant gabapentin use in the 120 days preceding the index date. A secondary analysis characterized gabapentin dose as low (<900 mg daily), moderate (900 to 1,799 mg daily), or high (≥1,800 mg daily). A sensitivity analysis examined the effect of concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in the preceding 120 days. Overall, 12.3% of cases (155 of 1,256) and 6.8% of controls (313 of 4,619) were prescribed gabapentin in the prior 120 days. After multivariable adjustment, co-prescription of opioids and gabapentin was associated with a significantly increased odds of opioid-related death (odds ratio [OR] 1.99, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.47, p < 0.001; adjusted OR [aOR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.88, p < 0.001) compared to opioid prescription alone. In the dose–response analysis, moderate-dose (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.87, p < 0.001; aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.28, p = 0.024) and high-dose (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.08, p < 0.001; aOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.27, p = 0.015) gabapentin use was associated with a nearly 60% increase in the odds of opioid-related death relative to no concomitant gabapentin use. As expected, we found no significant association between co-prescription of opioids and NSAIDs and opioid-related death (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27, p = 0.113; aOR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.32, p = 0.083). In an exploratory analysis of patients at risk of combined opioid and gabapentin use, we found that 46.0% (45,173 of 98,288) of gabapentin users in calendar year 2013 received at least 1 concomitant prescription for an opioid. This study was limited to individuals eligible for public drug coverage in Ontario, we were only able to identify prescriptions reimbursed by the government and dispensed from retail pharmacies, and information on indication for gabapentin use was not available. Furthermore, as with all observational studies, confounding due to unmeasured variables is a potential source of bias. Conclusions In this study we found that among patients receiving prescription opioids, concomitant treatment with gabapentin was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of opioid-related death. Clinicians should consider carefully whether to continue prescribing this combination of products and, when the combination is deemed necessary, should closely monitor their patients and adjust opioid dose accordingly.

Trauma patients represent a population that may be affected by this regulation, as the incidence of pain at hospital discharge is greater than 95%, and opioids are considered the first line of treatment for pain management. However, the use of opioid prescriptions in trauma patients at hospital discharge has not been explored. Objective To study the incidence and predictors of opioid prescription in trauma patients at discharge in a large national cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of adult (18-64 years), opioid-naive trauma patients who were beneficiaries of Military Health Insurance (military personnel and their dependents) treated at both military health care facilities and civilian trauma centers and hospitals between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2013, was conducted. Patients with burns, foreign body injury, toxic effects, or late complications of trauma were excluded. Prior diagnosis of trauma within 1 year and in-hospital death were also grounds for exclusion. Injury mechanism and severity, comorbid conditions, mental health disorders, and demographic factors were considered covariates. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s list of scheduled narcotics was used to query opioid use. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of opioid prescription. Data analysis was performed from June 7 to August 21, 2016. Exposures Injury mechanism and severity, comorbid conditions, mental health disorders, and demographic factors. Main Outcomes and Measures Prescription of opioid analgesics at discharge. Results Among the 33 762 patients included in the study (26 997 [80.0%] men; mean [SD] age, 32.9 [13.3] years), 18 338 (54.3%) received an opioid prescription at discharge. In risk-adjusted models, older age (45-64 vs 18-24 years: odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13-1.44), marriage (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.20-1.34), and higher Injury Severity Score (≥9 vs <9: OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.32-1.48) were associated with a higher likelihood of opioid prescription at discharge. Male sex (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.83) and anxiety (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.93) were associated with a decreased likelihood of opioid prescription at discharge.

Postoperative pain is not adequately managed in greater than 80% of patients in the US, although rates vary depending on such factors as type of surgery performed, analgesic/anesthetic intervention used, and time elapsed after surgery. Poorly controlled acute postoperative pain is associated with increased morbidity, functional and quality-of-life impairment, delayed recovery time, prolonged duration of opioid use, and higher health-care costs. In addition, the presence and intensity of acute pain during or after surgery is predictive of the development of chronic pain. More effective analgesic/anesthetic measures in the perioperative period are needed to prevent the progression to persistent pain. Although clinical findings are inconsistent, some studies of local anesthetics and nonopioid analgesics have suggested potential benefits as preventive interventions. Conventional opioids remain the standard of care for the management of acute postoperative pain; however, the risk of opioid-related adverse events can limit optimal dosing for analgesia, leading to poorly controlled acute postoperative pain. Several new opioids have been developed that modulate μ-receptor activity by selectively engaging intracellular pathways associated with analgesia and not those associated with adverse events, creating a wider therapeutic window than unselective conventional opioids. In clinical studies, oliceridine (TRV130), a novel μ-receptor G-protein pathway-selective modulator, produced rapid postoperative analgesia with reduced prevalence of adverse events versus morphine.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 153, 'citationCount': 665, 'authors': [{'authorId': '78425017', 'name': 'T.

However, its benefits in clinical practice are not demonstrated. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the impact of intraoperative pupillometry monitoring on perioperative opioid consumption in major gynecologic surgery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAfter receiving ethics committee approval and written consent of patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists status I to II women undergoing gynecologic surgery were included in this single-blinded, prospective, parallel-arm randomized study. General anesthesia was standardized with propofol-remifentanil target-controlled infusion. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. In the pupillometry group, remifentanil administration was guided by pupillary diameter changes. In the standard group, remifentanil administration was left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist. The primary outcome was intraoperative remifentanil consumption.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-five patients were analyzed. Remifentanil consumption was markedly decreased in the pupillometry group (3.8 [3.4 to 4.8 µg · kg · h] vs. 7.9 µg · kg · h [6.5 to 9.0 µg · kg · h] in the standard group; difference = 4.2 µg · kg · h [95% CI, 3.0 to 5.3 µg · kg · h]; P < 0.001).

This article briefly reviews the known psychological risk and protective factors associated with the development of chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). We begin with a definition of CPSP and then explain what we mean by a risk/protective factor. Next, we summarize known psychological risk and protective factors for CPSP. Psychological interventions that target risk factors and may impact postsurgical pain are reviewed, including the acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)-based approach to CPSP prevention and management we use in the Transitional Pain Service (TPS) at the Toronto General Hospital. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for research in risk factor identification and psychological interventions to prevent CPSP. Several pre-surgical psychological risk factors for CPSP have been consistently identified in recent years. These include negative affective constructs, such as anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing and general psychological distress. In contrast, relatively few studies have examined psychological protective factors for CPSP. Psychological interventions that target known psychological risk factors while enhancing protective psychological factors may reduce new incidence of CPSP. The primary goal of our ACT intervention is to teach patients a mindful way of responding to their postsurgical pain that empowers them to interrupt the negative cycle of pain, distress, behavioural avoidance and escalating opioid use that can limit functioning and quality of life while paradoxically amplifying pain over time. Early clinical outcome data suggest that patients who receive care from TPS physicians reduce their pain and opioid use, yet patients who also receive our ACT intervention have a larger decrease in daily opioid dose while reporting less pain interference and lower depression scores.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 75, 'citationCount': 88, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31988793', 'name': 'A.

The goal of this article was to outline important components of opioid-sparing analgesic regimens. Observations Regional analgesia, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, gabapentinoids, tramadol, lidocaine, and/or the N-methyl-D-aspartate class of glutamate receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective adjuncts to narcotic analgesia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are not associated with an increase in postoperative bleeding. A meta-analysis of 27 randomized clinical trials found no difference in postoperative bleeding between the groups taking ketorolac tromethamine (33 of 1304 patients [2.5%]) and the control groups (21 of 1010 [2.1%]) (odds ratio [OR],\u20091.1; 95% CI,\u20090.61-2.06; P\u2009=\u2009.72). After adoption of the multimodal analgesia approach for a colorectal ERAS pathway, most patients used less opioids while in the hospital and many did not need opioids after hospital discharge, although approximately 50% of patients received some opioid during their stay.

Neuropathic pain frequently leads to decisions about using long-term opioid therapy. Understanding the association of long-term opioid use with functional status, adverse outcomes, and mortality among patients with polyneuropathy could influence disease-specific decisions about opioid treatment. Objectives To quantify the prevalence of long-term opioid use among patients with polyneuropathy and to assess the association of long-term opioid use with functional status, adverse outcomes, and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted of prescriptions given to patients with polyneuropathy and to controls in ambulatory practice between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010, to determine exposure to long-term opioid use as well as other outcomes. The latest follow-up was conducted through November 25, 2016. Exposures Long-term opioid therapy, defined by 1 or multiple consecutive opioid prescriptions resulting in 90 continuous days or more of opioid use. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of long-term opioid therapy among patients with polyneuropathy and controls. Patient-reported functional status, documented adverse outcomes, and mortality were compared between patients with polyneuropathy receiving long-term opioid therapy (≥90 days) and patients with polyneuropathy receiving shorter durations of opioid therapy. Results Among the 2892 patients with polyneuropathy (1364 women and 1528 men; mean [SD] age, 67.5 [16.6] years) and the 14 435 controls (6827 women and 7608 men; mean [SD] age, 67.5 [16.5] years), patients with polyneuropathy received long-term opioids more often than did controls (545 [18.8%] vs 780 [5.4%]). Patients with polyneuropathy who were receiving long-term opioids had multiple functional status markers that were modestly poorer even after adjusting for medical comorbidity, including increased reliance on gait aids (adjusted odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6); no functional status markers were improved by long-term use of opioids. Adverse outcomes were more common among patients with polyneuropathy receiving long-term opioids, including depression (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.29-1.82), opioid dependence (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.54-5.47), and opioid overdose (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.12; 95% CI, 1.63-19.62). Conclusions and Relevance Polyneuropathy increased the likelihood of long-term opioid therapy. Chronic pain itself cannot be ruled out as a source of worsened functional status among patients receiving long-term opioid therapy. However, long-term opioid therapy did not improve functional status but rather was associated with a higher risk of subsequent opioid dependency and overdose.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 82, 'authors': [{'authorId': '12698688', 'name': 'E.

Objective To determine the incidence of new persistent opioid use after minor and major surgical procedures. Design, Setting, and Participants Using a nationwide insurance claims data set from 2013 to 2014, we identified US adults aged 18 to 64 years without opioid use in the year prior to surgery (ie, no opioid prescription fulfillments from 12 months to 1 month prior to the procedure). For patients filling a perioperative opioid prescription, we calculated the incidence of persistent opioid use for more than 90 days among opioid-naive patients after both minor surgical procedures (ie, varicose vein removal, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, thyroidectomy, transurethral prostate surgery, parathyroidectomy, and carpal tunnel) and major surgical procedures (ie, ventral incisional hernia repair, colectomy, reflux surgery, bariatric surgery, and hysterectomy). We then assessed data for patient-level predictors of persistent opioid use. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was defined a priori prior to data extraction. The primary outcome was new persistent opioid use, which was defined as an opioid prescription fulfillment between 90 and 180 days after the surgical procedure. Results A total of 36\u2009177 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 29\u2009068 (80.3%) receiving minor surgical procedures and 7109 (19.7%) receiving major procedures. The cohort had a mean (SD) age of 44.6 (11.9) years and was predominately female (23\u2009913 [66.1%]) and white (26\u2009091 [72.1%]). The rates of new persistent opioid use were similar between the 2 groups, ranging from 5.9% to 6.5%. By comparison, the incidence in the nonoperative control cohort was only 0.4%. Risk factors independently associated with new persistent opioid use included preoperative tobacco use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.35; 95% CI, 1.21-1.49), alcohol and substance abuse disorders (aOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05-1.72), mood disorders (aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.30), anxiety (aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.42), and preoperative pain disorders (back pain: aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.42-1.75; neck pain: aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.07-1.39; arthritis: aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.40-1.73; and centralized pain: aOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54). Conclusions and Relevance New persistent opioid use after surgery is common and is not significantly different between minor and major surgical procedures but rather associated with behavioral and pain disorders. This suggests its use is not due to surgical pain but addressable patient-level predictors. New persistent opioid use represents a common but previously underappreciated surgical complication that warrants increased awareness.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 1438, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3666286', 'name': 'C.

Patients and methods By retrieving the medical records from January 2013 to December 2016, 221 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified as having PLBP if numeric rating scale (NRS) scores were >50 at all postoperative follow-up time points (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). According to the occurrence of PLBP, patients were divided into two groups: PLBP group and non (N)-PLBP group. To investigate risk values for PLBP, the following three categorized factors were analyzed statistically. Patient characteristics: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), preoperative low back pain, comorbidity, smoking, and drinking. Surgical variables: surgical strategy, surgical segment, the number of fusion levels, surgery time, blood loss, and size of incision. Radiographic parameters: preoperative lumbar lordosis (LL), correction of LL at immediate postoperation, Modic changes, and preoperative paraspinal muscle degeneration. Results PLBP was detected in 16 patients and were enrolled into the PLBP group. There was no difference between the two groups in age, gender, BMI, comorbidity, smoking, and drinking. The preoperative low back pain was more severe in the PLBP group than that in the N-PLBP group. There was no difference in surgery time, blood loss, surgical strategy, number of fusion levels, and the size of incision. Surgery segment at L5–S1 was more prevalent in the PLBP group than that in the N-PLBP group, and there was no difference in preoperative LL, correction of LL, preoperative lumbar mobility, and Modic changes. The fatty infiltration rate (FIR) was larger in the PLBP group than that in the N-PLBP group. Multivariate logistic regression model revealed that preoperative low back pain (NRS > 35), surgery segment at L5–S1, and FIR > 15% were independently associated with PLBP.

Methods: Thoracic surgery patients were enrolled 1 week before surgery and followed up 6 months postsurgery in this prospective, observational study. Comprehensive psychosocial measurements were assessed before surgery. The presence and severity of pain were assessed at 3 and 6 months after surgery. One hundred seven patients were assessed during the first 3 days after surgery, and 99 (30 thoracotomy and 69 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, thoracoscopy) patients completed the 6-month follow-up. Patients with versus without chronic pain related to thoracic surgery at 6 months were compared. Results: Both incidence (P = 0.37) and severity (P = 0.97) of surgery-related chronic pain at 6 months were similar after thoracotomy (33%; 95% CI, 17 to 53%; 3.3\u2009±\u20092.1) and thoracoscopy (25%; 95% CI, 15 to 36%; 3.3\u2009±\u20091.7). Both frequentist and Bayesian multivariate models revealed that the severity of acute pain (numerical rating scale, 0 to 10) is the measure associated with chronic pain related to thoracic surgery.

Methods Patients ≥ 18 years old with cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2, who had been receiving a stable regimen of opioid analgesics for ≥ 2 weeks, had at least one constipation symptom despite laxative use, and no more than five spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) during the past 14 days, were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to oral, once-daily naldemedine 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg, or placebo, for 14 days. The primary end point was change in SBM frequency per week from baseline during the treatment period. Secondary end points included SBM responder rates, change from baseline in the frequency of SBM without straining, and complete SBM. Safety was also assessed. Results Of 227 patients who were randomly assigned, 225 were assessed for efficacy (naldemedine 0.1 mg, n = 55; 0.2 mg, n = 58; 0.4 mg, n = 56; placebo, n = 56) and 226 for safety. Change in SBM frequency (primary end point) was higher with all naldemedine doses versus placebo ( P < .05 for all comparisons), as were SBM responder rates and change in complete SBM frequency.

Summary of Background Data: In 2000, the Joint Commission recommended making pain the 5th vital sign, increasing the focus on postoperative pain control. However, the benefits of pain management must be weighed against the potentially lethal risk of opioid OD. Methods: This is a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study of patients undergoing 1 of 6 major elective inpatient operation from 2002 to 2011 using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, an approximately 20% representative sample of all United States hospital admissions. Patients with postoperative OD were identified using ICD-9 codes for poisoning from opioids or adverse effects from opioids. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors. Results: Among 11,317,958 patients, 9458 (0.1%) had a postoperative OD; this frequency doubled over the study period from 0.6 to 1.1 overdoses per 1000 cases. Patients with postoperative OD died more frequently during their hospitalization (1.7% vs 0.4%, P < 0.001). Substance abuse history was the strongest predictor of OD (odds ratio = 14.8; 95% confidence interval: 12.7–17.2). Gender, age, income, geographic location, operation type, and certain comorbid diseases also predicted OD (P < 0.05). Hospital variables, including teaching status, size, and urban/rural location, did not predict postoperative OD.

Design Retrospective analysis of claims data, 2001-13. Setting Administrative health claims database. Participants 315\u2009428 privately insured people aged 18-64 who were continuously enrolled in a health plan with medical and pharmacy benefits during the study period and who also filled at least one prescription for an opioid. Interventions Concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use, defined as an overlap of at least one day in the time periods covered by prescriptions for each drug. Main outcome measures Annual percentage of opioid users with concurrent benzodiazepine use; annual incidence of visits to emergency room and inpatient admissions for opioid overdose. Results 9% of opioid users also used a benzodiazepine in 2001, increasing to 17% in 2013 (80% relative increase). This increase was driven mainly by increases among intermittent, as opposed to chronic, opioid users. Compared with opioid users who did not use benzodiazepines, concurrent use of both drugs was associated with an increased risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission for opioid overdose (adjusted odds ratio 2.14, 95% confidence interval 2.05 to 2.24; P<0.001) among all opioid users.

We explored the risk of overdose in young children of women prescribed opioids as opposed with non-opioid analgesics. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Over the past 20 years, the prescribing of opioids has increased dramatically in North America, with parallel increases in opioid addiction, overdose, and associated deaths. We examined whether young children of women prescribed opioids were at increased risk of opioid overdose. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, nested case control study in Ontario, Canada, between 2002 and 2015. We identified children aged ≤10 years, whose mothers received publicly funded prescriptions for an opioid or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (comparator analgesic) in the preceding year. Cases were children who presented to hospital for or died of opioid overdose. Each case was matched with 4 controls with no opioid overdose. The primary outcome was the risk of opioid overdose. RESULTS: We identified 103 children who presented to the hospital with opioid overdose and matched them with 412 controls. Half of the children with opioid overdose were <2 years old. Compared with controls, children with an opioid overdose were far more likely to have a mother who received a prescription opioid (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.68–3.45) and who was prescribed antidepressants. The most commonly implicated overdose opioids were codeine (53.4%), oxycodone (32.0%), and methadone (15.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Young children of mothers prescribed opioids are at a markedly increased risk of overdose. Physicians, pharmacists, and parents should take measures to mitigate the risk of opioid-related harm to children, such as prescribing smaller quantities, emphasizing the importance of secure medication storage, and the prompt disposal of unused opioids.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 64, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3220799', 'name': 'Y.

However, the overall amount of pain reported by patients has not changed significantly. Specific information about opioid prescriptions in the perioperative period is lacking. Of the studies that have been published, investigators have shown that the majority of patients have unused postoperative opioid pills. Moreover, patients appear to lack information about disposal of unused opioid pills. Purpose: To compare the number of pills prescribed versus the numbers left unused after outpatient shoulder surgeries at an orthopaedic surgery institution. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: In this prospective, observational study, 100 patients (age >18 years) undergoing outpatient shoulder surgery (rotator cuff repair, labral repair, stabilization/Bankart repair, debridement) were enrolled. Follow-ups were conducted via surveys on postoperative days (PODs) 7, 14, 28, and 90. The primary outcome was the number of unused pills from the originally prescribed medication. Results: For all procedure types, the median (Q1, Q3) number of prescribed pills was 60 (40, 80). On POD 90, patients reported a median (Q1, Q3) of 13 (0, 32) unused pills; patients who underwent rotator cuff repairs had the lowest number of pills remaining (median [Q1, Q3], 0 [0, 16]), whereas patients who had stabilization/Bankart repairs had the highest number of unused pills (median [Q1, Q3], 37 [29, 50]). Patient satisfaction with pain management ranged from an average of 70% to 90%. Only 25 patients received instructions or education about opioid disposal. Conclusion: Most outpatient shoulder surgery patients who underwent certain operations were prescribed more opioid analgesics than they consumed. Patient education regarding the disposal of opioids was lacking.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 149, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2110685194', 'name': 'Kanupriya K Kumar'}, {'authorId': '6890976', 'name': 'L.

This version includes substantial changes to bring it in line with current methodological requirements. Methadone is a synthetic opioid that presents some challenges in dose titration and is recognised to cause potentially fatal arrhythmias in some patients. It does have a place in therapy for people who cannot tolerate other opioids but should be initiated only by experienced practitioners. This review is one of a suite of reviews on opioids for cancer pain.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the effectiveness and tolerability of methadone as an analgesic in adults and children with cancer pain.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nFor this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and clinicaltrials.gov, to May 2016, without language restriction. We also checked reference lists in relevant articles.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe sought randomised controlled trials comparing methadone (any formulation and by any route) with active or placebo comparators in people with cancer pain.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nAll authors agreed on studies for inclusion. We retrieved full texts whenever there was any uncertainty about eligibility. One review author extracted data, which were checked by another review author. There were insufficient comparable data for meta-analysis. We extracted information on the effect of methadone on pain intensity or pain relief, the number or proportion of participants with 'no worse than mild pain'. We looked for data on withdrawal and adverse events. We looked specifically for information about adverse events relating to appetite, thirst, and somnolence. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe revisited decisions made in the earlier version of this review and excluded five studies that were previously included. We identified one new study for this update. This review includes six studies with 388 participants. We did not identify any studies in children.The included studies differed so much in their methods and comparisons that no synthesis of results was feasible. Only one study (103 participants) specifically reported the number of participants with a given level of pain relief, in this case a reduction of at least 20% - similar in both the methadone and morphine groups. Using an outcome of 'no worse than mild pain', methadone was similar to morphine in effectiveness, and most participants who could tolerate methadone achieved 'no worse than mild pain'. Adverse event withdrawals with methadone were uncommon (12/202) and similar in other groups. Deaths were uncommon except in one study where the majority of participants died, irrespective of treatment group. For specific adverse events, somnolence was more common with methadone than with morphine, while dry mouth was more common with morphine than with methadone. None of the studies reported effects on appetite.We judged the quality of evidence to be low, downgraded due to risk of bias and sparse data. For specific adverse events, we considered the quality of evidence to be very low, downgraded due to risk of bias, sparse data, and indirectness, as surrogates for appetite, thirst and somnolence were used.There were no data on the use of methadone in children.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nBased on low-quality evidence, methadone is a drug that has similar analgesic benefits to morphine and has a role in the management of cancer pain in adults. Other opioids such as morphine and fentanyl are easier to manage but may be more expensive than methadone in many economies."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 37, 'authors': [{'authorId': '33344827', 'name': 'A.

Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of long-term (≥180 days) use of opioids for nonmalignant pain and associated factors among community-dwelling persons with AD and to compare the prevalence with a matched cohort without AD. The Medication use and Alzheimer's disease (MEDALZ) cohort was used for this study, comprising all community-dwelling persons diagnosed with AD in Finland during 2005 to 2011 and their matched comparison persons without AD. After exclusion of persons with active cancer treatment, 62,074 persons with and 62,074 persons without AD were included in this study. Data were collected from nationwide registers. Opioids were used by 13,111 persons with and by 16,659 without AD. Overall long-term opioid use was more common among persons without AD (8.7%) than among persons with AD (7.2%, P < 0.0001). However, among opioid users, prevalence of long-term opioid use was slightly higher among persons with AD than among those without AD (34.2% vs 32.3%, respectively, P = 0.0004). Long-term use of transdermal opioids was more than 2-fold among opioid users with AD (13.2%) compared with users without AD (5.5%). Factors associated with long-term opioid use included AD, age ≥80 years, female sex, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, low socioeconomic position, history of substance abuse, and long-term benzodiazepine use. Prevalence of long-term opioid use was somewhat similar among both groups. Among persons with AD, long-term opioid use was strongly associated with transdermal opioids."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 31, 'authors': [{'authorId': '8325005', 'name': 'A.

Aims: The Toronto General Hospital Transitional Pain Service (TPS) is a multidisciplinary, hospital-integrated program developed to prevent and manage CPSP and support opioid tapering. This clinical practice–based study reports on preliminary outcomes of the TPS psychology program, which provides acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to patients at risk for CPSP and persistent opioid use. Methods: Ninety-one patients received ACT, whereas 252 patients did not (no ACT group). Patient outcomes were compared for the two groups at first and last TPS visits. Pain, pain interference, sensitivity to pain traumatization, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and opioid use were analyzed using two-way (Group [ACT, no ACT] × Time [first, last visit]) analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Results: Patients referred to ACT were more likely to report a mental health condition preoperatively (P < 0.001), had higher opioid use (P < 0.001) at the first postsurgical visit, and reported higher sensitivity to pain traumatization (P < 0.05) and anxiety (P < 0.05) than the no ACT group at both time points. Both groups showed reductions in pain, pain interference, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and opioid use by the last TPS visit (P < 0.05). The ACT group demonstrated greater reductions in opioid use and pain interference and showed reductions in depressed mood (P = 0.001) by the end of treatment compared to the no ACT group.

The Kids' Inpatient Database was used to identify 13 052 discharge records for patients aged 1 to 19 years who were hospitalized for opioid poisonings. Data were analyzed within the collection time frame.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPoisonings attributed to prescription opioids were identified by codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. In adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, poisonings attributed to heroin were also identified. Census estimates were used to calculate incidence per 100\u202f000 population.

The annual incidence of hospitalizations for opioid poisonings per 100\u202f000 children aged 1 to 19 years rose from 1.40 (95% CI, 1.24-1.56) to 3.71 (95% CI, 3.44-3.98), an increase of 165% (P for trend, <.001). Among children 1 to 4 years of age, the incidence increased from 0.86 (95% CI, 0.60-1.12) to 2.62 (95% CI, 2.17-3.08), an increase of 205% (P for trend, <.001).

In this age group, poisonings from heroin increased from 0.96 (95% CI, 0.75-1.18) to 2.51 (95% CI, 2.21-2.80), an increase of 161% (P for trend, <.001); poisonings involving methadone increased from 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03-0.16) to 1.05 (95% CI, 0.87-1.23), an increase of 950% (P for trend, <.001).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nDuring the course of 16 years, hospitalizations attributed to opioid poisonings rose nearly 2-fold in the pediatric population. Hospitalizations increased across all age groups, yet young children and older adolescents were most vulnerable to the risks of opioid exposure.

The factors associated with this increased use remain unclear. We used the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys from 2005 to 2011 to measure the association of mood disorders with new opioid use and the transition to longer-term opioid use for a variety of pain conditions before and after controlling for patient characteristics and clinical disability. We analyzed 33,450 adults with likely acute or potentially chronic pain conditions who were not using opioids at baseline. Among respondents with likely acute pain conditions, those with mood disorders initiated opioids more frequently for that pain condition compared with those without mood disorders (19.3%, vs 17.2%, P = 0.01). After initiation, they also transitioned to longer-term opioid therapy more frequently (11.7% vs 5.3%, P < 0.01). Among respondents with potentially chronic pain conditions, adults with mood disorders initiated opioid therapy more frequently for their chronic pain condition (11.5% vs 9.2%, P < 0.01) and transitioned to longer-term therapy more frequently (36.8% vs 19.9%, P < 0.01).

This appears to be broadly true across a range of different drug combinations, in postoperative pain and migraine headache. A new combination of dexketoprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) plus tramadol (an opioid) has been tested in acute postoperative pain conditions. It is not yet licensed for use. This review is one of a series on oral analgesics for acute postoperative pain. Individual reviews have been brought together in two overviews to provide information about the relative efficacy and harm of the different interventions.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single fixed-dose of oral dexketoprofen plus tramadol, compared with placebo, for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults, using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in standardised trials using almost identical methods and outcomes. A secondary objective was to compare the combination with the individual analgesics alone.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via CRSO, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid from inception to 31 May 2016. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and two online clinical trial registries.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised, double-blind trials of oral dexketoprofen plus tramadol administered as a single oral dose, for the relief of acute postoperative pain in adults, and compared to placebo.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, examined issues of study quality and potential bias, and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) for dexketoprofen plus tramadol, compared with placebo with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We collected information on the number of participants with at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over six hours, the median time to use of rescue medication, and the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication. We also collected information on adverse events and withdrawals. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.We also collected information on the number of participants with at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over six hours for dexketoprofen alone and tramadol alone.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included three studies with 1853 participants who had undergone surgical removal of impacted wisdom teeth, hip replacement, or hysterectomy. The overall risk of bias across the three included studies was low, with unclear risk of bias in relation to the size of the three studies. Two studies did not report all our prespecified outcomes, which limited the analyses we could do.The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours with dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg was 66%, compared to 32% with placebo, giving an NNT of 3.0 (95% CI 2.5 to 3.7) (RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.4); 748 participants; 3 studies) (moderate quality evidence). The response rate with dexketoprofen 25 mg alone was 53% (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4); 744 participants; 3 studies) and with tramadol alone was 45% (RR 1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.7); 741 participants; 3 studies) (moderate quality evidence). We downgraded the evidence because of some inconsistency in the results.The median time to use of rescue medication could not be estimated exactly, but was probably eight hours or more, indicating a long duration of effect (moderate quality evidence). We downgraded the evidence because it was not possible to estimate the effect exactly in the two multiple dose studies, resulting in imprecision. Fewer participants used rescue medication with higher doses of active treatment (summary statistic not calculated; 123 participants; 1 study) (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the evidence because the data came from a single study with few participants and events.Adverse events and serious adverse events were not reported consistently for the single dose phase of the studies. In the single dose study, 11% of participants experienced adverse events with dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg, which were mostly mild or moderate nausea, vomiting, or dizziness, and typical with these medicines. Rates were lower with placebo and lower doses (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the evidence because the data came from a single study with few participants and events. Information on multiple dosing over three and five days supported a low event rate with the combination. Overall, rates were generally low in all treatment arms, as they were for withdrawals for adverse events or other reasons.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nA single oral dose of dexketoprofen 25 mg plus tramadol 75 mg provided good levels of pain relief with long duration of action to more people than placebo or the same dose of dexketoprofen or tramadol alone. The magnitude of the effect was similar to other good analgesics. Adverse event rates were low.There is modest uncertainty about the precision of the point estimate for efficacy, but the NNT of 3 is consistent with other analgesics considered effective and commonly used."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5258973', 'name': 'S.

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to control for possible confounders, including sex, age, preoperative history of depression, psychosis, drug or alcohol abuse, and preoperatice use of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and antidepressants.\n\n\nEXPOSURES\nOne of the 11 study surgical procedures.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nChronic opioid use, defined as having filled 10 or more prescriptions or more than 120 days\' supply of an opioid in the first year after surgery, excluding the first 90 postoperative days. For nonsurgical patients, chronic opioid use was defined as having filled 10 or more prescriptions or more than 120 days\' supply following a randomly assigned ""surgery date.""\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study included 641\u202f941 opioid-naive surgical patients (169\u202f666 men; mean [SD] age, 44.0 [12.8] years), and 18\u202f011\u202f137 opioid-naive nonsurgical patients (8\u202f849\u202f107 men; mean [SD] age, 42.4 [12.6] years). Among the surgical patients, the incidence of chronic opioid in the first preoperative year ranged from 0.119% for Cesarean delivery (95% CI, 0.104%-0.134%) to 1.41% for TKA (95% CI, 1.29%-1.53%) The baseline incidence of chronic opioid use among the nonsurgical patients was 0.136% (95% CI, 0.134%-0.137%). Except for cataract surgery, laparoscopic appendectomy, FESS, and TURP, all of the surgical procedures were associated with an increased risk of chronic opioid use, with odds ratios ranging from 1.28 (95% CI, 1.12-1.46) for cesarean delivery to 5.10 (95% CI, 4.67-5.58) for TKA. Male sex, age older than 50 years, and preoperative history of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, depression, benzodiazepine use, or antidepressant use were associated with chronic opioid use among surgical patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nIn opioid-naive patients, many surgical procedures are associated with an increased risk of chronic opioid use in the postoperative period. A certain subset of patients (eg, men, elderly patients) may be particularly vulnerable.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 819, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34347646', 'name': 'E.

Pain was measured with a 5-point scale of pain-related interference in daily activities and dichotomized as ""no pain"" (no or little interference) or ""pain"" (moderate to extreme interference). Prescription opioid use disorder was assessed with a structured interview (the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV version). Other covariates included age, sex, anxiety or mood disorders, and family history of drug, alcohol, and behavioral problems.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the structural equation model, pain and prescription opioid use disorders were significantly associated with one another at baseline and at 3-year follow-up. However, whereas pain at baseline was also significantly associated with prescription opioid use disorder at follow-up, prescription opioid use disorder at baseline was not associated with pain at follow-up. These associations were independent of several background demographic and clinical characteristics. The path for pain interference was associated with a 41% relative increase in the risk of developing a prescription opioid use disorder.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPainful conditions contribute to the risk of prescription opioid use disorders.

Although methadone accounted for only 2% of opioid prescriptions in 2009 (1), it was involved in approximately 30% of overdose deaths. Beginning with 2006 warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), efforts to reduce methadone use for pain have accelerated (2,3). The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and CDC analyzed methadone distribution, reports of diversion (the transfer of legally manufactured methadone into illegal markets), and overdose deaths during 2002-2014. On average, the rate of grams of methadone distributed increased 25.1% per year during 2002-2006 and declined 3.2% per year during 2006-2013. Methadone-involved overdose deaths increased 22.1% per year during 2002-2006 and then declined 6.5% per year during 2006-2014. During 2002-2006, rates of methadone diversion increased 24.3% per year; during 2006-2009, the rate increased at a slower rate, and after 2009, the rate declined 12.8% per year through 2014. Across sex, most age groups, racial/ethnic populations, and U.S. Census regions, the methadone overdose death rate peaked during 2005-2007 and declined in subsequent years. There was no change among persons aged ≥65 years, and among persons aged 55-64 years the methadone overdose death rate continued to increase through 2014.

The authors evaluated the abilities of the NoL index and other measures of nociception to discriminate between noxious and nonnoxious stimuli, to progressively respond to graded stimuli, and to respond to opioid administration. Methods:Intraoperative NoL was compared to heart rate, pulse plethysmograph amplitude, noninvasive blood pressure, and the surgical pleth index around five specific stimuli: tetanic stimulation with and without fentanyl analgesia, intubation, first incision/trocar insertion, and a nonnoxious period. The response around first incision was analyzed at two target plasma concentrations of remifentanil. Results:In 58 patients, the NoL index responded progressively to increased stimulus intensity and remained unchanged in response to nonnoxious stimuli. Compared to other accepted measures of nociception, the NoL index better discriminated noxious from nonnoxious stimuli with an area under the curve of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.97) and a sensitivity of 87% at a specificity of 84%. The NoL index was the only measure that reliably reflected two different analgesic concentrations of remifentanil during initial skin incision or trocar insertion. Conclusions:The NoL index changes proportionately with patients’ response to various clinical and experimental noxious stimuli and discriminates noxious from nonnoxious stimuli with high sensitivity and specificity. The NoL index also responds progressively to increasing stimuli intensity and is appropriately blunted by analgesic administration. The NoL index was superior to other compared measures and appears to accurately characterize nociception during general anesthesia.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 34, 'citationCount': 103, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6546503', 'name': 'R.

The main goal of this meta-analysis was to quantify the effects of nicotine/tobacco administration on human experimental pain threshold and tolerance ratings. A search of PubMed and PsycINFO online databases identified 13 eligible articles, including k = 21 tests of pain tolerance (N = 393) and k = 15 tests of pain threshold (N = 339). Meta-analytic integration for both threshold and tolerance outcomes revealed that nicotine administered through tobacco smoke and other delivery systems (eg, patch, nasal spray) produced acute analgesic effects that may be characterized as small to medium in magnitude (Hedges g = 0.35, 95% confidence interval = 0.21-0.50). Publication bias-corrected estimates remained significant and indicated that these effects may be closer to small. Sex composition was observed to be a significant moderator, such that pain threshold effects were more robust among samples that included more men than women. These results help to clarify a mixed literature and may ultimately help to inform the treatment of both pain and nicotine dependence. Pain and tobacco smoking are both highly prevalent and comorbid conditions. Current smoking has been associated with more severe chronic pain and physical impairment. Acute nicotine-induced analgesia could make smoking more rewarding and harder to give up.

The effect of these laws on opioid use is unclear.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe tested associations between prescription-opioid receipt and state controlled-substances laws. Using Medicare administrative data for fee-for-service disabled beneficiaries 21 to 64 years of age who were alive throughout the calendar year (8.7 million person-years from 2006 through 2012) and an original data set of laws (e.g., prescription-drug monitoring programs), we examined the annual prevalence of beneficiaries with four or more opioid prescribers, prescriptions yielding a daily morphine-equivalent dose (MED) of more than 120 mg, and treatment for nonfatal prescription-opioid overdose. We estimated how opioid outcomes varied according to eight types of laws.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom 2006 through 2012, states added 81 controlled-substance laws. Opioid receipt and potentially hazardous prescription patterns were common. In 2012 alone, 47% of beneficiaries filled opioid prescriptions (25% in one to three calendar quarters and 22% in every calendar quarter); 8% had four or more opioid prescribers; 5% had prescriptions yielding a daily MED of more than 120 mg in any calendar quarter; and 0.3% were treated for a nonfatal prescription-opioid overdose. We observed no significant associations between opioid outcomes and specific types of laws or the number of types enacted. For example, the percentage of beneficiaries with a prescription yielding a daily MED of more than 120 mg did not decline after adoption of a prescription-drug monitoring program (0.27 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -0.05 to 0.59).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdoption of controlled-substance laws was not associated with reductions in potentially hazardous use of opioids or overdose among disabled Medicare beneficiaries, a population particularly at risk.

Since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137%, including a 200% increase in the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids (opioid pain relievers and heroin). CDC analyzed recent multiple cause-of-death mortality data to examine current trends and characteristics of drug overdose deaths, including the types of opioids associated with drug overdose deaths. During 2014, a total of 47 055 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States, representing a 1-year increase of 6.5%, from 13.8 per 100 000 persons in 2013 to 14.7 per 100 000 persons in 2014. The rate of drug overdose deaths increased significantly for both sexes, persons aged 25–44 years and ≥55 years, non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, and in the Northeastern, Midwestern, and Southern regions of the United States. Rates of opioid overdose deaths also increased significantly, from 7.9 per 100 000 in 2013 to 9.0 per 100 000 in 2014, a 14% increase. Historically, CDC has programmatically characterized all opioid pain reliever deaths (natural and semisynthetic opioids, methadone, and other synthetic opioids) as “prescription” opioid overdoses (1). Between 2013 and 2014, the age-adjusted rate of death involving methadone remained unchanged; however, the ageadjusted rate of death involving natural and semisynthetic opioid pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids, other than methadone (e.g. fentanyl) increased 9%, 26%, and 80%, respectively. The sharp increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids, other than methadone, in 2014 coincided with law enforcement reports of increased availability of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid; however, illicitly manufactured fentanyl cannot be distinguished from prescription fentanyl in death certificate data. These findings indicate that the opioid overdose epidemic is worsening. There is a need for continued action to prevent opioid abuse, dependence, and death, improve treatment capacity for opioid use disorders, and reduce the supply of illicit opioids, particularly heroin and illicit fentanyl.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 9, 'citationCount': 1179, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4262266', 'name': 'R.

The clinical importance of cigarette smoking on acute postoperative pain perception is not fully understood. Methods. To determine whether smokers who underwent major surgery need more postoperative opiate than do nonsmokers. We prospectively enrolled 407 male and 441 female participants who underwent in-hospital surgery. Current-smokers were compared with nonsmokers and past-smokers about opiate use during the first 72\u2009h after surgery. Results. A greater proportion of males had more smoking history than females. The average age of male current-smokers is smaller than both nonsmokers and past-smokers. The surgical type (upper abdomen, lower abdomen, extremities, spine, and others) and duration of surgery have no differences between current-smokers, past-smokers, and nonsmokers. Statistically, the male current-smokers required more opiate analgesics during the first 72\u2009h following surgery compared with the male nonsmokers and past-smokers; furthermore, the male current-smokers reported higher pain intensity when moving and at rest on day 1 after surgery. Conclusions. In this study, the male current-smokers required more morphine in the first 72\u2009h after surgery than did the nonsmokers and past-smokers.

Methods For the 194 Member States of the World Health Organization, we searched PubMed for studies and contacted key informants for reports on surgical volumes between 2005 and 2012. We obtained data on population and total health expenditure per capita for 2012 and categorized Member States as very-low, low, middle and high expenditure. Data on caesarean delivery were obtained from validated statistical reports. For Member States without recorded surgical data, we estimated volumes by multiple imputation using data on total health expenditure. We estimated caesarean deliveries as a proportion of all surgery. Findings We identified 66 Member States reporting surgical data. We estimated that 312.9 million operations (95% confidence interval, CI: 266.2–359.5) took place in 2012, an increase from the 2004 estimate of 226.4 million operations. Only 6.3% (95% CI: 1.7–22.9) and 23.1% (95% CI: 14.8–36.7) of operations took place in very-low- and low-expenditure Member States representing 36.8% (2573 million people) and 34.2% (2393 million people) of the global population of 7001 million people, respectively. Caesarean deliveries comprised 29.6% (5.8/19.6 million operations; 95% CI: 9.7–91.7) of the total surgical volume in very-low-expenditure Member States, but only 2.7% (5.1/187.0 million operations; 95% CI: 2.2–3.4) in high-expenditure Member States.

We performed a retrospective analysis to assess the effect of converting from an opioid to RA-based approach to pain management after pediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods The records of patients having ACL reconstruction were reviewed. Two groups, those with (n = 115) and without (n = 39) nerve blocks, were identified. Single-shot blocks or indwelling catheters were performed in the operating room (OR) or a block room. Time to discharge readiness, postoperative opiate and antiemetic consumption, hospital admission or discharge, and complications were recorded. The cost of providing RA, the change in UHA and postanesthesia care unit utilization, and subsequent financial impact were calculated. Results Regional anesthesia–based pain management was associated with a lower rate of UHA (P = 0.045), less time in postanesthesia care unit phase II (P = 0.013), and a reduction in opioid consumption (P < 0.001). Use of a dedicated RA team with a dedicated block room resulted in cost savings or neutrality, whereas RA catheters placed in the OR were associated with increased direct hospital costs. Conclusions Regional anesthesia for pain after ACL repair in pediatric patients facilitated reliable same-day surgery discharge and significantly reduced UHAs.

Whenever possible, out-of-hospital pain scores and analgesics usage data were obtained as well. METHODS This prospective, randomized, double-blind and controlled study was conducted in consenting patients who underwent elective craniotomy for brain tumor resection at Tel Aviv Medical Center between 2012 and 2014. Patients received either 150 mg PGL (n = 50) or 500 mg starch (placebo; n = 50) on the evening before surgery, 1.5 hours before surgery, and twice daily for 72 hours following surgery. All patients spent the night before surgery in the hospital, and no other premedication was administered. Opioids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were used for pain, which was self-rated by means of a numerical rating scale (score range 0-10). RESULTS Eighty-eight patients completed the study. Data on the American Society of Anesthesiologists class, age, body weight, duration of surgery, and intraoperative drugs were similar for both groups. The pain scores during postoperative Days 0 to 2 were significantly lower in the PGL group than in the placebo group (p < 0.01). Analgesic consumption was also lower in the PGL group, both immediately and 1 month after surgery. There were fewer requests for antiemetics in the PGL group, and the rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting was lower. The preoperative anxiety level and the quality of sleep were significantly better in the PGL group (p < 0.01). There were no PGL-associated major adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Perioperative use of twice-daily 150 mg pregabalin attenuates preoperative anxiety, improves sleep quality, and reduces postoperative pain scores and analgesic usage without increasing the rate of adverse effects.

Epidurals have been posited to prevent the development of persistent pain, but there are little data on the effect of epidurals on persistent opioid use. Methods:This study was conducted using a claims database of a large, nationwide commercial health insurer. Opioid-naive patients who underwent open abdominal surgery from January 2004 to December 2013 were included in the study. Propensity scores for epidural placement were calculated accounting for demographic characteristics, resource utilization, and comorbid conditions (including medical, psychiatric, and pain conditions). Time-to-event analysis was used with the primary outcome defined as 30 days without filling an opioid prescription after discharge. In addition, total morphine equivalents dispensed within 90 days of discharge were also calculated for each patient. Results:A total of 6,432 patients were included in the final propensity score–matched cohort. The Cox proportional hazards ratio was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.01; P = 0.0910) for the relation between epidural placement and time till a 30-day gap without filling an opioid prescription. There was no difference in the total morphine equivalents dispensed within 90 days of discharge between the groups (P = 0.7670). Conclusions:Epidural placement was not protective against persistent opioid use in a large cohort of opioid-naive patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Multimodal analgesia included femoral nerve block, epidural analgesia, oxycodone-paracetamol, and meloxicam. The primary outcome was pain with flexion (POD14).\n\n\nRESULTS\nPregabalin did not reduce pain at rest, with ambulation, or with flexion at 2 weeks (P=0.69, 0.23, and 0.90, respectively).

Methods:This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, superiority trial was designed to determine the analgesic efficacy of a perioperative course of gabapentin when added to a multimodal analgesic regimen. Women scheduled for elective CD during spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive a perioperative oral course of either gabapentin (600\u2009mg preoperatively followed by 200\u2009mg every 8\u2009h for 2 days) or placebo. Postoperative pain was measured at 24 and 48\u2009h, at rest and on movement, on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 to 100\u2009mm). The primary outcome was pain on movement at 24\u2009h.

Recent evidence suggests a higher frequency of neuropathic pain features in those with CWP than previously thought. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of neuropathic pain features in individuals with CWP and to estimate the influence of genetic and environmental factors on neuropathic pain in CWP. Validated questionnaires (the London Fibromyalgia Screening Study questionnaire and PainDETECT questionnaire) were used to classify twins as having CWP and neuropathic pain, respectively. The prevalence of CWP was 14.7% (n = 4324), and of the 1357 twins invited to complete neuropathic pain screening, 15.9% of those having CWP demonstrated features of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was found to be heritable (A = 37%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23%-50%) with unique environmental factors accounting for 63% (95% CI: 49%-79%) of the variance. Heritability of neuropathic pain and CWP were found to be correlated, 0.54 (95% CI: 0.42-0.65). Increasing age, raised body mass index, female gender, and smoking were all risk factors for neuropathic pain (P < 0.05), and CWP (P < 0.05). High socioeconomic status showed negative correlation with neuropathic pain (P = 0.003) and CWP (P = 0.001). Bivariate analysis of the 2 pain traits revealed that genetic predisposition to neuropathic pain is shared with that for CWP. This is the first study to provide formal heritability estimates for neuropathic pain in CWP.

The authors examined anesthesia closed malpractice claims associated with RD to determine whether patterns of injuries could guide preventative strategies. Methods:From the Anesthesia Closed Claims Project database of 9,799 claims, three authors reviewed 357 acute pain claims that occurred between 1990 and 2009 for the likelihood of RD using literature-based criteria. Previously cited patient risk factors for RD, clinical management, nursing assessments, and timing of events were abstracted from claim narratives to identify recurrent patterns. Results:RD was judged as possible, probable, or definite in 92 claims (&kgr; = 0.690) of which 77% resulted in severe brain damage or death. The vast majority of RD events (88%) occurred within 24 h of surgery, and 97% were judged as preventable with better monitoring and response.

Two hours before surgery, patients received celecoxib 400 mg p.o. and were randomly assigned to receive either gabapentin 600 mg or placebo p.o. Two hours later, patients received femoral, sciatic nerve blocks, and spinal anaesthesia. After operation, patients received gabapentin 200 mg or placebo three times per day (TID) for 4 days. All patients also received celecoxib 200 mg q12 h for 72 h and i.v. patient-controlled analgesia for 24 h. Pain and function were assessed at baseline, during hospitalization, on postoperative day 4 (POD4), and 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe gabapentin group used less morphine in the first 24 h after surgery [G=38.3 (29.5 mg), P=48.2 (29.4 mg)] (P<0.0125) and had increased knee range of motion compared with the placebo group in-hospital (P<0.05).

This randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial examines the effects of multilevel ultrasound-guided paravertebral blocks (PVBs) and total intravenous anesthesia on QoR after ambulatory breast tumor resection. Methods:Sixty-six women were randomized to standardized general anesthesia (control group) or PVBs and propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (PVB group). The PVB group received T1–T5 PVBs with 5 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine per level, whereas the control group received sham subcutaneous injections. Postoperative QoR was designated as the primary outcome. The 29-item ambulatory QoR tool was administered in the preadmission clinic, before discharge, and on postoperative days 2, 4, and 7. Secondary outcomes included block success, pain scores, intra- and postoperative morphine consumption, time to rescue analgesia, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and hospital discharge time. Results:Data from sixty-four patients were analyzed. The PVB group had higher QoR scores than control group upon discharge (146 vs. 131; P < 0.0001) and on postoperative day 2 (145 vs. 135; P = 0.013); improvements beyond postoperative day 2 lacked statistical significance.

Design Population based retrospective cohort study. Setting Acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, between 1 April 2003 and 31 March 2010. Participants 39\u2009140 opioid naïve patients aged 66 years or older who had major elective surgery, including cardiac, intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, and pelvic procedures. Main outcome measure Prolonged opioid use after discharge, as defined by ongoing outpatient prescriptions for opioids for more than 90 days after surgery. Results Of the 39\u2009140 patients in the entire cohort, 49.2% (n=19\u2009256) were discharged from hospital with an opioid prescription, and 3.1% (n=1229) continued to receive opioids for more than 90 days after surgery. Following risk adjustment with multivariable logistic regression modelling, patient related factors associated with significantly higher risks of prolonged opioid use included younger age, lower household income, specific comorbidities (diabetes, heart failure, pulmonary disease), and use of specific drugs preoperatively (benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). The type of surgical procedure was also highly associated with prolonged opioid use. Compared with open radical prostatectomies, both open and minimally invasive thoracic procedures were associated with significantly higher risks (odds ratio 2.58, 95% confidence interval 2.03 to 3.28 and 1.95 1.36 to 2.78, respectively). Conversely, open and minimally invasive major gynaecological procedures were associated with significantly lower risks (0.73, 0.55 to 0.98 and 0.45, 0.33 to 0.62, respectively). Conclusions Approximately 3% of previously opioid naïve patients continued to use opioids for more than 90 days after major elective surgery.

Chronic opioid use is defined as 10 or more opioid dispensings over 90 or more days or as dispensings of at least a 120-day supply of opioids during the year prior to surgery.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBefore surgery, 8% (95% CI, 7%-8%; n\u2009=\u2009933) of bariatric patients were chronic opioid users. Of these individuals, 77% (95% CI, 75%-80%; n\u2009=\u2009723) continued chronic opioid use in the year following surgery. Mean daily morphine equivalents for the 933 bariatric patients who were chronic opioid users before surgery were 45.0 mg (95% CI, 40.0-50.1) preoperatively and 51.9 mg (95% CI, 46.0-57.8) postoperatively (P\u2009<\u2009.001).

We also checked references, and contacted study authors for additional studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different methods and administrative protocols for conscious sedation and analgesia during oocyte retrieval.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were intraoperative and postoperative pain. Secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy, patient satisfaction, analgesic side effects, and postoperative complications.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 24 RCTs (3160 women) in five comparisons. We report the main comparisons below. Evidence quality was generally low or very low, mainly owing to poor reporting and imprecision.1. CSA versus other active interventions.All evidence for this comparison was of very low quality.CSA versus CSA plus acupuncture or electroacupunctureData show more effective intraoperative pain relief on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) with CSA plus acupuncture (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.82, 62 women) or electroacupuncture (MD 3.00, 95% CI 2.23 to 3.77, 62 women).Data also show more effective postoperative pain relief (0 to 10 VAS) with CSA plus acupuncture (MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.10 to 1.30, 61 women) or electroacupuncture (MD 2.10, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.80, 61 women).Evidence was insufficient to show whether clinical pregnancy rates were different between CSA and CSA plus acupuncture (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.86, 61 women). CSA alone may be associated with fewer pregnancies than CSA plus electroacupuncture (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.66, 61 women).Evidence was insufficient to show whether rates of vomiting were different between CSA and CSA plus acupuncture (OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 5.88, 62 women) or electroacupuncture (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.58, 62 women).Trialists provided no usable data for other outcomes of interest.CSA versus general anaesthesia Postoperative pain relief was greater in the CSA group (0 to 3 Likert: mean difference (MD) 1.9, 95% CI 2.24 to 1.56, one RCT, 50 women).Evidence was insufficient to show whether groups differed in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.35, two RCTs, 108 women, I2 = 0%).Evidence was insufficient to show whether groups differed in rates of vomiting (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.75, one RCT, 50 women) or airway obstruction (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.22, one RCT, 58 women). Fewer women needed mask ventilation in the CSA group (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.20, one RCT, 58 women).Evidence was also insufficient to show whether groups differed in satisfaction rates (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.11 to 4.04, two RCTs, 108 women, I2 = 34%; very low-quality evidence).Trialists provided no usable data for outcomes of interest.2. CSA + paracervical block (PCB) versus other interventions.CSA + PCB versus electroacupuncture + PCB Intraoperative pain scores were lower in the CSA + PCB group (0 to 10 VAS: MD -0.66, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.39, 781 women, I2 = 76%; low-quality evidence).Evidence was insufficient to show whether groups differed in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.29, 783 women, I2 = 9%; low-quality evidence).Trialists provided no usable data for other outcomes of interest.CSA + PCB versus general anaesthesiaEvidence was insufficient to show whether groups differed in postoperative pain scores (0 to 10 VAS: MD 0.49, 95% CI -0.13 to 1.11, 50 women; very low-quality evidence).Evidence was insufficient to show whether groups differed in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.26, 51 women; very low-quality evidence).Trialists provided no usable data for other outcomes of interest.CSA + PCB versus spinal anaesthesiaPostoperative pain scores were higher in the CSA + PCB group (0 to 10 VAS: MD 1.02, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.56, 36 women; very low-quality evidence).Evidence was insufficient to show whether groups differed in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.65, 38 women; very low-quality evidence).Trialists provided no usable data for other outcomes of interest.CSA + PCB versus PCBEvidence was insufficient to show whether groups differed in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.96, 150 women; low-quality evidence) or satisfaction (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.89, 150 women, low-quality evidence).Trialists provided no usable data for other outcomes of interest.CSA + PCB versus CSA only Evidence was insufficient to show whether groups differed in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.36, one RCT, 100 women; very low-quality evidence). Rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting were lower in the CS + PCB group (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.97, two RCTs, 140 women, I2 = 40%; very low-quality evidence).Trialists provided no usable data for other outcomes of interest.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence does not support one particular method or technique over another in providing effective conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during and after oocyte retrieval. Simultaneous use of sedation combined with analgesia such as the opiates, further enhanced by paracervical block or acupuncture techniques, resulted in better pain relief than occurred with one modality alone. Evidence was insufficient to show conclusively whether any of the interventions influenced pregnancy rates. All techniques reviewed were associated with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Women's preferences and resource availability for choice of pain relief merit consideration in practice."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 70, 'citationCount': 60, 'authors': [{'authorId': '38435517', 'name': 'I.

We identified Ontario residents 66 years and older who were dispensed an opioid within 7 days of a short-stay surgery (cataract surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, or varicose vein stripping) and assessed the risk of long-term opioid use, defined as a prescription for an opioid within 60 days of the 1-year anniversary of the surgery. In a secondary analysis, we examined the risk of long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between postsurgical use of analgesics and long-term use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 391,139 opioid-naive patients undergoing short-stay surgery, opioids were newly prescribed to 27,636 patients (7.1%) within 7 days of being discharged from the hospital, and opioids were prescribed to 30,145 patients (7.7%) at 1 year from surgery. An increase in the use of oxycodone was found during this time (from 5.4% within 7 days to 15.9% at 1 year). In our primary analysis, patients receiving an opioid prescription within 7 days of surgery were 44% more likely to become long-term opioid users within 1 year compared with those who received no such prescription (adjusted odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.39-1.50). In a secondary analysis, among 383,780 NSAID-naive patients undergoing short-stay surgery, NSAIDs were prescribed to 1169 patients (0.3%) within 7 days of discharge and to 30,080 patients (7.8%) at 1 year from surgery. Patients who began taking NSAIDs within 7 days of surgery were almost 4 times more likely to become long-term NSAID users compared with patients with no such prescription (adjusted odds ratio, 3.74; 95% CI, 3.27-4.28).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPrescription of analgesics immediately after ambulatory surgery occurs frequently in older adults and is associated with long-term use.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 661, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2697177', 'name': 'A.

To perform a meta-synthesis of the evidence for modifiable lifestyle risk factors for inflammatory polyarthritis (IP) and RA. Methods. We performed a MEDLINE literature search. Case–control and cohort studies and systematic reviews published from 1948 through February 2011 and studying modifiable risk factors for RA were retrieved. The main outcome measure was diagnosis of RA according to the standard criteria. Results. Smoking contributes up to 25% of the population burden of RA. The risk is dose related, stronger in males and especially strong for anti-citrullinated peptide antibody positive (ACPA+) RA through an interaction with the shared epitope. After smoking cessation, there is, however, a latency of up to 20 years to return to baseline risk. Other associations are less definitive; however, prospective studies suggest that dietary antioxidants and breastfeeding may be protective and that high coffee consumption may increase RA risk. An inverse association with alcohol intake (especially in smokers) and with education/social class (especially seropositive RA) and an increased risk with obesity (seronegative RA) is also noted. Conclusion. There is a need for further large-scale prospective studies with a consistent definition of RA phenotype (undifferentiated IP through to ACPA+/RF+ disease). This will ultimately afford the opportunity to evaluate preventative population strategies for RA akin to the well-established programmes for cardiovascular disease and cancer, targeting common risk factors.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 139, 'citationCount': 96, 'authors': [{'authorId': '10102991', 'name': 'M.

Such a measure would ease comparison of the magnitude of the effects across studies, for example the effect of gender on heat pain with the effect of a genetic variant on pressure pain. Methodology/Principal Findings Effect sizes on pain thresholds to stimuli consisting of heat, cold, blunt pressure, punctuate pressure and electrical current, administered to 125 subjects, were analyzed for 29 common variants in eight human genes reportedly modulating pain, gender and sensitization procedures using capsaicin or menthol. The genotype explained 0–5.9% of the total interindividual variance in pain thresholds to various stimuli and produced mainly small effects (Cohen's d 0–1.8). The largest effect had the TRPA1 rs13255063T/rs11988795G haplotype explaining >5% of the variance in electrical pain thresholds and conferring lower pain sensitivity to homozygous carriers. Gender produced larger effect sizes than most variant alleles (1–14.8% explained variance, Cohen's d 0.2–0.8), with higher pain sensitivity in women than in men. Sensitization by capsaicin or menthol explained up to 63% of the total variance (4.7–62.8%) and produced largest effects according to Cohen's d (0.4–2.6), especially heat sensitization by capsaicin (Cohen's d\u200a=\u200a2.6).

To identify common genetic polymorphisms associated with CHD and its risk factors (LDL- and HDL-cholesterol (LDL-C and HDL-C), hypertension, smoking, and type-2 diabetes) in individuals of African ancestry, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 8,090 African Americans from five population-based cohorts. We replicated 17 loci previously associated with CHD or its risk factors in Caucasians. For five of these regions (CHD: CDKN2A/CDKN2B; HDL-C: FADS1-3, PLTP, LPL, and ABCA1), we could leverage the distinct linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in African Americans to identify DNA polymorphisms more strongly associated with the phenotypes than the previously reported index SNPs found in Caucasian populations. We also developed a new approach for association testing in admixed populations that uses allelic and local ancestry variation. Using this method, we discovered several loci that would have been missed using the basic allelic and global ancestry information only.

Examination of polymorphisms within the human OPRM1 gene locus identified strong association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs563649 and individual variations in pain perception. SNP rs563649 is located within a structurally conserved internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5′-UTR of a novel exon 13-containing OPRM1 isoforms (MOR-1K) and affects both mRNA levels and translation efficiency of these variants. Furthermore, rs563649 exhibits very strong linkage disequilibrium throughout the entire OPRM1 gene locus and thus affects the functional contribution of the corresponding haplotype that includes other functional OPRM1 SNPs.

The mu opioid receptor is the primary site of action for the most commonly used opioids, including morphine, heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. By sequencing DNA from 113 former heroin addicts in methadone maintenance and 39 individuals with no history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, we have identified five different single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of the mu opioid receptor gene. The most prevalent SNP is a nucleotide substitution at position 118 (A118G), predicting an amino acid change at a putative N-glycosylation site. This SNP displays an allelic frequency of approximately 10% in our study population. Significant differences in allele distribution were observed among ethnic groups studied. The variant receptor resulting from the A118G SNP did not show altered binding affinities for most opioid peptides and alkaloids tested. However, the A118G variant receptor binds beta-endorphin, an endogenous opioid that activates the mu opioid receptor, approximately three times more tightly than the most common allelic form of the receptor. Furthermore, beta-endorphin is approximately three times more potent at the A118G variant receptor than at the most common allelic form in agonist-induced activation of G protein-coupled potassium channels.

We aimed to identify characteristics associated with clinical severity in emergency department patients with prescription opioid overdose.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThis was a secondary data analysis of adult prescription opioid overdoses from a large prospective cohort of acute overdoses. We examined elements of a typical emergency department evaluation using a multivariable model to determine which characteristics were associated with clinical severity, specifically severe respiratory depression (SRD).\n\n\nSETTING\nThis study was conducted at two urban academic emergency departments in New York City, USA.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nAdult patients who presented with acute prescription opioid overdose between 2009 and 2013 were included in the current study. We analyzed 307 patients (mean age\xa0=\xa044.7, 42% female, 2.0% mortality).\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nPatient demographics, reported substances ingested, suspected intent for ingesting the substance, vital signs, laboratory data, treatments including antidotes and intubation and outcome of death were recorded by trained research assistants. Intent was categorized into four mutually exclusive categories: suicide, misuse, therapeutic error and undetermined. The primary outcome was SRD, defined as administration of either (a) naloxone or (b) endotracheal intubation (ETI).\n\n\nFINDINGS\nA total of 109 patients suffered SRD with 90 patients receiving naloxone alone, nine ETI alone and 10 both naloxone and ETI. The most common opioids were oxycodone (n\xa0=\xa0124) and methadone (n\xa0=\xa0116). Mean age was higher in patients with SRD (51.1 versus 41.1, P\xa0<\xa00.001). Opioid misuse was associated with SRD in the multivariable analysis [odds ratio (OR)\xa0=\xa02.07, 95% confidence interval (CI)\xa0=\xa01.21-3.55]. The unadjusted relative risk of SRD was high for fentanyl (83.3% SRD) and lowest for codeine (3.6% SRD).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn emergency department patients in the United States with prescription opioid overdose, worse clinical severity was associated with opioid misuse, increased with age and was widely variable, depending on the specific opioid medication involved.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 17, 'citationCount': 42, 'authors': [{'authorId': '20769162', 'name': 'L.

This review examined currently available evidence on the use of relaxation therapies for pain management in labour. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo examine the effects of mind-body relaxation techniques for pain management in labour on maternal and neonatal well-being during and after labour.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (9 May 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 5 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 May 2017), CINAHL (1980 to 24 May 2017), the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (18 May 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (18 May 2017), the ISRCTN Register (18 May 2017), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (18 May 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (including quasi randomised and cluster trials) comparing relaxation methods with standard care, no treatment, other non-pharmacological forms of pain management in labour or placebo.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We attempted to contact study authors for additional information. We assessed evidence quality with GRADE methodology.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThis review update includes 19 studies (2519 women), 15 of which (1731 women) contribute data. Interventions examined included relaxation, yoga, music and mindfulness. Approximately half of the studies had a low risk of bias for random sequence generation and attrition bias. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias for performance and detection bias, and unclear risk of bias for, allocation concealment, reporting bias and other bias. We assessed the evidence from these studies as ranging from low to very low quality, and therefore the effects below should be interpreted with caution.RelaxationWe found that relaxation compared to usual care provided lowered the intensity of pain (measured on a scale of 0 to 10 with low scores indicating less pain) during the latent phase of labour (mean difference (MD) -1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.97 to -0.53, one trial, 40 women). Four trials reported pain intensity in the active phase; there was high heterogeneity between trials and very low-quality evidence suggested that there was no strong evidence that the effects were any different between groups for this outcome (MD -1.08, 95% CI -2.57 to 0.41, four trials, 271 women, random-effects analysis). Very low-quality evidence showed that women receiving relaxation reported greater satisfaction with pain relief during labour (risk ratio (RR) 8.00, 95% CI 1.10 to 58.19, one trial, 40 women), and showed no clear benefit for satisfaction with childbirth experience (assessed using different scales) (standard mean difference (SMD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.31, three trials, 1176 women). For safety outcomes there was very low-quality evidence of no clear reduction in assisted vaginal birth (average RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.84, four trials, 1122 women) or in caesarean section rates (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.01, four trials, 1122 women). Sense of control in labour, and breastfeeding were not reported under this comparison.YogaWhen comparing yoga to control interventions there was low-quality evidence that yoga lowered pain intensity (measured on a scale of 0 to 10) with low scores indicating less pain) (MD -6.12, 95% CI -11.77 to -0.47, one trial, 66 women), greater satisfaction with pain relief (MD 7.88, 95% CI 1.51 to 14.25, one trial, 66 women) and greater satisfaction with childbirth experience (MD 6.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 12.42 one trial, 66 women (assessed using the Maternal Comfort Scale with higher score indicating greater comfort). Sense of control in labour, breastfeeding, assisted vaginal birth, and caesarean section were not reported under this comparison.MusicWhen comparing music to control interventions there was evidence of lower pain intensity in the latent phase for women receiving music (measured on a scale of 0 to 10 with low scores indicating less pain) (MD -0.73, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.45, random-effects analysis, two trials, 192 women) and very low-quality evidence of no clear benefit in the active phase (MD -0.51, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.07, three trials, 217 women). Very low-quality evidence suggested no clear benefit in terms of reducing assisted vaginal birth (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.05, one trial, 156 women) or caesarean section rate (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.70, two trials, 216 women). Satisfaction with pain relief, sense of control in labour, satisfaction with childbirth experience, and breastfeeding were not reported under this comparison.Audio analgesiaOne trial evaluating audio analgesia versus control only reported one outcome and showed no evidence of benefit in satisfaction with pain relief.MindfulnessOne trial evaluating mindfulness versus usual care found an increase in sense of control for the mindfulness group (using the Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory) (MD 31.30, 95% CI 1.61 to 60.99, 26 women). There is no strong evidence that the effects were any different between groups for satisfaction in childbirth, or for caesarean section rate, need for assisted vaginal delivery or need for pharmacological pain relief. No other outcomes were reported in this trial.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nRelaxation, yoga and music may have a role with reducing pain, and increasing satisfaction with pain relief, although the quality of evidence varies between very low to low. There was insufficient evidence for the role of mindfulness and audio-analgesia. The majority of trials did not report on the safety of the interventions. Further randomised controlled trials of relaxation modalities for pain management in labour are needed. Trials should be adequately powered and include clinically relevant outcomes such as those described in this review."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 86, 'citationCount': 129, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49788670', 'name': 'C.

These patients include, in particular, those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and other psychiatric conditions. This study examined health insurance claims among 10,311,961 patients who filled prescriptions for opioids. Specifically, we evaluated how opioid receipt differed among patients with and without a wide range of preexisting psychiatric and behavioral conditions (ie, opioid and nonopioid SUDs, suicide attempts or other self-injury, motor vehicle crashes, and depressive, anxiety, and sleep disorders) and psychoactive medications (ie, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and medications used for SUD, tobacco cessation, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Relative to those without, patients with all assessed psychiatric conditions and medications had modestly greater odds of subsequently filling prescriptions for opioids and, in particular, substantially greater risk of long-term opioid receipt. Increases in risk for long-term opioid receipt in adjusted Cox regressions ranged from approximately 1.5-fold for prior attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication prescriptions (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-1.58) to approximately 3-fold for prior nonopioid SUD diagnoses (HR = 3.15; 95% CI, 3.06-3.24) and nearly 9-fold for prior opioid use disorder diagnoses (HR = 8.70; 95% CI, 8.20-9.24).

Our previous study showed a large proportion of cancer patients have unsafe opioid practices. Our objective was to determine whether an improvement occurred in the patterns of use, storage, and disposal of opioids among cancer outpatients after the implementation of a patient educational program.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nOur palliative care (PC) clinic provides every patient with educational material (EM) on safe opioid use, storage, and disposal every time they receive an opioid prescription. We prospectively assessed 300 adult cancer outpatients receiving opioids in our PC clinic, who had received the EM, and compared them with 300 patients who had not received the EM. The previously used surveys pertaining to opioid use, storage, and disposal were administered, and demographic information was collected. Sharing or losing their opioids was defined as unsafe use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients who received EM were more aware of the proper opioid disposal methods (76% vs. 28%; p\u2009≤\u2009.0001), less likely to share their opioids with someone else (3% vs. 8%; p\u2009=\u2009.0311), less likely to practice unsafe use of opioids (18% vs. 25%; p\u2009=\u2009.0344), and more likely to be aware the danger of their opioids when taken by others (p\u2009=\u2009.0099). Patients who received the EM were less likely to have unused medication at home (38% vs. 47%; p\u2009=\u2009.0497) and more likely to keep their medications in a safe place (hidden, 75% vs. 70%; locked, 14% vs. 10%; p\u2009=\u2009.0025).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of EM on opioid safety for patients with advanced cancer was associated with improved patient-reported safe opioid use, storage, and disposal. The Oncologist 2017;22:115-121Implications for Practice: Prescription opioid abuse is a fast-growing epidemic that has become more prominent recently, even in the cancer pain population. A previous study reported that 26% of cancer outpatients seen in the supportive care center either lose their pain medications or share their pain medications with someone else. This study demonstrates that the implementation of an opioid educational program and distribution of educational material on opioid safety brings about an improvement in opioid storage, use, and disposal practices in patients being prescribed opioids for cancer-related pain.

We hypothesized that the effect might also be dose dependent in humans. We evaluated the effect of various concentrations of DEX with a local anesthetic in humans. Methods: Eighteen healthy volunteers were randomly assigned by a computer to receive 1.8 mL of 1 of 4 drug combinations: (1) 1% lidocaine with 2.5 ppm (parts per million) (4.5 μg) DEX, (2) lidocaine with 5.0 ppm (9.0 μg) DEX, (3) lidocaine with 7.5 ppm (13.5μg) DEX, or (4) lidocaine with 1:80,000 (22.5 μg) adrenaline (AD), to produce inferior alveolar nerve block. Pulp latency and lower lip numbness (for assessing onset and duration of anesthesia) were tested, and sedation level, blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded every 5 minutes for 20 minutes, and every 10 minutes from 20 to 60 minutes. Results: Pulp latency of each tooth increased compared with baseline, from 5 to 15 minutes until 60 minutes. There were no significant intergroup differences at any time point. Anesthesia onset was not different between groups. Anesthesia duration was different between groups (that with DEX 7.5 ppm was significantly longer than that with DEX 2.5 ppm and AD; there was no difference between DEX 2.5 ppm and AD).

Since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137%, including a 200% increase in the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids (opioid pain relievers and heroin). CDC analyzed recent multiple cause-of-death mortality data to examine current trends and characteristics of drug overdose deaths, including the types of opioids associated with drug overdose deaths. During 2014, a total of 47,055 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States, representing a 1-year increase of 6.5%, from 13.8 per 100,000 persons in 2013 to 14.7 per 100,000 persons in 2014. The rate of drug overdose deaths increased significantly for both sexes, persons aged 25-44 years and ≥55 years, non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, and in the Northeastern, Midwestern, and Southern regions of the United States. Rates of opioid overdose deaths also increased significantly, from 7.9 per 100,000 in 2013 to 9.0 per 100,000 in 2014, a 14% increase. Historically, CDC has programmatically characterized all opioid pain reliever deaths (natural and semisynthetic opioids, methadone, and other synthetic opioids) as ""prescription"" opioid overdoses (1). Between 2013 and 2014, the age-adjusted rate of death involving methadone remained unchanged; however, the age-adjusted rate of death involving natural and semisynthetic opioid pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids, other than methadone (e.g., fentanyl) increased 9%, 26%, and 80%, respectively. The sharp increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids, other than methadone, in 2014 coincided with law enforcement reports of increased availability of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid; however, illicitly manufactured fentanyl cannot be distinguished from prescription fentanyl in death certificate data. These findings indicate that the opioid overdose epidemic is worsening.

The purpose of this study was to assess postoperative opioid consumption after ultrasound-guided single-injection bupivacaine compared with saline adductor canal block for patients undergoing TKA. Methods: After institutional review board approval, written informed consent was obtained from patients (>18 years old) undergoing elective TKA. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups as follows: adductor canal blockade with 10 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:300,000 or 10 mL of normal saline. All patients received a periarticular infiltration mixture intraoperatively with scheduled and patient requested oral and IV analgesics postoperatively for breakthrough pain. Personnel blinded to group allocation recorded pain scores and opioid consumption every 6 hours. Pain burden, area under the numeric rating score for pain, was calculated for 36 hours. The primary outcome was postoperative IV/IM morphine (mg morEq) consumption at 36 hours after surgery. Results: Forty (28 women/12 men) subjects were studied. Postoperative opioid consumption was reduced in the bupivacaine 48 (39 to 61) mg morEq compared with saline 60 (49 to 85) mg morEq, difference −12 (−33 to −2) mg morEq (P = 0.03).

The influence of cigarette smoking (current or past) on the response to therapy was evaluated by logistic regression, with never smokers as the referent group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with never smokers, current smokers were less likely to achieve a good response at 3 months following the start of MTX (27% versus 36%; P=0.05) and at 3 months following the start of TNF inhibitors (29% versus 43%; P=0.03). In multivariate analyses in which clinical, serologic, and genetic factors were considered, the inverse associations between current smoking and good response remained (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for MTX response 0.60 [95% CI 0.39-0.94]; adjusted OR for TNF inhibitor response 0.52 [95% CI 0.29-0.96]). The lower likelihood of a good response remained at later followup visits. Evaluating remission or joint counts yielded similar findings. Past smoking did not affect the chance of response to MTX or TNF inhibitors. Evaluating the overall cohort, which reflects all treatments used, current smoking was similarly associated with a lower chance of a good response (adjusted ORs for the 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year visits 0.61, 0.65, 0.78, 0.66, and 0.61, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAmong patients with early RA, current cigarette smokers are less likely to respond to MTX and TNF inhibitors.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 34, 'citationCount': 228, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145290000', 'name': 'S.

At the same time, such interactions necessitate social cognition. The question thus arises how stress affects social cognition and how personality attributes modulate this effect. The aim of the current study was to investigate the link between emotional reactivity, physical exercise, and social cognition under stress. As a measure of social cognition, we used spontaneous perspective taking, i.e., the degree to which participants represented the mental state of another agent. Studying young female participants, we investigated how physiological regulation, measured through resting heart-rate variability, is related to spontaneous social perspective taking under stress, and to predicted anger in an ambiguous social scenario. When controlling for resting heart rate, vagally mediated heart-rate variability was negatively correlated with the effect of stress on perspective taking, indicating that good physiological regulation supports social cognition under stress. Further, participants who reported to exercise at least once a week showed higher perspective taking under stress than less active participants. Finally, we found tentative evidence for participants who exercised regularly to show reduced predicted anger in response to an ambiguous provocation. Our findings suggest that good physiological regulation and regular physical exercise support social cognition under stress.",2021,55,0,"{'name': 'Stress', 'pages': '753 - 762', 'volume':

Participants performed a spontaneous facial mimicry task with facial electromyography (fEMG) at baseline and approximately one month later, following an acute psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test). Results show that the magnitude of the endocrine stress response reduced zygomaticus major reactivity, and specifically spontaneous facial mimicry for positive social stimuli (i.e. smiles). Individuals with higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol showed a more blunted fEMG response to smiles, but not to frowns. Conversely, stress had no effect on corrugator supercilii activation (i.e. frowning to frowns).

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes and quantifies current empirical evidence of within-person changes in measures of CVA across the menstrual cycle in naturally-cycling premenopausal females. We conducted an extensive literature search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement in five databases to identify observational studies with repeated measures of CVA in at least two menstrual cycle phases. A broad meta-analysis (nstudies = 37; nindividuals = 1,004) revealed a significant CVA decrease from the follicular to luteal phase (d = −0.39, 95% CI (−0.67, −0.11)). Furthermore, 21 studies allowed for finer-grained comparisons between each of two cycle phases (menstrual, mid-to-late follicular, ovulatory, early-to-mid luteal, and premenstrual). Significant decreases in CVA were observed from the menstrual to premenstrual (nstudies = 5; nindividuals = 200; d = −1.17, 95% CI (−2.18, −0.17)) and from the mid-to-late follicular to premenstrual phases (nstudies = 8; nindividuals = 280; d = −1.32, 95% CI (−2.35, −0.29)).

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel and ticlopidine plus Ginkgo biloba in clopidogrel-resistant patients undergoing CAS. Methods: In this multi-center, randomized, controlled trial, we used platelet reactivity test to select patients undergoing CAS who showed clopidogrel resistance, and compared treatments using clopidogrel and ticlopidine plus ginkgo. The primary outcome was the incidence of new ischemic lesion in the ipsilateral hemisphere of CAS. Detection of microembolic signal on transcranial Doppler was the secondary outcome. The clinical outcomes were also monitored. Results: This trial was discontinued after 42 patients were randomized after preplanned interim sample size re-estimation indicated an impractical sample size. The primary endpoint occurred in 12/22 patients (54.5%) in the clopidogrel group and 13/20 patients (65.0%) in the ticlopidine–ginkgo group (P = 0.610). No significant differences in the presence of microembolic signal (15.0 vs. 11.8%, P = 0.580), clinical outcomes (ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, 0.0 vs. 5.5%; acute myocardial infarction 0.0 vs. 0.0%; all-cause death, 4.5 vs. 0.0%), or incidence of adverse events were found in the two groups. In terms of resistance to clopidogrel, treatment with ticlopidine–ginkgo significantly increased the P2Y12 Reaction Units (difference, 0.0 [−0.3–3.0] vs. 21.0 [6.0–35.0], P < 0.001). Conclusions: In patients who showed clopidogrel resistance, ticlopidine–ginkgo treatment was safe and increased P2Y12 Reaction Units; however, compared to clopidogrel, it failed to improve surrogate and clinical endpoints in patients undergoing CAS.

Frequent exercise is robustly associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality as well as the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Physically active individuals have lower blood pressure, higher insulin sensitivity, and a more favorable plasma lipoprotein profile. Animal models of exercise show that repeated physical activity suppresses atherogenesis and increases the availability of vasodilatory mediators such as nitric oxide. Exercise has also been found to have beneficial effects on the heart. Acutely, exercise increases cardiac output and blood pressure, but individuals adapted to exercise show lower resting heart rate and cardiac hypertrophy. Both cardiac and vascular changes have been linked to a variety of changes in tissue metabolism and signaling, although our understanding of the contribution of the underlying mechanisms remains incomplete. Even though moderate levels of exercise have been found to be consistently associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk, there is evidence to suggest that continuously high levels of exercise (e.g., marathon running) could have detrimental effects on cardiovascular health. Nevertheless, a specific dose response relationship between the extent and duration of exercise and the reduction in cardiovascular disease risk and mortality remains unclear.

Objective: The goal of this scoping review was to determine which factors pose a significant risk for the onset of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress in patients with heart disease, as well as to identify what might protect them from these afflictions. Method: We conducted a thorough search of relevant medical and psychological databases (Scopus, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Sage Journals, and MEDLINE) and identified 41 studies that met inclusion criteria, which included all types of heart disease. Results: The results of our review indicate that mental health history, the tendency to stifle negative emotional experiences (known as “type D personality”), and social support in patients with heart disease are related to the onset of or protection from depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. These factors, along with gender and younger age, seem to be relatively consistent predictors of mental health problems in this population. Conclusions: As per our results, it is important for clinicians to attend to the mental health history, type D personality, and presence and quality of social support in patients with heart disease. More research into prevention and gender differences is necessary to hone the detection and treatment of these problems in people with heart disease. Clinical Implications: Attention to their mental health history, their ability to express and regulate affect, their age, and their gender will most likely assist in identifying symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress in people with cardiac disease.

The implementation of such fight-or-flight decisions is a central aspect in the genesis and evolution of aggression episodes, yet it is usually investigated only indirectly or in nonsocial situations. In the present fMRI study, we aimed to distinguish brain regions associated with aggressive and avoidant responses to interpersonal provocation in humans. Participants (thirty-six healthy young women) could either avoid or face a highly (HP) and a lowly (LP) provoking opponent in a competitive reaction time task: the fight-or-escape (FOE) paradigm. Subjects avoided the HP more often, but retaliated when facing her. Moreover, they chose to fight the HP more quickly, and showed increased heart rate (HR) right before confronting her. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and sensorimotor cortex were more active when participants decided to fight, whereas the mentalizing network was engaged when deciding to avoid. Importantly, avoiding the HP relative to the LP was associated with both higher activation in the right basolateral amygdala and lower relative activity in several mentalizing regions [e.g., medial and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), temporal-parietal junction (TPJ)]. These results suggest that avoidant responses to provocation might result from heightened threat anticipation and are associated with reduced perspective taking.

A limited number of studies have shown that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation are associated with HRV. However, results from prior studies are inconclusive, and an ecological validation of the association has not yet been tested. Therefore, further exploration of the relation between self-report questionnaires and psychophysiological measures of emotional regulation is needed. The present study investigated the contribution of self-reported emotion regulation difficulties on HRV in a student sample. We expected higher scores on emotion regulation difficulties to be associated with lower vagus-mediated HRV (vmHRV). Sixty-three participants filled out the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and their resting HRV was assessed. In addition, a subsample of participants provided ambulatory 24-h HRV data, in order to ecologically validate the resting data. Correlation analyses indicated that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation was negatively associated with vmHRV in both resting HRV and 24-h HRV.

Comparisons with nonhuman apes point to our early‐emerging cooperative‐communicative abilities as crucial to the evolution of all forms of human cultural cognition, including language. The human self‐domestication hypothesis proposes that these early‐emerging social skills evolved when natural selection favored increased in‐group prosociality over aggression in late human evolution. As a by‐product of this selection, humans are predicted to show traits of the domestication syndrome observed in other domestic animals. In reviewing comparative, developmental, neurobiological, and paleoanthropological research, compelling evidence emerges for the predicted relationship between unique human mentalizing abilities, tolerance, and the domestication syndrome in humans.

In humans, androstadienone (ANDR), a synthetic male steroid, is a socially relevant chemosignal exhibited to increase positive mood and cortisol levels specifically in (periovulatory) females in positively arousing contexts. In a negative context, we expected that such effects of ANDR could amplify social evaluative threat depending on the stress sensitivity, which differs between menstrual cycle phases. Therefore, this fMRI study aimed to examine psychosocial stress reactions on behavioral, hormonal and neural levels in 31 naturally cycling females, between 15 early follicular (EF) and 16 mid-luteal (ML) females tested with ANDR and placebo treatment in a repeated-measures design. Regardless of odor stimulation, psychosocial stress (i.e., mental arithmetic task with social evaluative threat) led to elevated negative mood and anxiety in all females. A negative association of social threat related amygdala activation and competence ratings appeared in ML-females, indicating enhanced threat processing by ANDR, particularly in ML-females who felt less competent early in the stress experience. Further, ML-females showed reduced performance and stronger stress-related hippocampus activation compared to EF-females under ANDR. Hippocampal activation in ML-females also correlated positively with post-stress subjective stress. Contrarily, such patterns were not observed in EF-females or under placebo in either group. Strikingly, unlike passive emotional processing, ANDR in a stressful context decreased cortisol concentration in all females.

In this fMRI study, we investigated emotional reactivity to threat as possible link between provocation and aggression, as well as the neural correlates of this relationship. We hypothesized that emotional reactivity, measured as fear potentiation (FP) of the startle response, would be negatively associated with aggressive behavior and would modulate neural activity during an aggressive interaction. In 30 healthy female participants, FP was measured as the difference between blink amplitudes while watching threatening vs neutral pictures. Participants subsequently engaged in a variant of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP), while being scanned. During the TAP, participants selected a punishment level for either a highly provoking or a nonprovoking opponent. There was no difference in aggressive behavior between participants high and low in FP. However, we found a negative correlation between FP and the neural provocation effect in several regions of a network previously associated with mentalizing including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and the temporo-parietal junction. Independently of the FP variability, aggressive behavior correlated with the provocation effect on activity in the caudate nucleus.

Acute mental stress can activate the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis, eliciting the release of catecholamines (NE and EPI) resulting in the elevation of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Combined stress (psychological and physical) can exacerbate these cardiovascular responses, which may partially contribute to the elevated risk of CVD and increased proportionate mortality risks experienced by some occupations (e.g., firefighting and law enforcement). Studies have supported the benefits of physical activity on physiological and psychological health, including the cardiovascular response to acute stress. Aerobically trained individuals exhibit lower sympathetic nervous system (e.g., HR) reactivity and enhanced cardiovascular efficiency (e.g., lower vascular reactivity and decreased recovery time) in response to physical and/or psychological stress. In addition, resistance training has been demonstrated to attenuate cardiovascular responses and improve mental health. This review will examine stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity and plausible explanations for how exercise training and physical fitness (aerobic and resistance exercise) can attenuate cardiovascular responses to stress.

We examined relations between temperament and false-belief understanding in 102 preschool-age children from China and the United States. Temperament was measured via parental ratings of behavior as well as with physiological measures of children's reactivity (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis reactivity gauged via salivary cortisol). In accord with an emotional reactivity hypothesis, children with certain reactive temperaments--specifically, those who were more aggressive and those who were both socially withdrawn and physiologically reactive--evidenced poorer social-cognition. However, our findings also force amendment to the ontogenetic emotional reactivity hypothesis. For the majority of children in both countries, physiological reactivity predicted more advanced ToM, perhaps by facilitating social engagement and attention to social stimuli.

Holding two such beliefs in mind—one false and one true—is no simple feat, and up until a few years ago, it was generally accepted that such a capacity did not arise until children were 3 to 4 years old. Since then, a flurry of studies, using a variety of interrogation measures, has suggested that much-younger humans might, in fact, possess this capacity, commonly referred to as a theory of mind. Kovács et al. (p. 1830) devised an ingenious behavioral paradigm and applied it both to adults and to infants, which suggests that the representations of others' beliefs are indeed formed in the same way in adults and in infants. Knowledge of what others believe is present in 7-month-old infants. Human social interactions crucially depend on the ability to represent other agents’ beliefs even when these contradict our own beliefs, leading to the potentially complex problem of simultaneously holding two conflicting representations in mind. Here, we show that adults and 7-month-olds automatically encode others’ beliefs, and that, surprisingly, others’ beliefs have similar effects as the participants’ own beliefs. In a visual object detection task, participants’ beliefs and the beliefs of an agent (whose beliefs were irrelevant to performing the task) both modulated adults’ reaction times and infants’ looking times. Moreover, the agent’s beliefs influenced participants’ behavior even after the agent had left the scene, suggesting that participants computed the agent’s beliefs online and sustained them, possibly for future predictions about the agent’s behavior. Hence, the mere presence of an agent automatically triggers powerful processes of belief computation that may be part of a “social sense” crucial to human societies."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 685, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145454261', 'name': 'Á.

The eyeblink startle was recorded both during the affective foregrounds and during intertrial intervals. HRV was assessed during a resting baseline and relationships between HRV and startle magnitudes examined. Results indicated that resting HRV was inversely related to startle magnitude during both intertrial intervals and affective foregrounds. In addition, the participants with the highest HRV showed the most differentiated emotion-modulated startle effects, whereas those with the lowest HRV, compared to those with the highest HRV, showed significantly potentiated startle to neutral foregrounds and marginally potentiated startle to pleasant foregrounds. The findings are consistent with models that posit that prefrontal cortical activity modulates subcortical motivation circuits. These results have important implications for the use of startle probe methodology and for HRV in the study of emotional regulation and dysregulation.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 181, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1401562002', 'name': 'E.

To evaluate the short-term reproducibility of heart rate, oscillometrically determined blood pressure, antecubital venous plasma catecholamine concentrations and subjective responses to strictly standardized mental arithmetic, we performed two identical tests 1 h apart in 14 young, healthy and normotensive male subjects (age 22-35 years). 2. Heart rate and blood pressure responses to the two stress tests were highly correlated, when expressed both as correlations between levels attained during stress (rs greater than 0.80 throughout) and as absolute reactivity measures (all rs greater than 0.75). Also, subjective stress responses were highly correlated, when considering both levels during stress and reactivity (r = 0.97 and r = 0.85, respectively). Stress levels of catecholamines were correlated, but the change scores (reactivity) were unrelated. 3. The measurement error SD for heart rate was 2.6 and 3.0 beats/min for reactivity and stress levels, respectively. The corresponding SD for blood pressure ranged between 2.7 and 4.4 mmHg. Subjective stress experience showed an SD of a similar magnitude. The responses of plasma catecholamine concentrations were subject to considerable variability. 4.

The program was assessed to determine if it improved social skills at school and home, and whether improvements were maintained. Methods: Eighty-four students participated. Key outcomes were parent and teacher ratings of emotion regulation, social skills, and direct child social problem-solving measures. The standard school curriculum served as the control condition. Phase 1 was a two-group waitlist-control comparison of SAS versus the standard curriculum. Phase 2 was a follow up of all participants before and after the intervention and at 12-months post-intervention. Results: Parent and child measures improved after the intervention but not in the waitlist condition. Improvements in parent, child, and teacher measures were apparent at 12 months. Conclusions: The SAS Program warrants further research as a potential program for schools that serve children with ASD.",2018,61,29,"{'name': 'Journal of Intellectual & Developmental Disability',

This study compares child outcomes of two social skills interventions conducted in schools with children in Kindergarten through fifth grade.\n\n\nMETHOD\nChildren with ASD were randomized to one of two interventions that varied on group composition (mixed typical and ASD vs. all ASD or social difficulties) and intervention approach (didactic SKILLS based vs. activity-based ENGAGE groups). Interventions were implemented at school for 8 weeks (16 sessions) with an 8-week follow-up. Innovative measures of peer nomination and playground peer engagement, as well as teacher reports of child behavior problems and teacher-child relationship were analyzed for 137 children with ASD across four sites.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOn the primary outcome of social network connections from the peer nomination measure, there was no main effect of treatment, but there were moderator effects. Children with low teacher-child closeness or high conflict improved more in their social connections if they received the SKILLS intervention, whereas children with higher teacher-child closeness improved more if they received the ENGAGE intervention. Only two secondary outcome measures yielded significant effects of treatment. Children in the SKILLS groups increased peer engagement and decreased isolation during recess. Child behavior problems and teacher-child closeness moderated peer engagement such that children with higher behavior problems and lower closeness benefitted more from SKILLS groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that social skills groups conducted at school can affect both peer engagement during recess as well as peer acceptability.

UOT is contextually-based because it is implemented in school and at home, the contexts in which a child uses EF skills.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of UOT compared with a social skills intervention (SS), 3rd-5th graders with ASD (mean IQ\xa0=\xa0108; UOT n\xa0=\xa047; SS n\xa0=\xa020) received interventions delivered by school staff in small group sessions. Students were matched for gender, age, race, IQ, ASD symptomotolgy, medication status, and parents' education. Interventions were matched for 'dose' of intervention and training. Measures of pre-post change included classroom observations, parent/teacher report, and direct child measures of problem-solving, EF, and social skills. Schools were randomized and evaluators, but not parents or teachers, were blinded to intervention type.\n\n\nRESULTS\nInterventions were administered with high fidelity. Children in both groups improved with intervention, but mean change scores from pre- to postintervention indicated significantly greater improvements for UOT than SS groups in: problem-solving, flexibility, and planning/organizing. Also, classroom observations revealed that participants in UOT made greater improvements than SS participants in their ability to follow rules, make transitions, and be flexible. Children in both groups made equivalent improvements in social skills.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data support the effectiveness of the first contextually-based EF intervention for children with ASD.

ADDM surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase consists of screening and abstracting comprehensive evaluations performed by professional providers in the community. Multiple data sources for these evaluations include general pediatric health clinics and specialized programs for children with developmental disabilities. In addition, most ADDM Network sites also review and abstract records of children receiving special education services in public schools. The second phase involves review of all abstracted evaluations by trained clinicians to determine ASD surveillance case status. A child meets the surveillance case definition for ASD if a comprehensive evaluation of that child completed by a qualified professional describes behaviors consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for any of the following conditions: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (including atypical autism), or Asperger disorder. This report provides updated prevalence estimates for ASD from the 2010 surveillance year. In addition to prevalence estimates, characteristics of the population of children with ASD are described.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor 2010, the overall prevalence of ASD among the ADDM sites was 14.7 per 1,000 (one in 68) children aged 8 years. Overall ASD prevalence estimates varied among sites from 5.7 to 21.9 per 1,000 children aged 8 years. ASD prevalence estimates also varied by sex and racial/ethnic group. Approximately one in 42 boys and one in 189 girls living in the ADDM Network communities were identified as having ASD. Non-Hispanic white children were approximately 30% more likely to be identified with ASD than non-Hispanic black children and were almost 50% more likely to be identified with ASD than Hispanic children. Among the seven sites with sufficient data on intellectual ability, 31% of children with ASD were classified as having IQ scores in the range of intellectual disability (IQ ≤70), 23% in the borderline range (IQ = 71-85), and 46% in the average or above average range of intellectual ability (IQ >85). The proportion of children classified in the range of intellectual disability differed by race/ethnicity. Approximately 48% of non-Hispanic black children with ASD were classified in the range of intellectual disability compared with 38% of Hispanic children and 25% of non-Hispanic white children. The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 53 months and did not differ significantly by sex or race/ethnicity.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThese findings from CDC's ADDM Network, which are based on 2010 data reported from 11 sites, provide updated population-based estimates of the prevalence of ASD in multiple communities in the United States. Because the ADDM Network sites do not provide a representative sample of the entire United States, the combined prevalence estimates presented in this report cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the United States population. Consistent with previous reports from the ADDM Network, findings from the 2010 surveillance year were marked by significant variations in ASD prevalence by geographic area, sex, race/ethnicity, and level of intellectual ability. The extent to which this variation might be attributable to diagnostic practices, underrecognition of ASD symptoms in some racial/ethnic groups, socioeconomic disparities in access to services, and regional differences in clinical or school-based practices that might influence the findings in this report is unclear.\n\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTION\nADDM Network investigators will continue to monitor the prevalence of ASD in select communities, with a focus on exploring changes within these communities that might affect both the observed prevalence of ASD and population-based characteristics of children identified with ASD. Although ASD is sometimes diagnosed by 2 years of age, the median age of the first ASD diagnosis remains older than age 4 years in the ADDM Network communities. Recommendations from the ADDM Network include enhancing strategies to address the need for 1) standardized, widely adopted measures to document ASD severity and functional limitations associated with ASD diagnosis; 2) improved recognition and documentation of symptoms of ASD, particularly among both boys and girls, children without intellectual disability, and children in all racial/ethnic groups; and 3) decreasing the age when children receive their first evaluation for and a diagnosis of ASD and are enrolled in community-based support systems."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 2805, 'authors': [{'authorId': '123588846', 'name': 'J.

The study’s inclusionary criteria include a setting of public schools, participants aged between 12 and 22 years, and the investigation of an antecedent-, consequence-, self-management-, or video-based intervention strategy to influence skills or behaviors in students. A total of 34 studies met these criteria. The procedures of the What Works Clearinghouse Standards for Single-Case Designs and Evidence are used to evaluate whether sufficient high-quality research in using antecedent-, consequence-, self-management-, and video-based strategies exists to consider these evidence-based practices.

Social skills groups are a common intervention for individuals with ASD. Although a frequently recommended practice, the few studies that have addressed the efficacy of social skills groups have shown mixed results.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the effectiveness of social skills groups for improving social competence, social communication, and quality of life for people with ASD who are six to 21 years of age.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the following databases in December 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 50, 2011), PsycINFO (1887 to December Week 2, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), OCLC WorldCat (12 December 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 16 December 2011), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (20 December 2011). We also searched the reference lists of published papers.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population. No differences were found between treatment and control groups in relation to emotional recognition (ES = 0.34, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.21) assessed in two studies or social communication as related to the understanding of idioms (ES = 0.05, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.72, P = 0.89), which was assessed in only one study. Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported. Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere is some evidence that social skills groups can improve social competence for some children and adolescents with ASD.

A long-term follow-up study comprising a parent survey of satellite class graduates and four detailed case studies was undertaken to determine whether these classes led to successful placement of students with ASD in more inclusive educational settings. Results indicated that a majority of graduates remained placed in more inclusive educational settings. Overall, parents were satisfied with the programme.

Core autism behaviours are typically present in early childhood, but are not always apparent until the circumstances of the child or young person change—for example, when the child goes to nursery or primary school or moves to secondary school.

Respondents also provided information on sociodemographics and their use of mental health services.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 7461 adult participants who provided a complete phase 1 interview, 618 completed phase 2 diagnostic assessments. The weighted prevalence of ASD in adults was estimated to be 9.8 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 3.0-16.5). Prevalence was not related to the respondent's age. Rates were higher in men, those without educational qualifications, and those living in rented social (government-financed) housing. There was no evidence of increased use of services for mental health problems.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nConducting epidemiologic research on ASD in adults is feasible. The prevalence of ASD in this population is similar to that found in children. The lack of an association with age is consistent with there having been no increase in prevalence and with its causes being temporally constant.

A second interest was to evaluate whether more intensive parent involvement would increase the child's ability to manage anxiety outside of the clinic setting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeventy-one children aged ten to twelve years were recruited to participate in the anxiety programme. All children were diagnosed with AS and the presence of anxiety symptoms was accepted on parent report via brief interview. Children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: intervention for child only, intervention for child and parent, wait-list control.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe two intervention groups demonstrated significant decreases in parent-reported anxiety symptoms at follow-up and a significant increase in the child's ability to generate positive strategies in an anxiety-provoking situation. There were a number of significant differences between the two interventions to suggest parent involvement as beneficial.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe sample of children with AS in this study presented with a profile of anxiety similar to a sample of clinically diagnosed anxious children. The intervention was endorsed by parents as a useful programme for children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and exhibiting anxiety symptoms, and active parent involvement enhanced the usefulness of the programme.

35,4e413298a71799a6088c973ad8eb4a2cf3f107cb,Individual differences in valence bias: fMRI evidence of the initial negativity hypothesis,"Abstract Facial expressions offer an ecologically valid model for examining individual differences in affective decision-making. They convey an emotional signal from a social agent and provide important predictive information about one’s environment (presence of potential rewards or threats). Although some expressions provide clear predictive information (angry, happy), others (surprised) are ambiguous in that they predict both positive and negative outcomes. Thus, surprised faces can delineate an individual’s valence bias, or the tendency to interpret ambiguity as positive or negative. Our initial negativity hypothesis suggests that the initial response to ambiguity is negative, and that positivity relies on emotion regulation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing brain activity during explicit emotion regulation (reappraisal) and while freely viewing facial expressions, and measuring the relationship between brain activity and valence bias. Brain regions recruited during reappraisal showed greater activity for surprise in individuals with an increasingly positive valence bias. Additionally, we linked amygdala activity with an initial negativity, revealing a pattern similarity in individuals with negative bias between viewing surprised faces and maintaining negativity. Finally, these individuals failed to show normal habituation to clear negativity. These results support the initial negativity hypothesis, and are consistent with emotion research in both children and adult populations.",2018,95,34,"{'name': 'Social Cognitive and Affective

For example, although some facial expressions (e.g. happy, angry) convey a clear affective meaning, others (e.g. surprise) are ambiguous, in that their meaning is determined by the context. Here, we used mouse-tracking to examine the underlying process of resolving uncertainty. Previous work has suggested an initial negativity, in part via faster response times for negative than positive ratings of surprise. We examined valence categorizations of filtered images in order to compare faster (low spatial frequencies; LSF) versus more deliberate processing (high spatial frequencies; HSF). When participants categorised faces as “positive”, they first exhibited a partial attraction toward the competing (“negative”) response option, and this effect was exacerbated for HSF than LSF faces. Thus, the effect of response conflict due to an initial negativity bias was exaggerated for HSF faces, likely because these images allow for greater deliberation than the LSFs. These results are consistent with the notion that more positive categorizations are characterised by an initial attraction to a default, negative response.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 11, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144448112', 'name': 'M.

However, little research has examined the relationship between PA and decision-making within emotionally ambiguous contexts. The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between reported amount and intensity of PA and interpretations of emotional ambiguity. Methods Adults (n = 611) recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk were assessed on their interpretations of ambiguous and clear (unambiguous) emotional stimuli and reported habitual PA and exercise. Results More positive ratings of ambiguity were associated with greater amount of vigorous activity (p = .002), but not with moderate activity (p = .826) or walking (p = .673). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that this relationship between vigorous PA and positive interpretations of ambiguity was most pronounced when comparing individuals who reported any amount of vigorous PA to those who reported no vigorous activity at all. Conclusions Our findings suggest that higher amounts of vigorous, but not moderate, PA are associated with more positive interpretations of ambiguity, and that even small amounts of PA seem to be sufficient to promote this more positive valence bias when compared to individuals conducting no vigorous PA at all. Future work should examine the longitudinal effects of PA among individuals participating in structured activity programs.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144448112', 'name': 'M.

Without a clarifying context, surprise is interpreted as positive by some and negative by others, and this valence bias is stable across time. When compared to fearful expressions, which are consistently rated as negative, surprise and fear share similar morphological features (e.g., widened eyes) primarily in the upper part of the face. Recently, we demonstrated that the valence bias was associated with a specific pattern of eye movements (positive bias associated with faster fixation to the lower part of the face). In this follow-up, we identified two participants from our previous study who had the most positive and most negative valence bias. We used their eye movements to create a moving window such that new participants viewed faces through the eyes of one our previous participants (subjects saw only the areas of the face that were directly fixated by the original participants in the exact order they were fixated; i.e., Simulated Eye-movement Experience). The input provided by these windows modulated the valence ratings of surprise, but not fear faces. These findings suggest there are meaningful individual differences in how people process faces, and that these differences impact our emotional perceptions. Furthermore, this study is unique in its approach to examining individual differences in emotion by creating a new methodology adapted from those used primarily in the vision/attention domain.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 3, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144448112', 'name': 'M.

The amygdala plays a key role in initiating responses to biologically relevant information, such as facial expressions of emotion. While some expressions clearly signal negative (anger) or positive (happy) events, other expressions (e.g. surprise) are more ambiguous in that they can predict either valence, depending on the context. Here, we sought to determine whether unpredictable presentations of ambiguous facial expressions would bias participants to interpret them more negatively. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and facial electromyography (EMG) to characterize responses to predictable vs unpredictable presentations of surprised faces. We observed moderate but sustained increases in amygdala reactivity to predictable presentations of surprised faces, and relatively increased amygdala responses to unpredictable faces that then habituated, similar to previously observed responses to clearly negative (e.g. fearful) faces. We also observed decreased corrugator EMG responses to predictable surprised face presentations, similar to happy faces, and increased responses to unpredictable surprised face presentations, similar to angry faces.

We used a meta-analysis of 397 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography studies (containing 914 experimental contrasts and 6827 participants) to test 3 competing hypotheses about the brain basis of valence: the bipolarity hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by a brain system that monotonically increases and/or decreases along the valence dimension, the bivalent hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by independent brain systems, and the affective workspace hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by a flexible set of valence-general regions.

Despite these individual differences in valence bias, the more automatic interpretation is negative, and positivity appears to require regulation. Interestingly, extant research has shown that there is an age-related positivity effect such that relative to young adults, older adults attend to and remember positive more than negative information. In this report, the authors show that this positivity effect extends to emotional ambiguity (Experiment 1). Eighty participants (aged 19-71, 42 females) rated the valence of images with a clear or ambiguous valence. They found that age correlated with valence bias, such that older adults showed a more positive bias, and they took longer to rate images, than younger adults. They also found that this increase in reaction times was sufficient to bias positivity (Experiment 2). Thirty-four participants (aged 18-28, 24 females) rated ambiguous and clear images, before and after an instruction to delay their RTs. They also found that although ratings among individuals with a positive bias did not change, those with a negative bias became more positive when encouraged to delay. Indeed, participants with the strongest negativity bias showed the greatest increase in RTs. Taken together, this work demonstrates that the valence bias, which represents a stable, trait-like difference across people, can be moved in the positive direction, at least temporarily, when participants are encouraged to take their time and consider alternatives.

Given the hedonic potency of odor stimuli and the amygdala's anatomical proximity to the peripheral olfactory system, we combined high-resolution fMRI with pattern-based multivariate techniques to examine how valence information is encoded in the amygdala. Ten human subjects underwent fMRI scanning while smelling 9 odorants that systematically varied in perceived valence. Representational similarity analyses showed that amygdala codes the entire dimension of valence, ranging from pleasantness to unpleasantness. This unidimensional representation significantly correlated with self-reported valence ratings but not with intensity ratings. Furthermore, within-trial valence representations evolved over time, prioritizing earlier differentiation of unpleasant stimuli. Together, these findings underscore the idea that both spatial and temporal features uniquely encode pleasant and unpleasant odor valence in the amygdala. The availability of a unidimensional valence code in the amygdala, distributed in both space and time, would create greater flexibility in determining the pleasantness or unpleasantness of stimuli, providing a mechanism by which expectation, context, attention, and learning could influence affective boundaries for guiding behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our findings elucidate the mechanisms of affective processing in the amygdala by demonstrating that this brain region represents the entire valence dimension from pleasant to unpleasant. An important implication of this unidimensional valence code is that pleasant and unpleasant valence cannot coexist in the amygdale because overlap of fMRI ensemble patterns for these two valence extremes obscures their unique content. This functional architecture, whereby subjective valence maps onto a pattern continuum between pleasant and unpleasant poles, offers a robust mechanism by which context, expectation, and experience could alter the set-point for valence-based behavior. Finally, identification of spatial and temporal differentiation of valence in amygdala may shed new insights into individual differences in emotional responding, with potential relevance for affective disorders."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 75, 'authors': [{'authorId': '50736596', 'name': 'Jingwen Jin'}, {'authorId': '5175168', 'name': 'C.

These behavioral findings might reflect anxiety-related biases in stimulus representation within the human amygdala. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) together with a continuous adaptation design to investigate the representation of faces from three expression continua (surprise-fear, sadness-fear, and surprise-sadness) within the amygdala and other brain regions implicated in face processing. Fifty-four healthy adult participants completed a face expression categorization task. Nineteen of these participants also viewed the same expressions presented using type 1 index 1 sequences while fMRI data were acquired. Behavioral analyses revealed an anxiety-related categorization bias in the surprise-fear continuum alone. Here, elevated anxiety was associated with a more rapid transition from surprise to fear responses as a function of percentage fear in the face presented, leading to increased fear categorizations for faces with a mid-way blend of surprise and fear. fMRI analyses revealed that high trait anxious participants also showed greater representational similarity, as indexed by greater adaptation of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, between 50/50 surprise/fear expression blends and faces from the fear end of the surprise-fear continuum in both the right amygdala and right fusiform face area (FFA). No equivalent biases were observed for the other expression continua. These findings suggest that anxiety-related biases in the processing of expressions intermediate between surprise and fear may be linked to differential representation of these stimuli in the amygdala and FFA.

Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala, but they offer competing visions of how this is accomplished. One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala, whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC, and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions. This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus, and these altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 133, 'citationCount': 1398, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4522200', 'name': 'J.

In this study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the time course of amygdala activity in healthy adults in response to presentation of negative images. We split the amygdala time course into an initial reactivity period and a recovery period beginning after the offset of the stimulus. We find that initial reactivity in the amygdala does not predict trait measures of affective style.

Under typical environmental conditions, prefrontal cortex connections with the amygdala are immature during childhood and become adult-like during adolescence. Rodent models show that maternal deprivation accelerates this development as an ontogenetic adaptation to adversity. Here, we demonstrate that, as in the rodent, children who experienced early maternal deprivation exhibit early emergence of mature amygdala–prefrontal connectivity. Evidence suggests that the adult-like neural phenotype, which is mediated by cortisol levels, confers some degree of enhanced emotion regulation, as maternally deprived youths with adult-like phenotypes are less anxious than their counterparts with immature phenotypes. Accelerated amygdala–prefrontal development may serve as an ontogenetic adaptation in the human in response to early adversity. Under typical conditions, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) connections with the amygdala are immature during childhood and become adult-like during adolescence. Rodent models show that maternal deprivation accelerates this development, prompting examination of human amygdala–mPFC phenotypes following maternal deprivation. Previously institutionalized youths, who experienced early maternal deprivation, exhibited atypical amygdala–mPFC connectivity. Specifically, unlike the immature connectivity (positive amygdala–mPFC coupling) of comparison children, children with a history of early adversity evidenced mature connectivity (negative amygdala–mPFC coupling) and thus, resembled the adolescent phenotype. This connectivity pattern was mediated by the hormone cortisol, suggesting that stress-induced modifications of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis shape amygdala–mPFC circuitry. Despite being age-atypical, negative amygdala–mPFC coupling conferred some degree of reduced anxiety, although anxiety was still significantly higher in the previously institutionalized group.

An open question is whether ambiguity in social signals (e.g., emotional facial expressions) is processed similarly or whether a unique set of processors come on-line to resolve ambiguity in a social context. Our work has examined ambiguity using surprised facial expressions, as they have predicted both positive and negative outcomes in the past. Specifically, whereas some people tended to interpret surprise as negatively valenced, others tended toward a more positive interpretation. Here, we examined neural responses to social ambiguity using faces (surprise) and nonface emotional scenes (International Affective Picture System). Moreover, we examined whether these effects are specific to ambiguity resolution (i.e., judgments about the ambiguity) or whether similar effects would be demonstrated for incidental judgments (e.g., nonvalence judgments about ambiguously valenced stimuli). We found that a distinct task control (i.e., cingulo-opercular) network was more active when resolving ambiguity. We also found that activity in the ventral amygdala was greater to faces and scenes that were rated explicitly along the dimension of valence, consistent with findings that the ventral amygdala tracks valence.

Negative interpretations are first and fast, but this initial negativity default can be overridden by regulatory control processes that result in positive interpretations. We tested the initial negativity hypothesis by examining positivity-negativity biases during development. We hypothesized that during childhood, the default negativity mode would be more evident than in adulthood and, as a group, children would show a negativity bias when processing ambiguous facial expressions. We examined ratings of two ambiguous expressions, surprised and neutral expressions, from childhood through adolescence and recorded facial corrugator muscle activity, a physiological index of negative appraisals. Surprised faces were rated as conveying clear negative affect by younger participants as indexed by fast RTs and negative ratings, and corrugator data showed a corresponding increase in activity to surprised faces. By adolescence, positive ratings of surprised faces became more frequent and RTs slowed, suggesting that surprised faces were perceived as having more ambiguous meaning. Accordingly, corrugator activity also decreased during adolescence. Neutral faces also produced negative ratings by children, but were also rated as conveying negative affect by older participants. Accordingly, neutral faces also elicited high corrugator activity that was similar to that elicited by negative expressions.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one nontraditional treatment that has demonstrated efficacy in treating other mood and anxiety disorders, and preliminary data suggest its efficacy in SAD as well.\n\n\nMETHOD\nFifty-six adults (52% female; 41% Caucasian; age mean [M] ± standard deviation [SD]: 32.8 ± 8.4) with SAD were randomized to MBSR or an active comparison condition, aerobic exercise (AE). At baseline and post-intervention, participants completed measures of clinical symptoms (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Perceived Stress Scale) and subjective well-being (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Self-Compassion Scale, and UCLA-8 Loneliness Scale). At 3 months post-intervention, a subset of these measures was readministered.

Extremely shy, or inhibited individuals, are typically slow to acclimate to new people, a behavioral pattern that may reflect slower habituation to novelty. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine habituation to neutral faces in 39 young adults with either an extreme inhibited or extreme uninhibited temperament. Our investigation focused on two key brain regions involved in response to novelty—the amygdala and the hippocampus. Habituation to neutral faces in the amygdala and hippocampus differed significantly by temperament group. Individuals with an uninhibited temperament demonstrated habituation in both the amygdala and hippocampus, as expected. In contrast, in individuals with an inhibited temperament, the amygdala and hippocampus failed to habituate across repeated presentations of faces. The failure of the amygdala and hippocampus to habituate to faces represents a novel neural substrate mediating the behavioral differences seen in individuals with an inhibited temperament.

Across both age groups, cognitive reappraisal activated prefrontal regions similar to those reported in prior studies of emotion regulation, while emotional experience activated the bilateral amygdala. Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and amygdala demonstrated greater inverse connectivity during the 'Reappraise' condition relative to the 'Experience' condition. The only regions exhibiting significant age differences were the left IFG and the left superior temporal gyrus, for which greater regulation-related activation was observed in younger adults.

The authors recently reported that in healthy volunteers the pregenual anterior cingulate regulates emotional conflict on a trial-by-trial basis by dampening activity in the amygdala. The authors also showed that this process is specific to the regulation of emotional, compared to nonemotional, conflict. Here the authors examined whether this form of noninstructed emotion regulation is perturbed in generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n\nMETHOD\nSeventeen patients with generalized anxiety disorder and 24 healthy comparison subjects underwent functional MRI while performing an emotional conflict task that involved categorizing facial affect while ignoring overlaid affect label words.

The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare 31 adolescents (917 years old) and 30 adults (2140 years old) on activation to fearful faces in the amygdala and other regions implicated in face processing. Moreover, these data were used to compare patterns of amygdala functional connectivity in adolescents and adults. During passive viewing, adolescents demonstrated greater amygdala and fusiform activation to fearful faces than did adults. Functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus in adults than in adolescents. Within each group, variability in age did not correlate with amygdala response, and sex-related developmental differences in amygdala response were not found. Eye movement data collected outside of the magnetic resonance imaging scanner using the same task suggested that developmental differences in amygdala activation were not attributable to differences in eye-gaze patterns.

A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of affect labeling was conducted to remedy these limitations. The results indicated that affect labeling, relative to other forms of encoding, diminished the response of the amygdala and other limbic regions to negative emotional images. Additionally, affect labeling produced increased activity in a single brain region, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (RVLPFC). Finally, RVLPFC and amygdala activity during affect labeling were inversely correlated, a relationship that was mediated by activity in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC).

Different activations unique to increasing versus decreasing emotion were observed for positive and negative stimuli: Unique increase-related activations were observed only for positive stimuli, whereas unique decrease-related activations were observed only for negative stimuli. Regulation also modulated activity in the amygdala, a key emotion-processing region. Regulation effects on amygdala activity were larger for positive than for negative stimuli, potentially reflecting a greater malleability of positive emotional reactions.

Both mechanisms are related to a system for control and modulation of visceral function stretching from the spinal cord to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and mediodorsal thalamus, the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the brainstem reticular formation and autonomic nuclei. Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the PAG and hypothalamus coordinate these to produce more concerted responses. The amygdala interacts with the cortical sensory systems in the assessment of fear‐related stimuli and modulates the reflex responses through projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, especially the “medial prefrontal network,” is connected to the amygdala, hypothalamus, and PAG, and allows cortical control over the system in relation to a wider set of emotions. This cortical region is involved both in the assessment of reward and in mood disorders and it plays a central role in the ability to discern the consequences of one's actions and make appropriate behavioral choices. It also forms an interconnected circuit with specific cortical areas in the rostral superior temporal cortex, posterior parahippocampal cortex, and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex.

Thus, activity in the amygdala is greater to fearful facial expressions when contrasted with either neutral or angry faces. Furthermore, directly contrasting fear with angry faces highlighted involvement of the dorsal amygdaloid region.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 636, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1869485', 'name': 'P.

An urban community sample of 205 (114 females, 90 males; 27% minority) children were recruited in elementary school and followed over 10 years. Multiple methods and informants were utilized to assess three major domains of competence from childhood through adolescence (academic achievement, conduct, and peer social competence), multiple aspects of adversity, and major psychosocial resources. Both variable-centered and person-centered analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized significance of resources for resilience. Better intellectual functioning and parenting resources were associated with good outcomes across competence domains, even in the context of severe, chronic adversity. IQ and parenting appeared to have a specific protective role with respect to antisocial behavior. Resilient adolescents (high adversity, adequate competence across three domains) had much in common with their low-adversity competent peers, including average or better IQ, parenting, and psychological well-being. Resilient individuals differed markedly from their high adversity, maladaptive peers who had few resources and high negative emotionality.

Pictures of human faces bearing fearful or happy expressions were presented to 10 normal, healthy subjects by using a backward masking procedure that resulted in 8 of 10 subjects reporting that they had not seen these facial expressions. The backward masking procedure consisted of 33 msec presentations of fearful or happy facial expressions, their offset coincident with the onset of 167 msec presentations of neutral facial expressions. Although subjects reported seeing only neutral faces, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in the amygdala was significantly higher during viewing of masked fearful faces than during the viewing of masked happy faces. This difference was composed of significant signal increases in the amygdala to masked fearful faces as well as significant signal decreases to masked happy faces, consistent with the notion that the level of amygdala activation is affected differentially by the emotional valence of external stimuli. In addition, these facial expressions activated the sublenticular substantia innominata (SI), where signal increases were observed to both fearful and happy faces—suggesting a spatial dissociation of territories that respond to emotional valence versus salience or arousal value.

This paper describes a direct amygdaloid projection to medullary sensory and motor structures involved in cardiovascular regulation, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the dorsal motor nucleus (DVN), by the use of autoradiographic anterograde transport and retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) techniques in rabbits. Since all of these structures are highly heterogeneous structurally and functionally, details of the specific areas of the neuronal origin and efferent distribution of the projection were examined in relation to these features and with reference to a cytoarchitecture description of the relevant forebrain regions in the rabbit. Amygdaloid projections to the NTS and DVN, as determined from HRP experiments, arise from an extensive population of neurons concentrated exclusively within the ipsilateral central nucleus and confined to and distributed throughout a large medial subdivision of this nucleus. Projection neurons, however, also distribute without apparent interruption beyond the amygdala dorsomedially into the sublenticular substantia innominata and the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and thus delineate a single entity of possible anatomical unity across all three structures, extending rostrocaudally within the basal forebrain as a diagonal band. Descending central nucleus connections, based upon autoradiographic experiments, project heavily and extensively to both the NTS and the DVN. Within both nuclei, the projections have a highly specific distribution pattern, appearing to correspond largely to structural subdivisions, including the dorsomedial, medial, ventrolateral, ventral, and commissural NTS, and to cell group “a,” a caudally located dorsomedial region, and peripheral regions of the DVN, some of which appear to be involved in cardiovascular regulation. The existence of such an extensive projection system connecting these specific regions is significant evidence in support to its potential for participation in the amygdaloid expression of cardiovascular influences and has important implications for the cellular analysis of the functional role of these influences.', 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 433, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2087042574', 'name': 'J.

During a critical period of time, however, there is an urgent need for the information contained in this book. I, and others interested in getting the latest update of a rapidly changing field, might do well to push our local libraries to obtain this handy and informative volume. Both William James and Sigmund Freud believed in their time that the neural basis of emotion and memory is a most compelling but elusive area of study. Despite the great advances made in the neurosciences in the last decade, the study of psychobiology is still an unsettled frontier. A wealth of new techniques have, however, finally opened this fundamental area of research to experimental analysis. John Aggleton, of the University of Durham, has assembled a formidable group of clinical and laboratory investigators to present the latest and most exciting findings in the field of psychobiology in The Amygdala: Neurobiological Aspects of Emotion, Memory, and Mental Dysfunction. The amygdala complex, a mass of gray matter located in the medial part of the temporal lobe, is a critical structure in the generation of emotion and memory. Despite abundant evidence implicating the amygdala in affect and memory formation , stress responsivity, epilepsy, senile dementia, schizophrenia, pathologic aggression , and even stomach ulceration, it has been a decade since a book devoted to the subject has been published. But it has been worth the wait. Dr. Aggleton\'s The Amygdala is an authoritative and comprehensive volume, which is essential reading for anyone, whether expert or newcomer, who is interested in emotion and memory. The name of this subcortical structure (from the Latin for almond, a somewhat obscure reference to this structure\'s anatomical appearance) may be less familiar than its better studied cortical cousin, the hippocampus. Nevertheless, both brain areas have been considered allied structures since the time of Pierre Paul Broca, who included both in his le grand lobe limbique over a century ago (and indeed, modern neuroanatomical techniques have revealed abundant connections between the amyg-dala and the hippocampus). In 1952, Paul MacLean, then at Yale University, reintroduced Broca\'s term ""limbic"" for those structures which form an annular ring of tissue on the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres. MacLean elaborated on the Papez theory of 1937 that these limbic structures are involved in the generation of emotion.

The paper outlines a new and broadly inclusive conceptual itinerary for the scientific study of personality development across the human life course. From the standpoint of the person as a social actor, a first line of development runs from the temperament dimensions observed in infancy through the establishment of adult personality traits, tracking a movement toward greater elaboration and regulation of the person’s socio-emotional performance style. A second line of development traces continuity and change in the motivated agent, running from the child’s consolidation of theory of mind, through an age 5–7 shift, to the articulation in adolescence and adulthood of life goals and values. From the perspective of the autobiographical author, a third line of personality development runs from the sharing of episodic memories between preschool children and their parents to the emergence of

A Comparison of Theoretical Perspectives and Empirical Evidence', 'abstract': 'Increasing numbers of empirical studies provide compelling evidence that personality traits change across the entire lifespan. What initiates this continuing personality development and how does this development proceed? In this paper, we compare six theoretical perspectives that offer testable predictions about why personality develops the way it does and identify limitations and potentials of these perspectives by reviewing how they hold up against the empirical evidence. While all of these perspectives have received some empirical support, there is only little direct evidence for propositions put forward by the five–factor theory of personality and the theory of genotype → environment effects. In contrast, the neo–socioanalytic theory appears to offer a comprehensive framework that fits the empirical findings and allows the integration of other, more specialized, perspectives that focus on specific aspects of personality development like the role of time, systematic differences between categories of social roles or the active partake of the person himself or herself. We draw conclusions on the likely driving factors for adult personality development and identify avenues for future research.

When carried out on longitudinal data, behavioural genetic studies also offer promising ways to examine the genetic and environmental origins of personality stability and change. Here, we review the findings of longitudinal twin studies, discuss their implications for our understanding of adult personality development, and point out open questions that need to be addressed by future research. Three general conclusions stand out. First, there is a strong and relatively stable genetic foundation of individual differences in personality throughout the adult life span; second, environmental influences become more important and contribute to an increasing rank–order stability of personality traits from early to middle adulthood; and third, both genetic and nonshared environmental influences contribute to both stability and change in personality traits. Equipped with this knowledge, the most urgent tasks for the next generation of behavioural genetic studies on personality development will be to (i) identify measurable environmental factors that matter and (ii) to capture the interplay between genetic and environmental influences on personality stability and change throughout adulthood.

In the research reported here, we examined how the spread of reputational information through gossip promotes cooperation in mixed-motive settings. Results showed that individuals readily communicated reputational information about others, and recipients used this information to selectively interact with cooperative individuals and ostracize those who had behaved selfishly, which enabled group members to contribute to the public good with reduced threat of exploitation. Additionally, ostracized individuals responded to exclusion by subsequently cooperating at levels comparable to those who were not ostracized.

Personality and temperament are conceptualized as regulatory systems that start as physiological reactivity to environmental features early in life, but are increasingly supplemented by regulation efforts oriented toward reference values such as personal goals and social norms. These reference values change during development as society expects increasingly mature behaviors, but it takes regulatory resources and incremental practice before people can conform to these higher standards.

Diverse lines of research support dyadic morality. First, perceptions of mind are linked to moral judgments: dimensions of mind perception (agency and experience) map onto moral types (agents and patients), and deficits of mind perception correspond to difficulties with moral judgment. Second, not only are moral judgments sensitive to perceived agency and experience, but all moral transgressions are fundamentally understood as agency plus experienced suffering—that is, interpersonal harm—even ostensibly harmless acts such as purity violations. Third, dyadic morality uniquely accounts for the phenomena of dyadic completion (seeing agents in response to patients, and vice versa), and moral typecasting (characterizing others as either moral agents or moral patients).

However, this conclusion is surprising given that there is almost no data on the ability of traits to predict distributions of naturally occurring, representative behaviors of individuals (and that there are many studies showing that traits do indeed predict specific behaviors).

Participants reported traits on typical self-report questionnaires, then described their current behavior multiple times per day for several days as the behavior was occurring. Results show that traits, contrary to expectations, were strongly predictive of individual differences in trait manifestation in behavior, predicting average levels with correlations between .42 and .56 (approaching .60 for stringently restricted studies).

Three principles are involved. First, evolutionary selection pressure predicts a negative age correlation, and, therefore, genome-based plasticity and biological potential decrease with age. Second, for growth aspects of human development to extend further into the life span, culture-based resources are required at ever-increasing levels. Third, because of age-related losses in biological plasticity, the efficiency of culture is reduced as life span development unfolds. Joint application of these principles suggests that the lifespan architecture becomes more and more incomplete with age. Degree of completeness can be defined as the ratio between gains and losses in functioning. Two examples illustrate the implications of the lifespan architecture proposed. The first is a general theory of development involving the orchestration of three component processes: selection, optimization, and compensation. The second considers the task of completing the life course in the sense of achieving a positive balance between gains and losses for all age levels.

Children’s behavioral differences emerge in the first months of life, and those differences become more pronounced and complex as children move through the toddler, preschool, school-age, and adolescent years. In different research contexts, the individual differences that are consistent across time and situations are known as either temperament traits or personality traits. Parents, educators, physicians, mental health workers, and policy makers all ask important questions about these early emerging differences in children: What are the most important individual differences that can be observed in youth? To what extent do children’s personalities change and through what processes? Do the family environment and the broader context make a difference in the formation of children’s personalities? During the past several decades, research on early temperament and personality development has begun to yield answers to these questions. The research addressing these questions has been aided by a growing consensus about what the most important temperament and personality traits are in childhood and adolescence. This chapter reviews current research on temperament and personality trait development. It begins with an introductory section that describes the differences and similarities in how temperament and personality are conceived. The second section turns to a more in-depth discussion of the measurement and structure of temperament and personality traits in childhood and reviews current work on a core set of traits: extraversion–positive emotionality, neuroticism–negative emotionality, conscientiousness–effortful control, agreeableness, and openness to experience–intellect. The third section explores what is known about stability and change in mean levels and rank ordering of traits during childhood and adolescence and reviews some of the work on genetic and environmental sources of change in youth’s traits. The fourth and final section summarizes key findings from the chapter and offers suggestions for future research on the relationship between temperament and personality traits early in life, the structure of youths’ traits, and stability and change in traits during childhood and adolescence.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 113, 'citationCount': 23, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6372265', 'name': 'Rebecca L Shiner'}]}, {'paperId': '139739e7d61fead3aaa81ca87ed72899fc3b2bef', 'title': 'The interplay of personality and self-regulation.', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7305241', 'name': 'R.

We argue in this section that temperament and personality are different ways of describing the same basic traits, with temperament research primarily focused on early-emerging individual differences and personality research focused on individual differences that appear later in childhood and continue into adulthood. In the second section, we describe the current status of the most prominent models of temperament, as well as the most widely-accepted personality trait model, the Big Five. In the third section, we articulate a structural model that integrates contemporary findings on temperament and personality traits from early childhood through adulthood. We use the Big Five trait structure, along with the trait of activity level, to organize this taxonomy. In the fourth section, we discuss the current research on the psychological and biological processes that underlie individual differences in the Big Five traits in childhood and adulthood. In the final sections, we offer concluding thoughts on the nature of personality trait development and suggestions for future research.

They will be interested in his general socio-economic status, his concep tion of self, his attitude toward them, his compe tence, his trustworthiness, etc. Although some of this information seems to be sought almost as an end in itself, there are usually quite practical reasons for acquiring it. Information about the individual helps to define the situation, enabling others to know in advance what he will expect of them and what they may expect of him. Informed in these ways, the others will know how best to act in order to call forth a desired response from him. For those present, many sources of information become accessible and many carriers (or “signvehicles”) become available for conveying this information. If unacquainted with the individual, observers can glean clues from his conduct and appearance which allow them to apply their previ ous experience with individuals roughly similar to the one before them or, more important, to apply untested stereotypes to him. They can also assume from past experience that only individuals of a par ticular kind are likely to be found in a given social setting. They can rely on what the individual says about himself or on documentary evidence he provides as to who and what he is. If they know, or know of, the individual by virtue of experience prior to the interaction, they can rely on assumptions as to the persistence and generality of psychological traits as a means of predicting his present and future behavior. However, during the period in which the indi vidual is in the immediate presence of the others, few events may occur which directly provide the others with the conclusive information they will need if they are to direct wisely their own activity . Many crucial facts lie beyond the time and place of interaction or lie concealed within it. For example, the “true” or “real” attitudes, beliefs, and emotions of the individual can be ascertained only indirectly , through his avowals or through what appears to be involuntary expressive behavior. Similarly , if the individual offers the others a product or service, they will often find that during the interaction there will be no time and place immediately available for eating the pudding that the proof can be found in.

Our dependent variables include observational data regarding the social signals of shame and shame regulation as well as self-assessment questionnaires regarding the felt uneasiness and discomfort in the situation.

We show the potential of our fully automatic virtual human interviewer in a user study, and situate its performance in relation to the Wizard-of-Oz prototype.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 510, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144662324', 'name': 'D.

Both age groups had the highest recognition rates of facial expressions in the congruent context, followed by the neutral context, and recognition rates in the incongruent context were the lowest. These context effects were more pronounced for older adults. Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibited a greater benefit from congruent contextual information, regardless of facial expression.

However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human.

Experiment 2 examined the reception or identification of emotion displays. Participants viewed videos of emotions communicated in unrestricted and restricted conditions and identified the communicated emotions. Emotion identification in restricted conditions was most accurate when participants viewed emotions displayed via the emotion's preferred channel.

The nonverbal behavior of embarrassment was distinct from a related emotion (amusement), resembled the temporal pattern of facial expressions of emotion, was uniquely related to self-reports of embarrassment, and was accurately identified by observers who judged the spontaneous displays of various emotions. Across the judgment studies, observers were more accurate and attributed more emotion to the embarrassment displays of female and AfricanAmerican targets than those of male and Caucasian targets.

Mutual glances were recorded and results showed: (a) Ss, when speaking, looked at E significantly more during the innocuous interview; (b) female Ss looked significantly more regardless of E\'s sex; (c) only sex differences were found in a postexperimental discussion; and (d) female Ss were more affectionate and inclusion oriented. Results are discussed in terms of motives to conceal, cathect, and/or reduce distractions. Mediating effects of personality variables are suggested. This study reports results from an investigation of factors which affect visual interaction, i.e., looks and glances, in groups and dyads. Cherry (1957) points out that there is no communication without a system of signs, and that a sign can be denned as any physical event used in communication, i.e., ""a natural or conventional motion used instead of words to convey information [p. 7]."" Since looking at or away from another is a natural motion and since people characteristically read meanings into such fixations or avoidances, we assume that visual interaction is a form of nonverbal communication.

38,426c35e8bb85ce37cd47d693b1560649154bb279,EmotoTent: Reducing School Violence through Embodied Empathy Games,"EmotoTent is an interactive socio-emotional learning system developed in response to escalating levels of violence, inequality and marginalization in schools seen in the early 21st Century. The system is inspired by advances in biosensing wearables, tattoo displays, brain sensors, robotic agents, artificial intelligence (AI), gestural interaction and 3D holographic displays. By 2030, technological advances will enable us to prototype and investigate questions related to experiential and embodied emotional learning; emotion-based human-computer interaction, affective biosensing, empathetic AI agents, and 3D interactive holographic environments. We envision EmotoTent as a modular, emotion-sensing Holodeck. In the EmotoTent program children learn and practice emotion regulation and empathy with peers, pets and a robotic dog agent in ways that are experiential, embodied and playful. We propose EmotoTent as a core element of a K-6 socio-emotional learning curriculum designed to improve school culture through the enhancement of children's ability to regulate emotions and interact with human and non-human species with empathy and compassion. Enhancing these qualities has been shown to lead to reductions in violence and bullying, racism, gender inequality and other forms of marginalization.

However, it has been limited to the reconstruction with low-level image bases (Miyawaki et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2016) or to the matching to exemplars (Naselaris et al., 2009; Nishimoto et al., 2011). Recent work showed that visual cortical activity can be decoded (translated) into hierarchical features of a deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features (Horikawa & Kamitani, 2017). Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that the generated images resembled the stimulus images (both natural images and artificial shapes) and the subjective visual content during imagery. While our model was solely trained with natural images, our method successfully generalized the reconstruction to artificial shapes, indicating that our model indeed ‘reconstructs’ or ‘generates’ images from brain activity, not simply matches to exemplars. A natural image prior introduced by another deep neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to reconstructions by constraining reconstructed images to be similar to natural images. Furthermore, human judgment of reconstructions suggests the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance visual quality of generated images. The results suggest that hierarchical visual information in the brain can be effectively combined to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 184, 'authors': [{'authorId': '50566024', 'name': 'Guohua Shen'}, {'authorId': '3094859', 'name': 'T.

However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far. We also highlight how the focus on supporting SEL would bring novel opportunities and challenges for HCI, as well as provide a basis for a strong HCI research agenda in this space.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 170, 'citationCount': 69, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2971246', 'name': 'P.

In classrooms and other school settings, children and adolescents need to have skills such as managing negative emotions, being calm and focused, following directions, and navigating relationships with peers and adults. To build and support these skills, schools have widely adopted social and emotional learning (SEL) programs. When well-designed and well-implemented, SEL programs are associated with positive outcomes; however, effect sizes are generally modest even for the most promising interventions. This issue of Social Policy Report proposes that schools should take a new approach: integrating the teaching and reinforcement of SEL skills into their daily interactions and practices with students. It explains that research warrants a new perspective and highlights a range of new approaches and support strategies that are designed to be time-efficient, low-cost, and integrated with (rather than distracting from) academic curricula. These strategies are grounded in an organizing framework for SEL and a review of current programmatic approaches to SEL.

In recent years social neuroscience made considerable progress in revealing the mechanisms that enable a person to feel what another is feeling.

Consistent evidence shows that sharing the emotions of others is associated with activation in neural structures that are also active during the first‐hand experience of that emotion. Part of the neural activation shared between self‐ and other‐related experiences seems to be rather automatically activated. However, recent studies also show that empathy is a highly flexible phenomenon, and that vicarious responses are malleable with respect to a number of factors—such as contextual appraisal, the interpersonal relationship between empathizer and other, or the perspective adopted during observation of the other. Future investigations are needed to provide more detailed insights into these factors and their neural underpinnings.

Self-compassion is an emotionally positive self-attitude that should protect against the negative consequences of self-judgment, isolation, and rumination (such as depression).

Together, the taxonomy and guidelines constitute the Tangible Learning Design Framework.

Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 132, 'citationCount': 1508, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47016130', 'name': 'C.

However, this problem has not been studied in large-scale conversation generation so far. In this paper, we propose Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM) that can generate appropriate responses not only in content (relevant and grammatical) but also in emotion (emotionally consistent). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM addresses the factor using three new mechanisms that respectively (1) models the high-level abstraction of emotion expressions by embedding emotion categories, (2) captures the change of implicit internal emotion states, and (3) uses explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary. Experiments show that the proposed model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion.\n \n', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 624, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144751955', 'name': 'Hao Zhou'}, {'authorId': '1730108', 'name': 'Minlie Huang'}, {'authorId': '50615630', 'name': 'Tianyang Zhang'}, {'authorId': '145213540', 'name': 'Xiaoyan Zhu'}, {'authorId': '2149124481', 'name': 'Bing-Qian Liu'}]}, {'paperId': 'df0402517a7338ae28bc54acaac400de6b456a46', 'title': 'WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio', 'abstract': 'This paper introduces WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating raw audio waveforms.

The model utilizes topics to simulate prior human knowledge that guides them to form informative and interesting responses in conversation, and leverages topic information in generation by a joint attention mechanism and a biased generation probability. The joint attention mechanism summarizes the hidden vectors of an input message as context vectors by message attention and synthesizes topic vectors by topic attention from the topic words of the message obtained from a pre-trained LDA model, with these vectors jointly affecting the generation of words in decoding. To increase the possibility of topic words appearing in responses, the model modifies the generation probability of topic words by adding an extra probability item to bias the overall distribution. Empirical studies on both automatic evaluation metrics and human annotations show that TA-Seq2Seq can generate more informative and interesting responses, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art response generation models.\n \n', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 446, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1399291043', 'name': 'Chen Xing'}, {'authorId': '145717888', 'name': 'Wei Wu'}, {'authorId': '49176273', 'name': 'Yu Wu'}, {'authorId': '2146651412', 'name': 'Jie Liu'}, {'authorId': '9221107', 'name': 'Yalou Huang'}, {'authorId': '143849609', 'name': 'M.

A: Were used to thinking of the Internet like an enormous library, with services like Google providing a universal map. But thats no longer really the case. Sites from Google and Facebook to Yahoo News and the New York Times are now increasingly personalized based on your web history, they filter information to show you the stuff they think you want to see. That can be very different from what everyone else sees or from what we need to see. Your filter bubble is this unique, personal universe of information created just for you by this array of personalizing filters. Its invisible and its becoming more and more difficult to escape. Q: I like the idea that websites might show me information relevant to my interestsit can be overwhelming how much information is available I already only watch TV shows and listen to radio programs that are known to have my same political leaning. Whats so bad about this? A: Its true: Weve always selected information sources that accord with our own views. But one of the creepy things about the filter bubble is that were not really doing the selecting. When you turn on Fox News or MSNBC, you have a sense of what their editorial sensibility is: Fox isnt going to show many stories that portray Obama in a good light, and MSNBC isnt going to the ones that portray him badly. Personalized filters are a different story: You dont know who they think you are or on what basis theyre showing you what theyre showing. And as a result, you dont really have any sense of whats getting edited out or, in fact, that things are being edited out at all. Q: How does money fit into this picture? A: The rush to build the filter bubble is absolutely driven by commercial interests. Its becoming clearer and clearer that if you want to have lots of people use your website, you need to provide them with personally relevant information, and if you want to make the most money on ads, you need to provide them with relevant ads. This has triggered a personal information gold rush, in which the major companies Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, and the like are competing to create the most comprehensive portrait of each of us to drive personalized products. Theres also a whole behavior market opening up in which every action you take online every mouse click, every form entry can be sold as a commodity. Q: What is the Internet hiding from me? A: As Google engineer Jonathan McPhie explained to me, its different for every person and in fact, even Google doesnt totally know how it plays out on an individual level. At an aggregate level, they can see that people are clicking more. But they cant predict how each individuals information environment is altered. In general, the things that are most likely to get edited out are the things youre least likely to click on. Sometimes, this can be a real service if you never read articles about sports, why should a newspaper put a football story on your front page? But apply the same logic to, say, stories about foreign policy, and a problem starts to emerge. Some things, like homelessness or genocide, arent highly clickable but are highly important. Q: Which companies or Websites are personalizing like this? A: In one form or another, nearly every major website on the Internet is flirting with personalization. But the one that surprises people most is Google. If you and I Google the same thing at the same time, we may get very different results. Google tracks hundreds of signals about each of us what kind of computer were on, what weve searched for in the past, even how long it takes us to decide what to click on and uses it to customize our results. When the result is that our favorite pizza parlor shows up first when we Google pizza, its useful. But when the result is that we only see the information that is aligned with our religious or social or political beliefs, its difficult to maintain perspective. Q: Are any sites being transparent about their personalization? A: Some sites do better than others. Amazon, for example, is often quite transparent about the personalization it does: Were showing you Brave New World because you bought 1984. But its one thing to personalize products and another to personalize whole information flows, like Google and Facebook are doing. And very few users of those services are even marginally aware that this kind of filtering is at work. Q: Does this issue of personalization impact my privacy or jeopardize my identity at all? A: Research psychologists have known for a while that the media you consume shapes your identity. So when the media you consume is also shaped by your identity, you can slip into a weird feedback loop. A lot of people see a simple version of this on Facebook: You idly click on an old classmate, Facebook reads that as a friendship, and pretty soon youre seeing every one of John or Sues posts. Gone awry, personalization can create compulsive media media targeted to appeal to your personal psychological weak spots. You can find yourself eating the equivalent of information junk food instead of having a more balanced information diet. Q: You make it clear that while most Websites user agreements say they wont share our personal information, they also maintain the right to change the rules at any time. Do you foresee sites changing those rules to profit from our online personas? A: They already have. Facebook, for example, is notorious for its bait-and-switch tactics when it comes to privacy. For a long time, what you Liked on Facebook was private, and the site promised to keep it that way. Then, overnight, they made that information public to the world, in order to make it easier for their advertisers to target specific subgroups. Theres an irony in the fact that while Rolex needs to get Tom Cruises permission to put his face on a billboard, it doesnt need to get my permission to advertise my endorsement to my friends on Facebook. We need laws that give people more rights in their personal data. Q: Is there any way to avoid this personalization? What if Im not logged into a site? A: Even if youre not logged into Google, for example, an engineer told me there are 57 signals that the site uses to figure out who you are: whether youre on a Mac or PC or iPad, where youre located when youre Googling, etc. And in the near future, itll be possible to fingerprint unique devices, so that sites can tell which individual computer youre using. Thats why erasing your browser cookies is at best a partial solutionit only partially limits the information available to personalizers. What we really need is for the companies that power the filter bubble to take responsibility for the immense power they now have the power to determine what we see and dont see, what we know and dont know. We need them to make sure we continue to have access to public discourse and a view of the common good. A world based solely on things we Like is a very incomplete world. Im optimistic that they can. Its worth remembering that newspapers werent always informed by a sense of journalistic ethics. They existed for centuries without it. It was only when critics like Walter Lippman began to point out how important they were that the newspapers began to change. And while journalistic ethics arent perfect, because of them we have been better informed over the last century. We need algorithmic ethics to guide us through the next. Q: What are the business leaders at Google and Facebook and Yahoo saying about their responsibilities? A: To be honest, theyre frustratingly coy. They tend to frame the trend in the passive tense: Googles Eric Schmidt recently said It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them, rather than Google is making it very hard Mark Zuckerberg perfectly summed up the tension in personalization when he said A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa. But he refuses to engage with what that means at a societal level especially for the people in Africa. Q: Your background is as a political organizer for the liberal Website MoveOn.org. How does that experience inform your book? A: Ive always believed the Internet could connect us all together and help create a better, more democratic world. Thats what excited me about MoveOn here we were, connecting people directly with each other and with political leaders to create change. But that more democratic society has yet to emerge, and I think its partly because while the Internet is very good at helping groups of people with like interests band together (like MoveOn), its not so hot at introducing people to different people and ideas. Democracy requires discourse and personalization is making that more and more elusive. And that worries me, because we really need the Internet to live up to that connective promise. We need it to help us solve global problems like climate change, terrorism, or natural resource management which by their nature require massive coordination, and great wisdom and ingenuity. These problems cant be solved by a person or two they require whole societies to participate. And that just wont happen if were all isolated in a web of one.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 4, 'citationCount': 2874, 'authors': [{'authorId': '96905757', 'name': 'Eli Pariser'}]}, {'paperId': '86f8812b4217bbe3c10f75bb93dcdd320916b4fc', 'title': 'Survey on speech emotion recognition: Features, classification schemes, and databases', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 150, 'citationCount': 1782, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2250665', 'name': 'Moataz M.

This paper describes the hikikomori phenomenon in Japan, considers evidence relating to its prevalence and examines views about the causes. I argue that the tendency to think of hikikomori as a homogeneous group characterised by psychological malaise is misleading and that withdrawal and disengagement can also be linked to changing opportunity structures. The collapse of the primary labour market for young people and the growing prevalence of a precarious secondary sector has led to a situation in which traditional and deep-rooted norms are undermined and young people forced to find new ways of navigating transitions within a highly pressured and rigid system. Under these circumstances, acute withdrawal often represents an anomic response to a situation where tradition no longer provides adequate clues to appropriate behaviour rather than as a malaise reducible to individual psychologies.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 32, 'citationCount': 188, 'authors': [{'authorId': '101069341', 'name': 'A.

The continuous model defines each facial expression of emotion as a feature vector in a face space. This model explains, for example, how expressions of emotion can be seen at different intensities. In contrast, the categorical model consists of C classifiers, each tuned to a specific emotion category. This model explains, among other findings, why the images in a morphing sequence between a happy and a surprise face are perceived as either happy or surprise but not something in between. While the continuous model has a more difficult time justifying this latter finding, the categorical model is not as good when it comes to explaining how expressions are recognized at different intensities or modes. Most importantly, both models have problems explaining how one can recognize combinations of emotion categories such as happily surprised versus angrily surprised versus surprise. To resolve these issues, in the past several years, we have worked on a revised model that justifies the results reported in the cognitive science and neuroscience literature. This model consists of C distinct continuous spaces. Multiple (compound) emotion categories can be recognized by linearly combining these C face spaces. The dimensions of these spaces are shown to be mostly configural. According to this model, the major task for the classification of facial expressions of emotion is precise, detailed detection of facial landmarks rather than recognition. We provide an overview of the literature justifying the model, show how the resulting model can be employed to build algorithms for the recognition of facial expression of emotion, and propose research directions in machine learning and computer vision researchers to keep pushing the state of the art in these areas.

To do so, a computational model is proposed that embraces explicit intentions in the agents that are aimed at increasing the other's relations towards them. The model is inspired in the notion of emotional intelligence, and allows for agents to reason about the emotions of others and perform interpersonal emotion regulation (IER) in order to dynamically create the relations with others. The model was used to build the NPCs of a computer game scenario in NeverWinter Nights 2, where the player is required to work together with two agents to achieve a particular quest. An experiment was then conducted where players interacted with either a version with or without IER. By measuring friendship quality we were able to show that when one of the agents employed IER strategies it was perceived as more friendly according to four out of six dimensions of friendship.",2013,26,24,{'pages': '777-784'},,"[{'authorId': '2151066261', 'name': 'João Dias'}, {'authorId': '145136631', 'name': 'Ana Paiva'}]","[{'paperId': 'f4ec1ad7e047e77979c5fc0ce83a5db1a24d3178', 'title': 'Lie to me: virtual agents that lie', 'abstract': 'In order to deceive, agents need Theory of Mind capabilities (ToM), that is, the capability to model the others, and reason about the consequences of their actions and their implications in them.

Factor analysis confirmed the subscale structure of each questionnaire. The subscales showed high internal consistency, distinguished best from casual friends, and did not covary with social desirability. They did covary with the duration of being a best friend and with a self-esteem subscale regarding close friends, but not with other self-esteem measures. Women reported higher positive feelings for their friend than did men, and evaluated the friend higher on friendship functions. Finally, positive feelings and satisfaction covaried with each friendship function subscale. The research here concerns the development and validation of two multi-scale friendship questionnaires-one concerning a respondent's feelings for a friend and friendship, the other concerning the respondent's assessment of the degree to which the friend fulfills six friendship functions. The studies grew out of work on friendship quality in children and young adolescents (Aboud & Mendelson, 1996; Mendelson, Aboud, & Lanthier, 1994). The goal here was to design measures, based on a similar model of friendship, suitable for late adolescents and young adults. Friendships, like other relationships, vary in quality. Although it is difficult to judge friendship quality in behavioral terms, length of the relationship and reciprocated versus nonreciprocated nominations are gross criterion measures of friendship quality. Furthermore, individuals can specify types of friendships, distinguishing, for example, between best friends, good friends, casual friends, and acquaintances (i.e., nonfriends); and such distinctions are also gross criterion measures of quality. Gender also provides a criterion for validating friendship measures, because there is ample evidence that gender differences do exist, with women's friendships characterized by better overall quality, closeness, enjoyment, intimacy, and nurturance (e.g., Bell, 1991; Jones, 1991; Sapadin, 1988; Wright & Scanlon, 1991). Thus, any friendship measure should be sensitive enough to differentiate women's and men's friendships. At the most general level, relationships can be assessed as positive or negative. In these terms, friendship scales have been developed to assess attachment to the friend and conflict.2 Attachment refers to the special 1This paper was completed in 1997; we subsequently published a brief version (Mendelson & Aboud, 1999).

Indeed, friends often have conflicts, but may nonetheless be able to resolve them equitably and without bad feelings (Hartup, Laursen, Stewart & Eastenson, 1988). Thus, numerous friendship measures have subscales related to conflict or conflict resolution (Bukowski et al., 1994; Furman & Adler, 1982; Furman McGill Friendship Questionnaires 2 feelings that individuals have for a friend. Mutual liking has often been used as a criterion to identify a friend, but a separate subscale may be used to assess liking in greater depth (cf. Bukowski, Hoza, & Boivin, 1994; Sharabany, 1974; Wright, 1991). One of the measures reported here, taps positive feelings for the friend and satisfaction with the friendship, which will be viewed as criterion measures of undifferentiated friendship quality. Although the two measures are conceptually distinct, they should covary highly because they are both assumed to reflect overall friendship quality. However, an important assumption guiding research on friendship is that it is possible to assess specific qualities of friendships. Consideration of the theoretical foundations of various scales suggested that a framework based on friendship functions (Furman & Buhrmester, 1985; Parker & Asher, 1989)--rather than specific behaviors (Bukowski, et al. 1994; Sharabany, Gershoni, & Hofman, 1981) or motives (Wright, 1991)-is preferable for a number of reasons: It provides a broader scope, yields a better ideal for a mature relationship, and makes it possible to develop analogous, if not identical, measures for different developmental stages. Within a functional approach, a friend is seen as a source of certain social, emotional and instrumental resources that a person seeks (Asher & Parker, 1989; Weiss, 1974). In a review of existing measures (Aboud & Mendelson, 1992), we sought to define friendship functions that were theoretically distinct, that distinguished between friends and nonfriends, and that were associated with affection/satisfaction. We identified six relevant functions (stimulating companionship, help, intimacy, reliable alliance, self-validation and, emotional security). It is assumed that individual friends fulfill some, if not all, of these functions, so measures of the different functions should covary. Nonetheless, the following definitions describe what are clearly six conceptually distinguishable functions of friendship: Stimulating Companionship refers to doing things together that arouse enjoyment, amusement, and excitement. This quality seems to be an important expectation of friends at all ages. Some measures have focused mainly on doing things together (Buhrmester, 1990; Bukowski et al., 1994; Parker & Asher, 1989; Sharabany, 1974), but it seems important to stress the fun and excitement in common activities (Jones, 1991; Wright, 1991). Help refers to providing guidance, assistance, information, advice, and other forms of tangible aid necessary to meet needs or goals. Thus, it need not be reciprocal (Jones, 1991). Help has been assessed in specific subscales (Bukowski et al., 1994; Parker & Asher, 1989; Wright, 1991) and it has also been combined with support (Bukowski et al., 1994; Sharabany, 1974). However, the instrumental aspect of support tapped by help is distinguishable from other aspects of support tapped by Emotional Security and Self-Validation. Intimacy refers to sensitivity to the other's needs and states, providing an accepting context in which personal thoughts and feelings can be openly and honestly expressed, and openly and honestly disclosing personal information about oneself. A number of researchers have Intimacy subscales (e.g., Buhrmester & Furman, 1987), although Mannarino (1976) and Buhrmester (1990) assess it as a composite along with companionship. Sharabany's (1974) Sensitivity and Knowing subscale stresses the importance of knowing without any explicit disclosure. Wright (1991) does not include such a subscale except as it pertains to selfaffirmation or the expression of true feelings. Reliable Alliance refers to being able to count on the continuing availability and loyalty of the friend. This was an important dimension underlying Selman's (1980) distinction between a fair-weather friend who would end the relationship if conflict or strains arose and a more durable friend. It is assessed in a specific Conflict and Betrayal subscale (Parker & Asher, 1989) and in a Trust and Loyalty subscale (Sharabany, 1974). Bukowski and colleagues' (1994) Reliable Alliance subscale concerns self-disclosure, which is referred to here & Buhrmester, 1985; Parker and Asher, 1989; Wright, 1991). However, these constructs are not theoretically analogous to the six friendship functions considered here. Therefore, we are currently developing separate instruments to tap negative feelings for a friend and the incidence of conflict and conflict resolution in a friendship. McGill Friendship Questionnaires 3 as Intimacy; but they combine it with a Transcending Problems subscale that is closer to the definition of Reliable Alliance. Self-Validation refers to perceiving the other as reassuring, agreeing, encouraging, listening, and otherwise helping to maintain one's self-image as a competent and worthwhile person. This is often achieved through social comparison and consensual validation of one's attributes and beliefs. Similar items have been referred to as Attachment (Sharabany, 1974), as Ego Support and Self-Affirmation (Wright, 1991), and as Reflected Appraisal (Bukowski et al., 1994), although that was combined with an Affective Bond subscale as part of Closeness. Emotional Security refers to the comfort and confidence provided by the friend in novel or threatening situations. Although the emotional support provided by a friend is considered to be important, only Wright (1991) includes items in a Security subscale to assess perception of the friend as safe and unthreatening because he or she does not betray one's trust or draw attention to one's weaknesses. Besides assessing the respondent's feelings for the friend and satisfaction with the friendship, it seems important to choose between assessing the functions that the friend is perceived to fulfill and the functions that the respondent reportedly fulfills.

Yet considerable research evidence suggests that overly positive selfevaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism are characteristic of normal human thought. Moreover, these illusions appear to promote other criteria of mental health, including the ability to care about others, the ability to be happy or contented, and the ability to engage in productive and creative work. These strategies may succeed, in large part, because both the social world and cognitive-processing mechanisms impose niters on incoming information that distort it in a positive direction; negative information may be isolated and represented in as unthreatening a manner as possible. These positive illusions may be especially useful when an individual receives negative feedback or is otherwise threatened and may be especially adaptive under these circumstances. Decades of psychological wisdom have established contact with reality as a hallmark of mental health. In this view, the well-adjusted person is thought to engage in accurate reality testing, whereas the individual whose vision is clouded by illusion is regarded as vulnerable to, if not already a victim of, mental illness. Despite its plausibility, this viewpoint is increasingly difficult to maintain (cf. Lazarus, 1983). A substantial amount of research testifies to the prevalence of illusion in normal human cognition (see Fiske& Taylor, 1984;Greenwald, 1980; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Sackeim, 1983; Taylor, 1983). Moreover, these illusions often involve central aspects of the self and the environment and, therefore, cannot be dismissed as inconsequential. In this article, we review research suggesting that certain illusions may be adaptive for mental health and well-being. In particular, we examine evidence that a set of interrelated positive illusions—namely, unrealistically positive self-evaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism—can serve a wide variety of cognitive, affective, and social functions.

It has, of course, been a central concept within symbolic interactionism since the seminal writings of Mead ( 1934), Cooley (1902), and James ( 1890). However, even within this sociological tradition there has been a revitalization of interest in the self-concept: with developments in role theory (Turner 1978; Gordon 1976), with the increasing focus on the concept of identity (McCall & Simmons 1978; Stryker 1980; Gordon 1968; Guiot 1977; Burke 1980), with the reemergence of interest in social structure and person\xad ality (House 198 1 ; Turner 1976; Kohn 1969, 198 1 ; Rosenberg 1979), and with the reconceptualization of small group experimental situations (Alexander and colleagues 197 1 , 1 98 1 ; Webster & Sobieszek 1974). The reemergence of the self-concept is even more dramatic within psycho\xad logical social psychology. Much of this revitalization of interest in self\xad phenomena (e.g. self-awareness, self-esteem, self-image, self-evaluation) is due to the ""cognitive revolution"" in psychology (Dember 1974; Manis 1977), generally at the expense of behaviorism. As a result, the self-concept has become conspicuous in areas and traditions that were previously considered alien terrain: within behaviorism via Bern\'s ( 1972) theory of self-attribution; within social learning theory via Bandura\'s ( 1977) focus on self-efficacy; and within cognitive dissonance theory via Aronson\'s ( 1968) and Bramel\'s ( 1968) reformulations. It is also increasingly evident in theories of attitude and value formation and change (Rokeach 1973, 1979), in attribution theory (Epstein. 1973; Bowerman 1978), and in various other recent theories of cognitive', 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 1121, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3554198', 'name': 'V.

This has led to a truly interdisciplinary, mutually beneficial partnership between emotion research in psychology and in computational science, of which this volume is an exemplar. To understand this partnership and its potential for transforming existing practices in emotion research across disciplines and for disclosing important novel areas of research, we explore in this chapter the history of work in computational models of emotion including the various uses to which they have been put, the theoretical traditions that have shaped their development, and how these uses and traditions are reflected in their underlying architectures. For an outsider to the field, the last 15 years have seen the development of a seemingly bewildering array of competing and complementary computational models. Figure 1.2.1 lists a ‘family tree’ of a few of the significant models and the theoretical traditions from which they stem. Although there has been a proliferation of work, the field is far from mature: the goals that a model is designed to achieve are not always clearly articulated; research is rarely incremental, more often returning to motivating theories rather than extending prior computational approaches; and rarely are models contrasted with each other in terms of their ability to achieve their set goals. Contributing to potential confusion is the reality that computational models are complex systems embodying a number of, sometimes unarticulated, design decisions and assumptions inherited from the psychological and computational traditions from which they emerged, a circumstance made worse by the lack of a commonly accepted lexicon even for designating these distinctions. In this chapter, we lay out the work on computational models of emotion in an attempt to reveal the common uses to which they may be put and the underlying techniques and assumptions from which the models are built. Our aim is to present conceptual distinctions and common terminology that can aid in discussion and comparison of competing models. Our hope is that this will not only facilitate an understanding of the field for outside researchers but work towards a lexicon that can help foster the maturity of the field towards more incremental research. In characterizing different computational models of emotion, we begin by describing interdisciplinary uses to which computational models may be put, including their uses in improving human–computer interaction, in enhancing general models of intelligence, and as methodological tools for furthering our understanding of human behaviour. We next discuss how models have been built, including the underlying theoretical traditions that have shaped their development. These differing theoretical perspectives often conceptualize emotion in quite different ways, emphasizing different scenarios and proposed functions, different component processes, and different linkages between these components.

One major limitation of this approach has been that it fails to incorporate characters’ psychology, and as a consequence important aesthetic aspects of the narrative cannot be easily captured by Interactive Storytelling. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to Interactive Storytelling which aims at reconciling narrative actions with the characters’ attributed psychology as stated in the narrative. Our long-term goal is to be able to explore Interactive Storytelling for those narrative genres which are based on the characters’ psychology rather than solely on their actions. We used as a starting point the formalisation by Flaubert himself of his novel Madame Bovary, which includes a detailed account of character’s desires and feelings. We describe a prototype in which characters’ behaviour is driven by a real-time searchbased planning system applying operators whose content is based on a specific inventory of feelings. Furthermore, the actual pattern of evolution of the character’s plan, as measured through the variation of the search heuristic, is used to confer a sense of awareness to the characters, which can be used to generate feelings about its overall situation, from feelings of boredom to hope, despair and helplessness.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 28, 'citationCount': 42, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1691265', 'name': 'D.

Appraisals and emotions thus do not stand in such a clear relationship as appraisal theory would suggest. Fourth, the authors argue that a more or less complete evaluation of the role of appraisal in emotion elicitation requires extending the domain of dependent variables currently used in this context.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 131, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49584958', 'name': 'N.

42,036282ecd64951b99061aba6abd859a61e58d811,The Emotional Development of Exceptional Students,"I. All behavior has two essential characteristics one cognitive or structural, and one affective, having to do with energy. Both cognition and affect are adaptive. 2. Each of us is both an agent and an object. As an agent, we structure our personal identities and our worlds of other agents and objects. 3. Emotions are personal-social constructions having three components: a cognitive appraisal, an alteration of affect, and a terminal action. 4. Development is a product of maturation, physical and social experience, and self-regulation. 5. Human infants become human beings in relationships with other human beings and in no other way.",1989,32,5,"{'name': 'Focus on Exceptional Children', 'pages': '1-10', 'volume': '21'}","{'model':

My reply is in two parts. First, I discuss the boundaries of emotion as a phenomenon and whether sensory preferences can be regarded as emotions; second, I make an analysis of the evidence Zajonc regards as supporting his claims for the independence of cognition and emotion and the primacy of emotion. My aims are to sharpen the philosophical and empirical issues that underlie our disagreement and to emphasize the indeterminancy of the issue of cognitive versus emotional primacy. This latter issue is less important than the task of exploring the cognitive contents or meanings that shape each kind of emotional reaction. Finally, I offer a brief programmatic statement about what cognitivists can do to advance our understanding of emotion over the life course. The latest riposte by Zajonc (1984) has, in my view, not helped to clarify our understanding of the relationship between cognition and emotion. Zajonc takes my reasoning (Lazarus, 1982) to task in two major ways. First he complains that my position cannot be falsified because I defined emotion as requiring cognitive appraisal, then that I have ignored the evidence that emotion can occur without cognitive activity, which he cites. I believe he is wrong about my epistemological position and wrong that the evidence supports the primacy of emotion or its independence from cognition. The body of this reply consists of a discussion of the definitional issue and why I think the empirical case he makes is specious. My objective is to sharpen the issue and sustain my position and that of like-minded cognitivists. The Definitional Issue Definitions do not arise out of the blue; they are an integral part of a theory that helps delimit the phenomena of interest and organize observations. In my view, emotion reflects a constantly changing personenvironment relationship. When central life agendas (e.g., biological survival, personal and social values and goals) are engaged, this relationship becomes a source of emotion. Therefore, an emotional experience cannot be understood solely in terms of what happens inside the person or in the brain, but grows out of ongoing transactions with the environment that are evaluated. Cognitive activity is a necessary precondition of emotion because to experience an emotion, people must comprehend—whether in the form of a primitive evaluative perception or a highly differentiated symbolic process—that their well-being is implicated in a transaction, for better or worse. A creature that is oblivious to the significance of what is happening for its well-being does not react with an emotion. This same point has been stated cogently in various ways by numerous multidisciplinary scholars who responded recently to an article on a general psychobiological theory of emotions by Panksepp (1982) appearing in The Behavioral and Brain Sciences. The conception that the meaning or significance of a transaction is crucial to emotion forces us to restrict its definition to some psychophysiological phenomena and to reject others as outside its purview. The searching question is what an emotion is or is not. Zajonc evades this question. Thus, he takes me to task for doing what any good theorist should do with definitions, but he does not do himself—namely, specify the phenomena of interest. Emotion, for example, is not just physiological arousal, though such arousal is one of the traditional defining attributes. Arousal can be produced by exercising vigorously or entering a hot or cold room. Doing this will produce an emotion only if we appraise the encounter (e.g., the physical and social conditions and the bodily state it produces) as having a bearing on our well-being, as when, for example, it presents some physical danger or brings blissful relief from discomfort. Startle is a reaction that has long but erroneously been included under the rubric of emotion. Ekman (in press) presents new experimental evidence that startle might better be regarded as a reflex, like the knee jerk, because it does not behave as do other reactions we call emotions. He examined facial and bodily responses under four conditions: when subjects did not know at what moment a blank pistol would be fired; when they did know the moment; when they tried to inhibit the startle reaction; and when they attempted to simulate a genuine startle. Ekman contrasted emotions with startle. He found that the startle was easy to elicit and was consistently the initial response to a gunshot; in contrast, there is no single elicitor that will always call forth the same emotion in adults. Moreover, the startle response could not 124 February 1984 • American Psychologist Copyright 1984 by the American Psychological Association, Inc. Vol. 39, No. 2, 124-129 be totally inhibited; in contrast, emotions can. Nor could the startle be simulated correctly by any subject. On the basis of these findings, the startle response seems fixed and rigid in comparison to emotions, and once elicited it seems to run its course. Thus, from the perspective of a relational and cognitive conceptualization of emotion, I think we should exclude startle from the rubric of emotion, as I advocated in my earlier discussion in this journal (Lazarus, 1982). Historically, there has been much concern about diverse phenomena for which emotion terms are employed, such as moods, sentiments, emotion traits, and actual emotional reactions (cf. Ortony & Clore, 1981). Moods usually refer to sustained general states, such as sadness and contentment, that may or may not be considered emotions depending on theoretical and definitional conventions. Sentiments refer to characteristic ways a person evaluates an object (person, idea, thing); they operate as dispositions to react emotionally to that object but are not in themselves emotions. Another questionable category of emotion consists of personality traits, such as cheerful, which could in some instances describe an actual emotion, as in ""I feel cheerful,"" but could in other instances describe a trait, not an actual emotional response, as in ""I am a cheerful person."" Some emotion terms are heavily detached, lukewarm, or cold, such as interested, whereas others, such as enraged, are hot. As Ortony and Clore pointed out, it makes a considerable difference how such terms are used by subjects in emotion research. In the 1940s and 1950s, a period characterized by the scientific outlook sometimes called logical positivism, the dominant view in psychology was that emotions could not be defined and studied as such but represented intervening variables (cf. Brown & Farber, 1951; Lazarus, 1968; Lazarus, Kanner, & Folkman, 1980). Although similar attitudes still exist, the more restrictive treatment of emotions in the past has given way to a view that allows much greater latitude in their study; this view depends heavily on what subjects report, but can be supplemented by simultaneous assessments of behavioral and physiological response variables. Emotions are commonly conceptualized and studied as an organic mix of action impulses and bodily expressions, diverse positive or dysphoric (subjective) cognitive-affective states, and physiological disturbances. Although there are arguments about whether these physiological disturbances are diffuse or patterned, an emotion is not I acknowledge with appreciation several valued colleagues who carefully read, criticized, and made suggestions on an earlier draft of this article. They include Paul Ekman, Susan Folkman, Barbara Mellers, and Philip Tetlock; Carol Carr warrants special mention for her skilled editorial assistance. Regrettably, acute limitations in our resources dictate that reprints will not be available. definable solely by behavior, subjective reports, or physiological changes; its identification requires all three components, since each one can be generated by conditions that do not necessarily elicit emotion, as in the example of arousal by exercise given above. An emotion researcher must worry about which response states or processes can be called emotions and which cannot; meeting one or even two of the three response criteria is not enough. With respect to the debate between Zajonc and me, a critical question is, On what basis should preferences (e.g., for taste, smell, or photographs of faces) be regarded as emotions? We must ask a similar question about aesthetic reactions to a pretty picture, a pleasing sunset, a stirring piece of music, or a fine piece of literature. Some years ago, while examining emotion and feeling in psychology and art, Arnheim (1958) pointed out that emotion in artistic experience is not merely a passive receipt or apprehension of information, but requires active, involved participation. As with sensory preferences, what may pass for an emotional (aesthetic) response may be nothing more than a pro forma statement that implies emotion but does not necessarily reflect it, as when one casually says, ""That\'s a pretty picture"" in a manner more indicative of labeling than emotion. Although preferences can involve emotions, even strong ones, they often seem to fall at the ambiguous borderline between emotion and nonemotion. On the one hand, statements of preference can be ""cold cognitions"" expressing merely a social requirement to make a choice, or on the other hand, they can be expressions of genuine emotional involvement. In the research Zajonc cites, we do not know whether in expressing a preference (e.g., ""I like him more"") subjects are experiencing an emotion, as indicated by multileveled response criteria, or merely expressing an intellectual choice. If the latter, then preferences must be excluded from the category of emotions; if the former, they fall under the rubric of emotion. Zajonc fails to come to grips with this problem, and he makes no mention of the alternative st', 'year': 1984, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 1216, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5628684', 'name': 'R.

It therefore opposes the •stance taken by Zajonc, which reflects two widespread misunderstandings about what is meant by cognitive processes in emotion: (a) that a cognitive appraisal of the significance of an encounter for one\'s well-being must occur in fixed stages through the information processing of initially meaningless inputs from the environment; and (b) that such an appraisal is necessarily deliberate, rational, and conscious. Some of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic implications of a cognitive theory of emotion are also discussed briefly. Recent years have seen a major change in the way psychologists view emotion—the rediscovery that emotions are products of cognitive processes. The emotional response is elicited by an evaluative perception in lower animals, and in humans by a complex \'cognitive appraisal of the significance of events for one\'s well-being. Although there are many other issues concerning the relations between emotion and cognition, my comments will focus on the role of thought in the emotional response. I will refer often to Zajonc\'s (1980) challenge to the assumption that cognition occurs prior to emotion. I use his views to illustrate widespread misunderstandings of what it means to speak of cognition as a causal antecedent of emotion; I also use his views as a point of departure for rny argument that cognitive activity is a necessary as well as sufficient condition of emotion. Do Emotions Require Cognitive Mediation? My own position on this question is a variant of a family of theories of emotion centered on the concept of cognitive appraisal. Campos and Sternberg (1981) state, for example, that ""The recent history of the study of emotion has been dominated by approaches stressing cognitive factors. In theories of adult emotional response, cognitive appraisal now functions as the central construct"" (p. 273). Its role is, to mediate the relationship between the person and the environment. The appraisal process gives rise to a particular emotion with greater or lesser intensity depending on how the relationship is evaluated with respect to the person\'s well-being. Cognitive appraisal means that the way one interprets one\'s plight at any given moment is crucial to the emotional response. Cognition and emotion are usually fused in nature (Folkman, Schaefer, & Lazarus, 1979), although they can be dissociated in certain unusual or abnormal states. For example, cognitive coping processes (cf. Lazarus, 1981) such as isolation and intellectualization (or detachment), which are aimed at regulating feelings, can create a dissociation between thoughts and feelings. Moreover, attack can occur without anger, and avoidance without fear. These latter conditions are also instances in which the usual link between thought and feeling has been loosened or broken. Yet such separations are less often a rule of living and more often a product of coping under special circumstances. The full experience of emotion (as opposed to sham rage, for example) normally includes three fused components: thoughts, action impulses, and somatic disturbances. When these components are dissociated we are left with something other than what we mean by a true emotional state. Our theories of emotion must reflect the normal fusion, and separating thoughts, action impulses, and so^ matic disturbances except under certain specifiable conditions (as was done in the old days of faculty psychology—which treated cognition, emotion, and motivation as independent entities) distorts rather than clarifies the structure of the mind (cf. Lazarus, Coyne, & Folkman, 1982). One bit of fallout from the above analysis is the implication, often derived from statements of cognitive theory, that cognitive appraisal is a necessary I wish to thank my research colleague, Susan Folkman, and my secretary, Carol Carr, for providing substantial editorial advice on this article.

AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST • SEPTEMBER 1982 • 1019 0003-066X/82/3709-1019$00.75 I as well as sufficient condition of emotion. Such a position has been criticized trenchantly by Zajonc (1980). He writes that affect is erroneously regarded in contemporary psychological theory as postcognitive, occurring only after extensive cognitive operations have taken place, and that in actuality affective judgments are fairly independent of, and even precede, the perceptual and cognitive activities on which they are said to depend. Zajonc argues that not only can affect occur without extensive perceptual and cognitive encoding—and even before—but that affect and cognition are controlled by separate and partially independent neural systems (see also Tomkins, 1981). Zajonc thus seems to be saying two things contrary to what I have argued: first, that the proposed directionality in which cognition determines affect is wrorig and that the actual direction is affect to cognition; and second, that cognition and affect should be regarded as relatively independent subsystems rather than as fused and highly interdependent. Building his argument, Zajonc cites a stanza of poetry from e. e. cummings (1973): since feeling is first who pays any attention to the syntax of things will never wholly kiss you. (p. 160) He also cites Wundt\'s (1907) concept of affective primacy, and Bartlett (1932), Ittelson (1973), Osgood (1962), and Premack (1976) as having adopted the view that feelings come first. He states, for example: . < In fact, it is entirely possible that the very first stage of the organism\'s reaction to stimuli and the very first elements in retrieval are affective. It is further possible that we can like something or be afraid of it before we know precisely what it is and perhaps even without knowing what it is. (p. 154) The most serious mistake in Zajonc\'s analysis lies in his approach to cognition, which is characteristic of much of present-day cognitive psychology. In this approach information and meaning stem from the conception of mind as an analogue to a computer (Shannon & Weaver, 1962), a view illustrated also by the work of Newell and Simon (1961) and Weiner (I960). This conception has been rebutted by Dreyfus (1972), Polanyi (1958, 1966), and others, although the rebuttal has not affected the mainstream of cognitive psychology. The mainstream stance is that meanings for decision and action are built up from essentially meaningless stimulus display elements or bits and that systematic scanning of this display generates information. Thus, human cognition, like the operations of a computer, proceeds by serially receiving, registering, encoding, storing for the shortor longrun, and ""retrieving meaningless bits—a transformation to meaning that is called ""information processing."" Meanings and their associated emotions, or hot cognitions as Abelson (1963) referred to them, are built through such processing. As Erdelyi (1974) and others (e.g., Neisser, 1967) have suggested, however, emotion can influence the process at any of its stages. With this in mind, it is not surprising that Zajonc might be troubled by the implication that emotion lies at the end of a tortuous cognitive chain of information processing, and therefore find it necessary to suggest an independent system making possible rapid, nonreflective emotional reactions. As many have argued (Folkman et al., 1979; Wrubel, Benner, & Lazarus, 1981), humans are meaning-oriented, meaning-creating creatures who constantly evaluate events from the perspective of their well-being and react emotionally to some of these evaluations. Zajonc is therefore correct in asserting that meanings are immediately inherent in emotionally laden transactions without lengthy or sequential processing, but for the wrong reasons. In my view, the concept of meaning defined by the traditional information processing approach subscribed to by Zajonc has a perfectly reasonable-—and better—alternative. We do not always have to await revelation from information processing to unravel the environmental code. As was argued in the New Look movement in perception, personal factors such as beliefs, expectations, and motives or commitments influence attention and appraisal at the very outset of any encounter. Concern with individual differences leads inevitably to concern with personal meanings and to the factors that shape such meanings. We actively select and shape experience and in some degree mold it to our own requirements (see also Rychlak, 1981). Information processing as an exclusive model of cognition is insufficiently concerned with the person as a source of meaning. The history of debate about the phenomenon of subception is instructive (see Eriksen, 1956, 1960, 1962; Lazarus, 1956; Lazarus & McCleary, 1951). In a controversial experiment, McCleary and I showed that by associating a set of nonsense syllables to the threat of a painful electric shock, subjects would later react with a galvanic skin response selectively to the shock-associated syllables, even when they had misperceived and misreported, them. We referred to this phenomenon as ""autonomic discrimination without awareness,"" or ""sub1020 • SEPTEMBER 1982 • AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST ception,"" arguing that subjects somehow sensed the threat without consciously recognizing the syllables. The debate sparked by this interpretation touched on many complex issues, but it mainly centered on a claim by Bricker and Chapanis (1953) and Eriksen (1956, 1960, 1962) that even though the subjects had misreported what had been flashed on the screen, they probably had registered perceptually some of the structural elements of the syllables and had, in effect, reacted automatica', 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 1418, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5628684', 'name': 'R.

43,6527a9ffe96171c1aa2a5b2dc92b3e1ff253d4d4,Introducing Emotions into the Computational Study of Social Norms: A First Evaluation,"It is now generally recognised that emotions play an important functional role within both individuals and societies, thereby forming an important bond between these two levels of analysis. In particular, there is a bi-directional interrelationship between social norms and emotions, with emotions playing an instrumental role for the sustenance of social norms and social norms being an essential element of regulation in the individual emotional system. This paper lays the foundations for a computational study of this interrelationship, drawing upon the functional appraisal theory of emotions. We describe a first implementation of a situated agent architecture, TABASCOJAM, that incorporates a simple appraisal mechanism and report on its evaluation in a well-known scenario for the study of aggression control as a function of a norm, that was suitably extended. The simulation results reported in the original aggression control study were successfully reproduced, and consistent performances were achieved for extended scenarios with conditional norm obeyance. In conclusion, it is argued that the present effort indicates a promising lane towards the necessary abandonment of logical models for the explanation and simulation of human social behaviour.",2001,52,126,"{'name': 'J.

First, we analyze the relation between norms, social inequality and functional change more closely. Due to our results, the hypothesis stating that the ""finder-keeper"" norm while controlling aggression efficaciously reduces social inequality holds only in quite egalitarian societies. Throughout a variety of inegalitarian societies, it instead increases social inequality. This argument which can be traced back to Marx is being investigated by use of computer simulations of artificial societies. Second, we remodel normative behaviour from a sociological point of view by implementing Haferkamp\'s theory of action approach to deviant behaviour. Following the game theoretic models, the computational study of norms has up to now ignored the importance of power in explaining how norms affect social behaviour, how norms emerge, become established and internalized, and change. By simulating Haferkamp and repeating the Conte and Castelfranchi experiments, we demonstrate that it is possible to integrate power into computational models of norms.', 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 81, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2288801', 'name': 'N.

In previous simulations (Conte & Castelfranchi 1995), in contrast to a traditional view of norms as means for increasing co-ordination among agents, the effects of normative and non-normative strategies in the control of aggression among agents in a common environment was confronted. Normative strategies were found to reduce aggression to a much greater extent than non-normative strategies, and also to afford the highest average strength and the lowest polarisation of strength among the agents. The present study explores the effects of the interaction between populations following different criteria for aggression control. In such a situation the normative agents alone bear the cost of norms, due to their less aggressive behaviour, while other agents benefit from their presence. Equity is then restored by raising the cost of aggression through the introduction of agents' reputation. This allows normative agents to avoid respecting the cheaters' private property, and to impose a price for transgression. The relevance of knowledge communication is then emphasised by allowing neighbour normative agents to communicate. In particular, the spreading of agents' reputation via communication allows normative agents to co-operate without deliberation at the expense of non-normative agents, thereby redistributing the costs of normative strategies."", 'year': 1998, 'referenceCount': 18, 'citationCount': 159, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1755446', 'name': 'C.

Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists.

I argue that appraisal in the former sense is what is contained in information in self-reports and that this information is of limited use for making inferences on emotion antecedents. This is so because emotional experience may contain appraisals that are part of the emotional response rather than belonging to its causes. They often result from elaboration of the experience after it has begun to be generated. Although in most or all emotions some cognitive appraisal processes are essential antecedents, these processes may be much simpler than self-reports (and the semantics of emotion words) may suggest.

Players can communicate easily with each other in real time. This virtual gathering place has many of the social attributes of other places, and many of the usual social mechanisms operate there. Certain attributes of this virtual place, however, tend to have significant effects on social phenomena, leading to new mechanisms and modes of behavior not usually seen ‘IRL’ (in real life).

It only gave a general idea of people—an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes. E.M. Forster [1] A MUD is a software program that accepts ‘connections’ from multiple users across some kind of network (e.g., telephone lines or the Internet) and provides to each user access to a shared database of ‘rooms’, ‘exits’, and other objects. Each user browses and manipulates this database from ‘inside’ one of those rooms, seeing only those objects that are in the same room and moving from room to room mostly via the exits that connect them. A MUD, therefore, is a kind of virtual reality, an electronically-represented ‘place’ that users can visit. MUDs are not, however, like the kinds of virtual realities that one usually hears about, with fancy graphics and special hardware to sense the position and orientation of the user’s real-world body. A MUD user’s interface to the database is entirely text-based; all commands are typed in by the users and all feedback is', 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 529, 'authors': [{'authorId': '143843384', 'name': 'Pavel Curtis'}]}, {'paperId': '29a8f79f1581c00e66359e7e5ff1570f0bf013cd', 'title': 'Chapter 6 Levels of processing in emotion-antecedent appraisal', 'abstract': None, 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 140, 'citationCount': 97, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1759123', 'name': 'C.

Our solution has focused on implementing a platform for reasoning about emotions that supports the testing of such theories. \nIn the platform we model a multi-agent world and give simple affective life to agents in the form of rudimentary emotions and emotion-induced actions. In addition the agents are able to reason about emotion episodes that take place in one another's lives. The implementation includes representations for twenty-four emotion types (based on the work Ortony et al., 1988) and 1400 emotion-induced actions. Agents have rudimentary personalities, including an interpretive component which causes them to construe the world in idiosyncratic ways leading to emotional states, and an expressive component which give agents a unique profile for manifesting their emotions. Agents keep internal models of the concerns of other agents which allow them to explain the emotional episodes of other agents by classifying them as instances in which one or more of the twenty-four emotion types arise. \nThe implementation is simulation-based. It has been run with up to forty agents at a time. Situations arise in the modeled world, agents respond to some of these in their own unique, emotional, ways. Emotion-induced actions are generated which may be placed back in the simulation queue and further perturb the system. Other agents observe and explain the situations using both strong-theory reasoning based on a set of emotion rules, and weak-theory reasoning using a case-based heuristic classification system."", 'year': 1992, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 610, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6053516', 'name': 'C.

A plan is usually construed as a list of primitive robot actions to be executed one after another but in a complex domain, a plan must be structured to cope effectively with the myriad unpredictable details it will encounter during execution. However, adding structure to a plan involves more than augmenting the primitive plan representation; it requires a complete model of interaction with the world called situation-driven execution. Situation-driven execution assumes that a plan consists of tasks with three major components: a satisfaction test, a window of activity, and a set of execution methods that are appropriate in different circumstances. Execution of such a plan proceeds by selecting an unsatisfied task and choosing a method to achieve it based on the current world state. A task may be executed as many times as necessary to keep it satisfied while it is active. \nThis thesis proposes a plan and task representation based on program-like reactive action packages, or RAPs. A plan consists of RAP-defined tasks and each RAP generates primitive robot actions at execution time by selecting its most appropriate method. Within such a system, execution monitoring becomes an intrinsic part of the execution algorithm, and the need for separate replanning on failure disappears. RAPs are more than just programs that run at execution time, however, they are also hierarchical building blocks for plan construction. The RAP representation is structured to make a task's expected behavior evident for use in planning as well as in execution. The RAP execution system described includes a sensor memory, representation language and interpreter. Examples and experiments demonstrate a wide range of adaptive system behavior."", 'year': 1989, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 509, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2442139', 'name': 'R.

We argue that standard models of such work are inadequate for describing the adaptibility and variabil ity observed in offices, and are fundamentally misleading as metaphors for understanding the skills and knowledge needed by computers or people to do the work. The basic claim in our alternative framework is that an agent\'s work is defined in terms of making and fulfilling commitments to other agents, and that the tasks described in those commitments are merely agreed upon methods for fulfilling the commitments. Determining the intended meaning of those task descriptions in specific situations is an important component of the work, and the agents making the commitments decide in any given situation how and whether a given commitment has been fulfilled. We analyze subcontracting relationships, noting that the tasks\'s client and contractor both play a role in defining the subcontractor\'s work. Also, we analyze the use and role of procedures in informal domains, noting the interdependencies among the agents performing them, the problem solving required to perform each step, and ways in which they con be made more adaptive.

New cancer targeted therapies have become widely used, and their impact on brain functions and quality of life needs to be explored. We evaluated the impact of everolimus, an anticancer agent targeting the mTOR pathway, on cognitive functions, cerebral metabolism, and hippocampal cell proliferation/vascular density in mice. Adult mice received everolimus daily for 2 weeks, and behavioral tests were performed from 1 week after the last treatment. Everolimus-treated mice displayed a marked reduction in weight gain from the last day of the treatment period. Ex vivo analysis showed altered cytochrome oxidase activity in selective cerebral regions involved in energy balance, food intake, reward, learning and memory modulation, sleep/wake cycle regulation, and arousal. Like chemotherapy, everolimus did not alter emotional reactivity, learning and memory performances, but in contrast to chemotherapy, did not affect behavioral flexibility or reactivity to novelty. In vivo hippocampal neural cell proliferation and vascular density were also unchanged after everolimus treatments. In conclusion, two weeks daily everolimus treatment at the clinical dose did not evoke alteration of cognitive performances evaluated in hippocampal- and prefrontal cortex-dependent tasks that would persist at one to four weeks after the end of the treatment completion. However, acute everolimus treatment caused selective CO modifications without altering the mTOR effector P70S6 kinase in cerebral regions involved in feeding behavior and/or the sleep/wake cycle, at least in part under control of the solitary nucleus and the parasubthalamic region of the hypothalamus. Thus, this area may represent a key target for everolimus-mediating peripheral modifications, which has been previously associated with symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue.",2014,81,14,"{'name': 'PLoS ONE', 'volume': '9'}",,"[{'authorId': '80714578', 'name': 'M.

However, how the set point is determined is not well understood. We show that a single injection of rapamycin (RAP), an mTOR inhibitor, is sufficient to shift the set point in rats. Intraperitoneal RAP decreased food intake and daily weight gain for several days, but surprisingly, there was also a long-term reduction in body weight which lasted at least 10 weeks without additional RAP injection. These effects were not due to malaise or glucose intolerance. Two RAP administrations with a two-week interval had additive effects on body weight without desensitization and significantly reduced the white adipose tissue weight. When challenged with food deprivation, vehicle and RAP-treated rats responded with rebound hyperphagia, suggesting that RAP was not inhibiting compensatory responses to weight loss. Instead, RAP animals defended a lower body weight achieved after RAP treatment. Decreased food intake and body weight were also seen with intracerebroventricular injection of RAP, indicating that the RAP effect is at least partially mediated by the brain. In summary, we found a novel effect of RAP that maintains lower body weight by shifting the set point long-term. Thus, RAP and related compounds may be unique tools to investigate the mechanisms by which the defended level of body weight is determined; such compounds may also be used to complement weight loss strategy.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 30, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4464824', 'name': 'M.

Animals consuming the VDD had altered hypothalamic gene expression, typical of starvation. Pharmacological and genetic blockade of central melanocortin signaling failed to increase long-term food intake in this model. Chronic IAA deficiency was associated with a marked upregulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone expression in the lateral hypothalamus, particularly in the parasubthalamic nucleus, an area heavily innervated by efferent projections from the APC. Our observations indicate that the hypothalamic melanocortin system plays a minor role in acute, but not chronic, IAADA and suggest that the restraint on feeding is analogous to that observed after chronic dehydration.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 22, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4924059', 'name': 'Xinxia Zhu'}, {'authorId': '36193108', 'name': 'S.

Although most brain development occurs prenatally, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus harbors progenitor stem cells that contribute to its ongoing development postnatally. It is unclear how exposure to CH might affect postnatal hippocampal development, so we used a transgenic mouse that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) within this progenitor population to determine the effect of CH on the DG. We find that exposure to 10% oxygen from postnatal d 3 to 28 results in a smaller DG with long-term impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis. Because the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a well-known regulator of cell proliferation and growth and is sensitive to hypoxia, we investigated its activation on exposure to CH and find it to be attenuated specifically in neural progenitor cells.

As everolimus exerts its antineoplastic through inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key element of intracellular signalling of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, we hypothesized that muscle wasting would be also an important side effect of everolimus therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll patients with mRCC enrolled in RECORD 1 (everolimus (E) or placebo (P) post TKI failure) in IGR (n=40) were analyzed for this study. Patients were eligible if at least 2 CT scans were available. CT image analysis, which has high precision and specificity for evaluation of specific muscles, was used to define change in total skeletal muscle. The third lumbar vertebra (L3) was chosen as a landmark. Images were analyzed using Slice-O-Matic software V4.3 (Tomovision). Tissue Hounsfield unit thresholds were employed: -29 to +150 for skeletal muscle. Subsequently, tissue cross-sectional areas (cm2) were computed.\n\n\nRESULTS\n35 patients (83% male, median age 60y) were evaluable, 10 on P and 25 on E. In addition, 9 patients initially on P could cross to E (as per protocol) and were analyzed both on P and on E. Median durations of treatment were 79 and 263 days respectively on P and E. Placebo patients had stable body weight, with no significant mean gain or loss of muscle. By contrast, patients on E lost body weight over time: -2.5±3.6 kg by 83 d (p=0.02), -4.9±5.7 (p=0.005) by 167 d and -5.0±7.6 kg (p=0.02) by 286 d. E patients progressively lost skeletal muscle compared .with baseline from -2.5±5.9% at 83d (p=0.06), to -4.0±7.5% at 167d (p=0.03) and -4.8±6.8% at 263d (p=0.01). Interstingly, the 9 patients who had maintained body weight (+2.0 kg) and muscle (+2.7%) whilst on placebo, and crossed to E, promptly lost weight (-4.8 kg, p<0.03) and skeletal muscle (-5.3%) (about 1.5 kg of muscle) when crossed to E.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBody weight and muscle wasting are induced by everolimus in mRCC, and are not related to progressive disease. These changes increase over time. Relation between these changes and outcome will be presented at the meeting.

Whereas acute treatment of insulin target cells with the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor rapamycin prevents nutrient-induced insulin resistance, the chronic effect of rapamycin on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in vivo remains elusive. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS To assess the metabolic effects of chronic inhibition of the mTORC1/S6K1 pathway, rats were treated with rapamycin (2 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 15 days before metabolic phenotyping. RESULTS Chronic rapamycin treatment reduced adiposity and fat cell number, which was associated with a coordinated downregulation of genes involved in both lipid uptake and output. Rapamycin treatment also promoted insulin resistance, severe glucose intolerance, and increased gluconeogenesis. The latter was associated with elevated expression of hepatic gluconeogenic master genes, PEPCK and G6Pase, and increased expression of the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) as well as enhanced nuclear recruitment of FoxO1, CRTC2, and CREB. These changes were observed despite normal activation of the insulin receptor substrate/PI 3-kinase/Akt axis in liver of rapamycin-treated rats, as expected from the blockade of the mTORC1/S6K1 negative feedback loop. CONCLUSIONS These findings unravel a novel mechanism by which mTORC1/S6K1 controls gluconeogenesis through modulation of several key transcriptional factors. The robust induction of the gluconeogenic program in liver of rapamycin-treated rats underlies the development of severe glucose intolerance even in the face of preserved hepatic insulin signaling to Akt and despite a modest reduction in adiposity.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 56, 'citationCount': 385, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4940654', 'name': 'Vanessa P.

To test roles for TSC1 and mTORC1 in β-cell function, we utilized Rip2/Cre to generate mice lacking Tsc1 in pancreatic β-cells (Rip-Tsc1cKO mice). Although obesity developed due to hypothalamic Tsc1 excision in older Rip-Tsc1cKO animals, young animals displayed a prominent gain-of-function β-cell phenotype prior to the onset of obesity. The young Rip-Tsc1cKO animals displayed improved glycemic control due to mTOR-mediated enhancement of β-cell size, mass, and insulin production but not determinants of β-cell number (proliferation and apoptosis), consistent with an important anabolic role for mTOR in β-cell function.

The current study identifies a novel role of the Akt/mTOR pathway as a regulator of CNS myelination. Previously, we showed that overexpressing constitutively active Akt in oligodendrocytes in a transgenic mouse model induces enhanced CNS myelination, with no changes in the proliferation or survival of oligodendrocyte progenitor or mature cells. The present study focused on the signaling mechanisms regulating this hypermyelination induced by Akt. Activation of mTOR and its downstream substrates (p70S6 kinase and S6 ribosomal protein) was observed in Akt-overexpressing oligodendrocytes. When mTOR signaling was inhibited chronically in vivo with rapamycin starting at 6 weeks of age, the observed hypermyelination was reduced to approximately the amount of myelin seen in wild-type mice. mTOR inhibition had little impact on wild-type myelination between 6 and 12 weeks of age, suggesting that, in normal adults, myelination is relatively complete and is no longer regulated by mTOR signaling. However, when mTOR was chronically inhibited in young adult wild-type mice, myelination was reduced.

Acute kainate-induced seizures resulted in biphasic activation of the mTOR pathway, as evident by an increase in phospho-S6 (P-S6) expression. An initial rise in P-S6 expression started ∼1 h after seizure onset, peaked at 3–6 h, and returned to baseline by 24 h in both hippocampus and neocortex, reflecting widespread stimulation of mTOR signaling by acute seizure activity. After resolution of status epilepticus, a second increase in P-S6 was observed in hippocampus only, which started at 3 d, peaked 5–10 d, and persisted for several weeks after kainate injection, correlating with the development of chronic epileptogenesis within hippocampus. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, administered before kainate, blocked both the acute and chronic phases of seizure-induced mTOR activation and decreased kainate-induced neuronal cell death, neurogenesis, mossy fiber sprouting, and the development of spontaneous epilepsy. Late rapamycin treatment, after termination of status epilepticus, blocked the chronic phase of mTOR activation and reduced mossy fiber sprouting and epilepsy but not neurogenesis or neuronal death. These findings indicate that mTOR signaling mediates mechanisms of epileptogenesis in the kainate rat model and that mTOR inhibitors have potential antiepileptogenic effects in this model.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 60, 'citationCount': 455, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2056248', 'name': 'L.

Rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) have proven effective as anticancer agents in a broad range of preclinical models. Clinical trials using rapalogs have demonstrated important clinical benefits in several cancer types; however, objective response rates achieved with single-agent therapy have been modest. Rapalogs may be more effective in combination with other anticancer agents, including chemotherapy and targeted therapies. It is increasingly apparent that the mTOR signaling network is quite complex, and rapamycin treatment leads to different signaling responses in different cell types.

Deletion of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), a negative regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, in adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes robust axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. In wild-type adult mice, the mTOR activity was suppressed and new protein synthesis was impaired in axotomized RGCs, which may contribute to the regeneration failure. Reactivating this pathway by conditional knockout of tuberous sclerosis complex 1, another negative regulator of the mTOR pathway, also leads to axon regeneration.

To understand the basis for this effect, we have studied the consequences of a prolonged incubation with rapamycin on the viability and functions of endothelial cells. Methods and results Human umbilical vein or aorta endothelial cells were exposed to rapamycin in the absence or in the presence of tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa). After a 24 h-incubation, rapamycin (100 nM) caused a significant cell loss associated with the increase of both apoptosis and necrosis, as quantified by propidium iodide staining, caspase 3 activity, and lactate dehydrogenase release. Rapamy-cin also impaired cell mobility, as assessed by a wound test, and promoted the formation of actin stress fibres, as determined with confocal microscopy. Moreover, the inhibitor prolonged TNFa-dependent E-selectin induction, inhibited endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression at both mRNA (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) and protein level (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot), and lowered bioactive nitric oxide output (RFL-6 reporter cell assay). Under the conditions adopted, rapamycin inhibited both mammalian target-of-rapamycin complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2), as indicated by the reduced amount of raptor and rictor bound to mTOR in immunoprecipi-tates and by the marked hypophosphorylation of protein S6 kinase I (p70S6K) and Akt, determined by western blotting. The selective inhibition of mTORC1 by AICAR did not affect endothelial viability. Conclusion A prolonged treatment with rapamycin impairs endothelial function and hinders cell viability.

Experiments were done in alpha-chloralose anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated rats to investigate the effect of glutamate (10 nl, 0.25 M) activation of PSTN neurons on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). Glutamate stimulation of PSTN elicited depressor (-20.4 +/- 0.7 mmHg) and bradycardia (-26.0 +/- 1.0 beats/min) responses and decreases in RSNA (67 +/- 17%). Administration (intravenous) of atropine methyl bromide attenuated the bradycardia response (46%), but had no effect on the MAP response. Subsequent intravenous administration of hexamethonium bromide blocked both the remaining bradycardia and depressor responses. Bilateral microinjection of the synaptic blocker CoCl(2) into the caudal NTS region attenuated the PSTN depressor and bradycardia responses by 92% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, prior glutamate activation of neurons in the ipsilateral NTS did not alter the magnitude of the MAP response to stimulation of PSTN, but potentiated HR response by 35%. Finally, PSTN stimulation increased the magnitude of the reflex bradycardia to activation of arterial baroreceptors. These data indicate that activation of neurons in the PSTN elicits a decrease in MAP due to sympathoinhibition and a cardiac slowing that involves both vagal excitation and sympathoinhibition.

Nutritional regulation of the mTOR-signaling pathway is mediated by their corresponding plasma membrane transporters, other unknown mechanisms, or both. Adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, an important cellular energy sensor, can interact with the mTOR-signaling pathway to maintain cellular energy homeostasis. Interactions of mTOR with regulatory-associated protein of TOR or rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR result in 2 mTOR complexes, with the former (mTOR complex-1) being the primary controller of cell growth and the latter (mTOR complex-2) mediating effects that are insensitive to rapamycin, such as cytoskeletal organization. Upstream elements of the mTOR-signaling pathway include Ras-homolog enriched in brain, and tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2, with tuberous sclerosis complex 2 as the linker between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B or Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase pathways and the mTOR pathway.

Therefore, the combination of radiotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy with mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) might exert additive/synergistic effects on tumor growth. Experimental Design: Effects of radiation combined with mTOR inhibitor RAD001 were studied on proliferation of murine colon cancer CT-26, human pancreatic cancer L3.6pl, and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells in vitro. In vivo tumor growth of subcutaneous colon cancer CT 26 and orthotopic pancreatic cancer L3.6pl was assessed after fractionated radiotherapy (5 × 2 or 5 × 4 Gy) with or without the addition of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001. RAD001 (1.5 mg/kg/d) was administered until the end of experiments beginning before or after radiotherapy. Results: A single dose of 2 Gy reduced in vitro proliferation of L3.6pl (−16%), CT-26 (−70%), and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC; −72%). The mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (10 ng/mL) suppressed proliferation of HUVEC (−83%), L3.6pl (−8%), and CT-26 (−82%). Combination of even low concentrations of 0.01 ng/mL RAD001 and 0.25 Gy radiation significantly reduced proliferation of HUVECs (−57%), whereas additive effects of RAD001 and radiation on tumor cells were seen only at the highest concentrations tested. In vivo, RAD001 introduced before radiotherapy (5 × 2 Gy) improved tumor growth control in mice (L3.6pl: 326 mm3 versus 1144 mm3; CT-26: 210 mm3 versus 636 mm3; P < 0.05 versus control). RAD001 turned out to possess a dose-modifying effect on radiotherapy. Conclusion: Endothelial cells seem to be most sensitive to combination of mTOR inhibition and radiotherapy.

Two weeks after starting the treatment, she was admitted to the hospital because of partial seizures affecting her left superior extremity, headache, and vision loss in the previous 2 days. The physical examination was normal except for cortical blindness and hypertension (170/100 mmHg). Blood tests, including coagulation study and gasometry, were unremarkable. Computed tomography of the brain showed symmetric subcortical hypodense lesions in the occipital lobes, consistent with reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). Magnetic resonance imaging was requested to rule out brain micrometastasis and it confirmed the findings of RPLS: symmetric hyperintense T2 signal involving bilateral occipital and parietal lobes in the subcortical distribution (Fig 1). Sunitinib administration was withheld and the patient was treated with anticonvulsants and antihypertensives. She recovered completely, was discharged in a few days and had a normal brain computed tomography performed 1 month later. The RPLS was initially reported by Hinchey et al. It is a clinical condition characterized by headache, seizures, impaired vision, acute hypertension, and typical magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography imaging findings (symmetric and reversible). This syndrome has been described related to different circumstances: hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, collagen vascular disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodose, Behcet), trombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, acute porphyria, postcarotid endarterectomy, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. However, it is most commonly caused by immunosuppressive agents and cytotoxic drugs as cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, interferon alfa, cisplatin, cytarabine, IV immunoglobulins, L-asparaginase, and more recently by bevacizumab (antiangiogenic agent) and sorafenib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Its pathogenesis is not precisely known. It is postulated that the alterations can be related with the appearance of vasogenic edema because of elevation in the blood pressure (vasospasm) or because of toxic damage to blood-brain barrier or vascular endothelium. Sunitinib has a dual activity: extracellular action against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (antiangiogenic) and intracellular action against tyrosine kinase domains, which can produce hypertension. In our case, the set of symptoms could be caused through both mechanisms.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 4, 'citationCount': 96, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2107656316', 'name': 'G.

We examined whether mTOR inhibition by RAD001 (everolimus) is therapeutically efficacious in the treatment of ovarian cancer as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin. Experimental Design: Using four human ovarian cancer cell lines, we determined the effect of RAD001 by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Western blot, and apoptosis assays. We evaluated the association between phospho-AKT/mTOR activity and RAD001 sensitivity. We also determined the effect of RAD001 on tumor growth and malignancy using mice inoculated with human ovarian cancer cells. Results: RAD001 markedly inhibited cell proliferation of human ovarian carcinoma cells with high AKT activity (OVCAR10 and SKOV-3), but the effect was minimal in cells with low AKT activity (OVCAR4 and OVCAR5). Sensitivity to RAD001 was independent of p53 expression. RAD001 inhibited the phosphorylation of downstream 4E-BP1 and p70S6 kinase and attenuated the expression of Myc. RAD001 also attenuated the expression of HIF-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor, important factors in angiogenesis and tumor invasiveness. RAD001 enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cells with high AKT/mTOR activity, with minimal effect in cells with low AKT-mTOR activity. Mouse xenografts of SKOV-3 cells revealed that RAD001 inhibits tumor growth, angiogenesis, and i.p. dissemination and ascites production and prolongs survival. Moreover, treatment with RAD001 significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in vivo. Conclusion: These results indicate that RAD001 could have therapeutic efficacy in human ovarian cancers with hyperactivated AKT/mTOR signaling.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 222, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4354534', 'name': 'S.

In the present study, we report a modulating role for the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 in neural progenitor migration. We have identified IQGAP1 as a new marker of amplifying neural progenitor and neuronal precursor cells of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the rostral migratory stream (RMS) in the adult mouse brain. To determine functions for IQGAP1 in neural progenitors, we compared the properties of neural progenitor cells from wild-type and Iqgap1-null mutant mice in vivo and in vitro. The in vivo studies reveal a delay in the transition of de novo neural progenitors into neuronal precursor cells in Iqgap1-null mice. In vitro, we demonstrated that IQGAP1 acts as a downstream effector in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent migratory response of neural progenitors that also impacts on their neuronal differentiation. The Rho-family GTPases cdc42/Rac1 and Lis1 are major partners of IQGAP1 in this migratory process. Finally, astrocytes of the neurogenic SVZ and RMS are shown to express VEGF. We propose that VEGF synthesized by astrocytes could be involved in the guidance of neural progenitors to neurogenic niches and that IQGAP1 is an effector of the VEGF-dependent migratory signal.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 40, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47953731', 'name': 'L.

Because the AKT-mTOR pathway is frequently hyperactivated in ovarian cancer, we hypothesized that the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) would inhibit ovarian tumorigenesis in transgenic mice that spontaneously develop ovarian carcinomas. We used TgMISIIR-TAg transgenic mice, which develop bilateral ovarian serous adenocarcinomas accompanied by ascites and peritoneal dissemination. Fifty-eight female TgMISIIR-TAg mice were treated with 5 mg/kg RAD001 or placebo twice weekly from 5 to 20 weeks of age. To monitor tumor development, mice were examined biweekly using magnetic resonance microimaging. In vivo effects of RAD001 on Akt-mTOR signaling, tumor cell proliferation, and blood vessel area were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. RAD001 treatment markedly delayed tumor development. Tumor burden was reduced by approximately 84%. In addition, ascites formation, together with peritoneal dissemination, was detected in only 21% of RAD001-treated mice compared with 74% in placebo-treated animals. Approximately 30% of RAD001-treated mice developed early ovarian carcinoma confined within the ovary, whereas all placebo-treated mice developed advanced ovarian carcinoma. Treatment with RAD001 diminished the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor-derived cell lines and inhibited angiogenesis in vivo. RAD001 also attenuated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and inhibited the invasiveness of tumor-derived cells.

A phase I/II study was done to determine safety and efficacy of everolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. Experimental Design: Two dose levels (5 and 10 mg orally once daily continuously) were evaluated in the phase I portion of this study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus to be used in the phase II study. Results: Twenty-seven patients (9 acute myelogenous leukemia, 5 myelodysplastic syndrome, 6 B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 4 mantle cell lymphoma, 1 myelofibrosis, 1 natural killer cell/T-cell leukemia, and 1 T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia) received everolimus. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Grade 3 potentially drug-related toxicities included hyperglycemia (22%), hypophosphatemia (7%), fatigue (7%), anorexia (4%), and diarrhea (4%). One patient developed a cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis requiring a skin graft.

Because both growth factor signaling and glucose have been implicated in memory formation, we questioned whether mTOR activity is required for long-term spatial memory formation and whether this cascade is involved in the memory-augmenting effect of centrally applied glucose. To test our hypothesis, we directly administered rapamycin (an inhibitor of mTOR), glucose, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1β-4-ribonucleoside (AICAR; an activator of AMP kinase), or glucose plus rapamycin into the dorsal hippocampus after we trained rats in the Morris water maze task. The results from these studies indicate that glucose enhances, whereas AICAR and rapamycin both impair, long-term spatial memory. Furthermore, the memory-impairing effect of targeted rapamycin administration could not be overcome by coadministration of glucose. Consistent with these behavioral results, biochemical analysis revealed that glucose and AICAR had opposing influences on the activation of the TSC–mTOR cascade, as indicated by the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1), targets of mTOR.

In particular, studies have suggested that PI3K contributes to mechanisms associated with synaptic plasticity and memory processes but the function of this cascade in forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long‐term potentiation, remains controversial and the PI3K substrates which mediate these effects are poorly understood. Here we report that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 infused i.c.v. in vivo blocked maintenance of long‐term potentiation induced in the dentate gyrus with a single tetanus to the perforant path but not with repeated tetani. This pattern of stimulation led to rapid and transient phosphorylation of the PI3K substrate Akt at Ser473 but not at Thr308. Functional readout of partial activation of Akt was demonstrated by an increase in phosphorylation of two downstream substrates, Forkhead (FKHR) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in a delayed and prolonged manner at Akt‐specific phosphorylation sites. LY294002 blocked phosphorylation of Akt and the prolonged phosphorylation of FKHR and mTOR but did not impair long‐term potentiation‐induced phosphorylation of extracellular receptor kinase. In addition, the same i.c.v. concentration of LY294002 impaired long‐term consolidation of recognition memory but not short‐term recognition memory or spatial learning and repeated training in the recognition memory task overcame the deficit in consolidation. These results suggest that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway may contribute to the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation by promoting cell survival via FKHR and protein synthesis via mTOR.

The results indicate that the cell group is distinguished by massive projections to parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in the brainstem (especially in the salivatory nuclei and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve) and to parts of the parabrachial nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract that relay viscerosensory and gustatory information. In addition, the PSTN projects to cortical parts of the cerebral hemisphere (infralimbic, agranular insular, postpiriform transition and lateral entorhinal areas, and posterior basolateral amygdalar nucleus)—directly and also indirectly via thalamic feedback loops involving the paraventricular and mediodorsal nuclei—and to nuclear parts of the cerebral hemisphere (central amygdalar nucleus, striatal fundus, rhomboid nucleus of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis, and substantia innominata). The PSTN is thus positioned to influence directly many cerebral hemisphere and hindbrain components of the central parasympathetic control network that is active, for example, during feeding behavior and cardiovascular regulation.

Detailed biochemical profiling of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in tumors, skin, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), after a single administration of 5 mg/kg RAD001, indicated that RAD001 treatment blocked phosphorylation of the translational repressor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 and inactivated the translational activator ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). The efficacy of intermittent treatment schedules was associated with prolonged inactivation of S6K1 in tumors and surrogate tissues (≥72 h). Furthermore, detailed analysis of the dose dependency of weekly treatment schedules demonstrated a correlation between antitumor efficacy and prolonged effects (≥7 days) on PBMC-derived S6K1 activity. Analysis of human PBMCs revealed that S6K1 also underwent a concentration-dependent inactivation after RAD001 treatment ex vivo (>95% inactivation with 20 nm RAD001). In contrast, human PBMC-derived eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 was present predominantly in the hypophosphorylated form and was unaffected by RAD001 treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate a correlation between the antitumor efficacy of intermittent RAD001 treatment schedules and prolonged S6K1 inactivation in PBMCs and suggest that long-term monitoring of PBMC-derived S6K1 activity levels could be used for assessing RAD001 treatment schedules in cancer patients.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 70, 'citationCount': 327, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5360203', 'name': 'A.

Numerous intermingled HCRT‐immunopositive and DβH‐immunopositive fibers were seen in a ventrally situated corridor extending from the hypothalamus to deep layers of the infralimbic cortex. Both fiber types avoided the nucleus accumbens core, caudate putamen, and the globus pallidus. In the diencephalon, overlap was observed in several hypothalamic areas, including the perifornical, dorsomedial, and paraventricular nuclei, as well as in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus. Intermingled HCRT‐containing and DβH‐containing fibers extended from the hypothalamus into areas within the medial and central amygdala, terminating at the medial border of the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala. Dense overlap between the two fiber types was also observed in the periaqueductal gray, particularly in the vicinity of the dorsal raphe, as well as (to a lesser extent) in the ventral tegmental area, the retrorubral field, and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Hypocretin‐containing cell bodies, located in the perifornical and lateral hypothalamus, were embedded within a dense plexus of DβH‐immunopositive fibers and boutons, with numerous cases of apparent contacts of DβH‐containing boutons onto HCRT‐immunopositive soma and dendrites. HCRT‐containing fibers were observed amid the noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus, and in the vicinity of the A1, A2, and A5 cell groups. Hence, the projections of these two arousal‐related systems, originating in distinctly different parts of the brain, jointly target several forebrain regions and brainstem monoaminergic nuclei involved in regulating core motivational processes.

Using differential conditioning to linearly frequency‐modulated tones (FMs) we have recently shown that post‐training injections of protein synthesis inhibitors into the auditory cortex of Mongolian gerbils interfere with long‐term memory for a number of days. Here, we have used rapamycin as a pharmacological tool to elucidate signalling pathways that control the synthesis of proteins required for persistent memory storage. In mammalian cells, inhibition of target of rapamycin (TOR)‐mediated pathways was shown to block the translation of distinct classes of mRNAs. Bilateral infusions of rapamycin into the gerbil auditory cortex shortly after FM discrimination training did not impair the maintenance of the newly acquired memory trace for 24\u2003h, but caused profound retention deficits at 48\u2003h after injection. Control experiments showed that the amnesic action is rapamycin‐dependent, confined to the context of memory formation, and suppressed by the antagonist FK506. These data indicate that, in the mammalian brain, activation of rapamycin‐sensitive signalling pathways contributes to long‐term consolidation of a cerebral cortex‐dependent form of memory. Moreover, the finding that rapamycin‐induced amnesia parallels only late effects of conventional protein synthesis inhibitors on FM discrimination memory implies that at least two different protein synthesis‐dependent processes control memory formation. Both are activated during or shortly after learning. Whereas one process is required for the initial maintenance of memory for about one day the second one is involved in the regulation of its long‐lasting persistence in conditioning to FMs.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 56, 'citationCount': 120, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6726503', 'name': 'W.

The present study evaluated whether orally administered everolimus (a macrolide of the same family as sirolimus) inhibits in-stent neointimal growth in rabbit iliac arteries. Methods and Results—New Zealand white rabbits were randomized to everolimus 1.5 mg/kg per day starting 3 days before stenting and reduced to 1 mg/kg per day from days 14 to 28 (group 1), everolimus 1.5 mg/kg given 1 day before stenting followed by 0.75 mg/kg per day for 28 days (group 2), or matching placebo for each group.

Group 1 everolimus-treated rabbits experienced weight loss and anorexia, which resolved after the everolimus dose was lowered on day 14. Group 2 animals were healthy for the duration of everolimus dosing. Both everolimus treatment groups significantly reduced in-stent neointimal growth (46% reduction and 42% reduction in intimal thickness in groups 1 and 2, respectively).

For example, long-term potentiation (LTP) that endures for more than an hour requires both transcription and translation. The signal-transduction mechanisms that couple synaptic events to protein translational machinery during long-lasting synaptic plasticity, however, are not well understood. One signaling pathway that is stimulated by growth factors and results in the translation of specific mRNAs includes the rapamycin-sensitive kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, also known as FRAP and RAFT-1). Several components of this translational signaling pathway, including mTOR, eukaryotic initiation factor-4E-binding proteins 1 and 2, and eukaryotic initiation factor-4E, are present in the rat hippocampus as shown by Western blot analysis, and these proteins are detected in the cell bodies and dendrites in the hippocampal slices by immunostaining studies. In cultured hippocampal neurons, these proteins are present in dendrites and are often found near the presynaptic protein, synapsin I. At synaptic sites, their distribution completely overlaps with a postsynaptic protein, PSD-95. These observations suggest the postsynaptic localization of these proteins. Disruption of mTOR signaling by rapamycin results in a reduction of late-phase LTP expression induced by high-frequency stimulation; the early phase of LTP is unaffected. Rapamycin also blocks the synaptic potentiation induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor in hippocampal slices. These results demonstrate an essential role for rapamycin-sensitive signaling in the expression of two forms of synaptic plasticity that require new protein synthesis. The localization of this translational signaling pathway at postsynaptic sites may provide a mechanism that controls local protein synthesis at potentiated synapses.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 54, 'citationCount': 710, 'authors': [{'authorId': '37726322', 'name': 'Shao-Jun Tang'}, {'authorId': '48417014', 'name': 'G.

Understanding the mechanism of endothelial cell migration is critical to the therapeutic manipulation of angiogenesis and ultimately cancer prevention. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent chemotactic stimulus of endothelial cells during angiogenesis. The endothelial cell signal transduction pathway of VEGF represents a potential target for cancer therapy, but the mechanisms of post-receptor signal transduction including the roles of rho family GTPases in regulating the cytoskeletal effects of VEGF in endothelial cells are not understood. Here we analyze the mechanisms of cell migration in the mouse brain endothelial cell line (bEND3). Stable transfectants containing a tetracycline repressible expression vector were used to induce expression of Rac mutants. Endothelial cell haptotaxis was stimulated by constitutively active V12Rac on collagen and vitronectin coated supports, and chemotaxis was further stimulated by VEGF. Osteopontin coated supports were the most stimulatory to bEND3 haptotaxis, but VEGF was not effective in further increasing migration on osteopontin coated supports. Haptotaxis on support coated with collagen, vitronectin, and to a lesser degree osteopontin was inhibited by N17 Rac. N17 Rac expression blocked stimulation of endothelial cell chemotaxis by VEGF. As part of the chemotactic stimulation, VEGF caused a loss of actin organization at areas of cell-cell contact and increased stress fiber expression in endothelial cells which were directed towards pores in the transwell membrane. N17 Rac prevented the stimulation of cell-cell contact disruption and the stress fiber stimulation by VEGF. These data demonstrate two pathways of regulating endothelial cell motility, one in which Rac is activated by matrix/integrin stimulation and is a crucial modulator of endothelial cell haptotaxis. The other pathway, in the presence of osteopontin, is Rac independent. VEGF stimulated chemotaxis, is critically dependent on Rac activation. Osteopontin was a potent matrix activator of motility, and perhaps one explanation for the absence of a VEGF plus osteopontin effect is that osteopontin stimulated motility was inhibitory to the Rac pathway.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 74, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2169323206', 'name': 'Norihito Soga'}, {'authorId': '2060004543', 'name': 'John O.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of antidepressants on hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult rat, using the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker for dividing cells. Our studies demonstrate that chronic antidepressant treatment significantly increases the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus and hilus of the hippocampus. Administration of several different classes of antidepressant, but not non-antidepressant, agents was found to increase BrdU-labeled cell number, indicating that this is a common and selective action of antidepressants. In addition, upregulation of the number of BrdU-labeled cells is observed after chronic, but not acute, treatment, consistent with the time course for the therapeutic action of antidepressants. Additional studies demonstrated that antidepressant treatment increases the proliferation of hippocampal cells and that these new cells mature and become neurons, as determined by triple labeling for BrdU and neuronal- or glial-specific markers. These findings raise the possibility that increased cell proliferation and increased neuronal number may be a mechanism by which antidepressant treatment overcomes the stress-induced atrophy and loss of hippocampal neurons and may contribute to the therapeutic actions of antidepressant treatment.', 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 2993, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5869161', 'name': 'J.

Several brain regions involved in the central regulation of autonomic and endocrine processes or attention are targets of extensive hypocretin projections. The most dense arborization of hypocretin axons in the brainstem was detected in the locus coeruleus (LC). Multiple labeling immunocytochemistry revealed a massive synaptic innervation of catecholaminergic LC cells by hypocretin axon terminals in rats and monkeys. In both species, all tyrosine hydroxylase‐immunopositive cells in the LC examined by electron microscopy were found to receive asymmetrical (excitatory) synaptic contacts from multiple axons containing hypocretin. In parallel electrophysiological studies with slices of rat brain, all LC cells showed excitatory responses to the hypocretin‐2 peptide. Hypocretin‐2 uniformly increased the frequency of action potentials in these cells, even in the presence of tetrodotoxin, indicating that receptors responding to hypocretin were expressed in LC neurons. Two mechanisms for the increased firing rate appeared to be a reduction in the slow component of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and a modest depolarization. Catecholamine systems in other parts of the brain, including those found in the medulla, zona incerta, substantia nigra or olfactory bulb, received significantly less hypocretin input. Comparative analysis of lateral hypothalamic input to the LC revealed that hypocretin‐containing axon terminals were substantially more abundant than those containing melanin‐concentrating hormone. The present results provide evidence for direct action of hypothalamic hypocretin cells on the LC noradrenergic system in rats and monkeys. Our observations suggest a signaling pathway via which signals acting on the lateral hypothalamus may influence the activity of the LC and thereby a variety of CNSfunctions related to noradrenergic innervation, including vigilance, attention, learning, and memory. Thus, the hypocretin innervation of the LC may serve to focus cognitive processes to compliment hypocretin‐mediated activation of autonomic centers already described. J. Comp.

Genetic analyses in yeast indicate that binding of rapamycin to its intracellular receptor, FKBP12, generates a toxic complex that inhibits cell growth in G1 phase. These analyses implicated two related proteins, TOR1 and TOR2, as targets of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex in yeast. In this study, we have used a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FKBP12-rapamycin affinity matrix to isolate putative mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) from tissue extracts. In the presence of rapamycin, immobilized GST-FKBP12 specifically precipitates similar high molecular mass proteins from both rat brain and murine T-lymphoma cell extracts. Binding experiments performed with rapamycin-sensitive and -resistant mutant clones derived from the YAC-1 T-lymphoma cell line demonstrate that the GST-FKBP12-rapamycin complex recovers significantly lower amounts of the candidate mTOR from rapamycin-resistant cell lines. The latter results suggest that mTOR is a relevant target of rapamycin in these cells. Finally, we report the isolation of a full-length mTOR cDNA that encodes a direct ligand for the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The deduced amino acid sequence of mTOR displays 42 and 45% identity to those of yeast TOR1 and TOR2, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the FKBP12-rapamycin complex interacts with homologous ligands in yeast and mammalian cells and that the loss of mTOR function is directly related to the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on G1- to S-phase progression in T-lymphocytes and other sensitive cell types.', 'year': 1995, 'referenceCount': 29, 'citationCount': 849, 'authors': [{'authorId': '13152314', 'name': 'Candace J.

The effects of iron chelators, metabolic inhibitors and the cellular activators, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), on Tf and Fe uptake were investigated. Cells were incubated with 59Fe-125I-Tf; Fe uptake was shown to increase linearly over time for both cell lines, while Tf uptake reached a plateau within 2 h. Both Tf and Fe uptake were saturable. bEND3 cells were shown to have half as many Tf receptors as m1END1 cells, but the mean cycling times of a Tf molecule were the same. Tf and Fe efflux from the cells were measured over time, revealing that after 2 h only 25% of the Tf but 80% of the Fe remained associated with the cells. Of 7 iron chelators, only deferriprone (L1) markedly decreased Tf uptake. However, Fe uptake was reduced by more than 50% by L1, pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) and desferrithiocin (DFT).

The multikinase inhibitors sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib, the VEGF antibody bevacizumab in combination with interferon and the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus have all been shown to prolong progression-free survival in phase III studies. Here we review another mTOR inhibitor, everolimus (Afinitor ® ; Novartis, USA) which was approved in March 2009 by the US FDA for treatment of targeted-therapy refrac-tory metastatic renal cell cancer. The phase III study of everolimus (the RECORD study) was terminated early after a significant difference in efficacy was noted in the treatment arm with everolimus (progression-free survival of 4.0 months in patients on the treatment arm vs 1.9 months in the placebo arm). The most common adverse events were stomatitis, pneumonitis, fatigue and infections.

The development of a principal-agent relationship in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in which medical practitioners used their specialist knowledge to make decisions for and on behalf of their patients provided one way of managing this uncertainty. However the development of a less deferential and more consumerist culture associated with medical scandals in which trust has been betrayed have led to increased regulation of medical practice, especially the development of national standards based on encoded knowledge. Even if governments can overcome the practical problems of using such systems to structure decision-making, because these systems fail to address the personal and emotional components of trust they are likely to create a ‘trust deficit,’ a system that may work better, but is trusted less.",2007,49,72,"{'name': 'Health, Risk & Society', 'pages': '1 - 10', 'volume': '9'}","{'model': 'specter_v1',

Health professionals' claims to authority, for identifying and managing risk, are increasingly being challenged through the imposition of bureaucratic devices to control their professional behaviour. This paper examines the extent to which professional decision making is constrained in an organization that is characterized by the generation and application of rules for encoding knowledge and for monitoring compliance in order to ensure unified and predictable behaviour and outputs; a machine bureaucracy. Thirty nurse advisors in one NHS Direct site were interviewed, observation of the call centres and analysis of routine monitoring data were also carried out. The data revealed that respondents' behaviour was deceptive, giving the appearance of being controlled and standardized but in reality representing that of a professional working autonomously. By casting the encoded knowledge as a source of risk, respondents were able to invoke the use of professional judgement to manage the risks it posed. Informal risk management strategies and a focus on individual rather than organizational needs enabled respondents to subvert managerial control."", 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 33, 'authors': [{'authorId': '67218184', 'name': 'A.

In the UK, the current government is devoting considerable resources to welfare state reform and (arguably) achieving real improvements in services such as the NHS and education. Despite this, the reforms remain highly controversial and there is considerable concern about lack of trust in the new welfare policies. A decline in trust may undermine the public acceptability of the reforms and threaten the ability of government to gain electoral support for them. Recent work in sociology, political science and psychology indicates that rational deliberative and non-rational valued-based or affective factors contribute to trust in institutions. At the same time, theoretical arguments suggest an increasing need for public trust. Trust facilitates the co-ordination of complex enterprises under conditions of uncertainty, especially valuable at a time when rising demand and intensifying pressures for spending constraint provide a continuing impetus for reform. One possibility is that policies designed within a rational actor framework may erode the non-rational aspects of trust, so that the service improves but trust in it declines, with consequences for the political sustainability of reformed health care systems. Risk research in health care has a good opportunity to consider issues of institutional trust and to build inter-disciplinary links in doing so.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 41, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1422150939', 'name': 'P.

From the 1970s this oligarchy collapsed under the pressure of economic crisis. The British regulatory state is being constructed in its place.

Instead he argues that it is a new, threatening kind of interventionist state which is colonizing, dominating, and centralizing hitherto independent domains of civil society.

For example, in the quarter of a century between 1922 and 1947 the annual number of deaths recorded increased from 612 to 9,287, or roughly fifteenfold. This remarkable increase is, of course, out of all proportion to the increase of population-both in total and, particularly, in its older age groups. Stocks (1947), using standardized death rates to allow for these population changes, shows the following trend: rate per 100,000 in 1901-20, males 1.1, females 0.7; rate per 100,000 in 1936-9, males 10.6, females 2.5. The rise seems to have been particularly rapid since the end of the first world war, between 1921-30 and 1940-4 the death rate of men at ages 45 and over increased sixfold and of women of the same ages approximately threefold. This increase is still continuing. It has occurred, too, in Switzerland, Denmark, the U.S.A., Canada, and Australia, and has been reported from Turkey and Japan. Many writers have studied these changes, considering whether they denote a real increase in the incidence of the disease or are due merely to improved standards of diagnosis. Some believe that the latter factor can be regarded as wholly, or at least mainly, responsible-for example, Willis (1948), Clemmesen and Busk (1947), and Steiner (1944). On the other hand, Kennaway and Kennaway (1947) and Stocks (1947) have given good reasons for believing that the rise is at least partly real. The latter, for instance, has pointed out that "" the increase of certified respiratory cancer mortality during the past 20 years has been as rapid in country districts as in the cities with the best diagnostic facilities, a fact which does not support the view that such increase merely reflects improved diagnosis of cases previously certified as bronchitis or other respiratory affections."" He also draws attention to differences in mortality between some of the large cities of England and Wales, differences which it is difficult to explain in terms of diagnostic standards. The large and continued increase in the recorded deaths even within the last five years, both in the national figures and in those from teaching hospitals, also makes it hard to believe that improved diagnosis is entirely responsible. In short, there is sufficient reason to reject that factor as the whole explanation, although no one would deny that it may well have been contributory. As a corollary, it is right and proper to seek for other causes.', 'year': 1950, 'referenceCount': 3, 'citationCount': 1492, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4300751', 'name': 'R.

(Avery) 3 have revealed that at these hospitals cancer of the lung is now the most frequent visceral cancer in men.

In this country statistics compiled by the American Cancer Society show a similar trend during the past two decades. 5 Tobacco as a Possible Cause', 'year': 1950, 'referenceCount': 4, 'citationCount': 282, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46967108', 'name': 'E.

Agenda setting in multi-professional research : observations from a case study', 'abstract': 'This paper presents \x8e ndings from a study that investigated the relationship between research and practice on a Nursing Development Unit (NDU) in a hospital in the UK. The over-arching aim of the NDU was to promote individualised patient care. This requires the experiences and life goals of the patient, including the patient’s and family construction of risk, to inform the care planning process. Two projects, undertaken by nurses on the ward, one on inpatient self-medication and the other on the management of falls, are analysed as case studies in order to address the questions: (1) How do nurses develop and research patient-centred care? (2) What are the implications of their choice of methodology in relation to their stated aims of individualising care? The paper demonstrates how conventions about research methodology and outcomes dominated the nurses’ interpretation of research, the hospital research agenda and the literature on the research topics. These conventions shaped the construction of risk and safety within the hospital setting compromising practice developments designed to support the implementation of individualised care processes.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '67116495', 'name': 'usan'}, {'authorId': '2105397192', 'name': 'Rocter'}]}, {'paperId': '2ffc41e2787ab9ec5908ddb7d1ef1463c7e94173', 'title': 'Emotions and sociology', 'abstract': '1.

48,9cbd6c9b141ae5d1061946aaa81b2e7784800703,Investigating social gaze as an action-perception online performance,"Gaze represents a major non-verbal communication channel in social interactions. In this respect, when facing another person, one's gaze should not be examined as a purely perceptive process but also as an action-perception online performance. However, little is known about processes involved in the real-time self-regulation of social gaze. The present study investigates the impact of a gaze-contingent viewing window on fixation patterns and the awareness of being the agent moving the window. In face-to-face scenarios played by a virtual human character, the task for the 18 adult participants was to interpret an equivocal sentence which could be disambiguated by examining the emotional expressions of the character speaking. The virtual character was embedded in naturalistic backgrounds to enhance realism. Eye-tracking data showed that the viewing window induced changes in gaze behavior, notably longer visual fixations. Notwithstanding, only half of the participants ascribed the window displacements to their eye movements. These participants also spent more time looking at the eyes and mouth regions of the virtual human character. The outcomes of the study highlight the dissociation between non-volitional gaze adaptation and the self-ascription of agency. Such dissociation provides support for a two-step account of the sense of agency composed of pre-noetic monitoring mechanisms and reflexive processes, linked by bottom-up and top-down processes. We comment upon these results, which illustrate the relevance of our method for studying online social cognition, in particular concerning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) where the poor pragmatic understanding of oral speech is considered linked to visual peculiarities that impede facial exploration.",2012,57,18,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience', 'volume': '6'}",,"[{'authorId': '2791712', 'name': 'O.

Recent theories distinguish between a non-conceptual “feeling” of agency linked to changes in the processing of self-generated sensory events, and a higher-order judgement of agency, which attributes sensory events to the self. In the current study we explore the neural correlates of the judgement of agency by means of electrophysiology. We measured event-related potentials to tones that were either perceived or not perceived as triggered by participants' voluntary actions and related these potentials to later judgements of agency over the tones. Replicating earlier findings on predictive sensory attenuation, we found that the N1 component was attenuated for congruent tones that corresponded to the learned action-effect mapping as opposed to incongruent tones that did not correspond to the previously acquired associations between actions and tones. The P3a component, but not the N1, directly reflected the judgement of agency: deflections in this component were greater for tones judged as self-generated than for tones judged as externally produced. The fact that the outcome of the later agency judgement was predictable based on the P3a component demonstrates that agency judgements incorporate early information processing components and are not purely reconstructive, post-hoc evaluations generated at time of judgement."", 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 78, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1895071', 'name': 'S.

Previous investigations, however, have relied on paradigms in which participants are passive observers of other persons’ gazes and do not adjust their gaze behavior as is the case in real-life social encounters. We used an interactive eye-tracking paradigm that allows participants to interact with an anthropomorphic virtual character whose gaze behavior is responsive to where the participant looks on the stimulus screen in real time. The character’s gaze reactions were systematically varied along a continuum from a maximal probability of gaze aversion to a maximal probability of gaze-following during brief interactions, thereby varying contingency and congruency of the reactions. We investigated how these variations influenced whether participants believed that the character was controlled by another person (i.e., a confederate) or a computer program. In a series of experiments, the human confederate was either introduced as naïve to the task, cooperative, or competitive. Results demonstrate that the ascription of humanness increases with higher congruency of gaze reactions when participants are interacting with a naïve partner. In contrast, humanness ascription is driven by the degree of contingency irrespective of congruency when the confederate was introduced as cooperative. Conversely, during interaction with a competitive confederate, judgments were neither based on congruency nor on contingency. These results offer important insights into what renders the experience of an interaction truly social: Humans appear to have a default expectation of reciprocation that can be influenced drastically by the presumed disposition of the interactor to either cooperate or compete.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 56, 'citationCount': 78, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48230544', 'name': 'U.

Fifty male children American Society of Anesthesiolgists physical status classification I, aged between 3 and 12 were included in this randomized, prospective, comparative study. Anesthetic techniques were standardized for all children. Patients were randomized into 2 groups. Using 0.25% 0.5 ml/kg levobupivacain, we performed DPNB for Group 1 and caudal block for Group 2. Postoperative analgesia was evaluated for six hours with the Flacc Pain Scale for five categories; (F) Face, (L) Legs, (A) Activity, (C) Cry, and (C) Consolability. For every child, supplemental analgesic amounts, times, and probable local or systemic complications were recorded. Results No significant difference between the groups (P > 0.05) was found in mean age, body weight, anesthesia duration, FLACC pain, and sedation scores (P > 0.05). However, on subsequent measurements, a significant decrease of pain and sedation scores was noted in both the DPNB group and the caudal block group (P < 0.001).

Despite its significance, the neural basis remains elusive. To investigate the neural correlates of joint attention, we developed a novel, interactive research paradigm in which participants' gaze behavior—as measured by an eye tracking device—was used to contingently control the gaze of a computer-animated character. Instructed that the character on screen was controlled by a real person outside the scanner, 21 participants interacted with the virtual other while undergoing fMRI. Experimental variations focused on leading versus following the gaze of the character when fixating one of three objects also shown on the screen. In concordance with our hypotheses, results demonstrate, firstly, that following someone else's gaze to engage in joint attention resulted in activation of anterior portion of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) known to be involved in the supramodal coordination of perceptual and cognitive processes. Secondly, directing someone else's gaze toward an object activated the ventral striatum which—in light of ratings obtained from participants—appears to underlie the hedonic aspects of sharing attention. The data, therefore, support the idea that other-initiated joint attention relies upon recruitment of MPFC previously related to the “meeting of minds.” In contrast, self-initiated joint attention leads to a differential increase of neural activity in reward-related brain areas, which might contribute to the uniquely human motivation to engage in the sharing of experiences."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 367, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2127424', 'name': 'L.

They may either feel that external forces are controlling their actions or even their thoughts, or they may feel in control of events that in fact are not caused by their actions. Most theories link these disturbances in the sense of agency to deficits in motor prediction, resulting in a mismatch between predicted and actual sensory feedback at a central comparator mechanism. Such theories therefore can account for situations in which the sense of agency is reduced. However, other experiments as well as clinical observations show an enhanced rather than reduced sense of agency in schizophrenic patients. Here, we distinguish between a predictive and a retrospective mechanism where both contribute to the experience of agency, and show that schizophrenia is associated with a specific impairment to the predictive component. We measured subjective time estimates of self-initiated voluntary action (a key press) that were followed by a sensory effect (a tone). When the voluntary actions had a high probability of causing tones, healthy volunteers showed a predictive shift of the perceptual estimate of the action towards the tone, even on occasional trials where the tone was omitted. No such shift occurred in the absence of the tone on blocks when tones were less frequent. The predictive component of action awareness was calculated as the difference between time estimates on 'action only' trials from blocks with lower and higher tone probabilities. Schizophrenic patients lacked this predictive component of action awareness, showing a shift on 'action only' trials, regardless of the probability of the tone. Importantly, the schizophrenic deficit in predicting the relation between action and effect was strongly correlated with severity of positive psychotic symptoms, specifically delusions and hallucinations. Furthermore, the patients showed an exaggerated retrospective binding between action and tone, shifting the perceived time of action whenever the tone occurred, relative to when it did not occur. Our quantitative, implicit measures show how basic sensory and motor experience may be altered in acute psychosis. The enhanced sense of agency in schizophrenia reflects reliance on retrospection, rather than prediction, to associate actions with external events. The failure to predict the effects of one's own actions may underlie the blurring and confusion in the relationship between the self and the world that characterizes acute psychosis."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 60, 'citationCount': 279, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31963288', 'name': 'M.

In principle, perceptual cancellation of the displacements of the retinal stimulus caused by fixational eye movements could be achieved either by means of motor/proprioceptive information or by inferring eye movements directly from the retinal stimulus. In this study, we examined the mechanisms underlying visual stability during ocular drift, the primary source of retinal image motion during fixation on a stationary scene. By using an accurate system for gaze-contingent display control, we decoupled the eye movements of human observers from the changes in visual input that they normally cause. We show that the visual system relies on the spatiotemporal stimulus on the retina, rather than on extraretinal information, to discard the motion signals resulting from ocular drift.

We first analyze the difficulties experienced by people with high functioning autism in processing contextual cues during social conversations. We extend this approach to a broader scope including verbal and non-verbal communication. Indeed, understanding social interactions requires integrating and connecting transient multimodal social cues. The article then focuses on the alterations reported in high functioning autism concerning the ability to process facial expressions during an ongoing conversation. This ability involves attentional resources that are discussed in light of the executive dysfunction attributed to autism. On this basis, we hypothesize that the difficulties in appreciating the synergy between facial expressions and speech could be linked to impairments in shifting attention from one to the other. A new experimental paradigm designed for testing this hypothesis is presented. It relies on a virtual environment system based on eye-tracking technology enabling users to control the visual display via their gaze. The intent behind this apparatus is to compensate for the deficits in shifting attention attributed to autism.

To investigate these questions, we recorded eye movements during face recognition. During an otherwise standard face-recognition task, subjects were allowed a variable number of fixations before the stimulus was masked. We found that optimal recognition performance is achieved with two fixations; performance does not improve with additional fixations. The distribution of the first fixation is just to the left of the center of the nose, and that of the second fixation is around the center of the nose. Thus, these appear to be the preferred landing positions for face recognition.

Spatial updating, or remapping, is one neural mechanism by which the brain compensates for shifts in the retinal image caused by voluntary eye movements. Remapping of a visual representation is believed to arise from a widespread neural circuit including parietal and frontal cortex. The current experiment tests the hypothesis that extrastriate visual areas in human cortex have access to remapped spatial information. We tested this hypothesis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We first identified the borders of several occipital lobe visual areas using standard retinotopic techniques. We then tested subjects while they performed a single-step saccade task analogous to the task used in neurophysiological studies in monkeys, and two conditions that control for visual and motor effects. We analyzed the fMRI time series data with a nonlinear, fully Bayesian hierarchical statistical model. We identified remapping as activity in the single-step task that could not be attributed to purely visual or oculomotor effects. The strength of remapping was roughly monotonic with position in the visual hierarchy: remapped responses were largest in areas V3A and hV4 and smallest in V1 and V2.

To bring experimental measures in line with clinical observation, we report a novel method of quantifying atypical strategies of social monitoring in a setting that simulates the demands of daily experience. Enhanced ecological validity was intended to maximize between-group effect sizes and assess the predictive utility of experimental variables relative to outcome measures of social competence.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWhile viewing social scenes, eye-tracking technology measured visual fixations in 15 cognitively able males with autism and 15 age-, sex-, and verbal IQ-matched control subjects. We reliably coded fixations on 4 regions: mouth, eyes, body, and objects. Statistical analyses compared fixation time on regions of interest between groups and correlation of fixation time with outcome measures of social competence (ie, standardized measures of daily social adjustment and degree of autistic social symptoms).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSignificant between-group differences were obtained for all 4 regions. The best predictor of autism was reduced eye region fixation time. Fixation on mouths and objects was significantly correlated with social functioning: increased focus on mouths predicted improved social adjustment and less autistic social impairment, whereas more time on objects predicted the opposite relationship.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhen viewing naturalistic social situations, individuals with autism demonstrate abnormal patterns of social visual pursuit consistent with reduced salience of eyes and increased salience of mouths, bodies, and objects.

The aim of this study was to determine the implication of the prefrontal cortex in the control of action. For that purpose, we compared the performance of 15 patients with frontal lobe lesions and 15 matched controls on an experimental paradigm generating a conflict between the action planned and the sensory-motor feedback. Subjects had to trace a sagittal line witha stylus on a graphic tablet. The hand was hidden by a mirror on which the traced line, processed by a computer, was projected. Without informing the subjects, the line traced was modified by introducing a bias to the right, which increased progressively from 2 to 42. To succeed the task, subjects had to modify their motor program and deviate their hand in the opposite direction. The sensory-motor adjustment to the bias was evaluated by the surface between the line traced and the ideal line to compensate for the deviation. The awareness of the conflict was measured by the angle of the bias at which subjects expressed the feeling that the line they traced was not the same as the line they saw. The deviation was similarly compensated for by patients and controls until24. Then 14 controls but only3 patients were aware of a conflict.

The transformation is accomplished by dynamic updating of spatial representations in conjunction with voluntary movements. This direct sensory-to-motor coordinate transformation obviates the need for a single representation of space in environmental coordinates. In addition to representing object locations in motoric coordinates, parietal neurons exhibit strong modulation by attention. Both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of attention contribute to the enhancement of visual responses. The saliance of a stimulus is the primary factor in determining the neural response to it.

Despite this, she is unable to indicate any knowledge about these object properties. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which DF is able to use visual shape or pattern to guide her hand movements. In the first experiment, we found that when presented with a stimulus aperture cut in the shape of the letter T, DF was able to guide a T-shaped form into it on about half of the trials, across a range of different stimulus orientations. On the remaining trials, her responses were almost always perpendicular to the correct Orientation. Thus, the visual information guiding the rotation of DF's hand appears to be limited to a single orientation. In other words, the visuomotor transformations mediating her hand rotation appear to be unable to combine the orientations of the stem and the top of the T, although they are sensitive to the orientation of the element(s) that comprise the T. In a second experiment, we examined her ability to use different sources of visual information to guide her hand rotation. In this experiment, DF was required to guide the leading edge of a hand-held card onto a rectangular target positioned at dHerent orientations on a flat surface. Here the orientation of her hand was determined primarily by the predominant orientation of the luminance edge elements present in the stimulus, rather than by information about orientation that was conveyed by nonluminance boundaries. Little evidence was found for an ability to use contour boundaries defined by Gestalt principles of grouping (good continuation or similarity) or nonaccidental image properties (colinearity) to guide her movements. We have argued elsewhere that the dorsal visual pathway from occipital to parietal cortex may underlie these preserved visuomotor skills in DF. If so, the limitations in her ability to use different kinds of pattern information to guide her hand rotation suggest that such information may need to be transmitted from the ventral visual stream to these parietal areas to enable the full range of prehensive acts in the intact individual."", 'year': 1994, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 110, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145989594', 'name': 'M.

49,8812b9d4e06dc78fdf46bf463792d6fd65c9f804,Dextromethorphan/quinidine sulfate for pseudobulbar affect.,"A new agent containing a combination of dextromethorphan (DM) and quinidine (Q) is currently under development for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA). PBA is a disorder of emotional regulation, characterized by uncontrollable outbursts of laughing and/or crying that are disproportionate to the emotions being experienced. The pathophysiology of PBA is currently unknown, although the disorder is thought to occur exclusively in the setting of neurological disease. The most influential theory on PBA posits that emotional outbursts are being generated autonomously in the brain stem due to loss of regulatory control by the frontal lobe. Although rarely life-threatening, PBA can have significant impact on patient quality of life, and thus merits treatment. There are currently no approved treatments for PBA. Several agents have been found to be effective in small placebo-controlled trials and case series, with the most commonly used agents being tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Both these treatments are inexpensive and relatively low-risk, although the quality and quantity of data available on their efficacy are not optimal. DM has several pharmacological mechanisms of action relevant to the brain. It is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which prompted investigators to study its potential for slowing progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where glutamate toxicity is thought to be a factor. The combination agent DM/Q was developed to slow the metabolism of DM by P450 2D6 enzymes in the liver. DM/Q was not effective in slowing ALS progression, but patients noted that it helped to control their emotional outbursts, suggesting it might be useful as a treatment for PBA. DM is also a sigma-1 receptor agonist. These receptors are widely distributed in the brain, but probably most heavily in the limbic system, suggesting that DM may exert its emotion-controlling effects via these receptors. The endogenous ligands for sigma-1 receptors are not altogether known, although they appear to include gonadal steroids. DM/Q was recently shown to be effective in reducing the severity of PBA in two large studies of ALS and multiple sclerosis, which are probably the most common neurological settings. These are the largest treatment studies of PBA ever done. The agent was safe and relatively well tolerated. Further studies are being conducted to see if efficacy can be maintained with lower doses of quinidine. If DM/Q is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of PBA, it would be the first agent approved for this purpose. Currently, the antidepressants are probably the most attractive pharmacologic options for treatment of PBA. The choice of whether to use DM/Q in this setting will likely depend on individual patient factors as well as cost.",2008,38,29,"{'name': 'Drugs of today', 'pages': '\n          661-8\n        ', 'volume': '44 9'}",,"[{'authorId': '2184196', 'name': 'H.

Q inhibits the rapid first-pass metabolism of DM. The effects of AVP-923 (30 mg of DM plus 30 mg of Q) given twice daily for 28 days were compared with those of its components. Patients were evaluated on days 1, 15, and 29. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in the Center for Neurologic Study Lability Scale (CNS-LS) score. Secondary efficacy variables were laughing/crying episode rates and changes in Visual Analog Scales for Quality of Life (QOL) and Relationships (QOR). Efficacy was evaluated in intention-to-treat subjects who were not poor metabolizers of DM (n = 65 for AVP-923, n = 30 for DM, and n = 34 for Q). Safety was assessed in all randomized subjects (n = 140). Results: AVP-923 patients experienced 3.3-point greater improvements in CNS-LS than DM patients (p = 0.001) and 3.7-point greater improvements than Q patients (p < 0.001). AVP-923 patients exhibited lower overall episode rates, improved QOL scores, and improved QOR scores (p < 0.01 for all endpoints). Adverse effects were mostly mild or moderate; treatment-related discontinuation was 24% for AVP-923, 6% for DM, and 8% for Q. Conclusions: AVP-923 palliates pseudobulbar affect in ALS.

Cultural norms, such as the stigma associated with psychiatric disorders, may lead members of this population to ignore the emotional aspects of these disorders or deny the presence of psychological symptoms. Empirical support is provided by the lower prevalence of these disorders in some Western Pacific nations in relation to the rest of the world. For example, MDD rates in India (9%), Japan (2%), China (2% to 4%), Malaysia (8%) and Australia (3%) are generally lower than rates in the United States (16%) and worldwide (10%). These discrepancies may be the result of missed diagnoses. Misdiagnosis is related to the increased somatization of MDD symptoms in these populations. As defined by the WHO, the Western Pacific region consists of 37 countries with a total population of 1.8 billion people (1.3 billion in China alone) with diverse cultural backgrounds and demographic profiles, which makes the issue of cultural effects on MDD diagnosis more complex. Patients with MDD or anxiety disorders worldwide often present with somatic symptoms, which frequently accompany psychological symptoms. For example, in a recent report of pooled data from Canada, scores on the Somatic Symptoms Inventory, the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) were used to evaluate the association between somatic symptoms and MDD. Of the 2,191 patients randomly enrolled in the study, 78% reported moderate-to-severe fatigue and weakness. Painful physical symptoms commonly occur in patients with anxiety disorders as well.

Sigma receptors are non-opioid, non-phencyclidine receptors that contain two subtypes: sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. The sigma-1 receptor has been cloned and its sequence does not resemble that of any mammalian protein. Sigma-2 receptors have not been cloned. The focus of this review will be on sigma-1 receptors. Sigma-1 receptors contain 223 amino acids and reside primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum. Sigma-1 receptors exist mainly in the central nervous system, but also in the periphery. Sigma-1 receptor ligands include cocaine, (+)-benzomorphans like (+)-pentazocine and (+)N-allyl-normetazocine (or (+)-SKF-10047), and endogenous neurosteroids like progesterone and pregnenolone sulfate. Many pharmacological and physiological actions have been attributed to sigma-1 receptors. These include the regulation of IP3 receptors and calcium signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum, mobilization of cytoskeletal adaptor proteins, modulation of nerve growth factor-induced neurite sprouting, modulation of neurotransmitter release and neuronal firing, modulation of potassium channels as a regulatory subunit, alteration of psychostimulant-induced gene expression, and blockade of spreading depression. Behaviorally, sigma-1 receptors are involved in learning and memory, psychostimulant-induced sensitization, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, and pain perception. Notably, in almost all the aforementioned biochemical and behavioral tests, sigma-1 agonists, while having no effects by themselves, caused the amplification of signal transductions incurred upon the stimulation of the glutamatergic, dopaminergic, IP3-related metabotropic, or nerve growth factor-related systems. Thus, it is hypothesized that sigma-1 receptors, at least in part, are intracellular amplifiers creating a supersensitized state for signal transduction in the biological system.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 188, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144305331', 'name': 'T.

The episodes occur either without an apparent triggering stimulus or following a stimulus that would not have led the subject to laugh or cry prior to the onset of the condition. PLC is a disorder of emotional expression rather than a primary disturbance of feelings, and is thus distinct from mood disorders in which laughter and crying are associated with feelings of happiness or sadness. The traditional and currently accepted view is that PLC is due to the damage of pathways that arise in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex and descend to the brainstem to inhibit a putative centre for laughter and crying. In that view, the lesions 'disinhibit' or 'release' the laughter and crying centre. The neuroanatomical findings in a recently studied patient with PLC, along with new knowledge on the neurobiology of emotion and feeling, gave us an opportunity to revisit the traditional view and propose an alternative. Here we suggest that the critical PLC lesions occur in the cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathways and that, as a consequence, the cerebellar structures that automatically adjust the execution of laughter or crying to the cognitive and situational context of a potential stimulus, operate on the basis of incomplete information about that context, resulting in inadequate and even chaotic behaviour."", 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 387, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153836271', 'name': 'J.

(+)-SKF-10,047 and dextromethorphan, putative sigma receptor agonists, reversed the conditioned fear stress.

Potential items, as well as measures of affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression were administered to 99 patients with ALS for item selection and the examination of factor structure and construct validity. Test-retest reliability was examined using an additional sample of 31 patients with ALS, and criterion related validity was examined by comparing CNS-LS scores with physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability in a sample of 77 patients with ALS. RESULTS A seven item questionnaire emerged, composed of two subscales measuring labile laughter (four items) and labile tearfulness (three items). The CNS-LS showed a pattern of associations with affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression consistent with a scale measuring affective lability.

Since ALS occurs mostly in older age groups, this brings up the possibility that aging changes in the brain could play a causative role in the origin of such spells. To rule out or at least reduce the complicating factor of aging, a study was made of the incidence of pathologic laughter and crying in patients whose motor neuron disease had started before the age of 45 years. The data were collected from 73 such individuals, all with confirmed ALS. All told, 36 had experienced episodes of pathologic laughter and/or crying. Of these, 20 had bouts of both laughter and crying. 9 bouts of crying alone and 7 spells of laughter alone. Nearly all with such emotional spells had developed bulbar involvement with the illness.

DESIGN--Descriptive study of a cohort of patients consecutively entered on a community stroke register. SETTING--Community based research project. PATIENTS--A total of 128 patients who had suffered first ever stroke. INTERVENTIONS AND END POINTS--Patients were interviewed by a psychiatrist at 1, 6, and 12 months after stroke. Mood state was assessed by standardised semistructured interview (present state examination) and self report (Beck depression inventory). Intellectual impairment was assessed by mini mental state examination and Frenchay aphasia screening test. In addition, stroke lesions were localised by computed tomography. MAIN RESULTS--Emotionalism was reported by 13 of 89 patients (15%) at one month, 25 of 119 (21%) at six months, and 12 of 112 (11%) at 12 months after stroke. Patients with emotionalism had higher scores on both measures of mood disorder (at 6 months: mean Beck score 10.5 v 6.4; present state examination score 7.2 v 5.1) and more diagnosable psychiatric disorder (at 6 months: 40% v 14%; odds ratio 4.2, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 11.9). Almost all episodes were provoked by clearly identified and appropriate emotional experiences. Patients with emotionalism also had more intellectual impairment and larger lesions on computed tomography. Lesions in the left frontal and temporal regions were particularly associated with emotionalism: at 6 months 8 of 14 patients (57%) with such lesions had emotionalism compared with 10 of 52 (19%) of those with lesions elsewhere (odds ratio 5.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 22). CONCLUSIONS--Emotionalism is common after stroke. It is neither emotionally meaningless and inappropriate, nor is it found mostly in patients with bilateral brain damage. Emotionalism is associated with symptoms of a more general mood disturbance and is found especially in patients with left frontal and temporal lesions.', 'year': 1989, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 151, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144253717', 'name': 'A.

While the precise biological functions of sigma receptors have not been elucidated, recent work has shed some light on to these enigmatic systems. Sigma receptors have recently been a target of drug development related to psychiatric and neurological disorders. Sigma ligands have also been shown to modulate endothelial cell proliferation and can control angiogenesis which makes them a promising target for oncology applications. Other areas currently being investigated include treatment of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrine and immune system disorders. Of interest is that the human sigma-1 receptor gene contains a steroid binding component, and several gonadal steroids, including progesterone, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), interact with sigma-1 receptors. Of the steroids examined thus far, progesterone binds with the highest affinity to human sigma-1 receptors, with a reported affinity (Ki) as high as 30 nM while the other steroids exhibit lower affinity. For this and other reasons, sigma-1 receptors have been proposed as a link between the central nervous system and the endocrine and reproductive systems.

It seems of interest to investigate on adequate material the relative extent to which a short reaction time depends on the acuteness of the sense concerned, and on what we may term mental briskness. If reaction times to sight and sound depend largely on acuteness of sight and acuteness of hearing the correlations between acuteness and reaction time will be high; if, on the other hand, mentality is the chief factor in reaction time, we should expect a high correlation between reaction times for the different senses. Such is the problem which the present paper proposes to discuss.', 'year': 1923, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 59, 'authors': [{'authorId': '83824363', 'name': 'Y.

A tactic commonly used by our expert tutors is hinting, that is, the prompting of a student to recollect information presumed to be known to him or her, or the prompting of a student to make an inference needed to solve a problem or answer a question, or both. Hints may directly convey information or may point to information the student already possesses. Another tactic prompts the student in a step-by-step manner (in a directed line of reasoning) to an answer. Our tutors generated 315 hints and directed lines of reasoning in 30 hr of tutoring. The surface structure of hints is complex and varied, reflecting, in part, the fact that the utterances making up hints often serve multiple functions. Hinting is triggered by student errors but ceases when it appears that the student is unable to respond appropriately.

51,f9f3a4a3269d7ed86543144cd0579d81ecbd104b,A real reason for patients with pseudobulbar affect to smile,"Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a dramatic disorder of emotional expression and regulation characterized by uncontrollable episodes of laughing and crying that often cause embarrassment, curtailment of social activities, and reduction in quality of life. The disorder occurs in patients with brain injury caused by many types of neurological disease, including stroke, tumors, and neurodegenerative gray and white matter disorders. Although the pathophysiology is unknown, PBA may relate to release of brainstem emotional control centers from regulation by the frontal lobes. Diagnosis of PBA can be difficult and relies on careful characterization of episodes and differentiation from depression. Although there are no US Food and Drug Administration–approved treatments for PBA, several agents have been shown to be effective, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and a new agent containing dextromethorphan and quinidine. The growing number of treatment options, some of great benefit to patients, highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis of this disorder.

Cultural norms, such as the stigma associated with psychiatric disorders, may lead members of this population to ignore the emotional aspects of these disorders or deny the presence of psychological symptoms. Empirical support is provided by the lower prevalence of these disorders in some Western Pacific nations in relation to the rest of the world. For example, MDD rates in India (9%), Japan (2%), China (2% to 4%), Malaysia (8%) and Australia (3%) are generally lower than rates in the United States (16%) and worldwide (10%). These discrepancies may be the result of missed diagnoses. Misdiagnosis is related to the increased somatization of MDD symptoms in these populations. As defined by the WHO, the Western Pacific region consists of 37 countries with a total population of 1.8 billion people (1.3 billion in China alone) with diverse cultural backgrounds and demographic profiles, which makes the issue of cultural effects on MDD diagnosis more complex. Patients with MDD or anxiety disorders worldwide often present with somatic symptoms, which frequently accompany psychological symptoms. For example, in a recent report of pooled data from Canada, scores on the Somatic Symptoms Inventory, the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) were used to evaluate the association between somatic symptoms and MDD. Of the 2,191 patients randomly enrolled in the study, 78% reported moderate-to-severe fatigue and weakness. Painful physical symptoms commonly occur in patients with anxiety disorders as well.

Investigations into their neurological correlates remain fragmentary and the following review is a first attempt to collate and evaluate these studies, most of which have been published over the last two decades. By employing the classical methods of neurology, brain regions associated with symptomatic (pathological) laughter have been determined and catalogued under other diagnostic signs and symptoms of such conditions as epilepsy, strokes and circumspect brain lesions. These observations have been complemented by newer studies using modern non-invasive imaging methods. To summarize the results of many studies, the expression of laughter seems to depend on two partially independent neuronal pathways. The first of these, an 'involuntary' or 'emotionally driven' system, involves the amygdala, thalamic/hypo- and subthalamic areas and the dorsal/tegmental brainstem. The second, 'voluntary' system originates in the premotor/frontal opercular areas and leads through the motor cortex and pyramidal tract to the ventral brainstem. These systems and the laughter response appear to be coordinated by a laughter-coordinating centre in the dorsal upper pons. Analyses of the cerebral correlates of humour have been impeded by a lack of consensus among psychologists on exactly what humour is, and of what essential components it consists. Within the past two decades, however, sufficient agreement has been reached that theory-based hypotheses could be formulated and tested with various non-invasive methods. For the perception of humour (and depending on the type of humour involved, its mode of transmission, etc.) the right frontal cortex, the medial ventral prefrontal cortex, the right and left posterior (middle and inferior) temporal regions and possibly the cerebellum seem to be involved to varying degrees.

Sigma receptors are non-opioid, non-phencyclidine receptors that contain two subtypes: sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. The sigma-1 receptor has been cloned and its sequence does not resemble that of any mammalian protein. Sigma-2 receptors have not been cloned. The focus of this review will be on sigma-1 receptors. Sigma-1 receptors contain 223 amino acids and reside primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum. Sigma-1 receptors exist mainly in the central nervous system, but also in the periphery. Sigma-1 receptor ligands include cocaine, (+)-benzomorphans like (+)-pentazocine and (+)N-allyl-normetazocine (or (+)-SKF-10047), and endogenous neurosteroids like progesterone and pregnenolone sulfate. Many pharmacological and physiological actions have been attributed to sigma-1 receptors. These include the regulation of IP3 receptors and calcium signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum, mobilization of cytoskeletal adaptor proteins, modulation of nerve growth factor-induced neurite sprouting, modulation of neurotransmitter release and neuronal firing, modulation of potassium channels as a regulatory subunit, alteration of psychostimulant-induced gene expression, and blockade of spreading depression. Behaviorally, sigma-1 receptors are involved in learning and memory, psychostimulant-induced sensitization, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, and pain perception. Notably, in almost all the aforementioned biochemical and behavioral tests, sigma-1 agonists, while having no effects by themselves, caused the amplification of signal transductions incurred upon the stimulation of the glutamatergic, dopaminergic, IP3-related metabotropic, or nerve growth factor-related systems. Thus, it is hypothesized that sigma-1 receptors, at least in part, are intracellular amplifiers creating a supersensitized state for signal transduction in the biological system.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 188, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144305331', 'name': 'T.

The episodes occur either without an apparent triggering stimulus or following a stimulus that would not have led the subject to laugh or cry prior to the onset of the condition. PLC is a disorder of emotional expression rather than a primary disturbance of feelings, and is thus distinct from mood disorders in which laughter and crying are associated with feelings of happiness or sadness. The traditional and currently accepted view is that PLC is due to the damage of pathways that arise in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex and descend to the brainstem to inhibit a putative centre for laughter and crying. In that view, the lesions 'disinhibit' or 'release' the laughter and crying centre. The neuroanatomical findings in a recently studied patient with PLC, along with new knowledge on the neurobiology of emotion and feeling, gave us an opportunity to revisit the traditional view and propose an alternative. Here we suggest that the critical PLC lesions occur in the cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathways and that, as a consequence, the cerebellar structures that automatically adjust the execution of laughter or crying to the cognitive and situational context of a potential stimulus, operate on the basis of incomplete information about that context, resulting in inadequate and even chaotic behaviour."", 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 387, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153836271', 'name': 'J.

To clarify the functional role of sigma receptors in a stressful situation, we investigated the behavioral and neurochemical effects of various sigma receptor ligands on this psychological stress-induced motor suppression, defined as a conditioned fear stress. (+)-SKF-10,047 and dextromethorphan, putative sigma receptor agonists, reversed the conditioned fear stress. However, other sigma receptor ligands, (+)-pentazocine and 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine had no effect. Further, (+)-SKF-10,047, but not (+)-pentazocine, restored the decreased dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens in the stressed group to the control level, the effect being consistent with its behavioral effect. We indicated that these controversial results may be due to the presence of multiple types of sigma receptors, and that the activation of phenytoin-sensitive sigma 1 receptors may be involved in the ameliorating effects of sigma receptor agonists on this stress. Our findings suggest that the dysfunction in the mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons is responsible for the development of conditioned fear stress, and that this stress response is restored through phenytoin-sensitive sigma 1 receptors, which are closely connected to the dopaminergic neuronal systems.', 'year': 1998, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 17, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1972849', 'name': 'H.

METHODS Potential questionnaire items were identified through interviews with patients and families and expert review. Potential items, as well as measures of affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression were administered to 99 patients with ALS for item selection and the examination of factor structure and construct validity. Test-retest reliability was examined using an additional sample of 31 patients with ALS, and criterion related validity was examined by comparing CNS-LS scores with physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability in a sample of 77 patients with ALS. RESULTS A seven item questionnaire emerged, composed of two subscales measuring labile laughter (four items) and labile tearfulness (three items). The CNS-LS showed a pattern of associations with affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression consistent with a scale measuring affective lability. The CNS-LS also showed good test-retest reliability and internal consistency, and successfully predicted physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability. An auxiliary subscale measuring labile frustration, anger, and impatience also emerged. CONCLUSIONS The CNS-LS is a short, easily administered, and psychometrically sound measure of affective lability for use with patients with ALS.

Since ALS occurs mostly in older age groups, this brings up the possibility that aging changes in the brain could play a causative role in the origin of such spells. To rule out or at least reduce the complicating factor of aging, a study was made of the incidence of pathologic laughter and crying in patients whose motor neuron disease had started before the age of 45 years. The data were collected from 73 such individuals, all with confirmed ALS. All told, 36 had experienced episodes of pathologic laughter and/or crying. Of these, 20 had bouts of both laughter and crying. 9 bouts of crying alone and 7 spells of laughter alone. Nearly all with such emotional spells had developed bulbar involvement with the illness.

52,c27022f128dbb951245e7a865eab305a01979f4f,Computer response to user frustration,"Use of computer technology often has unpleasant side effects, some of which are strong, negative emotional states that arise in humans during interaction with computers. Frustration, confusion, anger, anxiety and similar emotional states can affect not only the interaction itself, but also productivity, learning, social relationships, and overall well-being. This thesis presents the idea of designing human-computer interaction systems to actively support human users in their ability to regulate, manage, and recover from their own negative emotional states, particularly frustration. This document describes traditional theoretical strategies for emotion regulation, the design of a human-computer interaction agent built by the author to actively help relieve frustration, and an evaluation that shows the effectiveness of the agent. A study designed to test this agent was conducted: A system was built that elicits frustration in human subjects. The interaction agent then initiated several social, emotional-content feedback strategies with some of the subjects, in an effort to help relieve their emotional state. These strategies were designed to provide many of the same cues that skilled, human listeners employ when helping relieve strong, negative emotions in others. Two control groups were exposed to the same frustrating stimuli, one of which was given no emotional support at all; the other enabled subjects to report problems and “vent“ at the computer. Subsequent behavior was then observed, and self-report data was collected. Behavioral results showed the agent was significantly more effective than the two controls in helping relieve frustration levels in subjects. These results demonstrate that strategic, social, emotional-content interaction with a computer by users who are experiencing frustration can help alleviate this negative state. They also provide evidence that humans may benefit emotionally in the short term from computers that respond in socially appropriate ways toward their emotions. The implications of this work suggest a wholly new role for computers in human life. Sociological ramifications of this new role are also discussed.",1998,83,55,"{'name': '', 'volume': ''}",,"[{'authorId': '2114063815', 'name': 'Jonathan Klein'}]","[{'paperId': 'caa960610561279c3fcbcbfbbcae8ba6d5dcc4a3', 'title': ""Frustrating the user on purpose: using biosignals in a pilot study to detect the user's emotional state"", 'abstract': 'Our goal was to develop a computer system trained to sense a user’s emotional state via the recognition of physiological signals.

It has been proposed here that one influence on individual differences in emotion regulation may be a child's attachment history. Individuals characterized by the flexible ability to accept and integrate both positive and negative emotions are generally securely attached; on the other hand, individuals characterized by either limited or heightened negative affect are more likely to be insecurely attached. While acknowledging the role of infant temperament, I have focused on the role of social factors in examining the link between emotion regulation and attachment. The approach to emotion regulation taken here--that emotion regulation is adaptive in helping a child attain her goals--is esentially a functionalist approach (Bretherton et al., 1986; Campos et al., 1983), consistent with earlier views of emotions as important regulators of interpersonal relationships (Charlesworth, 1982; Izard, 1977). It has been proposed that patterns of emotion regulation serve an important function for the infant: the function of maintaining the relationship with the attachment figure. Emotion regulation has been described as serving this function in two ways. First, the function of maintaining the relationship is thought to be served when infant emotion regulation contributes to the infant's more generalized regulation of the attachment system in response to experiences with the caregiver. Infants who have experienced rejection (insecure/avoidant infants) are thought to minimize negative affect in order to avoid the risk of further rejection. Infants whose mothers have been relatively unavailable or inconsistently available (insecure/ambivalent infants) are thought to maximize negative affect in order to increase the likelihood of gaining the attention of a frequently unavailable caregiver. Both these patterns of emotion regulation help ensure that the child will remain close to the parent and thereby be protected. Second, the function of maintaining the attachment relationship is thought to be served when the infant signals to the parent that she will cooperate in helping maintain the parent's own state of mind in relation to attachment. The minimizing of negative affect of the avoidant infant signals that the infant will not seek caregiving that would interfere with the parent's dismissal of attachment. The heightened negative emotionality of the ambivalent infant signals to the parent that the infant needs her and thus helps maintain a state of mind in which attachment is emphasized. The approach to emotion regulation presented here is congruent with much work examining the socialization of emotions (Lewis & Saarni, 1985; Thompson, 1990)."", 'year': 1994, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 1489, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35669149', 'name': 'J.

The mode of social interaction is that of a caretaker-infant dyad where a human acts as the caretaker for the robot. The robot’s motivational system is designed to generate an analogous interaction for a robot-human dyad as for an infantcaretaker dyad. An infant’s emotions and drives play a very important role in generating meaningful interactions with the caretaker (Bullowa 1979). Similarly, the learning task for the robot is to apply various communication skills acquired during social exchanges to manipulate the caretaker such that its drives are satisfied. Toward this goal, the motivational system implements drives, emotions, and facial expressions. The interaction is regulated specifically to promote a suitable learning environment. Although the details of the learning itself are beyond the scope of this paper, this work represents an important step toward realizing robots that can engage in meaningful bi-directional social interactions with humans.', 'year': 1998, 'referenceCount': 14, 'citationCount': 28, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

Many applications in affective computing research rely on, or can greatly benefit from, information regarding affective states of computer users. The sensing and recognition of human affect, therefore, is one of the most important research areas to receive much attention in the area of affective computing. In this work, inspired by the particular application of human-machine interaction and the potential use that human-computer interfaces can make of knowledge regarding the affective state of a user, we investigate the problem of sensing and recognizing typical affective experiences that arise in this setting. In particular, through the design of experimental conditions for data gathering, we approach the problem of detecting ""frustration"" in human computer interfaces. By first sensing human biophysiological correlates of internal affective states, we proceed to stochastically model the biological time series with Hidden Markov Models to obtain user-dependent recognition systems that learn affective patterns from a set of training data. Labeling criteria to classify the data are discussed, and generalization of the results to a set of unobserved data is evaluated. Final recognition results are reported under two conditions, for the entire data set, and only for those subjects with sufficient experimental data. Under the first criterion, recognition rates greater than random are obtained for of the subjects whereas under the second criterion, significant recognition rates are reported for 1 of the subjects.

Fifty-eight subjects with chronic age-related disabilities who were patients of the Wills Eye Hospital Geriatric Psychiatry Unit were assigned to a pet therapy intervention group or an exercise control group for 1 hr a day for 5 consecutive days. Every subject was blindly evaluated with the Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES) before and after the intervention week.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant differences in MOSES scores were found between or within groups before and after the interventions. There was a nonsignificant tendency for subjects who received the pet intervention to have less irritable behavior after treatment. However, women with dementia who received either pet therapy or exercise intervention had improved irritable behavior scores after treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis pilot study demonstrates the need for further research on animal-assisted interventions with hospitalized elderly persons.

In addition the agents are able to reason about emotion episodes that take place in one another's lives. The implementation includes representations for twenty-four emotion types (based on the work Ortony et al., 1988) and 1400 emotion-induced actions. Agents have rudimentary personalities, including an interpretive component which causes them to construe the world in idiosyncratic ways leading to emotional states, and an expressive component which give agents a unique profile for manifesting their emotions. Agents keep internal models of the concerns of other agents which allow them to explain the emotional episodes of other agents by classifying them as instances in which one or more of the twenty-four emotion types arise. \nThe implementation is simulation-based. It has been run with up to forty agents at a time. Situations arise in the modeled world, agents respond to some of these in their own unique, emotional, ways.

Rather, moment and their men, writes Erving Goffman in the introduction to his groundbreaking 1967 Interaction Ritual , a study of face-to-face interaction in natural settings, that class of events which occurs during co-presence and by virtue of co-presence. The ultimate behavioural materials are the glances, gestures, positionings, and verbal statements that people continuously feed into situations, whether intended or not. A sociology of occasions is here advocated. Social organisation is the central theme, but what is organized is the co-mingling of persons and the temporary interactional enterprises that can arise therefrom. A normatively stabilized structure is at issue, a ""social gathering"", but this is a shifting entity, necessarily evanescent, created by arrivals and killed by departures. The major section of the book is the essay ""Where the Action Is"", drawing on Goffman\'s last major ethnographic project observation of Nevada casinos. Tom Burns says of Goffman\'s work ""The eleven books form a singularly compact body of writing. All his published work was devoted to topics and themes which were closely connected, and the methodology, angles of approach and of course style of writing remained characteristically his own throughout. Interaction Ritual in particular is an interesting account of daily social interaction viewed with a new perspective for the logic of our behavior in such ordinary circumstances as entering a crowded elevator or bus."" In his new introduction, Joel Best considers Goffman\'s work in toto and places Interaction Ritual in that total context as one of Goffman\'s pivotal works: oHis subject matter was unique. In sharp contrast to the natural tendency of many scholars to tackle big, important topics, Goffman was a minimalist, working on a small scale, and concentrating on the most mundane, ordinary social contacts, on everyday life.o', 'year': 1967, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 6167, 'authors': [{'authorId': '16678797', 'name': 'E.

53,ea816ab60ec0f1a7f42a1ddc969933a52e6ed923,Central nucleus of amygdala projections to rostral ventrolateral medulla neurones activated by decreased blood pressure,"The central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) participates in cardiovascular regulation during emotional behaviour but it has not been established whether any of these effects are mediated through its direct connections to blood pressure‐regulating neurones in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The RVLM contains barosensitive neurones that maintain resting blood pressure via their projections to sympathetic preganglionic neurones in the thoracic spinal cord. In this study on rats, we used combined anterograde neuronal tracing of CeA projections with confocal and electron microscopic immunohistochemical detection of phenylethanolamine‐N‐methyltransferase, the adrenaline‐synthesizing enzyme present in C1 catecholamine neurones of the RVLM, and Fos, the protein product of the c‐fos proto‐oncogene. Fos expression in barosensitive neurones was stimulated by an intravenous infusion of the hypotensive agent sodium nitroprusside. Injection of the tracer biotin dextran amine (10‐kDa form) into the CeA resulted in anterograde labelling of axons and varicosities throughout the RVLM without retrograde labelling of somata in any brain area. With confocal microscopy, presumptive CeA terminals were found in close apposition to adrenergic (phenylethanolamine‐N‐methyltransferase‐immunoreactive) and non‐adrenergic neurones that displayed Fos‐immunoreactive nuclei in response to decreased blood pressure. Electron microscopic analysis confirmed that some labelled terminals of CeA axons made synaptic contact with c‐fos‐activated adrenergic neurones. The results provide evidence that cardiovascular influences elicited from the CeA during stressful events may be mediated, at least in part, via monosynaptic neural projections to barosensitive sympathetic blood pressure‐regulating neurones in the RVLM.",2005,51,40,"{'name': 'European Journal of Neuroscience', 'volume': '21'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [0.8781315684318542,

The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) plays a key role in sleep generation and, as such, might be an important target of the SCN circadian signal. However, direct SCN projections to the VLPO are limited, suggesting that most of the SCN output to the VLPO might be conveyed indirectly. We examined this possibility by microinjecting selected known major targets of SCN efferents with biotinylated dextran‐amine and/or cholera toxin B subunit, followed by analyses of retrograde labelling in the SCN and anterograde labelling in the VLPO. Retrograde labelling results confirmed that the medial preoptic area, subparaventricular zone, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and posterior hypothalamic area all received projections from the SCN; these projections arose predominantly from the shell, as opposed to the core, of the SCN. Anterograde labelling results indicated that these same nuclei also projected to the VLPO, mainly its medial and ventral aspects. Comparison of the results of injections of similar sizes across different target groups indicated that the rostral part of the medial preoptic area and the caudal part of the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus were particularly noteworthy for the abundance of both SCN source neurons and efferent fibres and terminals in the VLPO. These results suggest that the SCN might provide indirect input to the VLPO via the medial preoptic area and the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, and that these indirect neuronal pathways might play a major role in circadian control of sleep–wake cycles.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 88, 'citationCount': 89, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31558465', 'name': 'S.

This monosynaptic input includes adrenergic (C1), peptidergic, and noncatecholaminergic neurons. Some of the cells in this pathway are suspected to be glutamatergic, but conclusive evidence is lacking. In the present study we sought to determine whether these presympathetic neurons express the vesicular glutamate transporter BNPI/VGLUT1 or the closely related gene DNPI, the rat homolog of the mouse vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2. Both BNPI/VGLUT1 and DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNAs were detected in the medulla oblongata by in situ hybridization, but only DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA was present in the RVLM. Moreover, BNPI immunoreactivity was absent from the thoracic spinal cord lateral horn. DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA was present in many medullary cells retrogradely labeled with Fluoro‐Gold from the spinal cord (T2; four rats). Within the RVLM, 79% of the bulbospinal C1 cells contained DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA. Bulbospinal noradrenergic A5 neurons did not contain DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA. The RVLM of six unanesthetized rats subjected to 2 hours of hydralazine‐induced hypotension contained tenfold more c‐Fos‐ir DNPI/VGLUT2 neurons than that of six saline‐treated controls. c‐Fos‐ir DNPI/VGLUT2 neurons included C1 and non‐C1 neurons (3:2 ratio). In seven barbiturate‐anesthetized rats, 16 vasomotor presympathetic neurons were filled with biotinamide and analyzed for the presence of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and/or DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA. Biotinamide‐labeled neurons included C1 and non‐C1 cells. Most non‐C1 (9/10) and C1 presympathetic cells (5/6) contained DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA. In conclusion, DNPI/VGLUT2 is expressed by most blood pressure‐regulating presympathetic cells of the RVLM. The data suggest that these neurons may be glutamatergic and that the C1 adrenergic phenotype is one of several secondary phenotypes that are differentially expressed by subgroups of these cells. J.

However, rats with selective lesion of A5 cells by microinjection of 6‐hydroxydopamine into the pons showed no deficits to stimulation of the RVLM. 7 In summary, the loss of 84% of bulbospinal adrenergic neurones does not alter the ability of RVLM to maintain SNA and arterial pressure at rest in anaesthetized rats, but this loss reduces the sympathoexcitatory and pressor responses evoked by RVLM stimulation.

To clarify the nature of this involvement, immuno‐ and hybridization histochemical methods were used to follow c‐fos expression in these neurons in response to acute stimuli that differentially affect blood pressure and volume. From low basal levels, hypotensive hemorrhage (15%) provoked a progressive increase in the number and distribution of Fos‐immunoreactive (ir) nuclei in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the Al and C1 cell groups of the ventrolateral medulla, and in the pontine A5, locus coeruleus, and lateral parabrachial cell groups peaking at 2.0–2.5 hours after the challenge. Fos‐ir ventrolateral medullary neurons, subsets of which were identified as projecting to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus or spinal cord, were predominantly aminergic, whereas most of those in the NTS were not. Infusion of an angiotensin II antagonist blunted hemorrhage‐induced Fos expression in the area postrema, and attenuated that seen elsewhere in the medulla and pons. Nitroprusside‐induced isovolemic hypotension yielded a pattern of c‐fos induction similar to that seen following hemorrhage, except in the area postrema and the Al cell group, where the response was muted or lacking. Phenylephrineinduced hypertension stimulated a restricted pattern of c‐fos expression, largely limited to non‐aminergic neurons, whose distribution in the NTS conformed to the termination patterns of primary baroreceptor afferents, and in the ventrolateral medulla overlapped in part with those of vagal cardiomotor and depressor neurons. These findings underscore the importance of brainstem catecholaminergic neurons in effecting integrated homeostatic responses to cardiovascular challenges and their ability to responding strategically to specific modalities of cardiovascular information. They also foster testable predictions as to effector neuron populations that might be recruited to respond to perturbations in individual circulatory parameters. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.', 'year': 1994, 'referenceCount': 177, 'citationCount': 307, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49534406', 'name': 'Raymond K.

A total of 138 units were found which were inhibited by transient increases in mean arterial pressure elicited by intravenous injection of norepinephrine, aortic occlusion, or electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus, with 100% inhibition occurring at 148 mm Hg. Histograms of postsystolic activity showed that these units had pulse-synchronous rhythms which grew more prominent as arterial pressure increased. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve, which elicited a vasodepressor response, strongly inhibited these units. Thus, these neurons were termed negatively correlated cardiovascular units. At least half of these cells project to or through the thoracic spinal cord. In addition, arterial pressure sensitivity is conveyed through carotid sinus and aortic arch afferents. Approximately half of the cardiovascular units are also excited by hypothalamic stimulation.

Details of the pathways and transmitters that mediate tonic and reflex control of AP are emerging. Afferent fibers of cardiopulmonary receptors in the ninth and tenth nerves terminate bilaterally in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). Although some neurons contain substance P, the primary neurotransmitter appears to be the excitatory amino acid L-glutamate (L-glu). Neurons in rostral ventrolateral medulla, which most probably comprise the C1 group of epinephrine neurons, are also critical in AP control. C1 neurons project to innervate cholinergic preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the spinal cord. Stimulation of the C1 area electrically or with L-glu increases AP, while lesions or local injection of the inhibitory amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) lowers AP to levels comparable to spinal cord transection. Lesions of C1 neurons or their pathways abolish vasodepressor reflexes from baroreceptors and vagal afferents. In contrast, noradrenergic neurons of the caudal ventrolateral medulla, the A1 group, project rostrally to innervate, in part, vasopressin neurons of the hypothalamus. Stimulation of A1 neurons lowers AP, while lesions or GABA elevates it. We propose that C1 neurons comprise the so-called tonic vasomotor center of the brain stem and also mediate, via a projection from the NTS, the vasodepressor limb of baroreflexes.

Locations of most active pressor responses were compared to regions containing neurons labeled immunocytochemically for phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of adrenaline. Elevations of arterial pressure (+81.6 +/- 2.5 mm Hg) and cardioacceleration (+73 +/- 13.6 bpm) were elicited with low current (5 times threshold of 9.5 +/- 1.1 microA) electrical stimulation in a region of rostral ventrolateral medullary reticular formation we have termed the nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis (RVL). Electrical stimulation of the RVL increased plasma catecholamines (16.8-fold for adrenaline, 5.3-fold for noradrenaline, and 1.9-fold for dopamine) and vasopressin (1.7-fold before spinal transection, 4.7-fold after). The location of the most active pressor region in the ventrolateral medulla corresponded closely with the location of C1 adrenaline-synthesizing (PNMT-containing) neurons. In addition, the location of the most active pressor region in the dorsomedial medulla corresponded with the location of a bundle of PNMT-containing axons. Unilateral injections into the RVL of the excitatory amino acid monosodium L-glutamate (50 pmol to 10 nmol), but not saline, caused transient dose-dependent and topographically specific elevations (maximum +71.6 +/- 4.9 mm Hg) of arterial blood pressure and tachycardia. Injections of the rigid structural analogue of glutamate, kainic acid, caused large, prolonged (at least 15 min) pressor responses and tachycardia. Unilateral injections of the inhibitory amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the RVL caused transient dose-dependent hypotension (maximum -40.8 +/- 6.6 mm Hg) and bradycardia, whereas the specific GABA antagonist bicuculline caused prolonged (10 to 20 min) elevations (+64.2 +/- 6.8 mm Hg) of arterial pressure and tachycardia. By contrast, injections of the glycine antagonist strychnine had no significant effect. Bilateral injections of the neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, dropped arterial pressure to low levels (51.7 +/- 4.7) not changed by subsequent spinal cord transection at the first cervical segment (52.5 +/- 6.2). We propose the following. (1) Neurons within the RVL, most probably C1 adrenaline- synthesizing neurons, exert an excitatory influence on sympathetic vasomotor fibers, the adrenal medulla, and the posterior pituitary.

After placing injections of true blue in the dorsal vagal complex or in upper thoracic segments of the spinal cord, series of evenly spaced sections through the PVH were stained with antisera directed against oxytocin, vasopressin, somatostatin, methionine‐enkephalin, or leucine‐encephalin. The results indicate that both oxytocin‐ and vasopressin‐stained cells in the PVH project to the spinal cord and (or) to the dorsal vagal complex, although about three times as many oxytocinstained cells were doubly labeled after injections centered in either terminal field. The oxytocin‐ and vasopressin‐stained cells that give rise to these long descending projections were found primarily in caudal parts of the parvo cellular division of the PVH, where immunoreactive cells were shown to be significantly smaller than oxytocin‐ and vasopressin‐stained cells in parts of the nucleus that project to the posterior pituitary. Small populations of cells in the PVH that cross‐react with antisera against somatostatin, leucine‐enkephalin, or methionine‐enkephalin were also shown to project directly to the region of the dorsal vagal complex and to the spinal cord, and to have a unique distribution within the PVH.

Young adults from Mexico City (N=282) described an anger event, its causes, and the person they got angry at. Frequency analysis showed that there are five appreciations that generate anger (injustice, offense/aggression, disrespect, frustration, and disagreements) in five types of interpersonal relationships (relatives, strangers, couple, classmates, and friends). Specifically, it was found that the appreciations of injustice and offense/aggression generated anger with all causal agents. Therefore, interventions aimed at emotional regulation should take into account the fact that the appreciation of emotional stimuli differs depending on the type of interpersonal relation.",2014,23,0,"{'name': '', 'pages': '163-175', 'volume': '23'}",,"[{'authorId': '2110824330', 'name': 'M.

One hundred and seventy-five respondents participated in structured interviews about a work-related anger episode with a superior, co-worker, or subordinate. Various features of the anger episodes differed according to the status of the respondent, with superiors angered by morally reprehensible behaviors and job incompetence, co-workers angered by morally reprehensible behaviors and public humiliation, and subordinates angered by unjust treatment. Subordinates were less likely than superiors to confront the anger target and more likely to consider the incident unresolved. Humiliating offences elicited more intense hate than non-humiliating offences; hate was also negatively associated with situational power and with a perceived successful resolution of the anger-eliciting event.

The authors argue, first, that much research purporting to provide support for appraisal theory fails to do so by not clearly separating the antecedent, appraisal, from the consequent, emotion. Second, the authors argue that the available evidence does not show an unambiguous causal relation to emotions, and appraisals appear as consequences of emotions as well as antecedents. Third, emotion elicitation depends not only on appraisal but also on prevailing emotional response tendencies and, on occasion, on direct stimulus effects. Appraisals and emotions thus do not stand in such a clear relationship as appraisal theory would suggest.

The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the nature of METH-induced changes in the NPY system by examining the effect of multiple, high doses of METH on preproNPY (ppNPY) mRNA expression in the striatum and the role that dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors might play in these changes. Rats were administered five injections of 10 mg/kg METH at 6-h intervals, along with the D1 receptor antagonist 7-chloro-8-hydoxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benazepine hydrochloride (SCH22390) or the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride, and they were sacrificed 3 h after the last dose of METH. The number of neurons expressing ppNPY mRNA in striatum was examined using in situ hybridization histochemistry. An acute dose of METH as well as multiple, high doses of METH increased the number of neurons expressing ppNPY mRNA in all regions of striatum examined. There was no change in the number of prosomatostatin (pSOM) mRNA-containing neurons. The increase in the number of ppNPY mRNA-expressing neurons was abolished by pretreatment with SCH22390. Eticlopride alone increased the number of ppNPY mRNA-expressing neurons in striatum, and METH treatment did not further increase the number. These findings suggest that exposure to multiple, high doses of METH increases the number of neurons expressing detectable levels of ppNPY mRNA and that this phenomenon is dependent on DA D1-receptor activation.",2006,37,22,"{'name': 'Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics', 'pages': '414 - 421', 'volume': '319'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-4.463094234466553,

In the present study, injections of METH to mice were found to cause the death of enkephalin-positive projection neurons but not the death of neuropeptide Y (NPY)/nitric oxide synthase-positive striatal interneurons. In addition, these METH injections were associated with increased expression of neuropeptide Y mRNA and changes in the expression of the NPY receptors Y1 and Y2. Administration of NPY in the cerebral ventricles blocked METH-induced apoptosis, an effect that was mediated mainly by stimulation of NPY Y2 receptors and, to a lesser extent, of NPY Y1 receptors. Finally, we also found that neuropeptide Y knock-out mice were more sensitive than wild-type mice to METH-induced neuronal apoptosis of both enkephalin- and nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons, suggesting that NPY plays a general neuroprotective role within the striatum. Together, our results demonstrate that neuropeptide Y belongs to the class of factors that maintain neuronal integrity during cellular stresses. Given the similarity between the cell death patterns induced by METH and by disorders such as Huntington's disease, our results suggest that NPY analogs might be useful therapeutic agents against some neurodegenerative processes."", 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 92, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5083024', 'name': 'N.

Dopamine, glutamate, or their combined effects have been hypothesized to mediate striatal DA nerve terminal damage. Although it is known that METH releases DA via reverse transport, it is not known how METH increases the release of GLU. We hypothesized that METH increases GLU indirectly via activation of the basal ganglia output pathways. METH increased striatonigral GABAergic transmission, as evidenced by increased striatal GAD65 mRNA expression and extracellular GABA concentrations in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The METH-induced increase in nigral extracellular GABA concentrations was D1 receptor-dependent because intranigral perfusion of the D1 DA antagonist SCH23390 (10 μm) attenuated the METH-induced increase in GABA release in the SNr. Additionally, METH decreased extracellular GABA concentrations in the ventromedial thalamus (VM). Intranigral perfusion of the GABA-A receptor antagonist, bicuculline (10 μm), blocked the METH-induced decrease in extracellular GABA in the VM and the METH-induced increase in striatal GLU. Intranigral perfusion of either a DA D1 or GABA-A receptor antagonist during the systemic administrations of METH attenuated the striatal DA depletions when measured 1 week later. These results show that METH enhances D1-mediated striatonigral GABAergic transmission (1), which in turn activates GABA-A receptors in the SNr (2), leading to a decrease in GABAergic nigrothalamic activity (3), an increase in corticostriatal GLU release (4), and a consequent long-term depletion of striatal DA content (5).', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 191, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6153648', 'name': 'Karla A.

The purpose of this review is to provide an interim account for a role of oxygen‐based radicals and the participation of transcription factors and the involvement of cell death genes in METH‐induced neurodegeneration. We discuss data suggesting the participation of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria‐mediated activation of caspase‐dependent and ‐independent cascades in the manifestation of METH‐induced apoptosis.

Although the activities mediated by most dopamine receptor subtypes have already been determined, the role of the D5 receptor subtype in the basal ganglia has still not been established. Furthermore, it is often difficult to distinguish between dopamine D5 and D1 receptors as they are stimulated by the same ligands, and they have a similar molecular structure and pharmacology. In an effort to understand the differences between these two receptor subtypes, we have studied the distribution of neurons containing D5 receptors in the striatum, and their molecular phenotype. As a result, we show that the D5 receptor subtype is present in two different populations of striatal neurons, projection neurons and interneurons. Overall, the abundance of this receptor subtype in the striatum is low, particularly in striatal projection neurons of both the direct and indirect projection pathways. In contrast, the expression of D5 receptors in striatal interneurons (cholinergic, somatostatin‐ or parvalbumin‐positive neurons) is high, while low to moderate expression was observed in calretinin‐positive neurons. Our results demonstrate the presence of D5 receptors in all the striatal cell populations so far described, although at different intensities in each. The fact that a large number of striatal neurons express the D5 receptor subtype suggests that this receptor fulfils an important function in the process of integrating information in the striatum.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 69, 'citationCount': 129, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48363480', 'name': 'A.

Although prior work has focused primarily on the effects of methamphetamine on dopamine cells, there is evidence that other neuronal types are affected. The authors measured regional brain glucose metabolism, which serves as a marker of brain function, to assess if there is evidence of functional changes in methamphetamine abusers in regions other than those innervated by dopamine cells.\n\n\nMETHOD\nFifteen detoxified methamphetamine abusers and 21 comparison subjects underwent positron emission tomography following administration of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhole brain metabolism in the methamphetamine abusers was 14% higher than that of comparison subjects; the differences were most accentuated in the parietal cortex (20%). After normalization for whole brain metabolism, methamphetamine abusers exhibited significantly lower metabolism in the thalamus (17% difference) and striatum (where the differences were larger for the caudate [12%] than for the putamen [6%]). Statistical parametric mapping analyses corroborated these findings, revealing higher metabolism in the parietal cortex and lower metabolism in the thalamus and striatum of methamphetamine abusers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe fact that the parietal cortex is a region devoid of any significant dopaminergic innervation suggests that the higher metabolism seen in this region in the methamphetamine abusers is the result of methamphetamine effects in circuits other than those modulated by dopamine. In addition, the lower metabolism in the striatum and thalamus (major outputs of dopamine signals into the cortex) is likely to reflect the functional consequence of methamphetamine in dopaminergic circuits.

As a first step toward clarifying this issue further, the present study was thus undertaken to assess the toxic effects of methamphetamine in heterozygous and homozygous c-fos knock-out as well as wild-type mice. Administration of methamphetamine caused significant reduction in [125I]RTI-121–labeled dopamine uptake sites, dopamine transporter protein, and tyrosine hydroxylase–like immunohistochemistry in the striata of wild-type mice. These decreases were significantly exacerbated in heterozygous and homozygous c-fos knock-out mice, with the homozygous showing greater loss of striatal dopaminergic markers. Moreover, in comparison with wild-type animals, both genotypes of c-fos knock-out mice showed more DNA fragmentation, measured by the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick-end–labeled nondopaminergic cells in their cortices and striata. In contrast, wild-type mice treated with methamphetamine demonstrated a greater number of glial fibrillary acidic protein–positive cells than did c-fos knock-out mice.

Because of this association, we determined and compared the effects of psychotomimetic drugs on extrapyramidal and limbic NPY systems. We observed that phencyclidine, methamphetamine (METH), (+)methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and cocaine, but not (-)MDMA, similarly reduced the striatal content of NPY-like immunoreactivity from 54% (phencyclidine) to 74% [(+) MDMA] of control. The effects of METH on NPY levels in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra were characterized in greater detail. We observed that METH decreased NPY levels in specific regions of the nucleus accumbens and the caudate, but had no effect on NPY in the globus pallidus or the substantia nigra. The dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 blocked these effects of METH, suggesting that NPY levels throughout the nucleus accumbens and the caudate are regulated through D1 pathways. The D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride did not appear to alter the METH effect, but this was difficult to determine because eticlopride decreased NPY levels by itself. A single dose of METH was sufficient to lower NPY levels, in some, but not all, regions examined. The effects on NPY levels after multiple METH administrations were substantially greater and persisted up to 48 h after treatment; this suggests that synthesis of this neuropeptide may be suppressed even after the drug is gone.

Because the substantial DA overflow produced by multiple m‐AMPH treatments appears to contribute to the subsequent injury, we have investigated the effects of blockade of D1 or D2 receptors on m‐AMPH‐induced DA efflux using in vivo microdialysis. Four treatments with m‐AMPH (4 mg/kg, s.c., 2‐h intervals) produced large increases in striatal DA overflow, with particularly marked overflow (10 times the basal values) following the fourth injection. Administered by themselves, four injections of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 or the D2 antagonist eticlopride (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 2‐h intervals) significantly increased striatal DA overflow. However, treatment with either SCH 23390 or eticlopride 15 min before each of four m‐AMPH injections attenuated the marked DA peak otherwise seen after the fourth m‐AMPH injection. These effects on DA overflow were related to subsequent DA depletions. Although our m‐AMPH regimen produced a 54% reduction in striatal DA tissue content 1 week later, pretreatments with either the D1 or the D2 antagonist completely prevented subsequent DA content depletions. Furthermore, the DA content of striatal tissue remaining 1 week after m‐AMPH treatment was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the cumulative DA overflow during the m‐AMPH treatment (r= ‐0.69). Thus, the extensive DA overflow seen during neurotoxic regimens of m‐AMPH appears critical to the subsequent neurotoxicity, and the neuroprotective action of DA receptor antagonists seems to result from their attenuation of stimulant‐induced DA overflow.', 'year': 1993, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 110, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1394243791', 'name': ""S.

Somatostatin neurons varied in their morphology and amount of hybridization signal from region to region. The widespread distribution and regional variations in neuronal morphology and the amount of hybridization signal are consistent with a neurotransmitter and/or a neuromodulator role for somatostatin in addition to its well‐established neuroendocrine role.

It belongs to the same family of carboxyl-terminally amidated peptides as pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY. We describe here the gene encoding the rat neuropeptide Y precursor. The gene spans 7.2 kilobase pairs and contains four exons. The exon organization is identical to the pancreatic polypeptide gene, although the amino acid sequences of the neuropeptide Y and pancreatic polypeptide precursors differ extensively. The predicted amino acid sequence of mature rat neuropeptide Y is identical to the human sequence. Also the sequence of the 30-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide of preproneuropeptide Y is highly conserved, which suggests that it is functionally important. Two neuropeptide Y alleles were found to differ at nine positions in 2.5 kilobase pairs at the 5' portion of the gene. No exon difference was found. One nucleotide substitution close to the gene promoter may influence the regulation of expression. Neuropeptide Y mRNA was found in all rat brain subregions tested, which shows that neuropeptide Y is synthesized throughout the brain. Developmentally, mRNA was detected in the rat brain as early as embryonic day 16 and increased rapidly to adult levels. The level of neuropeptide Y mRNA was also studied in several rat peripheral organs. Unexpectedly high levels were observed in heart and spleen.

Further investigation revealed that neurons containing NADPH-d were also resistant to the toxicity of N-methyl-D-aspartate itself but were selectively vulnerable to the toxicity of either kainate or quisqualate. Thus, neurons containing NADPH-d may have an unusual distribution of receptors for excitatory amino acids, with a relative lack of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and a relative preponderance of kainate or quisqualate receptors.

The present studies were undertaken to determine what role the dopamine receptor subtype(s) might have in such METH effects. We found that the D1 antagonist, SCH23390, attenuated or blocked the effects of METH on dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, whereas the D2 antagonist, sulpiride, blocked the effects of METH on only the dopaminergic system. The results of the present studies suggest that METH-induced increases in dopaminergic action on both D1 and D2 receptors are associated with the effects of METH on the dopaminergic system.

56,74d302fa2f95b4f1a7b083986add0a6ce95d9025,Dextromethorphan/quinidine sulfate (Zenvia) for Pseudobulbar Affect,"SUMMARY A new agent containing a combination of Dextromethorphan and Quinidine is currently under development for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA). PBA is a disorder of emotional regulation, characterized by uncontrollable outbursts of laughing and/or crying that are disproportionate to the emotions being experienced. The pathophysiology of PBA is currently unknown, although the disorder is thought to occur exclusively in the setting of neurological disease. The most influential theory on PBA posits that emotional outbursts are being generated in the brainstem autonomously due to loss of regulatory control by the frontal lobes. Although rarely life-threatening, PBA can have significant impact on patients’ quality of life and thus merits treatment. There are currently no approved treatments for PBA. Several agents have been found to be effective in small placebo-controlled trials and case series, with the most commonly used agents being tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Both these treatments are inexpensive and relatively low-risk, although the quality and quantity of the available data on their efficacy are not optimal. is prompted study where was slow the DM by enzymes DM/Q slowing ALS progression, patients noted sigma1 widely emotion-controlling endogenous ligands for sigma1 receptors are not altogether known, although they appear to include gonadal Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which are probably the most common neurological settings. These are the largest treatment studies of PBA ever done. The agent was safe and relatively well tolerated. Further studies are being conducted to see if efficacy can be maintained with lower doses of quinidine. If DM/Q is approved by the FDA for treatment of PBA, this would be the first agent approved for this purpose. Currently, the antidepressants are probably the most attractive pharmacologic options for treatment of PBA. The choice of whether to use DM/ Q in this setting will likely depend on individual patient factors, as well as cost.",2010,38,1,,"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-3.9779224395751953,

Cultural norms, such as the stigma associated with psychiatric disorders, may lead members of this population to ignore the emotional aspects of these disorders or deny the presence of psychological symptoms. Empirical support is provided by the lower prevalence of these disorders in some Western Pacific nations in relation to the rest of the world. For example, MDD rates in India (9%), Japan (2%), China (2% to 4%), Malaysia (8%) and Australia (3%) are generally lower than rates in the United States (16%) and worldwide (10%). These discrepancies may be the result of missed diagnoses. Misdiagnosis is related to the increased somatization of MDD symptoms in these populations. As defined by the WHO, the Western Pacific region consists of 37 countries with a total population of 1.8 billion people (1.3 billion in China alone) with diverse cultural backgrounds and demographic profiles, which makes the issue of cultural effects on MDD diagnosis more complex. Patients with MDD or anxiety disorders worldwide often present with somatic symptoms, which frequently accompany psychological symptoms. For example, in a recent report of pooled data from Canada, scores on the Somatic Symptoms Inventory, the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) were used to evaluate the association between somatic symptoms and MDD. Of the 2,191 patients randomly enrolled in the study, 78% reported moderate-to-severe fatigue and weakness. Painful physical symptoms commonly occur in patients with anxiety disorders as well. In a European study, painful physical symptoms were reported by 28% of those without anxiety disorders and 45% of those with anxiety disorders.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 203, 'citationCount': 95, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2251772959', 'name': 'David M.

Sigma receptors are non-opioid, non-phencyclidine receptors that contain two subtypes: sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. The sigma-1 receptor has been cloned and its sequence does not resemble that of any mammalian protein. Sigma-2 receptors have not been cloned. The focus of this review will be on sigma-1 receptors. Sigma-1 receptors contain 223 amino acids and reside primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum. Sigma-1 receptors exist mainly in the central nervous system, but also in the periphery. Sigma-1 receptor ligands include cocaine, (+)-benzomorphans like (+)-pentazocine and (+)N-allyl-normetazocine (or (+)-SKF-10047), and endogenous neurosteroids like progesterone and pregnenolone sulfate. Many pharmacological and physiological actions have been attributed to sigma-1 receptors. These include the regulation of IP3 receptors and calcium signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum, mobilization of cytoskeletal adaptor proteins, modulation of nerve growth factor-induced neurite sprouting, modulation of neurotransmitter release and neuronal firing, modulation of potassium channels as a regulatory subunit, alteration of psychostimulant-induced gene expression, and blockade of spreading depression. Behaviorally, sigma-1 receptors are involved in learning and memory, psychostimulant-induced sensitization, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, and pain perception. Notably, in almost all the aforementioned biochemical and behavioral tests, sigma-1 agonists, while having no effects by themselves, caused the amplification of signal transductions incurred upon the stimulation of the glutamatergic, dopaminergic, IP3-related metabotropic, or nerve growth factor-related systems. Thus, it is hypothesized that sigma-1 receptors, at least in part, are intracellular amplifiers creating a supersensitized state for signal transduction in the biological system.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 188, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144305331', 'name': 'T.

Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been increasingly recognized as the treatment of choice for pathologic crying (PC). However, little is known about etiologies and other treatment options for various clinical manifestations of PLC. This case report illustrates the beneficial effect of lamotrigine, a novel antiepileptic drug with antidepressant and mood-stabilizing properties in post-stroke PLC. A 60-year-old woman developed PLC after an ischemic stroke affecting the left frontal and temporal lobes. She was treated with lamotrigine initially at the dose of 50 mg a day, which was gradually increased to 100 mg a day over a 4-week period.

The episodes occur either without an apparent triggering stimulus or following a stimulus that would not have led the subject to laugh or cry prior to the onset of the condition. PLC is a disorder of emotional expression rather than a primary disturbance of feelings, and is thus distinct from mood disorders in which laughter and crying are associated with feelings of happiness or sadness. The traditional and currently accepted view is that PLC is due to the damage of pathways that arise in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex and descend to the brainstem to inhibit a putative centre for laughter and crying. In that view, the lesions 'disinhibit' or 'release' the laughter and crying centre. The neuroanatomical findings in a recently studied patient with PLC, along with new knowledge on the neurobiology of emotion and feeling, gave us an opportunity to revisit the traditional view and propose an alternative. Here we suggest that the critical PLC lesions occur in the cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathways and that, as a consequence, the cerebellar structures that automatically adjust the execution of laughter or crying to the cognitive and situational context of a potential stimulus, operate on the basis of incomplete information about that context, resulting in inadequate and even chaotic behaviour."", 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 387, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153836271', 'name': 'J.

In 1924, Wilson postulated a supranuclear pontobulbar center for affective synergisms that is controlled by cortex and thalamus.

To clarify the functional role of sigma receptors in a stressful situation, we investigated the behavioral and neurochemical effects of various sigma receptor ligands on this psychological stress-induced motor suppression, defined as a conditioned fear stress. (+)-SKF-10,047 and dextromethorphan, putative sigma receptor agonists, reversed the conditioned fear stress. However, other sigma receptor ligands, (+)-pentazocine and 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine had no effect. Further, (+)-SKF-10,047, but not (+)-pentazocine, restored the decreased dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens in the stressed group to the control level, the effect being consistent with its behavioral effect. We indicated that these controversial results may be due to the presence of multiple types of sigma receptors, and that the activation of phenytoin-sensitive sigma 1 receptors may be involved in the ameliorating effects of sigma receptor agonists on this stress.

METHODS Potential questionnaire items were identified through interviews with patients and families and expert review. Potential items, as well as measures of affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression were administered to 99 patients with ALS for item selection and the examination of factor structure and construct validity. Test-retest reliability was examined using an additional sample of 31 patients with ALS, and criterion related validity was examined by comparing CNS-LS scores with physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability in a sample of 77 patients with ALS. RESULTS A seven item questionnaire emerged, composed of two subscales measuring labile laughter (four items) and labile tearfulness (three items). The CNS-LS showed a pattern of associations with affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression consistent with a scale measuring affective lability. The CNS-LS also showed good test-retest reliability and internal consistency, and successfully predicted physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability.

While the precise biological functions of sigma receptors have not been elucidated, recent work has shed some light on to these enigmatic systems. Sigma receptors have recently been a target of drug development related to psychiatric and neurological disorders. Sigma ligands have also been shown to modulate endothelial cell proliferation and can control angiogenesis which makes them a promising target for oncology applications. Other areas currently being investigated include treatment of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrine and immune system disorders. Of interest is that the human sigma-1 receptor gene contains a steroid binding component, and several gonadal steroids, including progesterone, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), interact with sigma-1 receptors. Of the steroids examined thus far, progesterone binds with the highest affinity to human sigma-1 receptors, with a reported affinity (Ki) as high as 30 nM while the other steroids exhibit lower affinity. For this and other reasons, sigma-1 receptors have been proposed as a link between the central nervous system and the endocrine and reproductive systems. Taken together, the above information highlights an important yet largely unexplored but promising area of research to examine the biological function and therapeutic potential of sigma receptors. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of these sites with a focus on specific areas where in vivo sigma receptor imaging is currently being investigated.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 325, 'citationCount': 81, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3781083', 'name': 'T.

As a repeated, circumscribed unit of developmental interaction, it is conceived to be an agent of developmental process and psychic structure formation. The appeal cycle has four phases: the adaptational phase, the distress phase, the appeal phase, and the interactional phase. The progression from the adaptational into the distress and appeal phases evidences the child's separation anxiety and failure of self-regulation in response to the experimentally induced attenuation of the mother-child relationship. A successful interactional phase reestablishes the relationship, regulates and restores the child's emotional equilibrium, and enables a return to self-regulation and adaptation. Because the interaction reinforces the functions and structures being developed through identification with the mother, the interactional phase is conceived to be an instrumental event in the mediation of psychic structure formation. The appeal cycle is discussed in comparison with similar phenomena in earlier phases of development and with other studies addressing development during the first two years of life. Directions for future research are noted.",1991,33,14,"{'name': 'Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association', 'pages': '1014 - 987', 'volume': '39'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

Concurrently, the child's behavior was observed in a play group situation. One set of rating scales was devised for assessment of the mother-child interaction, and another set for assessment of the child's functioning in the play group.

I trust that in the course of my presentation, necessarily quite brief and condensed, it will become apparent how much I owe to her observations and concepts, although my conceptual language in a number of ways differs from hers. I know how much I have learned from her ways of perceiving psychological material with the eyes, ears, and other perceptual organs of a psychoanalyst, while I often organize such data in a somewhat different, but I believe congenial, manner. In part this is the case because my psychoanalytic experience is based exclusively on therapeutic work with adults, however regressed or infantile they may have been in aspects of their personalities.

The major dimension of individual differences has been conceptualized in terms of quantitative differences in the ""strength"" of attachments, and a variety of discrete behaviors (touch, look, smile, approach, cling, cry) have been assumed to be valid ""indices"" of this dimension. These behaviors have been assumed to be significantly intercorrelated and stable across situations and over time. Critics have argued strongly that these assumptions cannot be defended empirically. It has further been argued that the study of individual differences in infant-adult ties is unlikely to he a productive research strategy and that attachment (as implying anything more than infant-adult interaction) has outlived its usefulness as a developmental construct. When, however, trait models are abandoned and greater attention is paid to the functions, outcomes, and context sensitivity of attachment behavior and to the underlying behavioral control systems that organize it, the apparent conflict between situational influences and stable individual differences can be resolved. The study of changes in the organization of behavior during development provides a framework for productive individual differences research. When greater emphasis is placed on the organization of behavior, both the stability and the flexibility of attachment behavior can be comprehended, and the attachment construct can continue to play an important integrative role in developmental theory.', 'year': 1977, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 1638, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5244329', 'name': 'L.

Individual differences in four separation-related behaviors--protest, following, and positive greetings or crying on reunion--were examined for 26 infants observed intensively at home during the fourth quarter-year, and considered in relation to one another, to other infant behaviors, and to maternal behavior. Contrary to Freudian and other hypotheses, separation protest was found to be related positively to maternal unresponsiveness to crying and negatively to maternal sensitivity to signals, while positive greetings had the converse of these relationships. The first factor yielded by a factor analysis seemed to reflect a security-insecurity dimension in an infant's organization of attachment behavior to his mother. The anxious cluster of behaviors included separation protest and crying on reunion, as well as crying when put down and frequency and duration of crying in general. The secure cluster included positive greetings on reunion and (to a lesser extent) following on separation, as well as positive responses both to being held and to being put down.

Now that the more spectacular forms of maternal deprivation have lost their urgency, other problems, more obscure, more difficult to investigate and also to deal with, and perhaps even more urgent for humanity in general, claim our attention.

The notion of autonomic computation, like other notions that also imply proactive computation, is based on autonomous entities that actively work to achieve their objectives and have the ability to dynamically adjust to changes in their environment, constrained by time and resource limits. In the approach used by the AutoFocus project, that adaptation to change and the regulation of the agent’s capabilities, result from the combination of cognitive aspects with emotional based aspects. The agent model defined and used by the AutoFocus project is the Agent Flow Model. The task that corresponded to the work presented in this document was to develop a platform for the Agent Flow Model.

The symbolic approach views cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation. Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter Gardenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist approaches. Symbolic representation is particularly weak at modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the symbolic approach. Gardenfors's theory of conceptual spaces presents a framework for representing information on the conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions. The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be applied to the development of artificial systems capable of solving cognitive tasks. Gardenfors also shows how conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning concept formation, induction, and semantics. His aim is to present a coherent research program that can be used as a basis for more detailed investigations.

The important role of emotions in the control and the organisation of the behaviour of robotic systems has been identified. This branch of robotics has recently been enabled and therefore significant research is expected to be carried out. This paper presents a real-time emotional architecture (RTEA) that allows the regulation of the behaviour of robotic agents to fulfil the objectives depending on the emotional state, on the attitude and on the mental capabilities (processor) of the agent. RTEA has been embedded in a real-time Linux kernel to permit the robot to have a more suitable control of the mental capacity and to guarantee the system integrity. A service robotic application where the robot is programmed with different attitudes shows how each of the attitudes influence the robot behavioural control, the use of the mental capacity and the degrees of satisfaction of the achievement of the objectives",2006,12,5,"{'name': 'IECON 2006 - 32nd Annual Conference on IEEE Industrial Electronics', 'pages': '4119-4124'}",,"[{'authorId': '1410696259', 'name': 'C.

Some confuse the concept of ""emotion"" with the more general concept of ""affect"", which covers other things besides emotions, including moods, attitudes, desires, preferences, intentions, dislikes, etc. Moreover researchers have different goals: some are concerned with understanding natural phenomena, while others are more concerned with producing useful artifacts, e.g. synthetic entertainment agents, sympathetic machine interfaces, and the like. We address this confusion by showing how ""architecture-based"" concepts can extend and refine our pre-theoretical concepts in ways that make them more useful both for expressing scientific questions and theories, and for specifying engineering objectives. An implication is that different information-processing architectures support different classes of emotions, different classes of consciousness, different varieties of perception, and so on. We start with high level concepts applicable to a wide variety of types of natural and artificial systems, including very simple organisms, namely concepts such as ""need"", ""function"", ""information-user"", ""affect"", ""information-processing architecture"". For more complex architectures, we offer the CogAff schema as a generic framework which distinguishes types of components that may be in a architecture, operating concurrently with different functional roles. We also sketch H-Cogaff, a richly-featured special case of CogAff, conjectured as a type of architecture that can explain or replicate human mental phenomena. We show how the concepts that are definable in terms of such architectures can clarify and enrich research on human emotions. If successful for the purposes of science and philosophy the architecture is also likely to be useful for engineering purposes, though many engineering goals can be achieved using shallow concepts and shallow theories, e.g., producing ""believable"" agents for computer entertainments.

These effects are modeled by manipulating a series of architecture parameters, such as the speed and processing capacity of the individual modules. The paper presents results of an evaluation experiment modeling the behavior of three types of agents: ‘normal’, ‘anxious’, and ‘aggressive’.

Are there activities that computers can engage in that actively draw people into relationships with them? What are the potential benefits to the people who participate in these human-computer relationships? To address these questions this work introduces a theory of Relational Agents, which are computational artifacts designed to build and maintain long-term, social-emotional relationships with their users. These can be purely software humanoid animated agents--as developed in this work--but they can also be non-humanoid or embodied in various physical forms, from robots, to pets, to jewelry, clothing, hand-helds, and other interactive devices. Central to the notion of relationship is that it is a persistent construct, spanning multiple interactions; thus, Relational Agents are explicitly designed to remember past history and manage future expectations in their interactions with users. Finally, relationships are fundamentally social and emotional, and detailed knowledge of human social psychology--with a particular emphasis on the role of affect--must be incorporated into these agents if they are to effectively leverage the mechanisms of human social cognition in order to build relationships in the most natural manner possible. People build relationships primarily through the use of language, and primarily within the context of face-to-face conversation. Embodied Conversational Agents--anthropomorphic computer characters that emulate the experience of face-to-face conversation--thus provide the substrate for this work, and so the relational activities provided by the theory will primarily be specific types of verbal and nonverbal conversational behaviors used by people to negotiate and maintain relationships. This work also provides an analysis of the types of applications in which having a human-computer relationship is advantageous to the human participant. In addition to applications in which the relationship is an end in itself (e.g., in entertainment systems), human-computer relationships are important in tasks in which the human is attempting to undergo some change in behavior or cognitive or emotional state. One such application is explored here: a system for assisting the user through a month-long health behavior change program in the area of exercise adoption. This application involves the research, design and implementation of relational agents as well as empirical evaluation of their ability to build relationships and effect change over a series of interactions with users.

In this paper, we first report on the results of an experiment with an agent-guided mathematical game suggesting that an interface character with affective behavior may significantly decrease user stress. Then, we describe a character-based job interview scenario where a user's affective state derived from physiological data is projected back (or 'mirrored') to the user in real-time.

Experiments were conducted for evaluation of the new systems and algorithms in three types of settings: a highly constrained laboratory setting, a largely unconstrained ambulatory environment, and a less unconstrained automotive environment. The laboratory experiment was designed to test for the presence of unique physiological patterns given a relatively motionless seated subject, intentionally expressing one of eight different emotions. This experiment generated a large dataset of physiological signals containing many day-today variations, and the proposed features contributed to a success rate of 81% for discriminating all eight emotions and up to 100% for subsets of emotion based on similar emotion qualities. For experiments in a largely unconstrained ambulatory setting, new wearable computer systems and sensors were developed and tested on subjects who walked, jogged, talked, and otherwise went about daily activities. Although physical motion often overwhelmed affective signals in this context, the systems developed in this thesis are currently useful as activity monitors, providing an image diary correlated with physiological signals. A third experiment was conducted in the natural but physically constrained environment of an automobile, generating a large database of physiological signals covering over 40 hours of driving data. This experiment was designed to induce varying amounts of stress in three conditions: rest, city diving and highway driving. Algorithms for detecting driver stress achieved a recognition rates of 96% for stress ratings based on task conditions and 89% accuracy using ratings of perceived stress from driver questionnaires. The results of second by second video coding of stressors by independent coders showed highly significant correlations with physiological features (up to r = .77 for over 4000 samples). Together, these three experiments show a range of success in recognizing affect from physiology, highlighting the need for more automatic context sensing in unconstrained conditions, and showing high recognition rates given somewhat constrained conditions. The recognition rates obtained thus far lend support to the hypothesis that many emotional differences can be automatically discriminated in patterns of physiological changes.

Relevant conceptual issues concerning both the nature of emotion and the structure of the autonomic nervous system are discussed in the context of the development of research methods appropriate for studying this question. Are different emotional states associated with distinct patterns of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity? This is an old question that is currently enjoying a modest revival in psychology. In the 1950s autonomic specificity was a key item on the agenda of the newly emerging discipline of psychophysiology, which saw as its mission the scientific exploration of the mind-body relationship using the tools of electrophysiological measurement. But the field of psychophysiology had the misfortune of coming of age during a period in which psychology drifted away from its physiological roots, a period in which psychology was dominated by learning, behaviourism, personality theory and later by cognition. Psychophysiology in the period between 1960 and 1980 reflected these broader trends in psychology by focusing on such issues as autonomic markers of perceptual states (e.g. orienting, stimulus processing), the interplay between personality factors and ANS responsivity, operant conditioning of autonomic functions, and finally, electrophysiological markers of cognitive states. Research on autonomic specificity in emotion became increasingly rare. Perhaps as a result of these historical trends in psychology, or perhaps because research on emotion and physiology is so difficult to do well, there 18 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION exists only a small body of studies on ANS specificity. Although almost all of these studies report some evidence for the existence of specificity, the prevailing zeitgeist has been that specificity has not been empirically established. At this point in time a review of the existing literature would not be very informative, for it would inevitably dissolve into a critique of methods. Instead, what I hope to accomplish in this chapter is to provide a new framework for thinking about ANS specificity, and to propose guidelines for carrying out research on this issue that will be cognizant of the recent methodological and theoretical advances that have been made both in psychophysiology and in research on emotion. Emotion as organization From the outset, the definition of emotion that underlies this chapter should be made explicit. For me the essential function of emotion is organization. The selection of emotion for preservation across time and species is based on the need for an efficient mechanism than can mobilize and organize disparate response systems to deal with environmental events that pose a threat to survival. In this view the prototypical context for human emotions is those situations in which a multi-system response must be organized quickly, where time is not available for the lengthy processes of deliberation, reformulation, planning and rehearsal; where a fine degree of co-ordination is required among systems as disparate as the muscles of the face and the organs of the viscera; and where adaptive behaviours that normally reside near the bottom of behavioural hierarchies must be instantaneously shifted to the top. Specificity versus undifferentiated arousal In this model of emotion as organization it is assumed that each component system is capable of a number of different responses, and that the emotion will guide the selection of responses from each system. Component systems differ in terms of the number of response possibilities. Thus, in the facial expressive system a selection must be made among a limited set of prototypic emotional expressions (which are but a subset of the enormous number of expressions the face is capable of assuming). A motor behaviour must also be selected from a similarly reduced set of responses consisting of fighting, fleeing, freezing, hiding, etc. All major theories of emotion would accept the proposition that activation of the ANS is one of the changes that occur during emotion. But theories differ as to how many different ANS patterns constitute the set of selection possibilities. At one extreme are those who would argue that there are only two ANS patterns: 'off' and 'on'. The 'on' ANS pattern, according to this view, consists EMOTION AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 19 of a high-level, global, diffuse ANS activation, mediated primarily by the sympathetic branch of the ANS. The manifestations of this pattern rapid and forcefulcontractions of the heart, rapid and deep breathing, increased systolic blood pressure, sweating, dry mouth, redirection of blood flow to large skeletal muscles, peripheral vasoconstriction, release of large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, and the resultant release of glucose from the liver are well known. Cannon (1927) described this pattern in some detail, arguing that this kind of high-intensity, undifferentiated arousal accompanied all emotions .. Among contemporary theories the notion of undifferentiated arousal is most clearly found in Mandler's theory (Mandler, 1975). However, undifferentiated arousal also played a major role in the extraordinarily influential cognitive/physiological theory of Schachter and Singer (1962). According to this theory, undifferentiated arousal is a necessary precondition for emotionan extremely plastic medium to be moulded by cognitive processes working in concert with the available cues from the social environment. At the other extreme are those who argue that there are a large number of patterns of ANS activation, each associated with a different emotion (or subset of emotions). This is the traditional specificity position. Its classic statement is often attributed to James (1884), although Alexander (1950) provided an even more radical version. The specificity position fuelled a number of experimental studies in the 1950s and 1960s, all attempting to identify some of these autonomic patterns (e.g. Averill, 1969; Ax, 1953; Funkenstein, King and Drolette, 1954; Schachter, 1957; Sternbach, 1962). Despite these studies, all of which reported support for ANS specificity, the undifferentiated arousal theory, especially as formulated by Schachter and Singer (1962) and their followers, has been dominant for a great many years. Is the ANS capable of specific action No matter how appealing the notion of ANS specificity might be in the abstract, there would be little reason to pursue it in the laboratory if the ANS were only capable of producing one pattern of arousal. There is no question that the pattern of high-level sympathetic arousal described earlier is one pattern that the ANS can produce. Cannon's arguments notwithstanding, I believe there now is quite ample evidence that the ANS is capable of a number of different patterns of activation. Whether these patterns are reliably associated with different emotions remains an empirical question, but the potential is surely there. A case in support of this potential for specificity can be based on: (a) the neural structure of the ANS; (b) the stimulation neurochemistry of the ANS; and (c) empirical findings. 20 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION"", 'year': 1988, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 304, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2001910', 'name': 'R.

Brilliantly orchestrating the new findings of geneticists, psychologists, and anthropologists, The Origins of Virtue re-examines the everyday assumptions upon which we base our actions towards others, whether we are nurturing parents, siblings, or trade partners. The Origins of Virtue searches for the roots of that capacity for trust, contrasts it with the social instincts of ants, baboons, and naked mole rats, and draws provocative conclusions for our understanding of politics.

Huang * Abstract: This Article studies how beliefs about strategic behavior interact with such emotions as guilt and fear in securities investment. Most investors lack the inclination, knowledge, or time to actively manage their investments full-time. Instead, most investors hire a financial professional to manage their portfolios. There are well-known incentive and behavioral problems with such a principal-agent relationship. This Article focuses on some novel emotional consequences of the fiduciary investing relationship. This Article applies psychological games of trust and herd-like behavior to explain how the duties of loyalty and care alter beliefs about strategic behavior, emotions that depend on those beliefs, and strategic behavior itself. This Article also discusses the applicability of such models to corporate law and other fiduciary settings. Thanks to Scott Altman, Colin Camerer, Ron Garet, Rebecca Huss, Kimberly D. Krawiec, Don C.

The first years at university represent a crucial period for students and are associated with an increase in mental health problems, particularly in healthcare studies. This study aimed (1) to document the current levels of mental health and study engagement among healthcare students in Tunisia, and (2) to investigate the relationships between emotional regulation, optimism, study engagement and common mental health problems (stress, anxiety and depression) among this population. A cross-sectional, electronic survey-based research design was used to draw a sample of 366 health care students from a University in Tunisia. Participants mostly reported mild (34.7%) or moderate (44.3%) levels of depression, moderate (44.7%) or severe (33.6%) levels of anxiety, average (50.8%) or mild (33.8%) levels of stress, and high levels of study engagement (>85%). Through structural equation modelling, the results showed that emotional regulation negatively affected stress, anxiety, and depression. Optimism partially mediated the relationship between emotional regulation, anxiety and depression and fully mediated the relationship between emotional regulation and study engagement. The findings indicated a high prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare university students in Tunisia, and specific protective factors that may be targeted to reduce mental health

An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 923 university students during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. Significant gender differences were found on mental health symptoms, emotional intelligence, and social support. A double mediation model was computed to verify if gender influences on mental health were mediated by emotional intelligence and social support. The results show indirect effects of gender on mental health. However, as both mediators mediate in the opposite direction, the total indirect effects become null.

To address this gap, we conducted an online study among undergraduate students (n = 366) to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academics, social isolation, and mental health, as well as the extent to which they have been implementing a variety of coping strategies. The pandemic had a more pronounced negative effect on female students' academics, social isolation, stress and mental health compared to male counterparts. Moreover, for females, frequent use of social media as a coping mechanism was associated with greater perceived negative impacts on their academic performance and stress levels, compared to males. However, frequent social media use related to similar negative mental health effects for both males and females. While male and female students both reported using substances to cope, for males the use of cannabis was associated with greater negative impacts on academic outcomes, stress and mental health compared to females.

This study adopted a cross-sectional, correlational design to collect data from 365 health-care workers in Amman, Jordan, from August 16th to 23rd, 2020. Along with collecting sociodemographic characteristics, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support electronically administered to participants. The majority of the participants (69.3%) were registered nurses. The mean overall score for the Fear of COVID-19 scale was 23.64 (SD + 6.85) which again exceeded the mid-point for the total score range (21), indicating elevated level fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants had displayed extremely severe depression 40%, extremely severe anxiety 60%, and 35% severely distressed. Scores for depression (21.30 ± 10.86), anxiety (20.37 ± 10.80), stress (23.33 ± 10.87) were also high.

We performed structural equation modelling to examine these essential assumptions. As assumed, we found that study demands—the “bad things” at university—predict student burnout (β = 0.50), whereas study resources—the “good things” at university—predict student engagement (β = 0.70) as well as burnout (β = −0.35). Also, in line with the SD-R’s assumptions, student burnout predicts life satisfaction negatively (β = −0.34), whereas student engagement predicts life satisfaction positively (β = 0.29). Hence, we were able to introduce the novel SD-R framework and validate its core assumptions.

Distance-learning students are particularly burdened and have limited access to conventional university health services. Interventions for stress are sought after in distance learners and may help increase treatment coverage. Internet-based interventions have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating depression, but it remains unclear if interventions directed at academic stress also have this potential. Aim: The trial presented here investigates the effectiveness of an Internet- and App-based stress intervention in distance-learning students with elevated levels of depression. Methods: A sample of N = 200 students of a large German distance university with elevated levels of depression [Center for Epidemiological Studies’ Depression Scale (CES-D) ≥ 16] will be randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress management intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program for academic stress. The IG consists of eight Internet-based sessions promoting stress management skills using cognitive–behavioral and problem-solving techniques. A mobile App will be employed to facilitate training transfer. Self-report data will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1; 7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up (T2). Potential moderators will be assessed at baseline. The primary outcome is depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and academic outcomes. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle along with sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. Additional health economic analyses will be conducted. Discussion: Results will provide the basis to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of Internet-delivered stress interventions in distance-learning students with symptoms of depression.

A Systematic Review', 'abstract': 'People with higher levels of emotional intelligence (EI: adaptive emotional traits, skills, and abilities) typically achieve more positive life outcomes, such as psychological wellbeing, educational attainment, and job-related success. Although the underpinning mechanisms linking EI with those outcomes are largely unknown, it has been suggested that EI may work as a “stress buffer.” Theoretically, when faced with a stressful situation, emotionally intelligent individuals should show a more adaptive response than those with low EI, such as reduced reactivity (less mood deterioration, less physiological arousal), and faster recovery once the threat has passed. A growing number of studies have begun to investigate that hypothesis in respect to EI measured as both an ability (AEI) and trait (TEI), but results are unclear. To test the “stress-buffering” function of EI, we systematically reviewed experimental studies that explored the relationship between both types of EI and acute stress reactivity or recovery. By searching four databases, we identified 45 eligible studies. Results indicated that EI was only adaptive in certain contexts, and that findings differed according to stressor type, and how EI was measured. In terms of stress reactivity, TEI related to less mood deterioration during sports-based stressors (e.g., competitions), physical discomfort (e.g., dental procedure), and cognitive stressors (e.g., memory tasks), but did not appear as helpful in other contexts (e.g., public speaking). Furthermore, effects of TEI on physiological stress responses, such as heart rate, were inconsistent. Effects of AEI on subjective and objective stress reactivity were often non-significant, with high levels detrimental in some cases. However, data suggest that both higher AEI and TEI relate to faster recovery from acute stress. In conclusion, results provide mixed support for the stress-buffering effect of EI.

Our interest in evaluating this type of intervention is based on the increasing accessibility of the Internet today, the growth of Internet-based interventions for various psychopathological problems, and the observation that despite the prevalence of stress among university students, only a fraction of students ever seek professional help. Methodology: “I’m managing my stress” (“Je gère mon stresse”), an Internet-based self-help program composed of four sessions, was examined in this study. The aforementioned program is based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and was inspired by the “Funambule” program in Quebec. Four questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Scale of Satisfaction in Studies, and General Health Questionnaire) uploaded online were answered thrice: during “preintervention”, “postintervention”, and “follow-up” stages, the latter of which occurred three months after the intervention. The sample comprised 128 university students, with the majority being women (81.25%). The subjects were divided randomly into two groups (an experimental group and a control group that did not follow the program). Results: The self-esteem scores of the control group were significantly higher than those of the experimental group at the preintervention stage, but this difference disappeared at the postintervention and follow-up stages. There were also significantly lower scores on the General Health Questionnaire subfactors of somatic symptoms and anxiety/insomnia in the experimental group than in the control group during the postintervention stage, though no differences were observed before the intervention. These differences no longer remained after three months. ANOVA revealed significant effects of the intervention over time in the experimental group. Effects were observed at both the postintervention and follow-up stages for self-esteem, perceived stress, satisfaction in studies, and in the somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia and severe depression aspects of the General Health Questionnaire (Cohen’s d = 0.38 to 4.58). In contrast, no effects were observed in the control group. Conclusion: This type of Internet-based program has the ability to reach a large number of students due to its rather short format and accessibility. It has already shown improvements in terms of the levels of perceived stress, psychological distress and satisfaction with studies. The option of online interventions could appeal specifically to students who do not seek professional help. However, even though these results are promising at the postintervention stage, they are limited, as indicated by the lack of significant differences between the two groups after the initial three months of follow-up. We still, specifically, need to improve this intervention program and, generally, need more research to address the methodological problems raised by this type of intervention.

Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Faculty of Medicine, Tunis. Participants All Tunisian medical residents brought together between 14 and 22 December 2015 to choose their next 6-month rotation. Intervention The items of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire were employed to capture the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among the residents. The statistical relationships between anxiety and depression (HAD score) and sociodemographic and work-related data were explored by Poisson regression. Results 1700 out of 2200 (77%) medical residents (mean age: 28.5±2 years, female: 60.8%) answered the questionnaire. The mean working hours per week was 62±21\u2009hours; 73% ensured a mean of 5.4±3\u2009night shifts per month; and only 8% of them could benefit from a day of safety rest. Overall, 74.1% of the participating residents had either definite (43.6%) or probable (30.5%) anxiety, while 62% had definite (30.5%) or probable (31.5%) depression symptoms, with 20% having both definite anxiety and definite depression. The total HAD score was significantly associated with the resident’s age (OR=1.014, 95%\u2009CI 1.006 to 1.023, p=0.001); female gender (OR=1.114, 95%\u2009CI 1.083 to 1.145, p<0.0001); and the heavy burden of work imposed on a weekly or monthly basis, as reflected by the number of night shifts per month (OR=1.048, 95%\u2009CI 1.016 to 1.082, p=0.03) and the number of hours worked per week (OR=1.008, 95%\u2009CI 1.005 to 1.011, p<0.0001). Compared with medical specialties, the generally accepted difficult specialties (surgical or medical-surgical) were associated with a higher HAD score (OR=1.459, 95%\u2009CI 1.172 to 1.816, p=0.001). Conclusion Tunisian residents experience a rate of anxiety/depression substantially higher than that reported at the international level. This phenomenon is worrying as it has been associated with an increase in medical errors, work dissatisfaction and attrition. The means of improving the well-being of Tunisian medical residents are explored, emphasising those requiring immediate implementation.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 36, 'citationCount': 23, 'authors': [{'authorId': '51111717', 'name': 'Mehdi Marzouk'}, {'authorId': '1399853827', 'name': 'L.

Despite academic demands, university students also face new stressors, such as different social networks, financial changes, and adaptation to new family and social roles that may have a negative impact on their mental health (Pidgeon & Pickett, 2017). In this sense, resilience literature has gained acceptance explaining how some students successfully adapt to university life while others find great challenges. Since resilience has been defined as the ability to successfully adapt in the face of stress and adversity, it is important to determine what psychological factors contribute enhancing this resilience levels. One of the factors related to life adaptation is optimism, understood as the general expectancy of obtaining positive outcomes in the future (Scheier & Carver, 1985). Hence, the aim of this study is to study the relationship between optimism and resilience among a sample of university students in Spain. The sample was comprised of 132 students from the University of Cadiz (Spain). Participants were selected by quota sampling from first to last year of studies. The majority of students (72.5%) were female and average age was 21.71 (range = 18–48, SD = 3.75). Participants completed the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale (Spanish version adapted by Novella, 2002) and Life Orientation Test (LOT-R Spanish version adapted by Ferrando, Chico & Tous). We performed hierarchical multiple regression analysis and obtained that optimism explained 25% of resilience among university students (R2 = .25, â = .49). No gender and age differences were observed. Thus, identifying the factors that influence students’ adjustment to university life can improve the targeting of interventions to improve university academic performance.

Most students with poor mental health, however, do not receive professional help. Internet-based self-help formats may increase the utilization of treatment. Objective The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based, app-supported stress management intervention for college students. Methods College students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4-item version, PSS-4 ≥8) were randomly assigned to either an internet- and mobile-based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group. Self-report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS-4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college-related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies’ Depression Scale >17). Results A total of 106 participants (76.8%) indicated that they were first-time help-seekers, and 77.3% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95% CI 0.36-1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95% CI 0.43-1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95% CI 0.30-0.96), college-related productivity (d=0.33; 95% CI 0.01-0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95% CI 0.01-0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment). Response rates for stress symptoms were significantly higher for the intervention group (69%, 52/75) compared with the waitlist control group (35%, 26/75, P<.001; number needed to treat=2.89, 95% CI 2.01-5.08) at posttest (7 weeks). Effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up, and similar findings emerged in students with symptoms of depression. Conclusions Internet- and mobile-based interventions could be an effective and cost-effective approach to reduce consequences of college-related stress and might potentially attract students with clinically relevant depression who would not otherwise seek help.

The authors appropriately argued that, although most researchers' theoretical interest rests with the latent structure, they still rely on indices of global model fit that simultaneously assess both the measurement and structural portions of the model. As such, Lance et al. proposed indices intended to assess the structural portion of the model in isolation of the measurement model. Unfortunately, although these strategies separate the assessment of the structure from the fit of the measurement model, they do not isolate the structure's assessment from the quality of the measurement model. That is, even with a perfectly fitting measurement model, poorer quality (i.e., less reliable) measurements will yield a more favorable verdict regarding structural fit, whereas better quality (i.e., more reliable) measurements will yield a less favorable structural assessment. This phenomenon, referred to by Hancock and Mueller (2011) as the reliability paradox, affects not only traditional global fit indices but also those structural indices proposed by Lance et al. as well. Fortunately, as this comment will clarify, indices proposed by Hancock and Mueller help to mitigate this problem and allow the structural portion of the model to be assessed independently of both the fit of the measurement model as well as the quality of indicator variables contained therein.

Academic pressure is reported as a major trigger. Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress and is popular among students, but its effectiveness in this context needs to be ascertained. In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we hypothesise that the provision of a preventative mindfulness intervention in universities could reduce students' psychological distress during the examination period (primary outcome), improve their resilience to stress up to at least 1\u2005year later, reduce their use of mental health support services and improve academic performance. Methods and analysis At least 550 University of Cambridge students free from active crises or severe mental illness will be randomised to joining an 8-week mindfulness course or to mental health provision as usual (one-to-one allocation rate). Psychological distress will be measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure at baseline, postintervention, examination term and 1-year follow-up. Other outcomes are use of mental health services, inability to sit examinations or special circumstance requests, examination grades, well-being, altruism and coping measured with ecological momentary assessment. Outcome assessment and intention-to-treat primary analysis using linear mixed models adjusted for baseline scores will be blind to intervention allocation. We will also conduct per-protocol, subgroup and secondary outcome analyses. An Independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee will be set up.

Method The World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys were used to examine the associations of mental disorders with college entry and attrition by comparing college students (n = 1572) and non-students in the same age range (18–22 years; n = 4178), including non-students who recently left college without graduating (n = 702) based on surveys in 21 countries (four low/lower-middle income, five upper-middle-income, one lower-middle or upper-middle at the times of two different surveys, and 11 high income). Lifetime and 12-month prevalence and age-of-onset of DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behavioral and substance disorders were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results One-fifth (20.3%) of college students had 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorders; 83.1% of these cases had pre-matriculation onsets. Disorders with pre-matriculation onsets were more important than those with post-matriculation onsets in predicting subsequent college attrition, with substance disorders and, among women, major depression the most important such disorders. Only 16.4% of students with 12-month disorders received any 12-month healthcare treatment for their mental disorders. Conclusions Mental disorders are common among college students, have onsets that mostly occur prior to college entry, in the case of pre-matriculation disorders are associated with college attrition, and are typically untreated.

Students are limited in seeking help from professionals. As university students are highly connected to digital technologies, Web-based and computer-delivered interventions could be used to improve students’ mental health. The effectiveness of these intervention types requires investigation to identify whether these are viable prevention strategies for university students. Objective The intent of the study was to systematically review and analyze trials of Web-based and computer-delivered interventions to improve depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress in university students. Methods Several databases were searched using keywords relating to higher education students, mental health, and eHealth interventions. The eligibility criteria for studies included in the review were: (1) the study aimed to improve symptoms relating to depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress, (2) the study involved computer-delivered or Web-based interventions accessed via computer, laptop, or tablet, (3) the study was a randomized controlled trial, and (4) the study was trialed on higher education students. Trials were reviewed and outcome data analyzed through random effects meta-analyses for each outcome and each type of trial arm comparison. Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess study quality. Results A total of 17 trials were identified, in which seven were the same three interventions on separate samples; 14 reported sufficient information for meta-analysis. The majority (n=13) were website-delivered and nine interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A total of 1795 participants were randomized and 1480 analyzed. Risk of bias was considered moderate, as many publications did not sufficiently report their methods and seven explicitly conducted completers’ analyses. In comparison to the inactive control, sensitivity meta-analyses supported intervention in improving anxiety (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.56; 95% CI −0.77 to −0.35, P<.001), depression (pooled SMD −0.43; 95% CI −0.63 to −0.22, P<.001), and stress (pooled SMD −0.73; 95% CI −1.27 to −0.19, P=.008). In comparison to active controls, sensitivity analyses did not support either condition for anxiety (pooled SMD −0.18; 95% CI −0.98 to 0.62, P=.66) or depression (pooled SMD −0.28; 95% CI −0.75 to −0.20, P=.25). In contrast to a comparison intervention, neither condition was supported in sensitivity analyses for anxiety (pooled SMD −0.10; 95% CI −0.39 to 0.18, P=.48) or depression (pooled SMD −0.33; 95% CI −0.43 to 1.09, P=.40). Conclusions The findings suggest Web-based and computer-delivered interventions can be effective in improving students’ depression, anxiety, and stress outcomes when compared to inactive controls, but some caution is needed when compared to other trial arms and methodological issues were noticeable. Interventions need to be trialed on more heterogeneous student samples and would benefit from user evaluation.

Higher EC is associated with greater happiness, better mental and physical health, more satisfying social and marital relationships and greater occupational success. While it is well-known that EC (as a whole) predicts a number of important outcomes, it is unclear so far which specific competency(ies) participate(s) in a given outcome. This is because no measure of EC distinctly measures each of the five core emotional competences, separately for one’s own and others’ emotions. This lack of information is problematic both theoretically (we do not understand the processes at stake) and practically (we cannot develop customized interventions). This paper aims to address this issue. We developed and validated in four steps a complete (albeit short: 50 items) self-reported measure of EC: the Profile of Emotional Competence.

A higher number of stressors with negative health consequences are present, especially among nursing professionals. Stress is a psychosocial factor that influences the academic performance and well-being of this group. The interest in analysing sources of stress in nursing students is due to the influence that their training period may have on their perceptions of stress on their future work. \n \nMethods:\u2002 We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature on stressors in nursing students. The search comprised all the articles published at the end of 2010. \n \nResults:\u2002 The most common sources of stress relate to academics (reviews, workload and problems associated with studying, among others). Other sources of stress include clinical sources (such as fear of unknown situations, mistakes with patients or handling of technical equipment).

Research purpose: The aim of this study was to determine how I/O psychologists experience the meaning of their work and to investigate the relationships between their experiences of work-role fit, meaning of work, psychological meaningfulness and work engagement, utilising the happiness framework proposed by Seligman (2002). Motivation for the study: I/O psychologists spend more than 88% of their working day with people, and they are primary role models for happiness in the workplace. Information about their work engagement and experiences of meaning is therefore needed. Research design, approach and method: A survey design was used. A convenience sample (n = 106) was taken of I/O psychologists in South Africa. A biographical questionnaire, the Work-Role Fit Scale, the Work-Life Questionnaire, the Psychological Meaningfulness Scale, the Work Engagement Scale and a survey measuring the actual and desired time spent on six broad categories of work were administered. Main findings: Work-role fit predicted psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. The calling orientation to work predicted both psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. Work-role fit mediated the relationship between the meaning of work and psychological meaningfulness. Work-role fit partially mediated the relationship between a calling orientation to work and work engagement.

A total of 527 university students comprised the sample and filled out a questionnaire. We obtained their previous and future academic performance Grade Point Average (GPA) from the university's records. Structural equations modeling showed that the best predictor of future performance was the students’ previous performance. As expected, study engagement mediated the relationship between performance obstacles and facilitators on the one hand, and future performance on the other. Contrary to expectations, burnout did not predict future performance, although, it is significantly associated with the presence of obstacles and the absence of facilitators. Our results illustrate that, although “success breeds success” (i.e., the best predictor of future performance is past performance), positive psychological states like study engagement are also important in explaining future performance, at least more so than negative states like study burnout."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 456, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2040374', 'name': 'M.

The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test–retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the points."", 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 34, 'citationCount': 2167, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3650003', 'name': 'T.

The suicide rate among male physicians is more than 40% higher than among men in the general population, whereas that of female physicians is a staggering 130% higher than among women in the general population (1, 2). The increased risk for suicide among physicians may begin during medical school (3). Available studies suggest that the suicide rate among medical students is higher than in the age-matched population (35). Other small, single-institution studies (610) have reported that 3% to 15% of medical students have suicidal ideation during medical school training. Suicidal ideation is a well-established predictor of suicidal planning and attempts. The National Comorbidity Survey found that 34% of individuals in the general population with suicidal ideation develop a suicide plan and, of those who plan, more than 70% will attempt suicide (11). Notably, 26% of individuals with suicidal ideation progressed directly to an unplanned suicide attempt (11). Suicide is at the extreme end of the personal distress continuum, and it is critical for medical schools to identify students at greatest risk for suicide in the hope of intervening before a tragic outcome. Several multi-institutional studies (1214) reveal that medical students have a substantially lower mental quality of life than similarly aged individuals in the general population and that burnout affects up to 50% of U.S. medical students. We hypothesized that burnout would relate to suicidal ideation among medical students. We used a mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional study design to evaluate the prevalence of suicidal ideation among U.S. medical students and to evaluate the relationship between suicidal ideation and burnout, symptoms of depression, and quality of life. Our objective was to assess the frequency of suicidal ideation among medical students and explore its relationship with burnout. Methods Participants In the spring of 2006 (baseline) and 2007 (1-year follow-up), we invited all medical students at the Mayo Medical School, University of Washington School of Medicine, University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, and University of Alabama School of Medicine to complete Web-based surveys. Students at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences also participated in the 2007 survey. Participation was elective, and responses were anonymized. We included all students who responded to the 2007 survey in the cross-sectional analysis and those who responded in both 2006 and 2007 in the longitudinal analysis. Each institution's institutional review board approved the study before participation of their students. Data Collection Participants returned the surveys electronically. Preserving student confidentiality was an essential feature. We linked individual responses on the 2006 and 2007 surveys for longitudinal analysis by using unique identifiers and stripped all data of identifiers before forwarding them to study statisticians for analysis. Study Measures We used established instruments to measure burnout, symptoms of depression, and quality of life on both the 2006 and 2007 surveys. These surveys also included questions about demographic characteristics, and the 2007 survey included questions about suicidal ideation. Suicidal Ideation We assessed suicidal ideation by asking students: Have you ever had thoughts of taking your own life, even if you would not really do it?, During the past 12 months have you had thoughts of taking your own life?, and Have you ever made an attempt to take your own life? These questions, which originated from an inventory developed by Meehan and colleagues (15) that has been used to assess suicidal ideation among medical students (9), are similar to questions used in large U.S. epidemiologic studies intended to assess suicidality (11, 1618). Burnout, Symptoms of Depression, and Quality of Life The Maslach Burnout Inventory is a 22-item instrument that is considered the gold standard for measuring burnout (1921). This instrument has separate subscales to evaluate each domain of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Tests of discriminant and convergent validity have been acceptable, construct validity of the 3 dimensions has been demonstrated (22, 23), and predictive validity has been suggested by burnout score predicting risk for future sick leave absences (24). The Maslach Burnout Inventory has also been used extensively in studies of both physicians (20,21, 25) and medical students (13, 14, 2628). According to convention, a score of 27 or higher on the emotional exhaustion subscale or 10 or higher on the depersonalization subscale was considered an indicator of professional burnout for medical professionals (19). Health professionals are considered to have a low score on the personal accomplishment scale if their score is 33 or less. Normal scores for health care professionals, including physicians, are 22.19, 7.12, and 36.53 on the emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment subscales, respectively (19). We identified symptoms of depression by using the 2-item Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (29), a screening tool which performs as well as longer instruments (30). This instrument has a sensitivity of 86% to 96% and a specificity of 57% to 75% for major depressive disorder (29, 30). With a reported positive likelihood ratio of up to 3.42 for the diagnosis of major depression (30) and an estimated 25% prevalence of depression among medical students (12), a positive result implies a 50% probability of current major depression. We measured mental and physical quality of life by using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-8 (SF-8) (31, 32), an alternate version of the SF-36. Norm-based scoring methods of responses on this instrument are used to calculate mental and physical quality of life summary scores (31). The mean mental and physical quality of life summary scores for the U.S. population are 49.2 (SD, 9.46) and 49.2 (SD, 9.07), respectively (31). Previous research has demonstrated acceptable reliability and testretest reliability (31). Several studies (31) have demonstrated content, construct, and criterion-related validity for the SF-8, and other studies (33) have demonstrated high convergent validity and good discriminate validity. The SF-8 has also been used in samples of residents (32) and medical students (14, 27, 28). Statistical Analysis Our primary analysis involved descriptive summary statistics for estimating the prevalence of suicidal ideation, burnout, a positive depression screen, and mental and physical quality of life for medical students. We evaluated differences by reported suicidal ideation in the previous year by using the WilcoxonMannWhitney test (for continuous variables) and the Fisher exact test (for categorical variables). We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test rather than parametric tests to account for the interval level nature of the psychological tests. All tests were 2-sided, with a type I error rate of 0.05. We performed collinearity testing to determine whether multiple-way collinearity existed among the independent variables (34). No variables had achieved a level of collinearity that would bias the modeling process. We performed forward stepwise logistic regression to evaluate independent associations of the independent variables with suicidal ideation. We used a saturated model and backward stepping to confirm results of the initial stepwise regression. In all cases, backward stepping produced the same model as the stepwise approach. All analyses were done by using SAS, version 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Role of the Funding Source This work was supported by an Education Innovation award from the Mayo Clinic.

Results Cross-Sectional Survey A total of 2248 (52.4%) of 4287 medical students responded to the 2007 survey. Responders were less likely than the overall population to be male (51.6% vs. 54.9%), between 25 and 30 years of age (55.4% vs. 62.4%), or nonwhite (25.8% vs. 31.0%) (all P< 0.02). Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of cross-sectional survey respondents. Table 1. Participant Characteristics, 2007 Table 2 shows the percentage of responders reporting suicidal ideation, burnout, and symptoms of depression and the mean quality-of-life scores. Of the 2230 responders on the 2007 survey who responded to questions on suicidal ideation, 249 (11.2% [CI, 9.9% to 12.6%]) reported considering suicide in the previous year and 43 (1.9% [CI, 1.4% to 2.6%]) had made a suicide attempt at some point in the past. On sensitivity analysis, assuming that all nonresponders did not have suicidal ideation, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 12 months would be 249 (5.8%) of 4287 students. Table 2. Burnout, Quality of Life, and Depression Symptoms, 2007 Overall, 1069 (49.6%, [CI, 47.5%51.8%]) of 2154 students met the criteria for burnout (94 students did not answer enough Maslach Burnout Inventory questions to be included in this analysis). Among these students, 860 (40.1%) of 2142 had high emotional exhaustion, 648 (31.8%) of 2037 had high depersonalization, and 595 of 1945 (30.6%) had a low sense of personal accomplishment. Compared with age-comparable individuals and the general U.S. population, medical students had lower mental quality-of-life scores (mean, 43.5 [SD, 11.0] vs. 47.2 [SD, 9.9] for age-comparable individuals [P< 0.001] and 49.2 [SD, 9.5] for the general U.S. population [P< 0.001]) but higher physical quality-of-life scores (mean, 52.2 [6.9] vs. 51.4 [SD, 7.9] for age-comparable "", 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 1051, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3616348', 'name': 'L.

The following review was performed independently of LaRose’s other two books. Paraphrasing from the Preface, the goal of this book is to “explore the process of data mining from the point of view of model building.” Nevertheless, the reader will soon be aware that this book is not intended to provide a systematic or comprehensive coverage of various data mining algorithms. Instead, it considers supervised learning or predictive modeling only, and it walks the reader through the data mining process merely with a few selected modeling methods such as (generalized) linear modeling and the Bayesian approach. The book has seven chapters. Chapter 1 introduces dimension reduction, with a focus on principal components analysis (PCA) types of techniques. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 provide a detailed coverage of simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression, respectively. Chapter 5 introduces naive Bayes estimation and Bayesian networks. In Chapter 6, the basic idea of genetic algorithms is discussed. Finally, Chapter 7 presents a case study example of modeling response to direct mail marketing within the CRISP (crossindustry standard process) framework. This book is very easy to read, and this is absolutely the strength which many readers, especially those nonstatistically oriented ones, will greatly appreciate. Predictive modeling is perhaps the most technical part in a data mining process. The author has done an excellent job in making this difficult topic accessible to a broad audience. For example, I like the way in which Bayesian networks are introduced in Chapter 5. After the reader goes through a churn example on naive Bayes estimation in a step-by-step manner, Bayesian belief networks become easily understood as natural extensions. The overall style of the book is clear and patient. The main limitation of the book is its limited coverage. An inspired reader would expect to see a much more extended list of topics. Hastie, Tibishirani, and Friedman (2001) gave a full and more technical account of various data mining algorithms. The inclusion of genetic algorithms in Chapter 6 seems novel when compared to Hastie, Tibishirani, and Friedman (2001), but at the same time, a little unexpected as a separate chapter, since a genetic algorithm involves a stochastics search scheme, which is somewhat involved given the elementary nature of this text. Another noteworthy issue is that the author does not make an attempt to distinguish between conventional statistical analysis and data mining. I found a few errors. On Page 25, for example, it should be ai = 1, instead of ai = 1/4. Also, in the frame on the top of Page 211, it might have been “Posterior Odds,” instead of “Posterior Odds Ratio.” The book uses three different software packages to implement the ideas including SPSS with Clementine, Minitab, and WEKA, which might not be appealing. On the other hand, it is justifiable as it allows one to perform data mining with affordable costs. In summary, I recommend this fairly readable book for adoption in a graduate-level introductory course on data mining, especially when the students come from varied backgrounds.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 6, 'citationCount': 8179, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2057008238', 'name': 'Phil Wood'}]}, {'paperId': '9e1388816388fad6b55334e6c7fc470c4cfb2877', 'title': 'The association between dispositional optimism and mental health problems among disaster victims and a comparison group: a prospective study.', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 49, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34245812', 'name': 'P.

Method Medline and PubMed were searched to identify peer-reviewed English-language studies published between January 1980 and May 2005 reporting on depression, anxiety, and burnout among U.S. and Canadian medical students. Searches used combinations of the Medical Subject Heading terms medical student and depression, depressive disorder major, depressive disorder, professional burnout, mental health, depersonalization, distress, anxiety, or emotional exhaustion. Reference lists of retrieved articles were inspected to identify relevant additional articles. Demographic information, instruments used, prevalence data on student distress, and statistically significant associations were abstracted. Results The search identified 40 articles on medical student psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, burnout, and related mental health problems) that met the authors' criteria. No studies of burnout among medical students were identified. The studies suggest a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students, with levels of overall psychological distress consistently higher than in the general population and age-matched peers by the later years of training. Overall, the studies suggest psychological distress may be higher among female students. Limited data were available regarding the causes of student distress and its impact on academic performance, dropout rates, and professional development. Conclusions Medical school is a time of significant psychological distress for physicians-in-training.

Positive self-esteem was significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with proactive coping behaviours. The four main stressors in the last three years for this cohort of students, in descending order are nursing studies, finance, family and health.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes."", 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 3650, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

While a variety of factors have been linked to suicidal ideation, only few studies have examined role of stress and optimism among adolescents population. This study aimed to determine the relationships between stress and optimism and suicidal ideation among adolescent students. Participants for this study were 200 adolescent students from Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India. Appropriate questionnaires were used for measuring optimism, stress, and suicidal ideation among students. Apart from descriptive statistics for analyzing data, a four-step hierarchical linear regression analysis was used in order to examine main and moderator effects predicting suicidal ideation. Significant moderating effects were also probed and plotted through simple slopes at plus-and-minus one standard deviation of the stress on the association between stress and suicidal ideation within each level of moderator variable i.e. high and low levels. The results of the Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that there was significant positive relationship between stress and suicidal ideation. A significant negative correlation between optimism and suicidal ideation was also found. In addition, boys were more pessimistic and had more suicidal ideation compared to girls. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that stress and optimism predicted suicidal ideation for total sample and for both boys and girls. Moreover, the Stress X Optimism interaction was found to further augment the prediction of suicidal ideation, even after controlling for demographic variables and the main effects of optimism and stress. Consistent with the proposed interaction model, a plot of the significant interactions indicated that the link between stress and suicidal ideation was significantly more exacerbated for pessimistic as compared to optimistic adolescents. Findings from this study would help the healthcare professionals, counsellors, teachers, and parents in understanding how high stress which is peculiar to the stage of adolescence particularly students may have serious consequences in the form of suicidal ideas and that optimistic thinking may be helpful in coping with the stresses of this stage so as to avoid its harmful effects.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 72, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '152517902', 'name': 'Journals Iosr'}, {'authorId': '1460287823', 'name': 'Hameeda Shaheen Dr.'}, {'authorId': '49859054', 'name': 'M.

65,b3ac5758cd39bbe72b1e10064dedcf3f550124e8,Emotional Regulation and Overeating Behaviors in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review,"The worldwide prevalence of obesity has dramatically increased, mostly in children and adolescents. The Emotional Eating theoretical model has proposed that the failure in emotional regulation could represent a risk factor for establishing maladaptive overeating behavior that represents an inadequate response to negative emotions and allows increasing body-weight. This systematic review investigates the relationship between overeating and both emotional regulation and emotional intelligence in childhood and adolescence, considering both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Moreover, another goal of the review is evaluating whether emotional regulation and emotional intelligence can cause overeating behaviors. The systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA-statement in the databases Medline, PsychArtcles, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences, and allows 484 records to be extracted. Twenty-six studies were selected according to inclusion (e.g., studies focused on children and adolescents without clinical conditions; groups of participants overweight or with obesity) and exclusion (e.g., studies that adopted qualitative assessment or cognitive-affective tasks to measure emotional variables; reviews, commentary, or brief reports) criteria detailed in the methods. Cross-sectional studies showed a negative association between emotional regulation and overeating behavior that was confirmed by longitudinal studies. These findings highlighted the role of maladaptive emotion regulation on overeating and being overweight. The relationship between these constructs in children and adolescents was consistent. The results indicated the complexity of this association, which would be influenced by many physiological, psychological, and social factors. These findings underline the need for further studies focused on emotion regulation in the development of overeating.

Specifically, it was tested whether attention allocation processes differ between individuals with overweight and normal weight using transient changes of food-related and neutral pictures. Change detection latencies in objects of central interest (CI) or objects of marginal interest (MI) were measured as an index of attention allocation in a sample of fifty-three students with overweight/obesity and sixty students with normal weight during a flicker paradigm with neutral, hypercaloric and hypocaloric food pictures. Both groups of participants showed an attentional bias for food-related pictures as compared to neutral pictures. However, the bias was larger in individuals with overweight than in individuals with normal weight when changes were of marginal interest, suggesting a stronger avoidance of the food-related picture. This study showed that food-related stimuli influence attention allocation processes in both participants with overweight and normal weight. In particular, as compared to individuals with normal weight, those with overweight seem to be characterised by a stronger attentional avoidance of (or smaller attention maintenance on) food-related stimuli that could be considered as a voluntary strategy to resist food consumption.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 82, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

The knowledge of the factors which influences the inappropriate eating behaviors causing excessive body fat is an essential goal for the research. Overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for many health diseases, such as cardiovascular problems, diabetes. Recently, many studies have focused on the relationship between body weight and cognitive processes. Objectives: This systematic review is aimed to investigate the existence and the nature of the relationship between excessive body weight (overweight/obesity) and executive functions, analyzing cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies in order to verify the evidence of a possible causality between these variables. Methods: The review was carried out according to the PRISMA-Statement, through systematic searches in the scientific databases PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo, and PsycArticles. The studies selected examined performance on executive tasks by participants with overweight or obesity, aged between 5 and 70 years. Studies examining eating disorders or obesity resulting from other medical problems were excluded. Furthermore, the results of studies using a cross-sectional design and those using a longitudinal one were separately investigated. Results: Sixty-three cross-sectional studies and twenty-eight longitudinal studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. The results confirmed the presence of a relation between executive functions and overweight/obesity, although the directionality of this relation was not clear; nor did any single executive function emerge as being more involved than others in this relation. Despite this, there was evidence of a reciprocal influence between executive functions and overweight/obesity. Conclusions: This systematic review underlines the presence of a relationship between executive functions and overweight/obesity. Moreover, it seems to suggest a bidirectional trend in this relationship that could be the cause of the failure of interventions for weight reduction. The results of this review highlight the importance of a theoretical model able to consider all the main variables of interest, with the aim to structuring integrated approaches to solve the overweight/obesity problems.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 177, 'citationCount': 85, 'authors': [{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

Increasingly, research points to the role of self-regulation in obesity development, yet existing work has largely focused on young children and/or clinical adult populations. This multi-method longitudinal study (N = 153) utilized a path analysis to delineate links between emotion regulation (age 15), emotional eating and dietary restraint (age 16), and adiposity (% body fat) using a BodPod for body composition assessment (age 19). Emotion regulation was negatively associated with emotional eating (β = −0.30, p < 0.001) and positively associated with dietary restraint (β = 0.15, p < 0.05) at age 16, but was not associated with age 19 adiposity (β = −0.01, p = ns). Emotional eating was positively associated with adiposity (β = 0.24, p < 0.01). Indirect effects suggested that emotional eating, but not dietary restraint, at age 16 serves as a mechanism that helps explain the associations between emotion regulation and adiposity four years later.

Accordingly, our aim was to identify demographic and psychological correlates of overeating regulation in a sample of university students, to facilitate greater understanding of this self‐regulatory capacity. Variables of interest included emotion regulation, mindfulness, eating pathology, age, and gender. Method Self‐report measures were completed by 312 Australian university students (68% female; M age = 22 years). Results Exploratory factor analyses indicated three overeating regulation subscales: (1) general overeating regulation (general ability to resist overeating); (2) discomfort overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating when experiencing physical pain or negative emotions); and (3) leisure overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating in leisure contexts and/or in the presence of high calorie foods). Overeating regulation was not associated with age; though young men reported better general overeating regulation capacity than young women. Individuals reporting greater ability to regulate overeating (across all three subscales) reported better emotion regulation and mindfulness, and less eating pathology. Multiple regression analyses showed that the emotion regulation subscales of goal‐directedness, emotional awareness, and impulse control, and the mindfulness subscales of acting with awareness and non‐reactivity to inner experience were unique correlates of the overeating regulation subscales. Conclusions This study offers greater understanding about the different facets of overeating regulation, and highlights the relevance of emotion regulation and mindfulness in this adaptive eating practise.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 17, 'authors': [{'authorId': '51028408', 'name': 'Jessica L.

They completed self-report measures assessing binge behaviors and Emotion Regulation strategies. No differences resulted between adolescents assuming binge behaviors and no bingers as regards CR; conversely, adolescents engaging in binge eating and in both binge behaviors reported the highest levels of ES. Furthermore, both Emotion Regulation strategies were significant predictors of binge eating.

Negative emotions and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies play a role in the onset and maintenance of binge eating in BED. Anger and sadness, along with negative emotions related to interpersonal experiences (i.e., disappointment, being hurt or loneliness), seem to be particularly relevant. Individuals with BED have a tendency to suppress and ruminate on their unwanted emotions, which leads to increased psychopathological thoughts and symptoms. Compared to healthy controls, they use adaptive strategies, such as reappraisal, less frequently. Evidence concerning the causal relation between negative affect and binge eating is inconclusive and still very limited. While experimental studies in a laboratory setting lack ecological validity, ecological momentary assessment studies offer more promise at unraveling the causal relationship between emotions and binge eating. Increases in negative affect are found to be antecedents of binge eating in BED. However, there seems to be less support for the possibility that binge eating serves as a means to alleviate negative affect. Finally, BED seems to be related to other forms of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as substance abuse and self-harm.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 190, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3662212', 'name': 'A.

Eating in response to negative affect contributes towards obesity, however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Evidence that visceral afferent signals contribute towards the experience of emotion is accumulating rapidly, with the emergence of new influential models of ‘active inference’. No longer viewed as a ‘bottom up’ process, new interoceptive facets based on ‘top down’ predictions have been proposed, although at present it is unclear which aspects of interoception contribute to aberrant eating behaviour and obesity. Study one examined the link between eating behaviour, body mass index and the novel interoceptive indices; interoceptive metacognitive awareness (IAw) and interoceptive prediction error (IPE), as well as the traditional measures; interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and interoceptive sensibility (IS). The dissociation between these interoceptive indices was confirmed. Emotional eaters were characterised by a heightened interoceptive signal but reduced meta-cognitive awareness of their interoceptive abilities. In addition, emotional eating correlated with IPE; effects that could not be accounted for by differences in anxiety and depression.

The current study examined the associations between physical and emotional neglect occurring in childhood and 2 types of disordered eating symptoms (binge eating and drive for muscularity) among college men and women. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the relations between childhood physical and emotional neglect and eating disorder symptoms would be mediated by alexithymia. Participants (N = 1344) completed self-report measures through an online system. Four moderated mediation models were tested to examine our proposed mediation model in the context of potential gender differences. Consistent with prediction, our analyses revealed significant associations between childhood physical and emotional neglect and 2 types of disordered eating symptoms, and alexithymia mediated these relationships. Contrary to our hypothesis, gender moderated the relationship between alexithymia and binge eating, but not drive for muscularity. Childhood neglect, both physical and emotional, was associated with higher levels of binge eating in women, but not men.

More important, suppression is a transactional process, creating stress and disrupting interactions for the suppressor and those in social interactions with individuals who are suppressing emotion. However, no research has examined the behavioral consequences of emotion suppression in close relationships. We examine the possibility that emotion suppression will predict eating behaviors as a secondary emotion regulatory strategy among 1,556 parent–adolescent dyads (N = 3,112), consistent with evidence suggesting that suppression influences eating at the individual-level. Actor-partner interdependence models and structural equation modeling demonstrate that one’s own emotion suppression was associated with emotional eating; greater consumption of hedonic—low nutrient, high energy dense—foods; and lower consumption of fruits and vegetables (actor effects). One’s partner’s emotion suppression was also independently associated with one’s own emotional eating; lower consumption of fruits and vegetables; and greater consumption of hedonic foods (partner effects), although this association was most consistent for adolescents’ suppression and parents’ eating (compared with the converse). These analyses suggest that dyadic emotion regulatory processes have implications on eating behavior.

We wanted to build on this study and investigate the relation between parental rejection, maladaptive ER and emotional eating in a community sample using longitudinal data. Design: Participants were 81 youngsters between the ages of 10 and 16 years. Participants completed questionnaires assessing maternal and paternal rejection, ER strategies and emotional eating, at two time moments (M = 71 days between time moments). Latent change models were used to estimate level and change of each variable. Results: Results showed that the levels of maternal rejection, maladaptive ER and emotional eating were related. The indirect effect of the level of maternal rejection on the level of emotional eating through the level of maladaptive ER was marginally significant. On average, maternal rejection showed no change over time, whereas the other variables decreased. The changes in the variables were not related.

A systematic review was completed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines with the aim of exploring associations between emotions and eating behaviour in a population affected by obesity and binge eating disorder (BED). A comprehensive literature search of four electronic databases (2004–2014) yielded 15 studies for inclusion. Included studies performed poorly on data quality analysis with respect to controlling for confounding variables, and sample size. Included papers largely focused on negative emotions as antecedents of BE; depression was consistently associated with a BED‐obese classification and BE. Negative mood, sadness, tension and instability of emotions were found to be antecedents of BE in an adult BED‐obese sample. However, findings were mixed regarding the role of stress, anger and positive emotions within the BED‐obese population. Recommendations are presented for the identification of BED, and ecologically valid experimental designs that further understanding of the complex and varied emotions that associate with BE.

It is a gateway to ill health, and it has become one of the leading causes of disability and death, affecting not only adults but also children and adolescents worldwide. In clinical practice, the body fatness is estimated by BMI, and the accumulation of intra-abdominal fat (marker for higher metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk) can be assessed by waist circumference. Complex interactions between biological, behavioural, social and environmental factors are involved in regulation of energy balance and fat stores. A comprehensive history, physical examination and laboratory assessment relevant to the patient's obesity should be obtained. Appropriate goals of weight management emphasise realistic weight loss to achieve a reduction in health risks and should include promotion of weight loss, maintenance and prevention of weight regain. Management of co-morbidities and improving quality of life of obese patients are also included in treatment aims. Balanced hypocaloric diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasise. Aerobic training is the optimal mode of exercise for reducing fat mass while a programme including resistance training is needed for increasing lean mass in middle-aged and overweight/obese individuals. Cognitive behavioural therapy directly addresses behaviours that require change for successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Pharmacotherapy can help patients to maintain compliance and ameliorate obesity-related health risks. Surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity in terms of long-term weight loss. A comprehensive obesity management can only be accomplished by a multidisciplinary obesity management team. We conclude that physicians have a responsibility to recognise obesity as a disease and help obese patients with appropriate prevention and treatment. Treatment should be based on good clinical care, and evidence-based interventions; should focus on realistic goals and lifelong multidisciplinary management."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 143, 'citationCount': 821, 'authors': [{'authorId': '9947728', 'name': 'V.

Therefore, the current study aims to test the internal structure and validity of the FEEL-KJ in a large sample of Dutch-speaking Belgian children and adolescents (N = 1102, 8–18 years old).

Deficits in cognitive and emotional functioning for eating disorders or obesity have been reported.

Overall, n = 57 studies were included in the present review.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRegarding cognitive functioning (CoF), individuals with BED consistently demonstrated higher information processing biases compared to obese and normal-weight controls in the context of disorder-related stimuli (i.e., food and body cues), whereas CoF in the context of neutral stimuli appeared to be less affected. Thus, results suggest disorder-related rather than general difficulties in CoF in BED. With respect to emotional functioning (EmF), individuals with BED reported difficulties similar to individuals with other eating disorders, with a tendency to show less severe difficulties in some domains. In addition, individuals with BED reported greater emotional deficits when compared to obese and normal-weight controls. Findings suggest general difficulties in EmF in BED. Thus far, however, investigations of EmF in disorder-relevant situations are lacking.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nOverall, the cross-sectional findings indicate BED to be associated with difficulties in CoF and EmF.

Studies in humans and laboratory animals show that eating can also be regulated by factors unrelated to metabolic control. Several studies suggest a link between stress, access to highly palatable food, and eating disorders. Eating “comfort foods” in response to a negative emotional state, for example, suggests that some individuals overeat to self-medicate. Clinical data suggest that some individuals may develop addiction-like behaviors from consuming palatable foods. Based on this observation, “food addiction” has emerged as an area of intense scientific research. A growing body of evidence suggests that some aspects of food addiction, such as compulsive eating behavior, can be modeled in animals. Moreover, several areas of the brain, including various neurotransmitter systems, are involved in the reinforcement effects of both food and drugs, suggesting that natural and pharmacological stimuli activate similar neural systems. In addition, several recent studies have identified a putative connection between neural circuits activated in the seeking and intake of both palatable food and drugs. The development of well-characterized animal models will increase our understanding of the etiological factors of food addiction and will help identify the neural substrates involved in eating disorders such as compulsive overeating.

It develops because of a mismatch between energy intake and expenditure that results from behavior (feeding behavior and time spent active) and physiology (resting metabolism and expenditure when active). Both of these traits are affected by environmental and genetic factors. The dramatic increase in the numbers of obese people in Western societies reflects mostly changing environmental factors and is linked to reduced activity and perhaps also increased food intake. However, in all societies and subpopulations, there are both obese and nonobese subjects. These differences are primarily a consequence of genetic factors as is revealed by the high heritability for body mass index. Most researchers agree that energy balance and, hence, body weight are regulated phenomena. There is some disagreement about exactly how this regulation occurs. However, a common model is the ""lipostatic"" regulation system, whereby our energy stores generate signals that are compared with targets encoded in the brain, and differences between these drive our food intake levels, activity patterns, and resting and active metabolisms. Considerable advances were made in the last decade in understanding the molecular basis of this lipostatic system. Some obese people have high body weight because they have broken lipostats, but these are a rare minority. This suggests that for the majority of obese people, the lipostat is set at an inappropriately high level. When combined with exposure to an environment where there is ready availability of food at low energy costs to obtain it, obesity develops. The evolutionary background to how such a system might have evolved involves the evolution of social behavior, the harnessing of fire, and the development of weapons that effectively freed humans from the risks of predation. The lipostatic model not only explains why some people become obese whereas others do not, but also allows us to understand why energy-controlled diets do not work. Drug-based solutions to the obesity problem that work with the lipostat, rather than against it, are presently under development and will probably be in regular use within 5-10 y. However, several lines of evidence including genetic mapping studies of quantitative trait loci associated with obesity suggest that our present understanding of the regulatory system is still rudimentary. In particular, we know nothing about how the target body weight in the brain is encoded. As our understanding in this field advances, new drug targets are likely to emerge and allow us to treat this crippling disorder.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 157, 'citationCount': 263, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3229359', 'name': 'J.

The validity of these norms is influenced by the observed secular increase in body weight and BMI. We hypothesized that the performance of children in health‐related physical fitness tests would be negatively related to increased BMIs, and therefore fitness tests might be used as criteria for developing a more appropriate set of BMI norms. We evaluated the existing data from a nation‐wide fitness survey for students in Taiwan (444 652 boys and 433 555 girls) to examine the relationship between BMI and fitness tests. The fitness tests used included: an 800/1600‐m run/walk; a standing long jump; bent‐leg curl‐ups; and a sit‐and‐reach test. The BMI percentiles developed from the subgroup whose test scores were better than the ‘poor’ quartile in all four tests were compared with those of the whole population and linked to the adult criteria for overweight and obesity. The BMIs were significantly related to the results of fitness testing. A total of 43% of students had scores better than the poorest quartile in all of their tests. The upper BMI percentile curves of this fitter subgroup were lower than those of the total population. The 85th and 95th BMI percentile values of the fitter 18‐year‐old‐students (23.7 and 25.5\u2003kg\u2003m−2 for boys; 22.6 and 24.6\u2003kg\u2003m−2 for girls) linked well with the adult cut‐off points of 23 and 25\u2003kg\u2003m−2, which have been recommended as the Asian criteria for adult overweight and obesity. Hence, the BMI norms for children and adolescents could be created from selected subgroups that have better physical fitness.

Binge eaters suffer from high standards and expectations, especially an acute sensitivity to the difficult (perceived) demands of others. When they fall short of these standards, they develop an aversive pattern of high self-awareness, characterized by unflattering views of self and concern over how they are perceived by others. These aversive self-perceptions are accompanied by emotional distress, which often includes anxiety and depression. To escape from this unpleasant state, binge eaters attempt the cognitive response of narrowing attention to the immediate stimulus environment and avoiding broadly meaningful thought. This narrowing of attention disengages normal inhibitions against eating and fosters an uncritical acceptance of irrational beliefs and thoughts.

Eating behaviors have psychosocial outcomes for adolescents’ development and are affected byEating disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in both developed and developing countries. In Turkey, eating disorders have been increasing in prevalence among adolescents. Family relations and parenting have been studied as sociocultural influences that shape individuals’ eating behaviors and relationships with food. Eating behaviors have psychosocial outcomes for adolescents’ development and are affected by parental warmth and care. This study investigated the relationship between fathers’ parental attitudes and young individuals’ emotion regulation skills and eating behaviors. It focused on fathers’ parental attitudes in Turkey, where a collectivistic and patriarchal culture typically has father figures playing an important role in family as well as in society. The Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26), Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire—Child Form (PARQ-C) were used to collect data from 401 Turkish adolescents. Correlation analyses showed positive correlations between 2 combinations of variables: adolescents’ eating behaviors and emotion regulation skills, and fathers’ parenting and adolescents’ eating behaviors. Multiple regression analysis showed that father’s parenting was predictive of adolescents’ eating behaviors and emotion regulation skills. Based on the results, this research may promote positive social change by identifying the importance of fathers’ parenting attitudes on adolescent health and by raising awareness of eating disorders in Turkey. The study will guide researchers and counselors in designing eating disorders prevention programs and identify tools for involving fathers in developing healthy parenting attitudes and awareness of eating disorders.

In total there were more than 244.2 thousands of primary and secondary Han nationality students aged 7 through 18 years old included in this study. The BMI distribution of various Chinese children and adolescent groups were compared with the NCHS international norm, the percentage values and with advanced ages, were calculated. In the beginning, three temporary norms were set up, using the different combination of P(85), P(90) and P(95) BMI percentages. Based on the intersect testing and varifying of physiological, lipidemia biochemical and body composition measures, the best norm was then selected. B-spline smoothing method was used to correct the curves, both for males and females, composed by cut-off points at different ages.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing samples from the costal developed metropolis, the BMI curves successfully overcame the shortcomings of low and depressive phenomenon of the total population, in particular after the mid-adolescent period. The temporary Norm II, composed by cut-off points of P(85) for overweight and P(95) for obesity, was found to be the best among the three temporary norms, both shown by its sensitivity and specificity. 24 and 28 were used as cut-off points for overweight and obesity in this norm, both for males and females aged 18 years. These two cut-off points were consistent with those shown in the Body Mass Index Reference Norm for Screening Overweight and Obesity in Chinese Adults. Three samples from Beijing, Henan and Sichuan, used as representatives of upper, middle and relative low levels of physical growth of children and adolescents in China, were used for extra tests. The screening results showed that among the male and female subjects aged 7 through 18 years, the prevalence rates were 17.00% and 9.46% for overweight, 9.99% and 6.47% for obesity in Beijing while 10.86% and 6.64% for overweight, 4.27% and 3.07% for obesity in Henan, and 6.95% and 4.23% for overweight and 2.84% and 2.09% for obesity in Sichuan, respectively. Data clearly showed that the results were in accordance with the actural situation seen in the Chinese students in 2000.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe newly established reference norm seemed to be good for prospective studies as it considered the facts regarding the rapid and strong tendency of secular growth changes seen in the Chinese children and adolescents. It also decreased the difference of growth levels between the Chinese children and adolescents and those of the international norms. This norm was particularly developed for the Chinese which was also in consistent with the Eastern Asia ethnic characteristics so could be promoted in China.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 251, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145100313', 'name': 'C.

Materials and Methods: The study included 80 patients who met the study criteria according to the DSM-5 criteria and 80 randomly selected healthy individuals with similar sociodemographic characteristics. Panic Agoraphobia Scale, Childhood Trauma Scale (CTQ-28), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) were applied to the participants. Results: A total of 160 cases were included in the study, including 80 patients aged 18-53 and 80 control subjects aged 19-61. In the patient group, the total score of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)) and the Awareness, Openness, Disagreement, Strategies, Impulse and Goals subscales were statistically significantly higher than the control group. The prevalence of those with a CTQ score of ≥35 was 47.5% in the patient group and 26.3% in the control group, which was statistically significantly higher in the patient group. Increase in “Disagreement”, “Awareness”, and “Goals” subscores significantly increased the likelihood of being in the patient group. Conclusion: Pharmacological agents and therapies targeting the affected regions may reduce the adverse effects of childhood trauma and associated emotional regulation difficulties in patients with panic disorder, increasing the success of treatment and quality of life. Amaç: Çalışmamızın birincil amacı panik bozukluğu hastalarında çocukluk çağı travmalarının varlığını saptamak, ikincil amacımız panik bozukluğu hastalarında duygusal işlev bozukluğunun varlığını tespit etmek ve üçüncü amacımız panik bozukluğu hastalarında çocukluk travması ile duygu işlev bozukluğu arasındaki ilişkiyi değerlendirmektir. Gereç ve Yöntem: Çalışmaya, DSM-5 kriterlerine göre çalışma kriterlerini karşılayan 80 hasta ve rastgele seçilmiş benzer sosyo-demografik özelliklere sahip 80 sağlıklı birey dahil edildi. Katılımcılara Panik Agorafobi Ölçeği, Çocukluk Çağı Travma Ölçeği (CTQ-28) ve Duygu Düzenleme Zorluk Ölçeği (DERS) uygulandı. Bulgular: Çalışmaya 18-53 yaş arası 80 hasta grubu ve 1961 yaş arası 80 kontrol grubu dahil toplam 160 olgu dahil edildi. Hasta grubunda Duygusal Düzenleme Zorluk Ölçeği (DERS) ve Farkındalık, Açıklık, Anlaşmazlık, Stratejiler, Dürtü ve Amaç alt ölçeklerinin toplam puanı kontrol grubuna göre istatistiksel olarak anlamlı derecede yüksek bulundu. CTQ skoru ≥35 olanların oranı hasta grubunda %47.5 ve kontrol grubunda %26.3 idi, bu da hasta grubunda istatistiksel olarak anlamlı derecede yüksekti. Anlaşmazlık, Farkındalık, Amaç skorlarında yükselme hasta grubunda olmayı öngörmekte olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Sonuç: Etkilenen alanları hedefleyen farmakolojik ajanlar ve tedaviler ile çocukluk ve buna bağlı duygusal düzenleme güçlüklerinin panik bozukluğu hastaları üzerindeki olumsuz etkileri azaltılabilir. Tedavi başarısı ve yaşam kalitesi arttırılabilir.",2021,35,0,,"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-5.902339458465576, -3.376401901245117, -4.170374870300293, 1.8854496479034424, 0.9202449917793274,

However, the mechanism of this effect, critical to enhancing public health, remains poorly understood. Objective To investigate the neurodevelopmental trajectory of the association between early ACEs and adolescent general and emotional health outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective longitudinal study that began when patients were aged 3 to 6 years who underwent neuroimaging later at ages 7 to 12 years and whose mental and physical health outcomes were observed at ages 9 to 15 years. Sequential mediation models were used to investigate associations between early ACEs and brain structure, emotion development, and health outcomes longitudinally. Children were recruited from an academic medical center research unit. Exposure Early life adversity. Main Outcomes and Measures Early ACEs in children aged 3 to 7 years; volume of a subregion of the prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, in children aged 6 to 12 years; and emotional awareness, depression severity, and general health outcomes in children and adolescents aged 9 to 15 years. Results The mean (SD) age of 119 patients was 9.65 (1.31) years at the time of scan. The mean (SD) ACE score was 5.44 (3.46). The mean (SD) depression severity scores were 2.61 (1.78) at preschool, 1.77 (1.58) at time 2, and 2.16 (1.64) at time 3. The mean (SD) global physical health scores at time 2 and time 3 were 0.30 (0.38) and 0.33 (0.42), respectively. Sequential mediation in the association between high early ACEs and emotional and physical health outcomes were found. Smaller inferior frontal gyrus volumes and poor emotional awareness sequentially mediated the association between early ACEs and poor general health (model parameter estimate\u2009=\u20090.002; 95% CI,\u20090.0002-0.056) and higher depression severity (model parameter estimate\u2009=\u20090.007; 95% CI,\u20090.001-0.021) in adolescence. An increase from 0 to 3 early ACEs was associated with 15% and 25% increases in depression severity and physical health problems, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Study findings highlight 1 putative neurodevelopmental mechanism by which the association between early ACEs and later poor mental and physical health outcomes may operate.

This article aims to provide an integrative review of the latest theoretical and empirical developments in this rapidly growing field of research. Recent findings Deficits in emotion regulation appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and treatment of various forms of psychopathology. Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties. Summary Despite some yet to be resolved challenges, the concept of emotion regulation has a broad and significant heuristic value for research in mental health.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 97, 'citationCount': 577, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2581311', 'name': 'M.

Clinical research to date reveals strong correlation between childhood abuse and neglect and anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThis study was conducted in order to assess the level of emotional, physical and sexual childhood abuse as well as the physical and emotional childhood neglect in 40 adult patients suffering from panic disorder, diagnosed in accordance with the 10th International Classification of Disorders diagnostic criteria, compared with the control group of 40 healthy test subjects without a history of psychiatric disorders, using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. The severity of the clinical manifestation in patients with panic disorder was assessed using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThere were no significant differences between the groups as to the level of sexual abuse and physical neglect, whereas in the group of patients with panic disorder, the level of physical and emotional abuse was significantly higher, with emphasis on emotional neglect. With regards to the correlation between the severity of the clinical manifestation in patients with panic disorder and the severity of suffered abuse and neglect in childhood age, significant correlation was found in the physical and emotional abuse as well as emotional neglect.

The objectives of the study were to examine linkages between exposure to childhood abuse and interparental violence and the subsequent development of panic attacks and panic disorder using data gathered on a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand young people studied to the age of 21 years. Method. Data on: (a) exposure to child abuse and interparental violence; (b) the development of panic attacks and panic disorder; and (c) other childhood and related factors were gathered over the course of a 21-year longitudinal study. Results. After adjustment for childhood and related factors, exposure to childhood physical abuse was associated with a significantly increased risk of later panic attack (OR 2·3, 95% CI 1·1–4·9) and panic disorder (OR 3·0, 95% CI 1·1–7·9); childhood sexual abuse was associated with a significantly increased risk of panic attack (OR 4·1, 95% CI 2·3–7·2) and a marginally significant increase risk of panic disorder (OR 2·2; 95% CI 0·98–5·0). Exposure to interparental violence was unrelated to later panic attack or disorder after adjustment. Conclusions. Exposure to childhood sexual and physical abuse was associated with increased risks of later panic attack/disorder even after adjustment for prospectively assessed confounding factors. However, exposure to interparental violence during childhood was not related to increased risk of later panic attack/disorder after adjustment. These data suggest the need for clinicians to be aware that patients with histories of childhood physical and sexual abuse may be at increased risk for panic during young adulthood.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 92, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5867204', 'name': 'R.

The P&A was specially developed for use in clinical drug trials. Factors which impair the quality of life, in panic disorder and agoraphobia patients (panic attacks, phobic avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, impairment in social relationships and work, assumption of somatic disease) were considered in the development of this scale so that the efficacy of a certain drug therapy on each of these factors can be assessed separately. Both an observer rating and a self-rating with matching items are available. The observer rating only takes about 10 minutes to complete. Translation into many European languages is planned so that it can be used in multicentre trials. Satisfactory results of item analysis., inter-rater reliability, objectivity, external validity and factor structure are presented.

AbstractIn this study, relationships among childhood abuse history, difficulties in emotion regulation, interpersonal styles and psychological wellbeing were examined. Besides the mediator role of emotion regulation and interpersonal styles in the relationship between childhood abuse history and psychological wellbeing were examined. The sample is composed of 802 adults aged 18-65. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to assess the participants? abuse experiences before age 18, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to evaluate participants? difficulties in emotion regulation, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) was used to assess the psychological distress level and Interpersonal Relationship Styles Inventory (IRSI) was used to assess participants? interpersonal styles. The results of the study have shown that gender variable has a main effect on all the study variables excluding emotion regulation and education variable also has a main effect on all the study variables excluding negative interpersonal style. Besides it was determined that the group with a higher level of abuse has more difficulties in emotion regulation, has more psychological distress and exhibit more negative interpersonal relation styles than the group with a lower level of abuse. The predictor variables of psychological wellbeing was found to be psychiatric treatment history, education level, age, the education level of the father, gender, trauma history, physical abuse, sexual abuse, negative interpersonal style and dimensions of emotion regulation difficulties including strategies, clarity, impulse control and goals. Results revealed that both emotion regulation difficulties and negative interpersonal style variables mediate the relation between childhood abuse history and psychological wellbeing. The results of this research in general have shown that childhood abuse history might have negative effects on psychological wellbeing, emotion regulation and interpersonal styles in adult life.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2084049725', 'name': 'Gülçim Bilim'}]}, {'paperId': '3271b93681b1b5a3cf9502b24a831a80db3b4b91', 'title': 'The frequency of childhood trauma and relationship with psychopathology in psychiatric patients', 'abstract': 'Objective: Abuse is considered as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. In this study, we aimed to determine the \nfrequency and risk factors of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual in psychiatric outpatient population and \ncompare the diagnostic groups in terms of these factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional, and descriptive epidemiologic study 183 patients whom accept to participate was enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria is being \naged between 15 and 67, diagnosed by DSM-IV (SCID) psychiatric disorder other than mental retardation and \npsychiatric disorder due to general medical condition.

Results: Of the sample \n65.7% (n=117) reported at least one and 6.1% (n=11) reported all three childhood emotional, physical and sexual \nabuse. The frequency of emotional and physical neglect was %81.6 (n=146) and %72.1(n=129). Whilst the \nreported emotional abuse was significantly more prevalent only in anxiety disorders, the distribution of other \nabuse types were similar in diagnostic groups. The group reported sexual abuse had statistically significant higher \nalcohol-substance abuse/dependence and suicide rates. When we examine family risk factors, low parent \neducation, in families that has interparental violence and in the group which reported being separated from \nparents because of migration, education and divorce, had significant higher rates of abuse. Discussion: The high \nprevalence of abuse in psychiatric patients, especially in mood and anxiety disorders is pointing at the need for \ndevelopment of preventative approaches. The rate of abuse is higher if there is violation between parents and/or \nthe child is separated from parents for a long time.

El maltrato se clasifica como fisico, fisico grave, emocional, negligencia y abuso sexual. La prevalencia del maltrato se ha reportado en estudios epidemiologicos (4.5% a 21%) y en estudios de poblacion clinica (6% a 48%) realizados en varios paises. En Mexico la encuesta de maltrato infantil y factores asociados reporto una prevalencia del maltrato de 16% a 20%, siendo el maltrato fisico, el maltrato fisico grave y el maltrato emocional los mas frecuentes. El maltrato infantil es un problema multicausal. Dentro de los factores familiares asociados al maltrato se han mencionado la desintegracion familiar, la violencia entre los padres y el menor nivel educativo de estos. La psicopatologia se ha reportado en 9% de los ninos y adolescentes maltratados, mencionandose al maltrato como predictor de esta. Se ha encontrado mayor frecuencia de trastornos afectivos, ansiosos, conductuales y de abuso de sustancias en sujetos victimas de maltrato cronico. Los objetivos del presente trabajo fueron determinar la frecuencia y tipos de maltrato reportados por pacientes adolescentes con psicopatologia y determinar la frecuencia de los factores demograficos y de funcionamiento familiar que se han asociado al maltrato en estos pacientes. Metodo El diseno del estudio fue transversal y descriptivo. La muestra incluyo adolescentes de 13 a 17 anos de ambos sexos, usuarios de los servicios de consulta externa, urgencias y hospitalizacion del Hospital Psiquiatrico Infantil «Dr. Juan N. Navarro». Los pacientes fueron evaluados con la Entrevista Semiestructurada para Adolescentes para obtener el diagnostico y contestaron la Encuesta de Maltrato Infantil, que incluye apartados para determinar la presencia de maltrato, las creencias del sujeto acerca del mismo, antecedentes de patologia en el adolescente, caracteristicas de la estructura y nivel socioeconomico familiar y su estilo para solucionar conflictos. Se utilizo estadistica descriptiva para el analisis de datos. Resultados: La muestra se conformo de un total de 100 pacientes (50% hombres, edad promedio 14.79±1.60 anos), 56% pertenecia a una familia integrada. Para ambos padres el nivel de escolaridad mas frecuentemente reportado fue de secundaria, 22% reporto violencia entre sus padres. Los diagnosticos mas frecuentemente encontrados fueron episodio depresivo mayor (61%), trastorno por deficit de atencion e hiperactividad (TDAH)(39%), trastorno disocial (31%), abuso de sustancias (31%) y trastornos de ansiedad (17%).Las frecuencias reportadas de los diferentes tipos de maltrato fueron: maltrato emocional 77%, maltrato fisico 41%, negligencia8% y abuso sexual 24%. La madre perpetro el abuso fisico y emocional con mayor frecuencia. Los pacientes con TDAH y trastorno disocial reportaron las frecuencias mas altas de todos los tipos de abuso, los adolescentes con diagnostico de abuso de sustancias tambien reportaron alta frecuencia de abuso emocional. El abuso sexual fue reportado con frecuencia similar por los pacientes con trastornos afectivos, de conducta y por uso de sustancias. Al preguntar a los pacientes las razones por las que sus padres los golpeaban, la desobediencia y la falta de respeto fueron las razones mas frecuentemente reportadas; el maltrato tambien se atribuyo a que los padres estuvieran nerviosos o hubieran consumido sustancias psicoactivas, siendo estas razones mas frecuentemente expuestas por los adolescentes con diagnostico de abuso de sustancias. Conclusiones: La muestra estudiada de adolescentes reporto frecuencias elevadas de maltrato y abuso sexual.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of emotional regulation training on depression, anxiety and stress, and professional quality of life for intensive and critical care nurses. In this experimental comparison trial, 60 intensive and critical care nurses were randomly assigned to treatment and wait-list control groups. The treatment group received six sessions of emotional regulation training, while the wait-list control group received no treatment. Outcome measures were: the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; and the Professional Quality of Life Scale in a pre-post design. The treatment group demonstrated greater improvements in burnout and compassion satisfaction compared with the wait-list control group. No significant reduction in compassion fatigue was found compared with controls. Some cognitive coping strategies improved in the treatment group compared with controls, with greater reductions in depression, anxiety, and stress.

Participants (N = 89) described how they regulated their emotions in terms of cognitive reappraisal and suppression. They also indicated their subjective well-being and level of perceived stress each day over 3 weeks. At the within-person level, cognitive reappraisal intended to increase positive emotions was positively associated with higher subjective well-being and negatively associated with perceived stress. Suppression of the expression of positive emotions was negatively associated with subjective well-being and positively associated with perceived stress. However, cognitive reappraisal intended to down-regulate negative emotions and suppression as a strategy to inhibit the expression of negative emotions were not associated with daily well-being or perceived stress. Off-days were rated as days with higher subjective well-being and lower perceived stress in contrast to working days. At the between-person level, individuals who reported more daily negative affect reported increased suppression of positive emotions, corroborating the within-person findings. Moreover, findings indicated that nurses with more years of experience in the job reported higher subjective well-being and less perceived stress.

High levels of stress may result in depression, anxiety, burnout syndrome, and in extreme cases, post-traumatic stress disorder. The aim of this study was to determine which personal, professional, and organizational variables are associated with greater perceived stress among critical care nurses for purposes of developing integrative solutions to decrease stress in the future. Methods: We conducted a correlation research survey using a cross-sectional design and an in-person survey method. The questionnaire consisted of 2 parts: (1) socioeconomic, professional, and institutional variables and (2) work stressors. Surveys were conducted between January 1, 2011, and December 1, 2015. Multistage cluster random sampling was utilized for data collection. Inclusion criteria were (1) age ≥18 years, (2) registered nurse, (3) works in the intensive care unit (ICU), and (4) willing and able to complete the survey. Results: We surveyed 21 767 ICU nurses in Iran and found that male sex, lower levels of peer collaboration, working with a supervisor in the unit, nurse–patient ratios, and working in a surgical ICU were positively associated with greater stress levels. Increasing age and married status were negatively associated with stress. Intensive care unit type (semi-closed vs open), ICU bed number, shift time, working on holidays, education level, and demographic factors including body mass index, and number of children were not significantly associated with stress levels. Conclusion: As the largest study of its kind, these findings support those found in various European, North, and South American studies. Efforts to decrease workplace stress of ICU nurses by focusing on facilitating peer collaboration, improving resource availability, and staffing ratios are likely to show the greatest impact on stress levels.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 75, 'citationCount': 101, 'authors': [{'authorId': '103116583', 'name': 'A. vahedian-azimi'}, {'authorId': '5600829', 'name': 'M.

Coping mechanisms and job satisfaction are associated with the incidence of burnout symptoms in a work context.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nThe aim of this paper was to make a systematic analysis of the literature related to nurses' stress and the incidence of burnout syndrome in intensive care nurses, and also to determine the research into associations between coping mechanisms and job satisfaction on one side, and burnout on the other side. Appropriate databases (Scopus, PubMed) were searched with the aim of finding relevant studies and articles published in the last 15 years. The keywords were burnout, coping mechanisms, job satisfaction, nurses, and intensive care. Two independent reviewers carried out a selection of the studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe literature review found 786 studies about burnout and its association with different variables. Twenty-nine original research papers were discovered in this review process. Open questions still remain concerning burnout and the associations between the considered variables.

Characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment it can result in significant personal and professional consequences putting patient care at risk. Emotion regulation describes a capacity to self-modulate emotions to achieve desirable emotional outcomes. Emotional intelligence theory suggests that emotion regulation skills facilitate the maintenance of appropriate emotions, reducing or adapting undesirable emotions in oneself and others. Emotion regulation is usually automatic but can be controlled through learnt strategies. There is evidence that occupationally stressed individuals are less capable of down-regulating negative emotions.

Successful emotion regulation is crucial to sustain health, enable well-being, foster resilience, and prevent burnout or compassion fatigue. Despite the alarmingly high rate of stress-related disorders in physicians, affecting not only physician well-being, but also outcomes such as physician performance, quality of care, or patient satisfaction, research on how to deal with emotionally challenging situations in physicians is lacking. Based on extant literature, the present article proposes a theoretical model depicting emotions, emotion regulation, and empathy-related processes and their relation to well-being in provider-client interactions. This model serves as a basis for future research and interventions aiming at improving physician well-being and professional functioning. As a first step, interviews with 21 psychiatrists were conducted. Results of qualitative and initial quantitative analyses provided detailed descriptions of the model's components confirming its usefulness for detecting mechanisms linking emotion regulation and well-being in psychiatrist-patient interactions. Additionally, results lend preliminary support for the validity of the model, suggesting that successful regulation of emotions (i.e., achieving a desired emotional state) elicited by cyclical transfer processes in provider-client interactions is associated with both short- and long-term well-being and resilience. Furthermore, empathy-related emotions and their regulation seem to be linked to well-being. Based on the results of the present study, a prospective longitudinal study is under preparation, which is intended to inform effective interventions targeting emotion transfer, empathy-related processes, and emotion regulation in physicians' professional lives.

Currently, the literature does not allow to determine stable similarities and differences in the use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) in anxiety and depression, especially concerning the adaptive strategies. Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify the overlapping and distinctive patterns of CERS use in the recently proposed types of anxiety and depression in a general population. In this dimensional approach, types of anxiety and depression are considered as personality types and distinguished based on their specific structural composition and functional role (reactive or regulative) in stimulation processing. 1,632 participants from a representative sample completed the Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire (measuring the Arousal and Apprehension Types of anxiety and the Valence and Anhedonic Types of depression) and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Regression analyses were conducted with the affective types as predictors. The co-occurrence of the types was accounted for in order to examine their independent relationships with the CERS. We found that reactive arousal anxiety was not related to any strategies, while regulative apprehension anxiety primarily predicted the use of rumination, which is presumably related to the type's cognitive structural components. The strategy specific to reactive valence depression was other-blame (as predicted by the high negative affect in its structure), and the regulative, most structurally complex anhedonic depression predicted the use of the largest number of strategies, including the adaptive ones. The relationships between the types of depression and self-blame and refocus on planning were moderated by sex but the effects were small. These findings fit into the current trend of exploring the shared and specific features of anxiety and depression, which might facilitate their differentiation by identifying CERS that are characteristic for the specific types.

Subsequently, the quality of patient care and outcomes may be threatened if clinicians experience burnout or compassion fatigue. Therefore, the aim of this descriptive, cross-sectional study was to evaluate the prevalence of burnout and compassion fatigue among burn clinicians in Israel. Fifty-five clinicians from Burns, Plastics and Reconstruction Surgery and Intensive Care completed four validated surveys to assess burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), depression (PRIME-MD), health-related quality of life (SF-8), and compassion fatigue (Professional Quality of Life version 5). Burn clinicians were compared with Plastics and Reconstruction Surgery and Intensive Care clinicians. This study identified a high prevalence of burnout (38.2%) among Intensive Care, Plastics and Reconstruction and Burns clinicians, with Burns clinicians having a greatly increased prevalence of burnout compared to Intensive Care clinicians (OR =24.3, P=0.017). Additional factors contributing to compassion fatigue were those without children (P=0.016), divorced (P=0.035), of a younger age (P=0.019), and a registered nurse (P=0.05).

This disorder affects important aspects of a person’s life such as professional quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between post-traumatic stress symptoms and professional quality of life among psychiatric nurses. Methods & Materials: In this descriptive analytical study, 160 nurses in psychiatric wards affiliated to Kerman University of Medical Sciences, were selected using census sampling in 2013. Data were collected using questionnaires including professional and demographic characteristics, the Weathers’ PTSD checklist (PCL-C) and Hudnall Stamm’s Professional Quality of Life (PQOL). Data were analyzed by the SPSS software v.20 using the Pearson correlation coefficient, independent t-test, one-way ANOVA and linear regression. Results: There was a significant correlation between PTSD score and professional quality of life scores in psychiatric nurses (r=0.32, P<0.001). Also, PTSD was positively correlated with burnout (r=0.36, P<0.001) and secondary traumatic stress (r=0.61, P<0.001), and conversely correlated with compassion satisfaction (r=-0.29, P<0.001). After removing the effects of age, work experience, previous experience of traumatic events, the correlation between two main research variables was significant as well (P<0.001).

Future Directions for Research.', 'abstract': 'Burnout syndrome is a psychological condition experienced in the workplace that is characterized by exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment (1). Burnout syndrome can manifest as physical and emotional health problems. Work-related consequences can include clinician dissatisfaction, decreased quality of care delivered to patients, medical errors, unjustified absenteeism, and intention to leave the organization. Health care organizations and leaders within the critical care community are increasingly concerned about the development of burnout syndrome among intensive care unit (ICU) health care professionals (2, 3). These concerns are fueled by growing awareness of the major adverse consequences burnout can have on individual clinicians, health care organizations, and patients. An official statement addressing burnout syndrome among ICU health care professionals was prepared jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN), and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and was published simultaneously in journals of the participating societies, including the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (4) The statement discusses the prevalence, contributing factors, diagnosis, consequences, prevention, and treatment of burnout syndrome in ICU physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals. This editorial expands on the research needs identified by the multisociety writing panel. Four priorities are highlighted for future research: the diagnosis of burnout syndrome in critical care health care professionals, the general effect of burnout syndrome, preventative measures and treatments, and the dissemination and implementation of effective interventions. Research on burnout syndrome requires the development and validation of appropriate tools for identifying and measuring the severity of the syndrome. The Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) is the most commonly used instrument for the measurement of burnout syndrome (1, 5, 6). The original MBI-HSS is based on a three-factor conceptualization of burnout, which includes the constructs of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Self-assessment instruments of this type are expected to measure the same constructs over a variety of subject cohorts and across repeated applications to the same subjects over time. If those expectations hold true in practice, the analyses of the scores are acceptable and yield meaningful results. However, there have been inconsistent findings based on the three-factor model for the MBI-HSS related to measurement invariance (7–9). Dramatic, unexplained variations in prevalence have been reported. There is also a question of whether the three-factor conceptualization of burnout embedded in the MBI-HSS appropriately defines burnout in the critical care health care professional. Future research should focus on developing briefer screening tests for burnout syndrome, examining the validity of diagnostic tests in the ICU health care professionals specifically, the validity of diagnostic instruments over time, and the responsiveness of the instrument to detect meaningful improvement in symptoms. Other than self-assessment instruments, there are no binding diagnostic criteria for burnout that enable differentiation between adverse consequences of the work environment and primary psychiatric disorders. To enable this differentiation, health care organizations may also benefit from developing a brief screening questionnaire to implement during the hiring of critical care health care professionals. Using existing instruments, estimates of the prevalence of burnout among critical care nurses and physicians have ranged from 25% to 80%, and the average severity has ranged from mild to severe (3, 10, 11) The temporal relationship between burnout and the ICU environment is poorly understood because all these studies have been cross-sectional in design. Therefore, prospective cohort studies are needed to more accurately define the prevalence of burnout and determine how quickly burnout develops. Assessing baseline burnout levels before commencing work in the ICU and repeated measures over time will help address the question of temporality. Other questions need to be addressed to fully understand the effect of burnout on critical care health care professionals and', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 17, 'citationCount': 25, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5026369', 'name': 'M.

Until recently, BOS and other psychological disorders in critical care health care professionals remained relatively unrecognized. To raise awareness of BOS, the Critical Care Societies Collaborative (CCSC) developed this call to action. The present article reviews the diagnostic criteria, prevalence, causative factors, and consequences of BOS. It also discusses potential interventions that may be used to prevent and treat BOS. Finally, we urge multiple stakeholders to help mitigate the development of BOS in critical care health care professionals and diminish the harmful consequences of BOS, both for critical care health care professionals and for patients.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 65, 'citationCount': 101, 'authors': [{'authorId': '80272913', 'name': 'M.

Research shows that mental health consumers’ understanding of compassion devolves on professionals valuing them as people worthy of intrinsic respect and interacting with them in ways that maintain their personal dignity (Lloyd & Carson, 2011).

Results In the case of general nurses the most prevalent symptoms were of anxiety (44%), followed by symptoms of depression (15%) and then posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (7%). Similarly, for intensive care unit (ICU) nurses anxiety symptoms were the most prevalent (28%), followed by symptoms of depression (15%) and PTSD (3%). We identified certain specific traumatic factors present in particular workplaces (care for dying patients and the bodies of the deceased, and participation in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, all found in general units, and care for potential organ donors in ICUs). General nurses were less satisfied with their job and their workload was high. It seems that in both workplaces, the occurrence of symptoms of anxiety best correlated with several estimated markers of high workload.

This article aims to provide an integrative review of the latest theoretical and empirical developments in this rapidly growing field of research. Recent findings Deficits in emotion regulation appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and treatment of various forms of psychopathology. Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties.

Therefore, success in life depends not only on intellectual abilities, but also on emotion regulation competence. Emotion regulation is of greater importance in professions with high levels of daily occupational stress such as nursing. The aim of this study was to determine cognitive emotion regulation strategies used by a group of Iranian critical care nurses. Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 193 critical care nurses. They were recruited through stratified random sampling from ICU, CCU, and Hemodialysis center and Emergency departments of six hospitals under supervision of Qazvin university of medical science, qazvin, Iran,. The 36-item Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was used for data gathering. Descriptive statistics measures (frequency, mean, and SD) and inferential statistics (T test, Pearson correlation analysis) were used for data description and analysis. Results: There were significant differences among nurses of different units respecting the mean scores of strategies Acceptance (P = 0.002), Rumination (P = 0.001), Catastrophizing (P = 0.046), and Self-blame (P = 0.029).

As an attempt to shed more light on the relationships among teacher psychological factors in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context, this study examined the role of teacher self-efficacy and emotional regulation as predictors of teaching stress among Iranian EFL teachers. In so doing, a sample of 256 teachers completed three questionnaires measuring these constructs. Structural Equation Modeling was employed to test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. The findings revealed that emotional regulation accounted for 14.2% of the variance and teacher self-efficacy accounted for 22.1% of the variance in teaching stress. Although each of the two variables had a unique effect on teaching stress, teacher self-efficacy outweighed emotional regulation in predicting teaching stress. Finally, the practical implications of the results were discussed.",2019,66,64,"{'name': '', 'pages': '117-143', 'volume': '13'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-2.1506831645965576,

We then highlight growing evidence that automatic and habitual forms of ER, characterized by low resource demands and low conscious awareness, have an important influence on the stress response and its link to psychopathology and well-being. We propose the Dynamic Fit Model of Stress and ER, which posits that (1) both deliberative and automatic ER contribute to the link between stress and psychopathology; (2) the fit between stress demands and ER strategy selection can be mapped along the dimensions of automaticity and flexibility; and (3) negative effects of stress on well-being and psychological functioning emerge when there is a poor fit between stress demands and ER.

The emotion regulation was measured via the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire developed by Gross and John. The scale comprises two subscales: cognitive reappraisal (an antecedent-focused factor aimed at changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact) and expressive suppression (a response-focused element targeted at inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings). Emotional labor strategies were assessed through the Teacher Emotional Labor Strategy Scale designed by Yin. This test consists of three parts: surface acting (which refers to strategy in which people hinder and cover their felt emotions or fake unfelt feeling for the aim of showing the appropriate emotions needed for their profession), deep acting (which refers to the kind of strategy in which individuals try to change their felt emotions with the aid of some cognitive techniques, such as distraction so as the appropriate emotion occurs), and natural acting (which refers to the instance when individuals simultaneously experience and present the appropriate emotion for their job).

The findings of this study showed that both leavers and stayers had intrinsic interests in working as a teacher. Also, both groups identified similar challenges of working as a teacher, such as classroom management and effective delivery of lessons. However, leavers showed weaker self-efficacy beliefs than stayers, who tended to get more support and help from school administrators. In addition, leavers held beliefs that imposed heavy burdens on themselves, which may have created stress and emotional burnout.

A Dutch bank organization who was part of a cancelled merger with another major bank organization was recently nationalized by the Dutch government. As a result of these changes, employees experience increased levels of job stress. This research indentifies self efficacy as an important factor \nto influence the amount of stress among employees. Furthermore, it identifies the perception of risk as \na mediating factor in the relation between self efficacy and job stress. A total of 83 (57%) employees \nfilled in a digital survey. The survey consisted of 49 statements measured by a five-point likert scale. \nThe results confirm a main effect of self efficacy on job stress, and a mediating effect of risk perception with a reverse causal effect. These results lead to a conclusion that during a recession, self efficacy of change negatively relates to job stress, and supports the general notion that self efficacy will effect job stress. Because of the confirmation of the reversed causality, a mediating effect of risk perception cannot be confirmed. However, it is made clear that there is a relation between job stress and risk perception. It is therefore suggested that future research is conducted using the same variables whilst controlling for the mediating variable', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 36, 'citationCount': 10, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2060358543', 'name': 'M.

Based on those recurring themes, the conclusion is that effective teachers share at least twelve clear characteristics. Those characteristics consistently affected students in positive ways. This article results from a longitudinal, qualitative, quasi-research study of students in education, including in-service as well as pre-service teachers. An out-of-class essay assignment asked this question: What were the qualities of the most memorable teacher who encouraged you to teach? Participants and Courses Involved in the Study This study utilized both traditional and nontraditional students the author taught in the past fifteen years. The undergraduate students (pre-service teachers) in the study were working toward bachelor’s degrees in teaching and not actually teaching when they wrote their essays. Most of the graduate students were in-service education professionals who had returned to school for advanced degrees. “Traditional” students were defined as on-campus students with tuition support from parents or student loans. “Nontraditional” students were defined as those living off campus and working or raising a family. 61 The students were enrolled in various courses, some held during the day, others at night. The courses included Methods of Teaching Science; Methods of Teaching Math; Methods of Teaching Social Studies; Curriculum Development; Child Development; Introduction to Special Education; Problems in the Elementary School; Educational Technology; and Teaching in the Urban Setting. More than one thousand students matriculated through these undergraduate and graduate classes, held in the United States, Canada, Bermuda, and the Caribbean. Several students from Africa participated. The courses were taught at both predominately white and historically black institutions, including two private colleges; three public universities; a junior college; and a technical college. The multiplicity of institutions and courses over the years provided the study with a diverse student population: young and old, black and white, Hispanic, those of Asian nationality, males, and females. The students were mainly early childhood majors, training to teach nursery to grade three (N–3); elementary education majors, training to teach kindergarten to sixth grade (K–6); and secondary education majors, training to teach seventh to twelfth grades (7–12) in specific subject areas such as physical education, mathematics, science, history, and music. The elementary education majors formed the largest contingent. educational HORIZONS Fall 2008', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 125, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2107296705', 'name': 'R.

En concreto se pretende estudiar la complementariedad entre dos medidas de autoeficacia: una generalizada y otra especifica para el ambito laboral. La hipotesis de partida es que la autoeficacia especifica modulara mas relaciones del estres laboral y sus consecuencias que la autoeficacia generalizada. A partir de los datos obtenidos de 140 trabajadores que utilizan nuevas tecnologias en sus puestos, se constata que, en general, la autoeficacia modula las relaciones entre los estresores y sus consecuencias, en el sentido de que bajos niveles de autoeficacia estan asociados a mayores niveles de estres experimentado. Los resultados de los analisis de regresion multiple jerarquica senalan que, aunque encontramos mas efectos de interaccion en el caso de la autoeficacia profesional, ambos tipos de autoeficacia son complementarias en cuanto a su rol modulador en los procesos de estres, dependiendo su modulacion del tipo de estresor y de la consecuencia de estres especifica considerada. En concreto encontramos que los trabajadores bajos en autoeficacia generalizada manifiestan mayor agotamiento emocional cuando la autonomia laboral es mayor; mientras que los trabajadores bajos en autoeficacia profesional manifiestan mayores niveles de cinismo cuando la rutina y el conflicto de rol son altos, y menores niveles de compromiso organizacional cuando tienen niveles elevados de conflicto de rol. Para los trabajadores altos en niveles de autoeficacia, tanto generalizada como especifica, valores altos de los estresores no estan asociado con consecuencias negativas del estres.

Consistent with a bioecological framework, where culture is part of the macrosystem, philosophical foundations and core cultural values that are relevant to Chinese parenting and parental socialization of children’s emotion and emotional self-regulation processes are discussed. In addition, major changes that have been observed in Chinese societies and cultures across the 20th and 21st centuries are discussed in relation to parenting and emotional self-regulation processes. In light of such cultural values and dynamics, transactional or bidirectional influences between parent and child factors on children’s emotional self-regulation processes and psychosocial adjustment, along with promising future research directions, are highlighted and discussed.",2022,0,4,{'name': 'The Oxford Handbook of Emotional Development'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

70,87712ca4b2c738db9528b3c74182126bb3653bc3,From anatomy to function: the role of the somatosensory cortex in emotional regulation,"Since the pioneering work of Penfield and his colleagues in the 1930s, the somatosensory cortex, which is located on the postcentral gyrus, has been known for its central role in processing sensory information from various parts of the body. More recently, a converging body of literature has shown that the somatosensory cortex also plays an important role in each stage of emotional processing, including identification of emotional significance in a stimulus, generation of emotional states, and regulation of emotion. Importantly, studies conducted in individuals suffering from mental disorders associated with abnormal emotional regulation, such as major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and panic disorders, specific phobia, obesity, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, have found structural and functional changes in the somatosensory cortex. Common observations in the somatosensory cortices of individuals with mood disorders include alterations in gray matter volume, cortical thickness, abnormal functional connectivity with other brain regions, and changes in metabolic rates. These findings support the hypothesis that the somatosensory cortex may be a treatment target for certain mental disorders. In this review, we discuss the anatomy, connectivity, and functions of the somatosensory cortex, with a focus on its role in emotional regulation.",2018,63,134,"{'name': 'Revista Brasileira de

However, the unique and the shared neuroanatomical characteristics of the two disorders have not been fully identified. The aim of this study was to compare the topological organization of gray matter networks between non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients and SAD patients. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 37 non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients, 24 non-comorbid medication-naive SAD patients, and 41 healthy controls. Single-subject gray matter graphs were extracted from structural MRI scans, and whole-brain neuroanatomic organization was compared across the three groups. The relationships between brain network measures and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Relative to healthy controls, both the MDD and the SAD patients showed global decreases in clustering coefficient, normalized clustering coefficient, and small-worldness and locally decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the left insular, lingual, and calcarine cortices. Compared with healthy controls, the SAD patients exhibited increased nodal centralities and morphological connections mainly involving the prefrontal cortex and the sensorimotor network. Furthermore, compared to the SAD patients, the MDD patients showed increased characteristic path length, reduced global efficiency, and decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus. Our findings provide new evidence for shared and specific similarity-based gray matter network alterations in MDD and SAD and emphasize that the psychopathological changes in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus might be different between the two disorders.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 12, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7637061', 'name': 'Youjin Zhao'}, {'authorId': '23597096', 'name': 'R.

This study tested the potential of diffusion measurements in WM for identifying ALS based on support vector machine (SVM). Methods: Voxel-wise fractional anisotropy (FA) values of diffusion tensor images (DTI) were extracted from 22 ALS patients and 26 healthy controls and served as discrimination features. The revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) was employed to assess ALS severity. Feature ranking and selection were based on Fisher scores. A linear kernel SVM algorithm was applied to build the classification model, from which the classification performance was evaluated. To promote classifier generalization ability, a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method was adopted. Results: By using the 2,400~3,400 ranked features as optimal features, the highest classification accuracy of 83.33% (sensitivity = 77.27% and specificity = 88.46%, P = 0.0001) was achieved, with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.862. The predicted function value was positively correlated with patient ALSFRS-R scores (r = 0.493, P = 0.020). In the optimized SVM model, FA values from several regions mostly contributed to classification, primarily involving the corticospinal tract pathway, postcentral gyrus, and frontal and parietal areas.

Reduced pyramidal cell arborization occurs with stress and MDD, and may diminish excitatory neurotransmission. Enhanced deposition of perineuronal net (PNN) components also occurs with stress. Since parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are the predominant cell population that is enveloped by PNNs, which enhance their ability to release GABA, excess PNN deposition likely increases pyramidal cell inhibition. In the present study, we investigate the potential for matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), an endopeptidase secreted in response to neuronal activity, to contribute to the antidepressant efficacy of the serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine in male mice. Chronic venlafaxine increases MMP-9 levels in murine cortex, and increases both pyramidal cell arborization and PSD-95 expression in the cortex of WT but not MMP-9-null mice. We have previously shown that venlafaxine reduces PNN deposition and increases the power of ex vivo γ oscillations in conventionally housed mice. γ power is increased with pyramidal cell disinhibition and with remission from MDD. Herein we observe that PNN expression is increased in a corticosterone-induced stress model of disease and reduced by venlafaxine. Compared with mice that receive concurrent venlafaxine, corticosterone-treated mice also display reduced ex vivo γ power and impaired working memory. Autopsy-derived PFC samples show elevated MMP-9 levels in antidepressant-treated MDD patients compared with controls. These preclinical and postmortem findings highlight a link between extracellular matrix regulation and MDD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Reduced excitatory neurotransmission occurs with major depressive disorder, and may be normalized by antidepressant treatment. Underlying molecular mechanisms are, however, not well understood. Herein we investigate a potential role for an extracellular protease, released from neurons and known to play a role in learning and memory, in antidepressant-associated increases in excitatory transmission. Our data suggest that this protease, matrix metalloprotease-9, increases branching of excitatory neurons and concomitantly attenuates the perineuronal net to potentially reduce inhibitory input to these neurons. Matrix metalloprotease-9 may thus enhance overall excitatory/inhibitory balance and neuronal population dynamics, which are important to mood and memory.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 99, 'citationCount': 30, 'authors': [{'authorId': '38254612', 'name': 'Seham Alaiyed'}, {'authorId': '40862909', 'name': 'Mondona S.

Methods: In total, 68 right-handed euthymic women (bipolar disorder\u2009=\u200932 and healthy controls\u2009=\u200936) between 16 and 45\u2009years of age underwent high-resolution anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging during the mid-follicular menstrual phase.

Voxel-based morphometry was used to evaluate somatosensory cortical gray matter volume between groups.

Few studies have taken a whole‐brain perspective in the functional connectivity (FC) analysis of these two disorders in resting state. It limits the ability to identify regionally and psychopathologically specific network abnormalities with their subsequent use as diagnostic marker and novel treatment strategy. The whole brain FC using a novel FC metric was compared, that is, scaled correlation, which they demonstrated to be a reliable FC statistics, but have higher statistical power in two‐sample t‐test of whole brain FC analysis. About 21 GAD and 18 PD patients were compared with 22 matched control subjects during resting‐state, respectively. It was found that GAD patients demonstrated increased FC between hippocampus/parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus among the most significantly changed FC, while PD was mainly associated with greater FC between somatosensory cortex and thalamus. Besides such regional specificity, it was observed that psychopathological specificity in that the disrupted FC pattern in PD and GAD correlated with their respective symptom severity. The findings suggested that the increased FC between hippocampus/parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus in GAD were mainly associated with a fear generalization related neural circuit, while the greater FC between somatosensory cortex and thalamus in PD were more likely linked to interoceptive processing. Due to the observed regional and psychopathological specificity, their findings bear important clinical implications for the potential treatment strategy.

Second, early sensory input regions in occipital, temporal, piriform, mid-insular, and primary sensory cortex were frequently engaged during affective experiences driven by visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and somatosensory inputs. A classification analysis demonstrated that the pattern of neural activity across a contrast map diagnosed the stimulus modality driving the affective experience.

The current study used structural MRI-based multivariate pattern classification to (i) identify and cross-validate a differential diagnostic signature separating patients with first-episode and recurrent stages of schizophrenia (n = 158) from patients with major depression (n = 104); and (ii) quantify the impact of major clinical variables, including disease stage, age of disease onset and accelerated brain ageing on the signature's classification performance. This diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging signature was then evaluated in an independent patient cohort from two different centres to test its generalizability to individuals with bipolar disorder (n = 35), first-episode psychosis (n = 23) and clinically defined at-risk mental states for psychosis (n = 89). Neuroanatomical diagnosis was correct in 80% and 72% of patients with major depression and schizophrenia, respectively, and involved a pattern of prefronto-temporo-limbic volume reductions and premotor, somatosensory and subcortical increments in schizophrenia versus major depression. Diagnostic performance was not influenced by the presence of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms in major depression, but earlier disease onset and accelerated brain ageing promoted misclassification in major depression due to an increased neuroanatomical schizophrenia likeness of these patients. Furthermore, disease stage significantly moderated neuroanatomical diagnosis as recurrently-ill patients had higher misclassification rates (major depression: 23%; schizophrenia: 29%) than first-episode patients (major depression: 15%; schizophrenia: 12%). Finally, the trained biomarker assigned 74% of the bipolar patients to the major depression group, while 83% of the first-episode psychosis patients and 77% and 61% of the individuals with an ultra-high risk and low-risk state, respectively, were labelled with schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that neuroanatomical information may provide generalizable diagnostic tools distinguishing schizophrenia from mood disorders early in the course of psychosis. Disease course-related variables such as age of disease onset and disease stage as well alterations of structural brain maturation may strongly impact on the neuroanatomical separability of major depression and schizophrenia."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 99, 'citationCount': 121, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3214043', 'name': 'N.

However, the unique and shared neuroanatomical characteristics of depression and anxiety disorders have not been fully identified. The aim of this study was to identify gray matter abnormalities and their clinical correlates in depressive patients with and without anxiety disorders.We applied voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest analyses of gray matter volume (GMV) in normal controls (NC group, n\u200a=\u200a28), depressive patients without anxiety disorder (DP group, n\u200a=\u200a18), and depressive patients with anxiety disorder (DPA group, n\u200a=\u200a20). The correlations between regional GMV and clinical data were analyzed.The DP group showed decreased GMV in the left insula (INS) and left triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus when compared to the NC group. The DPA group showed greater GMV in the midbrain, medial prefrontal cortex, and primary motor/somatosensory cortex when compared to the NC group. Moreover, the DPA group showed greater GMV than the DP group in the frontal, INS, and temporal lobes. Most gray matter anomalies were significantly correlated with depression severity or anxiety symptoms. These correlations were categorized into 4 trend models, of which 3 trend models (ie, Models I, II, and IV) revealed the direction of the correlation between regional GMV and depression severity to be the opposite of that between regional GMV and anxiety symptoms. Importantly, the left INS showed a trend Model I, which might be critically important for distinguishing depressive patients with and without anxiety disorder.Our findings of gray matter abnormalities, their correlations with clinical data, and the trend models showing opposite direction may reflect disorder-specific symptom characteristics and help explain the neurobiological differences between depression and anxiety disorder.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 60, 'citationCount': 26, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1406140379', 'name': 'Haochen Qi'}, {'authorId': '152781697', 'name': 'Y.

Previous studies have revealed thalamic abnormalities in schizophrenia; however, it is not known whether thalamocortical networks are differentially affected in the disorder. To explore this possibility, the authors examined functional connectivity in intrinsic low-frequency blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations between major divisions of the cortex and thalamus using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI).\n\n\nMETHOD\nSeventy-seven healthy subjects and 62 patients with schizophrenia underwent resting-state fMRI. To identify functional subdivisions of the thalamus, the authors parceled the cortex into six regions of interest: the prefrontal cortex, motor cortex/supplementary motor area, somatosensory cortex, temporal lobe, posterior parietal cortex, and occipital lobe. Mean BOLD time series were extracted for each region of interest and entered into a seed-based functional connectivity analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nConsistent with previous reports, activity in distinct cortical areas correlated with specific, largely nonoverlapping regions of the thalamus in both healthy comparison subjects and schizophrenia patients. Direct comparison between groups revealed reduced prefrontal-thalamic connectivity and increased motor/somatosensory-thalamic connectivity in schizophrenia. The changes in connectivity were unrelated to local gray matter content within the thalamus and to antipsychotic medication dosage. No differences were observed in temporal, posterior parietal, or occipital cortex connectivity with the thalamus.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings establish differential abnormalities of thalamocortical networks in schizophrenia. The etiology of schizophrenia may disrupt the development of prefrontal-thalamic connectivity and refinement of somatomotor connectivity with the thalamus that occurs during brain maturation.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 402, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1941486', 'name': 'N.

Potential human homologues for these areas have already been defined by cytoarchitectonic mapping and functional imaging experiments. Differences between the two most widely studied areas [operculum parietale (OP) 1 and OP 4] within this region particularly pertain to their connection with either the perceptive parietal network or the frontal motor areas. In the present study, we investigated differences in anatomical connection patterns probed by probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. Functional connectivity was then mapped by coordinate-based meta-analysis of imaging studies. Comparison between these two aspects of connectivity showed a good congruency and hence converging evidence for an involvement of these areas in matching brain networks. There were, however, also several instances in which anatomical and functional connectivity diverged, underlining the independence of these measures and the need for multimodal characterization of brain connectivity. The connectivity analyses performed showed that the two largest areas within the human parietal operculum region display considerable differences in their connectivity to frontoparietal brain regions. In particular, relative to OP 1, area OP 4 is more closely integrated with areas responsible for basic sensorimotor processing and action control, while OP 1 is more closely connected to the parietal networks for higher order somatosensory processing. These results are largely congruent with data on nonhuman primates. Differences between anatomical and functional connectivity as well as between species, however, highlight the need for an integrative view on connectivity, including comparison and cross-validation of results from different approaches.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 88, 'citationCount': 319, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1717616', 'name': 'S.

Drugs that target the γ-aminobutyric acid or serotonergic system, such as benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, respectively, are the most widely prescribed treatments for these disorders. However, the role of glutamate in anxiety disorders is becoming more recognized with the belief that drugs that modulate glutamatergic function through either ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors have the potential to improve the current treatment of these severe and disabling illnesses. Animal models of fear and anxiety have provided a method to study the role of glutamate in anxiety. This research has demonstrated that drugs that alter glutamate transmission have potential anxiolytic action for many different paradigms including fear-potentiated startle, punished responding, and the elevated plus maze. Human clinical drug trials have demonstrated the efficacy of glutamatergic drugs for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. Recent data from magnetic resonance imaging studies provide an additional link between the glutamate system and anxiety.

However, emotional behaviors, such as novelty and emergence responses have not been reported in μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice due to the disruptions of exon 2 and 3. Here, we report that μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice, with deletion of exon 2 and 3, display significant emotional behavior changes; they showed less anxiety in the elevated plus maze and emergence tests, reduced response to novel stimuli in the novelty test, and less depressive‐like behavior in the forced‐swim test. Analysis of the compensatory mechanism in μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice revealed that the M1 mRNA levels were reduced in the cortex, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus, and that M1 receptor levels were reduced in the nucleus accumbens, CA1, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, versus the wild‐type. However, 5‐HT1A receptor levels were significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex and in the hypothalamus of μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice versus the wild‐type. These aberrant emotional behavioral phenotypes are possibly related to M1 and 5‐HT1A receptor alterations in the μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice. Overall, our study suggests that μ‐opioid receptor may play a role in the modification of emotional responses to novelty, anxiety, and depression.

The mechanism of these behaviors is not well understood. Our prior studies with positron emission tomography (PET) in drug-addicted subjects documented reductions in striatal dopamine (DA) D2 receptors. In pathologically obese subjects, we found reductions in striatal DA D2 receptors similar to that in drug-addicted subjects. Moreover, DA D2 receptor levels were found to have an inverse relationship to the body mass index of the obese subjects. We postulated that decreased levels of DA D2 receptors predisposed subjects to search for reinforcers; in the case of drug-addicted subjects for the drug and in the case of the obese subjects for food as a means to temporarily compensate for a decreased sensitivity of DA D2 regulated reward circuits.

Subsequent training in the hand and finger conditions with feedback for correctness did not modify segregation, indicating that segregation was a task effect and not a training effect.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes."", 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 3649, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

We addressed these two issues in a quantitative study of 108 subjects with focal brain lesions, using three different tasks that assessed the recognition and naming of six basic emotions from facial expressions. Lesions were analyzed as a function of task performance by coregistration in a common brain space, and statistical analyses of their joint volumetric density revealed specific regions in which damage was significantly associated with impairment. We show that recognizing emotions from visually presented facial expressions requires right somatosensory-related cortices. The findings are consistent with the idea that we recognize another individual's emotional state by internally generating somatosensory representations that simulate how the other individual would feel when displaying a certain facial expression. Follow-up experiments revealed that conceptual knowledge and knowledge of the name of the emotion draw on neuroanatomically separable systems. Right somatosensory-related cortices thus constitute an additional critical component that functions together with structures such as the amygdala and right visual cortices in retrieving socially relevant information from faces."", 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 1000, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46306086', 'name': 'R.

Somatic stimuli were applied to the lips, face, hand, trunk, and foot of 18 human subjects. Activity patterns were transposed onto three‐dimensional magnetic resonance images of the brain so that the location of activity associated with the different stimuli could be related to specific regions of the cortex. There were several consistent findings. First, there were three regions of activity in the lateral sulcus associated with stimulation of the contralateral body. The most consistent locus of activation was on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus, continuing onto the operculum. The other two areas, one rostral and one caudal to this large central area, were smaller and were activated less consistently. Second, when activity patterns in the large central area resulting from stimulation of all body parts were considered, this region appeared to contain two fields that corresponded in location and somatotopic organization to the second somatosensory area (SII) and the parietal ventral area (PV). Finally, patterns of activation within SII and PV were somewhat variable across subjects. Repeated within‐subject stimulus presentation indicated that differences across subjects were not due to inconsistent stimulus presentation. Comparisons with other mammals suggest that some features of organization are found only in primates. It is hypothesized that these features may be associated with manual dexterity and coordination of the hands, a characteristic generally restricted to the primate lineage. J. Comp.

Cues selectively directed subjects to attend to the roughness or duration of contact with embossed gratings that rubbed against a single fingertip with controlled speed and force. The task required discriminating between paired gratings that differed in tactile features of roughness and/or length. For different blocks of trials, cues directed attention to one tactile feature or indicated a divided attention strategy to a change in either feature. All attention conditions unambiguously activated several somatosensory foci in the parietal cortex, including somatotopically appropriate portions of the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus (S1) and the secondary somatosensory region (S2) within parietal opercular regions. There was no evidence for separate processing foci for selective and divided attention strategies, or for selectively attending to roughness versus stimulus duration. We observed a greater magnitude blood flow change in S2 versus S1 during attention tasks, which suggests that S2 might actually influence S1 activity. Despite these differences, modulation of S1 and S2 supports concepts of early selection in tactile attention. There were also examples of non-sensory foci in frontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and bilateral superior parietal regions at the fundus of the postcentral sulcus. Posterior parietal regions observed in this study did not overlap foci seen in studies of visual attention. Thus, the posterior parietal region may be subdivided into modality-specific subregions, each of which processes information needed to attend to a specific modality. These non-sensory areas may constitute a network that provides a source of modulating influences on the earlier stage, sensory areas.', 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 94, 'citationCount': 210, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2140424472', 'name': 'H.

The later components of SI response (latency 37.7 and 67.9 ms) were enhanced by rarely presented stimuli (stimulus deviancy) during passive and active attention.

Cryostat sections from a dorsomedial region of the postcentral gyrus close to the interhemispheric fissure and from a ventrolateral region close to the Sylvian fissure were examined. Neurotransmitter-binding sites were analyzed with quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Different muscarinic-binding sites were labeled with [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]oxotremorine-M, noradrenergic-binding sites with [3H]prazosin, different serotoninergic-binding sites with [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine and [3H]ketanserine, glutamate-binding sites with l-[3H]glutamate, and GABA-binding sites with [3H]muscimol. Adjacent sections were stained with a modified Nissl method for cytoarchitectonic analysis. The binding sites either were preferentially localized in the superficial layers ([3H]5-hydroxytryptamine, [3H]prazosin, l-[3H]glutamate, [3H]muscimol, and [3H]pirenzepine) or were more homogeneously distributed with highest densities in layers III-V ([3H]oxotremorine-M and [3H]ketanserine). Changes in the distribution patterns of [3H]oxotremorine-M- and [3H]ketanserine-binding sites precisely matched the borders between areas 4/3a, 3b/1, and 1/2, as defined cytoarchitectonically. In addition, the autoradiographs showed that area 1 possibly consists of two subregions which cannot be distinguished cytoarchitectonically. The results demonstrate that the regional and laminar distribution patterns of some, but not all, transmitter-binding sites are precisely correlated with the cytoarchitectonic parcelation of the human primary somatosensory cortex. In addition, binding sites may reveal new borders not detectable in Nissl-stained sections. Finally, the human primary somatosensory cortex differs clearly from the primary motor cortex due to higher densities of l-[3H]glutamate-, [3H]muscimol-, [3H]pirenzepine-, [3H]oxotremorine-M-, and [3H]ketanserine-binding sites.', 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 95, 'citationCount': 132, 'authors': [{'authorId': '152321010', 'name': 'S.

The relationship between symptom intensity and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF; an index of neural activity) was subsequently examined in the group and in individual patients. The group showed significant positive correlations between symptom intensity and blood flow in the right inferior frontal gyrus, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus, and the left hippocampus and posterior cingulate gyrus. Negative correlations were evident in the right superior prefrontal cortex, and the temporoparietal junction, particularly on the right side. The pattern in single subjects was broadly similar, although individual differences in neural response were also observed. A graded relationship between symptom intensity and regional brain activity can thus be identified in obsessive–compulsive disorder.

Electro-physiological evidence points to concomitant involvement of prefrontal regions in automatic orienting to subliminal signals of fear, which may reflect innervation arising from brainstem arousal systems. To approximate blindsight in 22 healthy subjects, facial signals of fear were presented briefly (16.7 ms) and masked such that conscious detection was prevented. Results revealed that subliminal fear signals elicited activity in the brainstem region encompassing the superior colliculus and locus coeruleus, pulvinar and amygdala, and in fronto-temporal regions associated with orienting. These findings suggest that crude sensory input from the superior colliculo-pulvinar visual pathway to the amygdala may allow for sufficient appraisal of fear signals to innervate the locus coeruleus. The engagement of the locus coeruleus could explain the observation of diffuse fronto-temporal cortical activity, given its role in evoking collateral ascending noradrenergic efferents to the subcortical amygdala and prefrontal cortex.
