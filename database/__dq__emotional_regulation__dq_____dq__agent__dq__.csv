Research design: Feasibility study involving single case experimental design with two participants. Methods and procedures: TBI Express is an established program for improving social interactions between people with TBI and their CPs. To improve access to the program, we developed a modified version called TBIconneCT that can be delivered via videoconferencing. Two participants with TBI and their CPs completed TBIconneCT training. Outcome measures included exchange structure analysis of conversation samples, blinded ratings of conversation samples and self-report measures. Main outcomes and results: The study indicated positive change on blinded ratings of conversation and self-reported measures for both participants. Exchange structure analysis conducted on session-by-session data did not demonstrate treatment effects due to variability during baseline.

Social skills training groups have been developed to provide an evidence-based practice to target these difficulties. However, several barriers exist to implementing these groups within real-world settings, including community mental health clinics serving children with autism spectrum disorders. Our article identifies these barriers and poses potential solutions to overcoming these obstacles. Specifically, we share adaptations to the implementation of a social skills curriculum in order to meet the needs of an urban, underserved, economically challenged, and diverse population; tailor the curriculum to meet the individual needs of each participant; and facilitate generalization of the learned skills to different settings, most notably the school setting. Effectiveness of these adaptations was measured through assessing parent, teacher, and child perspective of social skills, emotion regulation skills, and anxiety at preintervention, postintervention, and follow-up time points. It is our hope that the adaptations implemented in this setting can be translated to inform social skills groups in other similar settings.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 4, 'authors': [{'authorId': '117942031', 'name': 'Jennifer S.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10‐session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods Sixty‐eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent‐, child‐, and clinician‐reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10‐week follow‐up. Results Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow‐up. Conclusions This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD.

One novel approach is to train parents to use evidence-based interventions for their child with ASD via telehealth. Pilot work examining the efficacy of one such program, ImPACT Online, demonstrated a high rate of parent program engagement, low attrition, and associated gains in parent learning and child social communication. Objective The objective of this study was to conduct an open trial of ImPACT Online to better understand its dissemination potential. Methods We examined the reach and representativeness of families who registered (n=36) compared to families who were referred (n=139) to the open trial for one referral site. We then compared the demographics of all families who enrolled in the open trial (n=112) to families who enrolled in one of two controlled trials of the same program (n=50). We also examined metrics of program engagement for the open and controlled trials, the relationship between program engagement and changes in parents’ intervention knowledge, and program evaluation for the participants in the open trial. Results In total, 25.8% (36/139) of the parents who were given information about the program at their child’s diagnostic feedback session registered with the program. The parents who enrolled in the open (OT) and controlled trials (CT), respectively, were similar in gender (OT: 84.8% (95/112); CT: 88% (44/50), female), marital status (OT: 80.4% (90/112) ; CT: 69.6% (32/46), married), education (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 54.0% (27/50), college degree or higher), and employment status (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 65.3% (32/49), employed outside the home). The child participants were similar in terms of gender (OT: 83.0% (93/112); CT: 76.0% (38/50), male) and race and ethnicity (OT: 38.4% (43/112); CT: 24.0% (12/50), minority). However, the mean chronological age of the child participants in the open trial group was significantly higher (Mean=60.0 months) than in the controlled trial group (Mean=43.0 months), with t160=5.22, P<.001. Parents in the open trial engaged with the program at a significantly lower rate than the controlled trial, F3,81=21.14, P<.001. Program engagement was significantly associated with gains in parent intervention knowledge across both the groups, beta=.41, t=2.43, P=.02. Participants in the open access trial evaluated the program highly, but several barriers were noted.

This is the first controlled trial examining video-teleconferencing to remotely deliver behavioral parent training to the home setting with a live therapist. Method: Racially/ethnically diverse children ages 3–5 years with disruptive behavior disorders, and their caregiver(s), using webcams and parent-worn Bluetooth earpieces, participated in a randomized trial comparing Internet-delivered parent–child interaction therapy (I-PCIT) versus standard clinic-based PCIT (N = 40). Major assessments were conducted at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Linear regressions and hierarchical linear modeling using maximum-likelihood estimation were used to analyze treatment satisfaction, diagnoses, symptoms, functioning, and burden to parents across conditions. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses found 70% and 55% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, showed “treatment response” after treatment, and 55% and 40% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, continued to show “treatment response” at 6-month follow-up. Both treatments had significant effects on children’s symptoms and burden to parents, and many effects were very large in magnitude. Most outcomes were comparable across conditions, except that the rate of posttreatment “excellent response” was significantly higher in I-PCIT than in clinic-based PCIT, and I-PCIT was associated with significantly fewer parent-perceived barriers to treatment than clinic-based PCIT. Both treatments were associated with positive engagement, treatment retention, and very high treatment satisfaction.

The supply of child and adolescent psychiatrists is insufficient for the number of children in need of services and is not anticipated to grow. This calls for novel approaches to mental health care. Telemental health (TMH) offers one approach to increase access. TMH programmes serving young people are developing rapidly and available studies demonstrate that these services are feasible, acceptable, sustainable and likely as effective as in-person services. TMH services are utilized in clinical settings to provide direct care and consultation to primary care providers (PCPs), as well as in non-traditional settings, such as schools, correctional facilities and the home. Delivery of services to young people through TMH requires several adjustments to practice with adults regarding the model of care, cultural values, participating adults, rapport-building, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Additional infrastructure accommodations at the patient site include space and staffing to conduct developmentally appropriate evaluations and treatment planning with parents, other providers, and community services. For TMH to optimally impact young people’s access to mental health care, collaborative models of care are needed to support PCPs as frontline mental health-care providers, thereby effectively expanding the child and adolescent mental health workforce.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 87, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7757965', 'name': 'Nicole Gloff'}, {'authorId': '6995270', 'name': 'Sean R LeNoue'}, {'authorId': '4857034', 'name': 'D.

This paper draws on information gathered from carers and adults with a disability living in a rural area in New South Wales (NSW), Australia to determine the extent to which people living in rural areas may receive a person-centred therapy service. Methods: As part of a larger study in rural NSW into the delivery of therapy services, focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 78 carers and 10 adults with a disability. Data were analysed using constant comparison and thematic analysis. Results: Three related themes emerged: (i) travelling to access therapy; (ii) waiting a long time to get therapy; and (iii) limited access to therapy past early childhood. The themes overlaid the problems of recruiting and retaining sufficient therapists to work in rural areas. Conclusions: Community-based rehabilitation principles offer possibilities for increasing person-centred therapy services. We propose a person-centred and place-based approach that builds on existing service delivery models in the region and involves four inter-related strategies aimed at reducing travel and waiting times and with applicability across the life course. Implications for Rehabilitation Therapy service delivery in rural and remote areas requires: Place-based and person centred strategies to build local capacity in communities. Responsive outreach programs working with individuals and local communities. Recognition of the need to support families who must travel to access remotely located specialist services. Innovative use of technology to supplement and enhance service delivery.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 93, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145984868', 'name': 'A.

Telemedicine increases access to psychological interventions by linking the child and the clinician using videoconferencing (VC). The current study evaluated an 8-week, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for childhood depression either face-to-face (F2F) or over VC. The telemedicine setup included two PC-based PictureTel systems at 128 kilibits per second (kbps). Success was defined by (1) decreasing depressive symptoms at similar rates in both the VC group and the F2F group and (2) demonstrating the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial in telemental health. Children were assessed for childhood depression using the mood section of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present Episode (K-SADS-P). Twenty-eight children were randomized to either F2F or VC treatment. The participants completed the K-SADS-P and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) at pre- and post-treatment. The CBT treatment across the two conditions was effective. The overall response rate based on post-evaluation with the K-SADS-P was 82%. For the CDI total score, both the Time and the Group by Time effects were significant (p < 0.05). The interaction effect reflected a faster rate of decline in the CDI total score for the VC group.

Boredom is considered as a main unpleasant emotional state at the workplace, which could lead to stress, depression and decreased well-being. Boredom is related to the situation at hand and may lead to decreased performance. We frame the situation by connecting socio-emotional and cognitive conflict and individual differences to shed light onto the function of boredom. We look at the relation of boredom to theoretically connected emotions and their regulation. We conducted an online experiment in a virtual workplace setting (N = 57). We induced a socio-emotional and cognitive conflict situation by using a socially interactive agent which shames participants. Individual differences were operationalised through social identity and self-consciousness. We tested how social identity (predictor) and self-consciousness (moderator) influence cognitive appraisal of threat (mediator) and boredom (outcome). The results revealed that self-consciousness moderates the effect of social identity on cognitive appraisal of threat which then mediates the effect of social identity on boredom.",2021,0,0,"{'name':

A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations. The school environment and the character of the friendly student also have the potential to be adapted for follow-up experiments on additional aspects of social emotion regulation for a variety of contexts.",2022,63,0,{'volume': '3'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-3.313366174697876, -2.7898108959198, -1.46319580078125, 3.06809663772583, 0.12631890177726746, 2.1955008506774902,

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR.

Animal and human studies on neural pathways underlying social buffering typically examined physiological reactions or regional brain activations. However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings.

This review seeks to advance a more nuanced approach to the study of the social processes associated with emotion regulation.

But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions.

An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 24, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2742204', 'name': 'B.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 102, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5983047', 'name': 'Dario Bombari'}, {'authorId': '2284257', 'name': 'M.

In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes."", 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 84, 'citationCount': 3713, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Social stress was elicited in 66 adolescent girls (Mage = 15 years) using a spontaneous public-speaking task. Mother-daughter dyads reported their relationship quality, and physical closeness was manipulated by having mothers either touch or not touch their daughter's hand during the performance.

It is thus relevant, though highly challenging, to develop computational models and artificial agents derived from psychological theories allowing investigators to explore and test hypotheses through simulations. This chapter reviews and discusses current modeling challenges and advances that are relevant to the understanding and simulation of affective social learning and the development of adaptive and motivated behaviors. The hope is that the chapter will encourage dialogue and the sharing of perspectives with developmental and clinical psychologists. The chapter emphasizes the importance of modeling the complex integration of multiple interacting mechanisms, including processes analogous to the imagination and subjective experience, in order to understand the development of appraisal, emotions, emotion regulation, and their roles in adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.",2022,0,0,{'name': 'The Oxford Handbook of Emotional

These can contribute to difficulties forming friendships and secondary challenges such as academic underachievement, depression, and substance use in adolescence. To be optimally successful, interventions typically require parents and teachers to have a shared understanding of a child’s social-emotional needs and use consistent support strategies across home and school environments. However, research is yet to examine the effect that clinic-based programs have on parent-teacher agreement regarding children’s social-emotional functioning. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first published study to explore this. A sample of eighty-nine youth (aged 8 to 12 years) with ASD, ADHD, and/or an Anxiety Disorder participated in the Secret Agent Society Program. The Social Skills Questionnaire and Emotion Regulation and Social Skills Questionnaire were administered to parents and teachers at pre-program, post-program, and six-month follow-up. Parent-teacher agreement was assessed at each time point. Pearson Product Moment correlations and intraclass correlations indicated that parent-teacher agreement on the measures of children’s social-emotional functioning improved over time. These findings suggest that clinic-based programs can contribute to key stakeholders developing a shared understanding of children’s social-emotional needs. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.",2023,33,0,"{'name': 'Behavioral Sciences', 'volume': '13'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

In particular, self-control is a construct that has been shown to predict academic outcomes, though much debate on this point exists. Although largely unexamined, inconsistent findings could stem from the fact that related surveys are often scored by multiple raters (e.g., teachers and parents), especially when administered at a young age when students cannot respond to items themselves. Yet little is known about (a) how much parent and teacher self-control ratings overlap and (b) what student characteristics like race and socioeconomic status are associated with inconsistencies. In this study, we use data from a widely used measure of early self-control with parent and teacher forms. We use these data to examine the impact of rater discrepancies on our understanding of students' self-control. Results show relatively low agreement between parents and teachers, with some evidence that discrepancies are associated with student race.

This prospective longitudinal study included 2,121 children, ages 3–5 at baseline, from the general population in a mid-sized Swedish municipality. Results show both stability and change in social skills. Stable low social skills increased the risk for poor school performance, while stable high social skills increased the chance for good school performance in primary school. With some notable gender differences, both individual and family factors were significant predictors of stable low and stable high paths of social skills during early childhood. Practice or Policy: Whether the goal is to improve children’s social skills or their performance in school, this study provides important clues for prevention. We identified several potential targets for interventions to promote early social skills development, which may in turn promote positive school performance. It is also notable that there seem to be gender differences in which factors are important, indicating the need for gender-differentiated interventions.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 106, 'citationCount': 8, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3622477', 'name': 'Louise Frogner'}, {'authorId': '31668727', 'name': 'Karin Hellfeldt'}, {'authorId': '1381339096', 'name': 'Anna-Karin Ångström'}, {'authorId': '3882921', 'name': 'Anna-Karin Andershed'}, {'authorId': '32524433', 'name': 'Å.

However, substantial disagreement has been found between informants. Specifically, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tend to overestimate their competencies, also known as “positive (illusionary) bias.” This study compared parent, teacher, and adolescent ratings of ADHD and other behavioral symptoms in a sample of 114 adolescents with ADHD. Further, the effect of cross-informant disagreement (CID) on treatment outcomes was investigated in a subsample of 54 adolescents who had undergone a training and coaching intervention. Overall, there was moderate agreement among informants. Parent and adolescent ratings were more strongly correlated with each other than with teacher ratings. The strongest discrepancy was found between teacher and adolescent ratings on prosocial behavior.

During this pandemic, where students are confined to their homes with limited guidance from teachers, this chatbot provides a human-like interface that can solve academic queries of students, thus encouraging students to learn in an interesting manner. This paper demonstrates and presents the design and development of Student Chatbot software integrated with a user website that handles students' queries through defined intents. The paper covers the chatbot system with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for dealing language part, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with the image part, Dialogflow, illustrating with precision the intent and entity representation and keyword matching techniques used by introducing an artificial brain into “Web-Based Bot”. The aim to have a balanced user interface that is easy to access and customized to all target users. Also two Visual Question Answering chatbots ie visualdialog.cloudcv and CloudCV are compared to find which performs better.

However, which of these “big three” health behaviors most strongly predicts mental health and well-being, and their higher-order relationships in predictive models, is less known. This study investigated the differential and higher-order associations between sleep, physical activity, and dietary factors as predictors of mental health and well-being in young adults. Method In a cross-sectional survey design, 1,111 young adults (28.4% men) ages 18–25 from New Zealand and the United States answered an online survey measuring typical sleep quantity and quality; physical activity; and consumption of raw and processed fruit and vegetables, fast food, sweets, and soda, along with extensive covariates (including demographics, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, and health conditions) and the outcome measures of depressive symptoms [measured by the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D)] and well-being (measured by the Flourishing Scale). Results Controlling for covariates, sleep quality was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms and well-being, followed by sleep quantity and physical activity. Only one dietary factor—raw fruit and vegetable consumption—predicted greater well-being but not depressive symptoms when controlling for covariates. There were some higher-order interactions among health behaviors in predicting the outcomes, but these did not survive cross-validation. Conclusion Sleep quality is an important predictor of mental health and well-being in young adults, whereas physical activity and diet are secondary but still significant factors. Although strictly correlational, these patterns suggest that future interventions could prioritize sleep quality to maximize mental health and well-being in young adults.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 70, 'citationCount': 45, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2034055971', 'name': 'S.

With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 101, 'citationCount': 211, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46217950', 'name': 'A.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise.

After reviewing some literature related to retrieval process, repetition is one effective way to promote retrieval process. Since repeated encounters of the words facilitate the students to access the words-related information in their mind, repetition activity will be the effective solution for this context. The spaced repetition as proposed by Baddley (1990) can be appropriate for this context since learners will not be bored about the repetition.

Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on consumers or healthcare professionals; involved a conversational agent using any unconstrained natural language input; and reported evaluation measures resulting from user interaction with the system. Studies were screened by independent reviewers and Cohen’s kappa measured inter-coder agreement. Results The database search retrieved 1513 citations; 17 articles (14 different conversational agents) met the inclusion criteria. Dialogue management strategies were mostly finite-state and frame-based (6 and 7 conversational agents, respectively); agent-based strategies were present in one type of system. Two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was cross-sectional, and the remaining were quasi-experimental. Half of the conversational agents supported consumers with health tasks such as self-care. The only RCT evaluating the efficacy of a conversational agent found a significant effect in reducing depression symptoms (effect size d\u2009=\u20090.44, p\u2009=\u2009.04). Patient safety was rarely evaluated in the included studies. Conclusions The use of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities for health-related purposes is an emerging field of research, where the few published studies were mainly quasi-experimental, and rarely evaluated efficacy or safety. Future studies would benefit from more robust experimental designs and standardized reporting.

However, current findings are lacking as to whether the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and cortical regions are involved in the learning effect when subjects retrieve associative memory, and whether their activations differentially change over time due to learning experience. To address these issues, we designed an fMRI experiment in which face-scene pairs were learned once (L1) or six times (L6). Subjects learned the pairs at four retention intervals, 30-min, 1-day, 1-week and 1-month, after which they finished an associative recognition task in the scanner. The results showed that compared to learning once, learning six times led to stronger activation in the hippocampus, but weaker activation in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as well as anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC). In addition, the hippocampal activation was positively correlated with that of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and negatively correlated with that of the vLPFC when the L6 group was compared to the L1 group. The hippocampal activation decreased over time after L1 but remained stable after L6.

Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10‐session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods Sixty‐eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent‐, child‐, and clinician‐reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10‐week follow‐up. Results Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow‐up. Conclusions This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD. Additional investigations are needed to further establish its relative efficacy compared to more traditional models of CBT for children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 80, 'citationCount': 99, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2150018495', 'name': 'J.

However, until recently, the impact of emotion regulation difficulties for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received little attention. We investigated emotion regulation difficulties from the perspective of those who would experience the sequelae. This included parents, teachers, and psychologists. Method Seven focus groups with parents, teachers, and psychologists, and 7 interviews with adolescents and young adults with ASD were conducted. Results Across the groups, participants discussed their triggers of distressing emotions, difficulties with emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and the consequences of their distressing emotions.

We report on interviews with 27 parents and a diary study with a separate 28 families examining these transitions. These families turn on screens primarily to facilitate parents' independent activities. Parents feel this is appropriate but self-audit and express hesitation, as they feel they are benefiting from an activity that can be detrimental to their child's well-being. We found that families turn off screens when parents are ready to give their child their full attention and technology presents a natural stopping point. Transitioning away from screens is often painful, and predictive factors determine the pain of a transition.

The role that storytelling played, even before the discovery of writing, in the diffusion of knowledge, in the construction of interpersonal relationships and in the birth of new societies, is well known. Without doubt writing is the earliest “technology” invented by man, through which culture and knowledge have been passed down over time, after having been transmitted orally for a long time. According to Barthes and Duisit (1975), in fact, storytelling begins with the same story of the human race, almost as if to represent an ontogenetically distinctive trait of the species, which unites homo sapiens with the homo digitalis of today’s society (Montag & Diefenbach, 2018). Other authors (Kenyon et al., 1996) argue that men and women not only have stories to tell, but that they are the stories they tell.

6,6,6,6,8,ba07c5f29871ce669a0a3493c351e29255ca252a,The boomerang effect: How nurses’ regulation of patients’ affect associates with their own emotional exhaustion and affective experiences.,"Recent research has shown that the intentional regulation of others’ affect has effects not only on the target (e.g., a patient) of the regulation, but also on the agent (e.g., a nurse). In particular, the use of intentional interpersonal affect regulation strategies has been found to predict employees’ emotional exhaustion (EEx). Use of affect-worsening strategies is associated with an increase in EEx, whereas the effect of using affect-improving strategies is less clear. Another relevant consequence of interpersonal affect regulation is its effect on affective experiences, which is one of the main determinants of job attitudes. This study tests the relationships between the interpersonal affect regulation strategies that nurses use to regulate their patients’ affect and the nurses’ EEx and affective experiences. A longitudinal 2-wave field study was conducted in sample of nurses. Participants completed a questionnaire on 2 different occasions, 2 months apart (Time 1 [T1], Time 2 [T2]). Of the 141 participants at T1, 103 also completed the survey at T2. Longitudinal hierarchical regression analyses showed that using affect-worsening strategies was a significant predictor of nurse’s EEx, whereas using affect-improving strategies did not significantly predict their EEx. For affective experiences, use of affect-worsening strategies was related to nurses experiencing low-activation negative affect (e.g., feeling depressed); whereas affect-improving strategies was related to them experiencing low-activation positive affect (e.g., feeling calm). Results support the view that intentional regulation of patients’ affect needs to be considered not only in relation to the patients’ perception of service quality but also from the perspective of nurses’ well-being.",2016,0,15,"{'name': 'International Journal of Stress Management', 'pages': '1-13', 'volume': '25'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-3.2190184593200684, -2.0822982788085938,

7,7,7,7,9,d5f2245011dfd06236544f0dcce492722d476ae9,Emergent behaviours in multi-agent systems with Evolutionary Game Theory,"The mechanisms of emergence and evolution of collective behaviours in dynamical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) of multiple interacting agents, with diverse behavioral strategies in co-presence, have been undergoing mathematical study via Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT). Their systematic study also resorts to agent-based modelling and simulation (ABM) techniques, thus enabling the study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters, and alternative virtual games. This paper summarises some main research directions and challenges tackled in our group, using methods from EGT and ABM. These range from the introduction of cognitive and emotional mechanisms into agents’ implementation in an evolving MAS, to the cost-efficient interference for promoting prosocial behaviours in complex networks, to the regulation and governance of AI safety development ecology, and to the equilibrium analysis of random evolutionary multi-player games. This brief aims to sensitize the reader to EGT based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines and the engineering of prosocial behaviours in dynamical MAS, with impact on our understanding of the emergence and stability of collective behaviours. In all cases, important open problems in MAS research as viewed or prioritised by the group are described.",2022,54,9,{'name': 'AI Communications'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

Here, we develop a theory of participation and compliance with respect to an explicit commitment formation process and to institutional incentives where individuals, at first, decide whether or not to join a cooperative agreement to play a one-shot social dilemma game. Using a mathematical model, we determine whether and when participating in a costly commitment, and complying with it, is an evolutionarily stable strategy, resulting in high levels of cooperation. We show that, given a sufficient budget for providing incentives, rewarding of commitment compliant behaviours better promotes cooperation than punishment of non-compliant ones. Moreover, by sparing part of this budget for rewarding those willing to participate in a commitment, the overall level of cooperation can be significantly enhanced for both reward and punishment.

This process is costly, and it is thus important to optimize the overall spending. This problem can be mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem where one wishes to minimize the cost of providing incentives while ensuring a minimum level of cooperation, sustained over time. Prior works that consider this question usually omit the stochastic effects that drive population dynamics. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of this optimization problem, in a finite population and stochastic setting, studying both pairwise and multi-player cooperation dilemmas. We prove the regularity of the cost functions for providing incentives over time, characterize their asymptotic limits (infinite population size, weak selection and large selection) and show exactly when reward or punishment is more cost efficient. We show that these cost functions exhibit a phase transition phenomenon when the intensity of selection varies. By determining the critical threshold of this phase transition, we provide exact calculations for the optimal cost of the incentive, for any given intensity of selection. Numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate analytical observations. Overall, our analysis provides for the first time a selection-dependent calculation of the optimal cost of institutional incentives (for both reward and punishment) that guarantees a minimum level of cooperation over time. It is of crucial importance for real-world applications of institutional incentives since the intensity of selection is often found to be non-extreme and specific for a given population.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 66, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35225892', 'name': 'M.

Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects. \n \n \nThis article is part of the special track on AI and Society. \n \n \n\xa0', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 66, 'citationCount': 27, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

This anxiety is further energised by an AI race narrative that makes people believe they might be missing out. Whether real or not, a belief in this narrative may be detrimental as some stake-holders will feel obliged to cut corners on safety precautions, or ignore societal consequences just to “win”. Starting from a baseline model that describes a broad class of technology races where winners draw a significant benefit compared to others (such as AI advances, patent race, pharmaceutical technologies), we investigate here how positive (rewards) and negative (punishments) incentives may beneficially influence the outcomes. We uncover conditions in which punishment is either capable of reducing the development speed of unsafe participants or has the capacity to reduce innovation through over-regulation. Alternatively, we show that, in several scenarios, rewarding those that follow safety measures may increase the development speed while ensuring safe choices. Moreover, in the latter regimes, rewards do not suffer from the issue of over-regulation as is the case for punishment.

This in turn has spurred debate on the social responsibilities of large technology companies to serve the interests of society at large. In response, ethical principles and codes of conduct have been proposed to meet the escalating demand for this responsibility to be taken seriously. As yet, however, few institutional innovations have been suggested to translate this responsibility into legal commitments which apply to companies positioned to reap large financial gains from the development and use of AI. This paper offers one potentially attractive tool for addressing such issues: the Windfall Clause, which is an ex ante commitment by AI firms to donate a significant amount of any eventual extremely large profits. By this we mean an early commitment that profits that a firm could not earn without achieving fundamental, economically transformative breakthroughs in AI capabilities will be donated to benefit humanity broadly, with particular attention towards mitigating any downsides from deployment of windfall-generating AI.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 267, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1435765036', 'name': ""Cullen O'Keefe""}, {'authorId': '119127731', 'name': 'P.

Pro-social behavior occurs when people and agents perform costly actions that benefit others. Acts such as helping others voluntarily, donating to charity, providing informations or sharing resources, are all forms of pro-social behavior. We discuss two questions that challenge a purely utilitarian view of human decision making and contextualize its role in hybrid societies: i) What are the conditions and mechanisms that lead societies of agents and humans to be more pro-social? ii) How can we engineer autonomous entities (agents and robots) that lead to more altruistic and cooperative behaviors in a hybrid society? We propose using social simulations, game theory, population dynamics, and studies with people in virtual or real environments (with robots) where both agents and humans interact. This research will constitute the basis for establishing the foundations for the new field of Pro-social Computing, aiming at understanding, predicting and promoting pro-sociality among humans, through artificial agents and multiagent systems.\n \n', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 53, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145136631', 'name': 'Ana Paiva'}, {'authorId': '144438218', 'name': 'F.

However, whenever antisocial punishment, whereby defectors punish cooperators, is available, this antisocial behavior outperforms social punishment, leading to the destruction of cooperation. In this paper, we use evolutionary game theory to show that this antisocial behavior can be efficiently restrained by relying on prior commitments, wherein agents can arrange, prior to an interaction, agreements regarding posterior compensation by those who dishonor the agreements. We show that, although the commitment mechanism by itself can guarantee a notable level of cooperation, a significantly higher level is achieved when both mechanisms, those of proposing prior commitments and of punishment, are available in co-presence. Interestingly, social punishment prevails and dominates in this system as it can take advantage of the commitment mechanism to cope with antisocial behaviors. That is, establishment of a commitment system helps to pave the way for the evolution of social punishment and abundant cooperation, even in the presence of antisocial punishment.\n \n', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

Providing incentives tends to be costly, so it is important to find effective and efficient policies for the combined use of rewards and penalties. Most studies of cooperation, however, have addressed rewarding and punishing in isolation and have focused on peer-to-peer sanctioning as opposed to institutional sanctioning. Here, we demonstrate that an institutional sanctioning policy we call ‘first carrot, then stick’ is unexpectedly successful in promoting cooperation. The policy switches the incentive from rewarding to punishing when the frequency of cooperators exceeds a threshold. We find that this policy establishes and recovers full cooperation at lower cost and under a wider range of conditions than either rewards or penalties alone, in both well-mixed and spatial populations. In particular, the spatial dynamics of cooperation make it evident how punishment acts as a ‘booster stage’ that capitalizes on and amplifies the pro-social effects of rewarding. Together, our results show that the adaptive hybridization of incentives offers the ‘best of both worlds’ by combining the effectiveness of rewarding in establishing cooperation with the effectiveness of punishing in recovering it, thereby providing a surprisingly inexpensive and widely applicable method of promoting cooperation.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 54, 'citationCount': 135, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3187743', 'name': 'Xiaojie Chen'}, {'authorId': '2110618737', 'name': 'Tatsuya Sasaki'}, {'authorId': '2781829', 'name': 'Å.

Intention recognition can also use past experience from a database of past interactions, not necessarily with the same agent. Bayesian Networks BN can be employed to dynamically summarize general statistical evidence, furnishing heuristic information to link with the situation specific information, about which logical reasoning can take place, and decisions made on actions to be performed, possibly involving actions to obtain new observations. This situated reasoning feeds into the BN to tune it, and back again into the logic component.

By equipping some individuals with the capacity of assessing the intentions of others in the course of a prototypical dilemma of cooperation—the repeated prisoner's dilemma—we show how intention recognition is favored by natural selection, opening a window of opportunity for cooperation to thrive. We introduce a new strategy (IR) that is able to assign an intention to the actions of opponents, on the basis of an acquired corpus consisting of possible plans achieving that intention, as well as to then make decisions on the basis of such recognized intentions. The success of IR is grounded on the free exploitation of unconditional cooperators while remaining robust against unconditional defectors.

Here we address explicitly this issue, characterizing the dynamics emerging from a population of intention recognizers. We derive a Bayesian network model for intention recognition in the context of repeated social dilemmas and evolutionary game theory, by assessing the internal dynamics of trust between intention recognizers and their opponents.

We find that decisions within small groups under high risk and stringent requirements to success significantly raise the chances of coordinating actions and escaping the tragedy of the commons. We also offer insights on the scale at which public goods problems of cooperation are best solved. Instead of large-scale endeavors involving most of the population, which as we argue, may be counterproductive to achieve cooperation, the joint combination of local agreements within groups that are small compared with the population at risk is prone to significantly raise the probability of success.

Human communication is grounded in fundamentally cooperative, even shared, intentions. In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.

Prior research applies text-based sentiment analysis and emotional response generation to improve CAs’ emotional intelligence. However, acoustic features in speech containing rich contexts are underexploited. In this work, we designed and implemented an emotionally aware CA, called HUE (Heard yoUr Emotion) that stylized responses with emotion regulation strategies and empathetic interjections. We conducted a user study with 75 participants to evaluate their perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) of HUE by having them observe conversations between people and HUE in different emotional scenarios. Our results show that participants’ PEI was significantly higher with the acoustic features than without.",2021,47,9,{'name': 'Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in

No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants’ comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM addresses the factor using three new mechanisms that respectively (1) models the high-level abstraction of emotion expressions by embedding emotion categories, (2) captures the change of implicit internal emotion states, and (3) uses explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary. Experiments show that the proposed model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion.\n \n', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 61, 'citationCount': 623, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144751955', 'name': 'Hao Zhou'}, {'authorId': '1730108', 'name': 'Minlie Huang'}, {'authorId': '50615630', 'name': 'Tianyang Zhang'}, {'authorId': '145213540', 'name': 'Xiaoyan Zhu'}, {'authorId': '2149124481', 'name': 'Bing-Qian Liu'}]}, {'paperId': 'b44b751db2b6f6ef662f517e9a01e055c6e337a8', 'title': 'Automatic speech emotion recognition using recurrent neural networks with local attention', 'abstract': 'Automatic emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task which relies heavily on the effectiveness of the speech features used for classification.

Further, mimicked participants who reported a priori negative feelings toward Palestinians expressed more sympathy toward their Palestinian virtual interaction partner, rated themselves as closer to him, and perceived the interaction as more harmonious compared to participants in a counter-mimicry condition.

Different strategies may be adopted to achieve successful emotion regulation, ranging from attentional control (e.g., distraction) to cognitive change (e.g., reappraisal). However, there is only scarce evidence comparing the different regulation strategies with respect to their neural mechanisms and their effects on emotional experience. We, therefore, directly compared reappraisal and distraction in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with emotional pictures. In the distraction condition participants performed an arithmetic task, while they reinterpreted the emotional situation during reappraisal to downregulate emotional intensity. Both strategies were successful in reducing subjective emotional state ratings and lowered activity in the bilateral amygdala. Direct contrasts, however, showed a stronger decrease in amygdala activity for distraction when compared with reappraisal. While both strategies relied on common control areas in the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex was selectively activated for reappraisal. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate and large clusters in the parietal cortex were active in the distraction condition. Functional connectivity patterns of the amygdala activation confirmed the roles of these specific activations for the 2 emotion regulation strategies.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 516, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2197918', 'name': 'P.

Metacognitive Events Classification in Human-Agent Interactions,"For an agent, either human or artificial, to show intelligent interactive behaviour implies assessments of the reliability of own and others’ thoughts, feelings and beliefs. Agents capable of these robust evaluations are able to adequately interpret their own and others’ cognitive and emotional processes, anticipate future actions, and improve their decision-making and interactive performances across domains and contexts. Reliable instruments to assess interlocutors’ mindful capacities for monitoring and regulation - metacognition - in human-agent interaction in real-time and continuously are of crucial importance however challenging to design. The presented study reports Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA) experiments in order to access and evaluate metacognitive dispositions and attitudes of participants in human-agent interactions. A typology of metacognitive events related to the ‘verbalized’ monitoring, interpretation, reflection and regulation activities observed in a multimodal dialogue has been designed, and serves as a valid tool to identify relation between participants’ behaviour analysed in terms of ISO 24617-2 compliant dialogue acts and the corresponding metacognitive indicators.",2022,37,0,,"{'model':

It can also be applied to others, in which case it is known as mentalizing. Both kinds of metacognition have implicit and explicit forms, where implicit means automatic and without awareness. Implicit metacognition enables us to adopt a we-mode, through which we automatically take account of the knowledge and intentions of others. Adoption of this mode enhances joint action. Explicit metacognition enables us to reflect on and justify our behaviour to others. However, access to the underlying processes is very limited for both self and others and our reports on our own and others' intentions can be very inaccurate. On the other hand, recent experiments have shown that, through discussions of our perceptual experiences with others, we can detect sensory signals more accurately, even in the absence of objective feedback. Through our willingness to discuss with others the reasons for our actions and perceptions, we overcome our lack of direct access to the underlying cognitive processes.

In this review, we consider progress in characterizing the neural and mechanistic basis of these related aspects of metacognition—confidence judgements and error monitoring—and identify crucial points of convergence between methods and theories in the two fields. This convergence suggests that common principles govern metacognitive judgements of confidence and accuracy; in particular, a shared reliance on post-decisional processing within the systems responsible for the initial decision. However, research in both fields has focused rather narrowly on simple, discrete decisions—reflecting the correspondingly restricted focus of current models of the decision process itself—raising doubts about the degree to which discovered principles will scale up to explain metacognitive evaluation of real-world decisions and actions that are fluid, temporally extended, and embedded in the broader context of evolving behavioural goals.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 463, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144927959', 'name': 'N.

Research over the past 20 years or so has revealed that many symptoms associated with schizophrenia can be interpreted as a result of poor “metacognition”, first defined as the ability to think about ones mental operations, which in our understanding more specifically refers to the ability to reflect upon mental states of oneself and others, and to flexibly entertain this knowledge in social interaction and problemsolving (termed “mastery”). The latter aspect implies that metacognitive dysfunction is putatively critical to explain social impairment. Method: The present article reviews the evidence for a link between metacognitive deficits in schizophrenia and poor social functioning. Results: Metacognition including its subcomponents such as self-reflectivity, empathetic perspective-taking and mastery are profoundly linked with awareness of illness and social functioning in schizophrenia. The impact of metacognition on awareness of illness and social functioning seems to be partially independent of neurocognitive functioning.

Two ideas seem to be prevalent in the literature concerning the notion of dimension: (1) dimensions correspond to different types of information; and (2) a dimension is formed by a set of mutually exclusive tags. In DAMSL, for instance, the terms \x93dimension\x94 and \x93layer\x94 are used sometimes in the sense of (1) and sometimes in that of (2). We argue that being mutually exclusive is not a good criterion for a set of dialogue act types to constitute a dimension, even though the description of an object in a multidimensional space should never assign more than one value per dimension. We define a dimension of dialogue act annotation as an aspect of participating in a dialogue that can be addressed independently by means of dialogue acts. We show that DAMSL dimensions such as Info-request, Statement, and Answer do not qualify as proper dimensions, and that the communicative functions in these categories do not fall in any specific dimension, but should be considered as \x93general-purpose\x94 in the sense that they can be used in any dimension.

MARTINEZ is an associate professor in the Department of Education at the University of California, Irvine. THE DISCOVERY and theoretical elaboration of metacognition constitute a major breakthrough in recent decades of cognitive research. While it is always best to begin with definitions, a concept as complex as metacognition demands that our initial definition be provisional. This definition will become more detailed and complete as our understanding grows. Many teachers would describe metacognition, quite acceptably, as ""thinking about thinking."" But I would propose a more precise definition: metacognition is the monitoring and control of thought. In this article, I seek to clarify the concept of metacognition and to present ideas about how metacognitive ability can be taught. Metacognition serves many diverse functions, as does language. Consider what the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein had to say about language: ""Think of the tools in a tool-box: There is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails, and screws. The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects."" (1) The toolbox is an equally apt metaphor for metacognition. To give a sense of the breadth of metacognitive functioning, I have identified three major categories of metacognition: metamemory and metacomprehension, problem solving, and critical thinking. While this simple taxonomy does not exhaust the many types of metacognition, it does communicate the broad role of the process in important cognitive endeavors. Metamemory and metacomprehension. I have grouped these two concepts together because both refer to an understanding of one\'s own knowledge state. To grasp metamemory, think about being asked if you are able to name the planets of our solar system in order of their distance from the sun. Now, you either can or cannot do so. But your answer to the question might be yes or no in either case. That is, you can be accurate or inaccurate in your appraisal of your own knowledge. Is this accuracy important? Yes, it is. Research has shown that this self-insight has predictive power for subsequent learning. (2) Metacomprehension is a similar concept with similar importance to learning. Comprehension during reading or listening can be either good or poor. But independent of learners\' true comprehension is whether they realize that their comprehension is good or poor. This appraisal can sometimes be very inaccurate. You can easily imagine a student reading a textbook page and not understanding it--and moreover not realizing that he does not understand it. Believing that one understands when one does not is a serious and common error. But even more serious is when students don\'t even consider whether they comprehend but simply take notes or read mechanically. Problem solving. This almost exclusively human pursuit is a significant category of cognitive activity. Problem solving is exercised daily, often continuously, especially in a complex society where following established rules and procedures is not enough to succeed. Problem solving can be defined simply as the pursuit of a goal when the path to that goal is uncertain. In other words, it\'s what you do when you don\'t know what you\'re doing. Scientific research is a form of problem solving; so is teaching. Neither of these enterprises is algorithmic. Both involve continuously generating possibilities, weighing those options, exploring subsets of options, and evaluating the results. Herbert Simon used the metaphor of finding your way through a maze to describe this process. Problem solving certainly involves cognition. But more is required: constantly stepping back mentally to appraise and rework plans by asking such questions as, What am I trying to accomplish? What are the most promising pathways? Is my strategy working? Critical thinking. Like problem solving, critical thinking encompasses a lot of what human beings do--or at least potentially can do. …', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 4, 'citationCount': 352, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144950035', 'name': 'Michael E.

The two experimental studies replicated in different learning domains the classic study of Sylva, Bruner and Genova (1976), which contrasted the problem-solving performance of 3- to 5-year-old children who had experienced a ‘taught’ and ‘play’ condition.Evidence from the present studies reported and other studies supports the view that play, and particularly pretence or symbolic play, which might be with objects or other children, is particularly significant in its contribution to the development of children as metacognitively skilful, self-regulated learners. Evidence from the observational study indicated that child-initiated playful activities, in small groups without adult supervision, supported the greatest proportion of self-regulatory behaviours. The experimental studies suggested that the experience of the ‘play’ condition was particularly effective in preparing the children for effortful, problem-solving or creative tasks which require a high level of metacognitive and self-regulatory skill.Metacognitive and self-regulatory development is crucially important in the development of academic skills which involve intentional learning, problem-solving and creativity. An understanding of the relationship between pretend or symbolic play and self-regulation is also helpful in providing clear guidelines for adults working with young children as regards their role in supporting and encouraging play in educational contexts.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 143, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2113522', 'name': 'D.

Metacognition refers to higher order thinking that involves active control over the cognitive processes engaged in learning. Because metacognition plays a critical role in successful learning, it is important to study metacognitive activity and development to determine how students can be taught to apply their cognitive resources through metacognitive control. The term ""metacognition"" is most often associated with John Flavell (1979), who proposed that metacognition consists of both metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive experiences or regulation. Flavell further divides metacognitive knowledge into knowledge of person variables, task variables, and strategy variables. Most definitions of metacognition include both knowledge and strategy components. Most individuals of normal intelligence engage in metacognitive regulation when confronted with an effortful cognitive task, but some are more metacognitive than others. The most effective approaches to metacognitive instruction involve providing the learner with both knowledge of cognitive processes and strategies and experience or practice in using both cognitive and metacognitive strategies. The study of metacognition has important implications for instructional intervention. (Contains 16 references.)

Although the focus of this chapter is on the metacognitive aspects of learning and memory -which throughout the chapter will be called metammoryboth the overall approach and many of the points apply as well to other aspects of cognition. Emphasis is placed on some shortcomings in previous research on memory that have been commented on by several prominent investigators. It is to those investigators' credit that they stepped back from their specific investigations to take stock of the overall progress in the field and to highlight problems.

The older subjects studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were, that is, they showed perfect recall. The younger children studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were not. In another study, elementary school children were asked to help the experimenter evaluate the communicative adequacy of verbal instructions, indicating any omissions and obscurities (Markman, 1977). Although the instructions were riddled with blatant omissions and obscurities, the younger subjects were surprisingly poor at detecting them. They incorrectly thought they had understood and could follow the instructions, much as their counterparts in the study by Flavell et al. (1970) incorrectly thought they had memorized and could recall the items. Results such as these have suggested that young children are quite limited in their knowledge and cognition about cognitive phenomena, or in their metacognition, and do relatively little monitoring of their own memory, comprehension, and other cognitive enterprises (see, e.g., Brown, 1978; Flavell, 1978; Flavell & Wellman, 1977; Kreutzer, Leonard, & Flavell, 1975; Flavell, Note 1, Note 2, Note 3; Markman, Note 4).

Their systematic study also resorts to agent-based modelling and simulation (ABM) techniques, thus enabling the study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters, and alternative virtual games. This paper summarises some main research directions and challenges tackled in our group, using methods from EGT and ABM. These range from the introduction of cognitive and emotional mechanisms into agents' implementation in an evolving MAS, to the cost-efficient interference for promoting prosocial behaviours in complex networks, to the regulation and governance of AI safety development ecology, and to the equilibrium analysis of random evolutionary multi-player games. This brief aims to sensitize the reader to EGT based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines and the engineering of prosocial behaviours in dynamical MAS, with impact on our understanding of the emergence and stability of collective behaviours. In all cases, important open problems in MAS research as viewed or prioritised by the group are described.",2022,88,0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2205.07369'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

All agents have a tag, and they gain or lose trust in other tags as they interact with other agents. This trust in different tags determines their trust in other players and groups. In contrast to other models in the literature, our model does not use tags to determine the cooperation/defection decisions of the agents, but rather their migration decisions. Agents decide whether to cooperate or defect based purely on social learning (i.e. imitation from others). Agents use information about tags and their trust in tags to determine how much they trust a particular group of agents and whether they want to migrate to that group. Comprehensive experiments show that the model can promote high levels of cooperation and trust under different game scenarios, and that curbing the migration decisions of agents can negatively impact both cooperation and trust in the system. We also observed that trust becomes scarce in the system as the diversity of tags increases.

Yet it is not clear what mechanisms might underlie the participation in and compliance with such a commitment, especially when participation is costly and non-compliance can be profitable. Here, we develop a theory of participation and compliance with respect to an explicit commitment formation process and to institutional incentives where individuals, at first, decide whether or not to join a cooperative agreement to play a one-shot social dilemma game. Using a mathematical model, we determine whether and when participating in a costly commitment, and complying with it, is an evolutionarily stable strategy, resulting in high levels of cooperation. We show that, given a sufficient budget for providing incentives, rewarding of commitment compliant behaviours better promotes cooperation than punishment of non-compliant ones. Moreover, by sparing part of this budget for rewarding those willing to participate in a commitment, the overall level of cooperation can be significantly enhanced for both reward and punishment. Finally, the presence of mistakes in deciding to participate favours evolutionary stability of commitment compliance and cooperation.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 86, 'citationCount': 16, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34751767', 'name': 'T.

This process is costly, and it is thus important to optimize the overall spending. This problem can be mathematically formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem where one wishes to minimize the cost of providing incentives while ensuring a minimum level of cooperation, sustained over time. Prior works that consider this question usually omit the stochastic effects that drive population dynamics. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of this optimization problem, in a finite population and stochastic setting, studying both pairwise and multi-player cooperation dilemmas. We prove the regularity of the cost functions for providing incentives over time, characterize their asymptotic limits (infinite population size, weak selection and large selection) and show exactly when reward or punishment is more cost efficient. We show that these cost functions exhibit a phase transition phenomenon when the intensity of selection varies. By determining the critical threshold of this phase transition, we provide exact calculations for the optimal cost of the incentive, for any given intensity of selection. Numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate analytical observations. Overall, our analysis provides for the first time a selection-dependent calculation of the optimal cost of institutional incentives (for both reward and punishment) that guarantees a minimum level of cooperation over time. It is of crucial importance for real-world applications of institutional incentives since the intensity of selection is often found to be non-extreme and specific for a given population.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 66, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35225892', 'name': 'M.

Whether real or not, the belief in such a race for domain supremacy through AI, can make it real simply from its consequences, as put forward by the Thomas theorem. These consequences may be negative, as racing for technological supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders to underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures. As a consequence, different actors are urging to consider both the normative and social impact of these technological advancements, contemplating the use of the precautionary principle in AI innovation and research. Yet, given the breadth and depth of AI and its advances, it is difficult to assess which technology needs regulation and when. As there is no easy access to data describing this alleged AI race, theoretical models are necessary to understand its potential dynamics, allowing for the identification of when procedures need to be put in place to favour outcomes beneficial for all. We show that, next to the risks of setbacks and being reprimanded for unsafe behaviour, the time-scale in which domain supremacy can be achieved plays a crucial role. When this can be achieved in a short term, those who completely ignore the safety precautions are bound to win the race but at a cost to society, apparently requiring regulatory actions. Our analysis reveals that imposing regulations for all risk and timing conditions may not have the anticipated effect as only for specific conditions a dilemma arises between what is individually preferred and globally beneficial. Similar observations can be made for the long-term development case. Yet different from the short-term situation, conditions can be identified that require the promotion of risk-taking as opposed to compliance with safety regulations in order to improve social welfare. These results remain robust both when two or several actors are involved in the race and when collective rather than individual setbacks are produced by risk-taking behaviour. When defining codes of conduct and regulatory policies for applications of AI, a clear understanding of the time-scale of the race is thus required, as this may induce important non-trivial effects. \n \n \nThis article is part of the special track on AI and Society. \n \n \n\xa0', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 66, 'citationCount': 27, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

This anxiety is further energised by an AI race narrative that makes people believe they might be missing out. Whether real or not, a belief in this narrative may be detrimental as some stake-holders will feel obliged to cut corners on safety precautions, or ignore societal consequences just to “win”. Starting from a baseline model that describes a broad class of technology races where winners draw a significant benefit compared to others (such as AI advances, patent race, pharmaceutical technologies), we investigate here how positive (rewards) and negative (punishments) incentives may beneficially influence the outcomes. We uncover conditions in which punishment is either capable of reducing the development speed of unsafe participants or has the capacity to reduce innovation through over-regulation. Alternatively, we show that, in several scenarios, rewarding those that follow safety measures may increase the development speed while ensuring safe choices. Moreover, in the latter regimes, rewards do not suffer from the issue of over-regulation as is the case for punishment.

Establishing a prior commitment or agreement in terms of posterior benefits and consequences from those engaging in it provides an important mechanism for securing cooperation. Resorting to methods from Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT), here we analyse how prior commitments can also be adopted as a tool for enhancing coordination when its outcomes exhibit an asymmetric payoff structure, in both pairwise and multi-party interactions. Arguably, coordination is more complex to achieve than cooperation since there might be several desirable collective outcomes in a coordination problem (compared to mutual cooperation, the only desirable collective outcome in cooperation dilemmas). Our analysis, both analytically and via numerical simulations, shows that whether prior commitment would be a viable evolutionary mechanism for enhancing coordination and the overall population social welfare strongly depends on the collective benefit and severity of competition, and more importantly, how asymmetric benefits are resolved in a commitment deal. Moreover, in multi-party interactions, prior commitments prove to be crucial when a high level of group diversity is required for optimal coordination. The results are robust for different selection intensities.

As yet, however, few institutional innovations have been suggested to translate this responsibility into legal commitments which apply to companies positioned to reap large financial gains from the development and use of AI. This paper offers one potentially attractive tool for addressing such issues: the Windfall Clause, which is an ex ante commitment by AI firms to donate a significant amount of any eventual extremely large profits.

We discuss two questions that challenge a purely utilitarian view of human decision making and contextualize its role in hybrid societies: i) What are the conditions and mechanisms that lead societies of agents and humans to be more pro-social? ii) How can we engineer autonomous entities (agents and robots) that lead to more altruistic and cooperative behaviors in a hybrid society? We propose using social simulations, game theory, population dynamics, and studies with people in virtual or real environments (with robots) where both agents and humans interact.

To achieve this goal, analytical and numerical methods from evolutionary game theory are employed to identify the conditions for which enhanced cooperation emerges within the context of the iterated prisoners dilemma. Guilt is modelled explicitly as two features, i.e. a counter that keeps track of the number of transgressions and a threshold that dictates when alleviation (through for instance apology and self-punishment) is required for an emotional agent. Such an alleviation introduces an effect on the payoff of the agent experiencing guilt. We show that when the system consists of agents that resolve their guilt without considering the co-player's attitude towards guilt alleviation then cooperation does not emerge. In that case those guilt prone agents are easily dominated by agents expressing no guilt or having no incentive to alleviate the guilt they experience. When, on the other hand, the guilt prone focal agent requires that guilt only needs to be alleviated when guilt alleviation is also manifested by a defecting co-player, then cooperation may thrive. This observation remains consistent for a generalised model as is discussed in this article.

Friedman was focused on the infrastructure of communications and technology-the new web-based platform that allows business to follow the hunt for lower costs, higher value and greater efficiency around the planet seemingly oblivious to the boundaries of nation states. Hadfield peels back this technological platform to look at the 'structure that lies beneath'--our legal infrastructure, the platform of rules about who can do what, when and how. Often taken for granted, economic growth throughout human history has depended at least as much on the evolution of new systems of rules to support ever-more complex modes of cooperation and trade as it has on technological innovation. When Google rolled out YouTube in over one hundred countries around the globe simultaneously, for example, it faced not only the challenges of technology but also the staggering problem of how to build success in the context of a bewildering and often conflicting patchwork of nation-state-based laws and legal systems affecting every aspect of the business-contract, copyright, encryption, censorship, advertising and more. Google is not alone. A study presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2011 found that for global firms, the number one challenge of the modern economy is increasing complexity, and the number one source of complexity is law. Today, even our startups, the engines of economic growth, are global from Day One. Put simply, the law and legal methods on which we currently rely have failed to evolve along with technology. They are increasingly unable to cope with the speed, complexity, and constant border-crossing of our new globally inter-connected environment. Our current legal systems are still rooted in the politics-based nation state platform on which the industrial revolution was built. Hadfield argues that even though these systems supported fantastic growth over the past two centuries, today they are too slow, costly, cumbersome and localized to support the exponential rise in economic complexity they fostered. While everything else in the economy strives to become cheaper, sleeker and faster, our outdated approach to law hampers the invention of new products, the development of new business models, the structuring of global supply chains, the management of the risks posed by complex technologies, the evolution of financial, ecological, and other systems, as well as the protection of people and businesses as they and their products travel around the globe. They also fail to address looming challenges such as global warming and the reduction of poverty and oppression in the developing countries that are the backyard of global business. The answer to our troubles with law, however, is not the one critics usually reach for--to have less of it. Recognizing that law provides critical infrastructure for the cooperation and collaboration on which economic growth is built is the first step, Hadfield argues, to building a legal environment that does more of what we need it to do and less of what we don't. Through a sweeping review of first the invention and then the evolution of law over thousands of years of human development and the ways in which rule systems have consistently adapted to higher levels of complexity, Hadfield stresses that the state-based legal systems governing us today are not the only way to build the planks of a legal platform. Going back to fundamentals, she shows how historically, law's primary purpose has been to help societies to cope with the essential issues of trust, commitment, risk-allocation, and distribution that we face in coordinating cooperative ventures. While nation-state laws will never disappear, the time has come for us to supplement our legal infrastructure with rules developed on the same global platform as our economy. Hadfield offers a model for a more market- and globally-oriented legal system that fosters greater participation of end-users, market actors, and other non-governmental entities. Combining an impressive grasp of the empirical details of economic globalization with an ambitious re-envisioning of our global legal system, Rules for a Flat World promises to be a crucial and influential intervention into the debates surrounding how best to manage the evolving global economy."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 59, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40051700', 'name': 'Gillian K.

However, whenever antisocial punishment, whereby defectors punish cooperators, is available, this antisocial behavior outperforms social punishment, leading to the destruction of cooperation. In this paper, we use evolutionary game theory to show that this antisocial behavior can be efficiently restrained by relying on prior commitments, wherein agents can arrange, prior to an interaction, agreements regarding posterior compensation by those who dishonor the agreements. We show that, although the commitment mechanism by itself can guarantee a notable level of cooperation, a significantly higher level is achieved when both mechanisms, those of proposing prior commitments and of punishment, are available in co-presence. Interestingly, social punishment prevails and dominates in this system as it can take advantage of the commitment mechanism to cope with antisocial behaviors. That is, establishment of a commitment system helps to pave the way for the evolution of social punishment and abundant cooperation, even in the presence of antisocial punishment.\n \n', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2928820', 'name': 'H.

Providing incentives tends to be costly, so it is important to find effective and efficient policies for the combined use of rewards and penalties. Most studies of cooperation, however, have addressed rewarding and punishing in isolation and have focused on peer-to-peer sanctioning as opposed to institutional sanctioning. Here, we demonstrate that an institutional sanctioning policy we call ‘first carrot, then stick’ is unexpectedly successful in promoting cooperation. The policy switches the incentive from rewarding to punishing when the frequency of cooperators exceeds a threshold. We find that this policy establishes and recovers full cooperation at lower cost and under a wider range of conditions than either rewards or penalties alone, in both well-mixed and spatial populations. In particular, the spatial dynamics of cooperation make it evident how punishment acts as a ‘booster stage’ that capitalizes on and amplifies the pro-social effects of rewarding.

Here we provide a computational model showing that apologizing acts are rare in non-committed interactions, especially whenever cooperation is very costly, and that arranging prior commitments can considerably increase the frequency of such behavior. In addition, we show that in both cases, with or without commitments, apology works only if it is sincere, i.e. costly enough. Most interestingly, our model predicts that individuals tend to use much costlier apology in committed relationships than otherwise, because it helps better identify free-riders such as fake committers: ""commitments bring about sincerity\'.

Intention recognition can also use past experience from a database of past interactions, not necessarily with the same agent. Bayesian Networks BN can be employed to dynamically summarize general statistical evidence, furnishing heuristic information to link with the situation specific information, about which logical reasoning can take place, and decisions made on actions to be performed, possibly involving actions to obtain new observations.

We also offer insights on the scale at which public goods problems of cooperation are best solved. Instead of large-scale endeavors involving most of the population, which as we argue, may be counterproductive to achieve cooperation, the joint combination of local agreements within groups that are small compared with the population at risk is prone to significantly raise the probability of success.

As such, there is a huge range of work that the book could cover – from distributed software agents to cellular automata. A more accurate gloss of the actual content of the book comes in the introductory chapter – ‘designing problem solving devices inspired by social insects’ (p.23). Within this more circumscribed \x8eeld, the book provides fairly comprehensive coverage of recent research developments. It thus constitutes an excellent resource for researchers in the \x8eeld or for those wishing to familiarize themselves with current approaches e.g. it would be an ideal introduction for a doctoral student wanting to enter this area. But why and how should social insects inspire methods for problem solving? The introduction (Chapter 1) claims the critical concepts are self-organization and stigmergy. Self-organization is more or less self-explanatory – the idea that some kind of global coherence in structure or behaviour can emerge from purely local interactions. As such it is not a new concept (as the authors recognize, much of the theoretical work in this area comes from physics) nor is it evident that it applies to all social insect behaviour. For example, it could be argued that the idea (discussed in Chapter 5) of a template – a structure in the environment that organises the local activity towards a constrained result – is a global mechanism in much the same way as a centralized plan. However it is true that much of the success and \x8fexibility of social insect behaviour does seem to be the emergent result of local actions. Insect swarms provide an existence proof of the potential power of self-organizing systems. They can also provide speci\x8ec ideas as to the kinds of local interactions to implement. If termites can build a huge, well-structured nest, and ants alternate their activities dynamically to increase colony ef\x8eciency, then it should be possible to copy their local behaviours to achieve comparable global results. Stigmergy may be a less familiar term but refers to one important mechanism for successful self-organization: how agents’ effects on their environment can feed back to modify each others’ and their own behaviour. A good example discussed at length in Chapter 4 is distributed clustering. A simple agent behaviour of picking up isolated objects and dropping them when another object is encountered leads to the formation of initial small clusters that can effectively guide the further development of larger ones. These ideas have become an attractive (some might say seductive) alternative to more conventional ‘centralized’ approaches to problem solving. By providing an overview, this book allows some assessment of how successful this approach has been, as discussed further below.

Human communication is grounded in fundamentally cooperative, even shared, intentions. In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.

Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work. Our study of evolutionary dynamics is built around the replicator equations. We begin by defining the replicator dynamic, deriving it in several distinct ways, and exploring its major characteristics (\x9012.1–\x9012.6). The next several sections make good on our promise to justify Nash equilibrium in terms of dynamical systems, as we exhibit the relationship between dynamic stability of evolutionary models, on the one hand, and dominated strategies (\x9012.7), Nash equilibria (\x9012.8), evolutionarily stable strategies (\x9012.9), and connected sets of Nash equilibria, on the other. Many of the results we obtain remain valid in more general settings (e.g., when the dynamic has an aggregate tendency toward favoring more fit strategies, but not necessarily as strongly as the replicator dynamic). We next turn to asymmetric evolutionary games (\x9012.17), which have the surprising property, a property that is extremely important from the point of view of understanding real-world evolutionary dynamics, that strictly mixed Nash equilibria are never asymptotically stable but are often neutrally stable, leading to generically stable orbits (the Lotka-Volterra model has orbits, but it is not generic, as small changes in the coefficients lead to the equilibrium being either a stable or an unstable focus). In asymmetric games, the limit points of dynamic processes are generally Nash equilib-271', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 1282, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145012155', 'name': 'R.

Evolutionary game theory replaces the static solutions of classical game theory by a dynamical approach centered not on the concept of rational players but on the population dynamics of behavioral programs. In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the self-regulation of social and economic behavior, and of the closely related interactions among species in ecological communities. Replicator equations describe how successful strategies spread and thereby create new conditions that can alter the basis of their success, i.e., to enable us to understand the strategic and genetic foundations of the endless chronicle of invasions and extinctions that punctuate evolution. In short, evolutionary game theory describes when to escalate a conflict, how to elicit cooperation, why to expect a balance of the sexes, and how to understand natural selection in mathematical terms. \n \n Comprehensive treatment of ecological and game theoretic dynamics \n Invasion dynamics and permanence as key concepts \n Explanation in terms of games of things like competition between species', 'year': 1998, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 4999, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144012376', 'name': 'J.

Over the course of the last 20 years, multiple researchers have studied sensory and motor connections within the amygdala in trying to understand the ultimate role of this structure in pain perception and descending control of pain. A number of investigators have been using cell-type specific manipulations to probe the underlying circuitry of the amygdala. As data have accumulated in this research space, we recognized a critical need for a single framework to integrate these data and evaluate emergent system-level responses. In this manuscript, we present an agent-based computational model of two distinct inhibitory neuron populations in the amygdala, those that express protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) and those that express somatostatin (SOM). We utilized a network of neural links to simulate connectivity and the transmission of inhibitory signals between neurons. Type-specific parameters describing the response of these neurons to noxious stimuli were estimated from published physiological and immunological data as well as our own wet-lab experiments. The model outputs an abstract measure of pain, which is calculated in terms of the cumulative pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive activity across neurons in both hemispheres of the amygdala. Results demonstrate the ability of the model to produce changes in pain that are consistent with published studies and highlight the importance of several model parameters. In particular, we found that the relative proportion of PKCδ and SOM neurons within each hemisphere is a key parameter in predicting pain and we explored model predictions for three possible values of this parameter. We compared model predictions of pain to data from our earlier behavioral studies and found areas of similarity as well as distinctions between the data sets. These differences, in particular, suggest a number of wet-lab experiments that could be done in the future.",2021,48,8,"{'name': 'PLoS Computational Biology', 'volume': '17'}","{'model': 'specter_v1',

This increase is often attributed to the “accumulation of damage” known to occur in many biological structures and systems. The aim of this paper is to describe a generic model of damage accumulation and death in which mortality increases exponentially with age. The damage-accumulation process is modeled by a stochastic process know as a queue, and risk of dying is a function of the accumulated damage, i.e., length of the queue. The model has four parameters and the main characteristics of the model are: (i) damage occurs at random times with a constant high rate; (ii) the damage is repaired at a limited rate, and consequently damage can accumulate; (iii) the efficiency of the repair mechanism decays linearly with age; (iv) the risk of dying is a function of the accumulated damage. Using standard results from the mathematical theory of queues it is shown that there is an exponential dependence between risk of dying and age in these models, and that this dependency holds irrespective of how the damage-accumulation process is modeled. Furthermore, the ways in which this exponential dependence is shaped by the model parameters are also independent of the details of the damage accumulation process. These generic features suggest that the model could be useful when interpreting changes in the relation between age and mortality in real data. To exemplify, historical mortality data from Sweden are interpreted in the light of the model. The decrease in mortality seen between cohorts born in 1905, compared to those born in 1885, can be accounted for by higher threshold to damage. This fits well with the many advances made in public health during the 20th century.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 12, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47375699', 'name': 'A.

The underlying features supporting cell-type-specific function in the CeA, however, remain unknown. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute mouse brain slices and biocytin-based neuronal reconstructions, we demonstrate that neuronal morphology and relative excitability are two distinguishing features between Som+ and PKCδ+ neurons in the laterocapsular subdivision of the CeA (CeLC). Som+ neurons, for example, are more excitable, compact, and with more complex dendritic arborizations than PKCδ+ neurons. Cell size, intrinsic membrane properties, and anatomic localization were further shown to correlate with cell-type-specific differences in excitability. Lastly, in the context of neuropathic pain, we show a shift in the excitability equilibrium between PKCδ+ and Som+ neurons, suggesting that imbalances in the relative output of these cells underlie maladaptive changes in behaviors. Together, our results identify fundamentally important distinguishing features of PKCδ+ and Som+ cells that support cell-type-specific function in the CeA.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 25, 'authors': [{'authorId': '10243088', 'name': 'A.

Nevertheless, a relationship between radiation (dose and dose rate) and response (e.g., incidence, onset and progression) remains incompletely understood, raising the need for a risk-predictive mathematical model. We here report for the first time an in silico model for cataractogenesis. First, a simplified cell proliferation model was developed for human lens growth based on stem and progenitor cell proliferation as well as epithelial-fiber cell differentiation. Then, a model for spontaneous cataractogenesis was developed to reproduce the human data on a relationship between age and cataract incidence. Finally, a model for radiation cataractogenesis was developed that can reproduce the human data on a relationship between dose and cataract onset at various ages, which was further applied to estimate cataract incidence following chronic lifetime exposure. The model can serve as the foundation for further development of the risk-predictive model for cataractogenesis along with additional considerations of various biological mechanisms and epidemiological datasets.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 8, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34506995', 'name': 'T.

Agent‐based modeling is well suited to translating into a computational model the knowledge generated from basic science research, particularly with respect to translating across scales the mechanisms of cellular behavior into aggregated cell population dynamics manifesting at the tissue and organ level. This capacity has made agent‐based modeling an integral method in translational systems biology (TSB), an approach that uses multiscale dynamic computational modeling to explicitly represent disease processes in a clinically relevant fashion. The initial work in the early 2000s using agent‐based models (ABMs) in TSB focused on examining acute inflammation and its intersection with wound healing; the decade since has seen vast growth in both the application of agent‐based modeling to a wide array of disease processes as well as methodological advancements in the use and analysis of ABM. This report presents an update on an earlier review of ABMs in TSB and presents examples of exciting progress in the modeling of various organs and diseases that involve inflammation.

The spino-(trigemino-)parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway is one of the principal pathways mediating signals from nociception-specific ascending neurons to the central amygdala, a limbic structure involved in aversive signal-associated emotional responses, including the emotional aspects of pain. Recent studies suggest that the right and left central amygdala play distinct roles in the regulation of nociceptive responses. Using a latent formalin inflammatory pain model of the rat, we analyzed the right–left differences in synaptic potentiation at the synapses formed between the fibers from the lateral parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala neurons as well as those in the c-Fos expression in the lateral parabrachial nucleus, central amygdala, and the basolateral/lateral amygdala after formalin injection to either the right or left side of the rat upper lip. Although the single-sided formalin injection caused a significant bilateral increase in c-Fos-expressing neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus with slight projection-side dependence, the increase in the amplitude of postsynaptic excitatory currents and the number of c-Fos-expressing neurons in the central amygdala occurred predominantly on the right side regardless of the side of the inflammation. Although there was no significant correlation in the number of c-Fos-expressing neurons between the lateral parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala in the formalin-injected animals, these numbers were significantly correlated between the basolateral amygdala and central amygdala. It is thus concluded that the lateral parabrachial nucleus-central amygdala synaptic potentiation reported in various pain models is not a simple Hebbian plasticity in which raised inputs from the lateral parabrachial nucleus cause lateral parabrachial nucleus-central amygdala potentiation but rather an integrative and adaptive response involving specific mechanisms in the right central amygdala.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 79, 'citationCount': 28, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48839790', 'name': 'Yuta Miyazawa'}, {'authorId': '50300406', 'name': 'Yukari Takahashi'}, {'authorId': '40447710', 'name': 'A.

These 2 nuclei are asymmetrically involved in somatic pain modulation; pain-like responses on both sides of the body are preferentially driven by the right CeA, and in a reciprocal fashion, nociceptive somatic stimuli on both sides of the body predominantly alter molecular and physiological activities in the right CeA. Unknown, however, is whether this lateralization also exists in visceral pain processing and furthermore what function the left CeA has in modulating nociceptive information. Using urinary bladder distension (UBD) and excitatory optogenetics, a pronociceptive function of the right CeA was demonstrated in mice. Channelrhodopsin-2–mediated activation of the right CeA increased visceromotor responses (VMRs), while activation of the left CeA had no effect. Similarly, UBD-evoked VMRs increased after unilateral infusion of pituitary adenylate cyclase–activating polypeptide in the right CeA. To determine intrinsic left CeA involvement in bladder pain modulation, this region was optogenetically silenced during noxious UBD. Halorhodopsin (NpHR)-mediated inhibition of the left CeA increased VMRs, suggesting an ongoing antinociceptive function for this region. Finally, divergent left and right CeA functions were evaluated during abdominal mechanosensory testing. In naive animals, channelrhodopsin-2–mediated activation of the right CeA induced mechanical allodynia, and after cyclophosphamide-induced bladder sensitization, activation of the left CeA reversed referred bladder pain–like behaviors.

However, the local circuits of the CeL are not fully understood and have only recently begun to be explored in detail. Here, we characterized the intrinsic circuits in the CeL using paired whole-call patch-clamp recordings, immunohistochemistry, and optogenetics in C57BL/6J wild-type and somatostatin-cre (SOM-Cre) mice. Our results revealed that throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the CeL, neurons form inhibitory connections at a rate of ∼29% with an average amplitude of 20 ± 3 pA (at −40 mV). Inhibitory input from a single neuron is sufficient to halt firing in the postsynaptic neuron. Post hoc immunostaining for protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) in wild-type mice and paired recordings in SOM-Cre mice demonstrated that the most common local connections were PKCδ(−) → PKCδ(−) and SOM(+) → SOM(+). Finally, by optogenetically activating either SOM(+) or SOM(−) neurons, we found that almost all neurons in the CeL were innervated by these neuronal populations and that connections between like neurons were stronger than those between different neuronal types.

Identifying the extent to which depression remains causally associated with ongoing physical discomfort during chronic pain, or becomes independent of it, is an important problem for basic neuroscience and psychiatry. Difficulty in distinguishing between effects of ongoing aversive sensory input and its long-term consequences is a significant roadblock, especially in animal models. To address this relationship between localized physical discomfort and its more global consequences, we investigated cellular and behavioral changes during and after reversing a mouse model of neuropathic pain. Tactile allodynia produced by placing a plastic cuff around the sciatic nerve resolved within several days when the cuff was removed. In contrast, the changes in elevated O-maze, forced-swim, Y-maze spontaneous alternation and novel-object recognition test performance that developed after nerve cuff placement remained for at least 3 weeks after the nerve cuffs were removed, or 10–15 d following complete normalization of mechanical sensitivity. Hippocampal neurogenesis, measured by doublecortin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, was also suppressed after nerve cuff placement and remained suppressed 3 weeks after cuff removal. FosB expression was elevated in the central nucleus of the amygdala and spinal cord dorsal horn only in mice with ongoing allodynia. In contrast, FosB remained elevated in the basolateral amygdala of mice with resolved nociception and persisting behavioral effects.

Some believe that thalamic and cortical neurons transmitting information about the conditioned stimulus (CS) to the lateral amygdala (LA) serve a relay function. Others maintain that thalamic and/or cortical plasticity is critically involved in fear conditioning. To address this question, we developed a large-scale biophysical model of the LA that could reproduce earlier findings regarding the cellular correlates of fear conditioning in LA. We then conducted model experiments that examined whether fear memories depend on (1) training-induced increases in the responsiveness of thalamic and cortical neurons projecting to LA, (2) plasticity at the synapses they form in LA, and/or (3) plasticity at synapses between LA neurons. These tests revealed that training-induced increases in the responsiveness of afferent neurons are required for fear memory formation. However, once the memory has been formed, this factor is no longer required because the efficacy of the synapses that thalamic and cortical neurons form with LA cells has augmented enough to maintain the memory.

Indeed, CeL contains neurons exhibiting positive (CeL-On) or negative (CeL-Off) responses to fear-inducing conditioned stimuli (CSs). In mice, these cells differ in their expression of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) and physiological properties. CeL-Off cells are PKCδ(+) and late firing (LF), whereas CeL-On cells are PKCδ(-) and express a regular-spiking (RS) or low-threshold bursting (LTB) phenotype. However, the scarcity of LF cells in rats raises questions about the correspondence between the organization of CeL in mice and rats. Therefore, we studied the PKCδ expression, morphological properties, synaptic responsiveness, and fear conditioning-induced plasticity of rat CeL neurons. No PKCδ(+) LF cells were encountered, but ≈20-25% of RS and LTB neurons were PKCδ(+). Compared with RS neurons, a higher proportion of LTB cells projected to central medial amygdala (CeM) and they had fewer primary dendritic branches, yet the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by lateral amygdala (LA) stimulation was similar in RS and LTB cells. In contrast, LA-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) had a higher amplitude in LTB than RS neurons. Finally, fear conditioning did not induce plasticity at LA inputs to RS or LTB neurons. These findings point to major species differences in the organization of CeL. Since rat LTB cells are subjected to stronger feedforward inhibition, they are more likely to exhibit inhibitory CS responses than RS cells.

The amygdala is involved in the processing of mood disorders, fear, and the emotional‐affective components of pain. Hemispheric lateralization of pain processing in the amygdala has recently been brought to light because, independently of the side of the peripheral injury, the right central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) showed higher neuronal activity than the left in models of inflammatory pain. Although the CeA has been called the ‘nociceptive amygdala’, because of its high content of nociceptive neurones, little is known about changes in its neuronal function in vivo, under NP conditions. Herein, we quantified CeA spontaneous and evoked activity in rats subjected to spinal nerve ligation (SNL), under isoflurane anaesthesia, following application of mechanical and thermal stimuli to widespread body areas. We found that spontaneous and stimulus‐evoked neuronal activity was higher in the left CeA at 2 and 6\u2003days after SNL induction and declined afterwards, whereas activity in the right CeA became dominant at 14\u2003days after surgery, independently of the side of surgery. We also observed that systemic injection of pregabalin, which is widely used in patients with NP, reduced CeA spontaneous and stimulus‐evoked neuronal activity. Overall, we observed that peripheral nerve injury produced asymmetric plasticity in ongoing and evoked activity in the left and right CeA. Remarkably, at 14\u2003days after SNL induction, enhanced evoked activity in the right CeA persisted compared to short‐term increases in activity in the left CeA.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that changes in CNS processing are key to the development of chronic bladder pain conditions but little is known regarding the underlying cellular, molecular, and neuronal mechanisms. Using a mouse model of distention-induced bladder pain, we found that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a critical site of neuromodulation for processing of bladder nociception. Furthermore, we demonstrate that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) activation in the CeA induces bladder pain sensitization by increasing CeA output. Thus, pharmacological activation of mGluR5 in the CeA is sufficient to increase the response to bladder distention. Additionally, pharmacological blockade or virally mediated conditional deletion of mGluR5 in the CeA reduced responses to bladder distention suggesting that mGluR5 in the CeA is also necessary for these responses. Finally, we used optogenetic activation of the CeA and demonstrated that this caused a robust increase in the visceral pain response. The CeA-localized effects on responses to bladder distention are associated with changes in extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in the spinal cord.

Normal functions of the intact amygdala and prefrontal cortex are required for emotion-based decision-making that relies on the ability to assess risk, attribute value, and identify advantageous strategies. We tested the hypothesis that pain-related cognitive deficits result from amygdala-driven impairment of medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) function. To do this, we used electrophysiological single-unit recordings in vivo, patch clamp in brain slices, and various behavioral assays to show that increased neuronal activity in the amygdala in an animal model of arthritis pain was accompanied by decreased mPFC activation and impaired decision-making. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition (with a corticotropin-releasing factor 1 receptor antagonist) of pain-related hyperactivity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but not central amygdala (CeA), reversed deactivation of mPFC pyramidal cells and improved decision-making deficits. Pain-related cortical deactivation resulted from a shift of balance between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission. Direct excitatory transmission to mPFC pyramidal cells did not change in the pain model, whereas polysynaptic inhibitory transmission increased. GABAergic transmission was reduced by non-NMDA receptor antagonists, suggesting that synaptic inhibition was glutamate driven. The results are consistent with a model of BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of mPFC neurons. In contrast to the differential effects of BLA versus CeA hyperactivity on cortical-cognitive functions, both amygdala nuclei modulate emotional-affective pain behavior. Thus, this study shows that the amygdala contributes not only to emotional-affective but also cognitive effects of pain.

Individual CeLC neurons were recorded extracellularly before and after induction of an arthritis pain state in anesthetized rats. Brief innocuous and noxious test stimuli were applied to peripheral tissues ipsi- and contralateral to the recording site. A monoarthritis was induced in the ipsi- or contralateral knee by intraarticular injections of kaolin and carrageenan. Under normal conditions, CeLC neurons in the left amygdala had smaller receptive fields than those in the right, but the magnitude of background and evoked activity was not significantly different. After arthritis induction, neurons in the right, but not left, CeLC developed increased background activity and evoked responses, irrespective of the location of the arthritis (ipsi- or contralateral to the recording site). A protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor decreased the activity of right CeLC neurons after arthritis induction but had no effect in the left amygdala. Forskolin, however, increased the activity of left and right CeLC neurons under normal conditions. The results show for the first time laterality of pain-related electrophysiological activity changes in individual amygdala neurons.

Numerous anatomical and behavioral studies demonstrate that exogenous manipulations of the amygdala (i.e., lesions, drug infusions) modulate behavioral responses to acute noxious stimuli; however, little is known about the endogenous molecular changes in the amygdala that contribute to alterations in nociceptive processing during persistent noxious stimuli that resemble pathological pain conditions. In the present study, we demonstrate that endogenous molecular changes in the amygdala play a crucial role in modulating long-lasting peripheral hypersensitivity associated with persistent inflammation and we further identify the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a molecular substrate underlying this behavioral sensitization. Using the formalin test as a mouse model of persistent inflammatory pain, we show that activation of ERK in the amygdala is both necessary for and sufficient to induce long-lasting peripheral hypersensitivity to tactile stimulation. Thus, blockade of inflammation-induced ERK activation in the amygdala significantly reduced long-lasting peripheral hypersensitivity associated with persistent inflammation, and pharmacological activation of ERK in the amygdala induced peripheral hypersensitivity in the absence of inflammation. Importantly, blockade of ERK activation in the amygdala did not affect responses to acute noxious stimuli in the absence of inflammation, indicating that modulation of nociceptive responses by amygdala ERK activation is specific to the persistent inflammatory state. Altogether, our results demonstrate a functional role of the ERK signaling cascade in the amygdala in inflammation-induced peripheral hypersensitivity.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 195, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5953396', 'name': 'Y.

After an overview of simulation approaches in financial economics, we first give a summary of the Donangelo–Sneppen model of monetary exchange and compare it with related models in economics literature. Our selective review then outlines the main ingredients of some influential early models of multi-agent dynamics in financial markets (Kim–Markowitz, Levy–Levy–Solomon). As will be seen, these contributions draw their inspiration from the complex appearance of investors' interactions in real-life markets. Their main aim is to reproduce (and, thereby, provide possible explanations) for the spectacular bubbles and crashes seen in certain historical episodes, but they lack (like almost all the work before 1998 or so) a perspective in terms of the universal statistical features of financial time series. In fact, awareness of a set of such regularities (power-law tails of the distribution of returns, temporal scaling of volatility) only gradually appeared over the nineties. With the more precise description of the formerly relatively vague characteristics (e.g. moving from the notion of fat tails to the more concrete one of a power law with index around three), it became clear that financial market dynamics give rise to some kind of universal scaling law. Showing similarities with scaling laws for other systems with many interacting sub-units, an exploration of financial markets as multi-agent systems appeared to be a natural consequence. This topic has been pursued by quite a number of contributions appearing in both the physics and economics literature since the late nineties. From the wealth of different flavours of multi-agent models that have appeared up to now, we discuss the Cont–Bouchaud, Solomon–Levy–Huang and Lux–Marchesi models.

As a related CeA function is the expression of hypoalgesia induced by conditioned stimuli or systemic morphine administration, we examined postsynaptic opioid modulation of neurons in each major CeA subdivision. Following electrophysiological recording, biocytin‐filled neurons were precisely located in CeA regions identified by chemoarchitecture (enkephalin‐immunoreactivity) and cytoarchitecture (DAPI nuclear staining) in fixed adult rat brain slices. This revealed a striking distribution of physiological types, as 92% of neurons in capsular CeA were classified as late‐firing, whereas no neurons in the medial CeA were of this class. In contrast, 60% or more of neurons in the lateral and medial CeA were low‐threshold bursting neurons. Mu‐opioid receptor (MOPR) agonists induced postsynaptic inhibitory potassium currents in 61% of CeA cells, and this ratio was maintained in each subdivision and for each physiological class of neuron. However, MOPR agonists more frequently inhibited bipolar/fusiform cells than triangular or multipolar neurons. A subpopulation of MOPR‐expressing neurons were also inhibited by delta opioid receptor agonists, whereas a separate population were inhibited kappa opioid receptors (KOPR). The MOPR agonist DAMGO inhibited 9/9 CeM neurons with projections to the parabrachial nucleus identified by retrograde tracer injection. These data support models of striatopallidal organization that have identified striatal‐like and pallidal‐like CeA regions. Opioids can directly inhibit output from each subdivision by activating postsynaptic MOPRs or KOPRs on distinct subpopulations of opioid‐sensitive neurons. J. Comp.

It remains to be investigated how the diverse innervation patterns are generated and how these spatially complicated, but synaptically specific wirings are achieved. Here, we asked whether a particular cell type obeys a specific branching and bouton arrangement principle or differs from others only in average morphometric values of the morphological template common to nonpyramidal cells. For this purpose, we subclassified nonpyramidal cells within each physiological class by quantitative parameters of somata, dendrites, and axons and characterized axon branching and bouton distribution patterns quantitatively. Each subtype showed a characteristic set of vertical and horizontal bouton spreads around the somata. Each parameter, such as branching angles, internode or interbouton intervals, followed its own characteristic distribution pattern irrespective of subtypes, suggesting that nonpyramidal cells have the common mechanism for formation of the axon branching pattern and bouton arrangement. Fitting of internode and interbouton interval distributions to the exponential indicated their apparent random occurrence. Decay constants of the fitted exponentials varied among nonpyramidal cells, but each subtype expressed a particular set of interbouton and internode interval averages. The distinctive combination of innervation field shape and local axon phenotypes suggests a marked functional difference in the laminar and columnar integration properties of different GABAergic subtypes, as well as the subtype-specific density of inhibited targets.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 199, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3580433', 'name': 'F.

Larger, pyramiform spiny neurons; medium‐sized, sparsely spinous neurons; and small, aspinous cells were also present in CL.

No obvious morphological differences were evident among medium spiny neurons containing different peptides. In the medial subdivision, substance P, neurotensin, somatostatin, and CRF were present within pyramiform, sparsely spinous neurons with long dendrites. Galanin immunoreactivity in the medial subdivision was associated with moderately spiny, pyramiform neurons and a larger, aspinous, polygonal neuron.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the rat CN using Nissl, Klüver‐Barrera, and Golgi techniques suggests that it consists of four subdivisions. The medial subdivision (CM), which is closely associated with the stria terminalis, is narrow caudally but enlarges near the rostral pole of CN. Most neurons in CM have long dendrites that branch sparingly and have a moderate number of dendritic spines. A smaller number of CM neurons have thick dendrites with virtually no spines. Lateral to CM is the lateral subdivision (CL) which appears round in coronal sections. Neurons of CL have a very dense covering of dendritic spines and resemble medium‐size spiny neurons of the striatum. Area X of Hall contains spiny neurons similar to those of CL and spine‐sparse neurons that resemble medium‐size spine‐sparse cells of the striatum. Since area X encapsulates the lateral aspect of CL, it is termed the lateral capsular subdivision (CLC) of CN. The lateral capsular subdivision enlarges rostrally and is divided into dorsal and ventral portions by a laminar extension of the putamen. Near the rostral pole of CN a small region of tightly packed, intensely stained neurons is interposed between CL and CM. Golgi preparations reveal that this intermediate subdivision (CI) of CN contains neurons similar to those of CM. The lateral subdivision, CLC, and CM correspond, in part, to subdivisions recognized in previous Nissl studies. The intermediate subdivision has not been recognized as a distinct subdivision in previous investigations. This is the first Golgi study to recognize differences in neuronal morphology in particular subdivisions of the rat CN. The correlation of Nissl and Golgi preparations has permitted a more accurate determination of the boundaries and total extent of each subdivision than the use of Nissl techniques alone.', 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 79, 'citationCount': 335, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49501031', 'name': 'A.

The Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) protocol for describing Individual-and Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is now widely accepted and used to document such models in journal articles. As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design ratio-nale, the model’s underlying narrative, and the means by which the model’s fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model.

A big challenge in Emotion modeling is to establish the complex personal system of an intelligent agent or machine in a quasi‐physical and quasi‐sociological way, so that it rationally responds to emotions and behaviors by different internal and external stimuli with concurrency. For this purpose, an emotion classification model is presented for the audio‐visual external stimuli based on an improved long short‐term memory network. Then, based on Gross's emotional regulation theory, a hidden Markov model is constructed to imitate the process framework of human emotional cognition and personalized emotional regulation and expression, so as to realize the machine's intuitive and reasonable response to stimuli with concurrency. In this article, a framework of machine personalized artificial emotion simulation is preliminarily constructed, which provides a new model for human–computer interaction, in order to provide a

Multicloud is a high-performance secure computing platform, which combines multiple cloud providers for data processing, and the distributed multicloud platform ensures the security of data to some extent. Based on multicloud and task scheduling in IoT, this article constructs a many-objective distributed scheduling model, which includes six objectives of total time, cost, cloud throughput, energy consumption, resource utilization, and balancing load. Furthermore, this article presents a many-objective intelligent algorithm with sine function to implement the model, which considers the variation tendency of diversity strategy in the population is similar to the sine function.

However, the traditional recommendation algorithms cannot meet user's fast and accurate recommended requirements in the IoT environment. In the face of a large-volume data, the method of finding neighborhood by comparing whole user information will result in a low recommendation efficiency. In addition, the traditional recommendation system ignores the inherent connection between user's preference and time. In reality, the interest of the user varies over time. Recommendation system should provide users accurate and fast with the change of time. To address this, we propose a novel recommendation model based on time correlation coefficient and an improved K-means with cuckoo search (CSK-means), called TCCF. The clustering method can cluster similar users together for further quick and accurate recommendation. Moreover, an effective and personalized recommendation model based on preference pattern (PTCCF) is designed to improve the quality of TCCF. It can provide a higher quality recommendation by analyzing the user's behaviors. The extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets of MovieLens and Douban, and the precision of our model have improved about 5.2 percent compared with the MCoC model. Systematic experimental results have demonstrated our models TCCF and PTCCF are effective for IoT scenarios."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 267, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1713448', 'name': 'Z.

However, there is no one working to solve these problems synchronously at present. To tackle this problem, a hybrid multi‐objective cuckoo search under‐sampled software defect prediction model based on SVM (HMOCS‐US‐SVM) is proposed to solve synchronously above two problems. Firstly, a hybrid multi‐objective cuckoo search with dynamical local search (HMOCS) is utilized to select synchronously the non‐defective sampling and optimize the parameters of SVM. Then, three under‐sampled methods for decision region range are proposed to select the non‐defective modules.

Blockchain technology with decentralization features provides a new solution for distributed IoT system. In this paper, a blockchain based multi-WSN authentication scheme for IoT is proposed. The nodes of IoT are divided into base stations, cluster head nodes and ordinary nodes according to their capability differences, which are formed to a hierarchical network. A blockchain network is constructed among different types of nodes to form a hybrid blockchain model, including local chain and public chain. In this hybrid model, nodes identity mutual authentication in various communication scenarios is realized, ordinary node identity authentication operation is accomplished by local blockchain, and cluster head node identity authentication are realized in public blockchain.

As the amount of MVs is explosively increasing, it has become an important task to develop new techniques for effective MV analysis, retrieval, and management. By stimulating the human affective response mechanism, affective video content analysis extracts the affective information contained in videos, and, with the affective information, natural, user-friendly, and effective MV access strategies could be developed. In this paper, a novel integrated system (i.MV) is proposed for personalized MV affective analysis, visualization, and retrieval. In i.MV, we not only perform the personalized MV affective analysis, which is a challenging and insufficiently covered problem in current affective content analysis field, but also propose novel affective visualization to convert the abstract affective states intuitive and friendly to users. Based on the affective analysis and visualization, affective information based MV retrieval is achieved. Both comprehensive experiments and subjective user studies on a large MV dataset demonstrate that our personalized affective analysis is more effective than the previous algorithms. In addition, affective visualization is proved to be more suitable for affective information-based MV retrieval than the commonly used affective state representation strategies.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 106, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1776581', 'name': 'Shiliang Zhang'}, {'authorId': '1689702', 'name': 'Qingming Huang'}, {'authorId': '1696610', 'name': 'Shuqiang Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2153576035', 'name': 'Wen Gao'}, {'authorId': '144876831', 'name': 'Q.

Firstly, High, Medium and Low are detected as emotion intensity levels by using fuzzy c-mean clustering on arousal features. Fuzzy clustering provides a mathematical model to represent vagueness, which is close to human perception. After that, valence related features are used to detect emotion types (Anger, Sad, Fear, Happy and Neutral). Considering video is continuous time series data and the occurrence of a certain emotion is affected by recent emotional history, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to capture the context information. Experimental results shows the movie segments with high emotion intensity cover over 80% of the movie highlights in Horror and Action movies and the hierarchical method outperforms the one-step method on emotion type detection.

For such workflows, it is important to maximize the overall throughput to provide good quality of service. However, most of the existing scheduling algorithms are designed for scheduling of a single complex scientific workflow instance and are not efficient enough for scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows. To address this problem, we propose a throughput maximization strategy (TMS), which contains two specific algorithms for scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows at the instance and task levels, respectively. The first algorithm called Opposite Average Load tries to maximize the overall throughput by pursuing the overall load balance at the instance level, whereas the second algorithm called Extended Min–Min tries to further maximize the overall throughput at the task level by increasing the utilization rate of resources within each local autonomous group. The comparison and simulation performed on Swinburne Decentralized Workflow for Grid (SwinDeW‐G), a peer‐to‐peer‐based grid workflow environment, demonstrate that our strategy can improve the overall throughput significantly over existing scheduling algorithms when scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows.

 Antecedents
 Interpersonal emotional regulation (IER) is the deliberate attempt to influence others’ emotions. There is not enough research on IER in the context of romantic couples.
 
 
 Aim
 The aim of the present study was to develop and validate an instrument to assess couples’ IER and understanding its functioning at both an individual and dyadic level.
 
 
 Method
 Participants were 764 adults and 91 dyads. Three studies were carried out: first, to study the psychometric properties of the scale and its validity; second, to understand the functioning of the scale at a dyadic level; third, to analyse the predictive capacity of the instrument.
 
 
 Results
 Our 11-item scale has four factors: observe, ask, validate, and soothe feelings. These factors are doubly evaluated: as an agent (SIERC-A) and as a target (SIERC-B). The scale showed good psychometric properties and adequate internal consistency. It presents convergent validity with emotional competences, and divergent validity with emotional dysregulation and insecure attachment. At a dyadic level, there is an actor-partner effect of IER on couple adjustment. Finally, IER seems to predict relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and life satisfaction.

dimensions of emotion regulation and, more specifically, to the features of attempted support transactions that shape the outcomes of enacted support. We conducted 2 autobiographical recall studies to investigate receivers' evaluations of intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation interactions, to ascertain the number of dimensions required to capture variation in those evaluations, and then to examine associations of those dimensions with perceived benefits of the interactions. To do so, we developed a new questionnaire, the Interpersonal Regulation Interaction Scale (IRIS). In Study 1 (n = 390), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the IRIS yielded 4 dimensions, which we labeled responsiveness, hostility, cognitive support, and physical presence. Each dimension was uniquely associated with perceived benefits of receiving interpersonal emotion regulation. In Study 2, we collected multiple, diverse samples (ns = 199-895) and found support for the replicability and generalizability of key findings from Study 1, including the factor structure and associations with perceived benefits. In summary, across 2 studies and multiple, diverse samples, we identified 4 conceptually and practically important dimensions of receivers' evaluations of interpersonal emotion regulation interactions and developed a brief measure that taps interaction variability in these dimensions.

As a result, prior research has failed to systematically investigate whether individuals’ emotional and behavioral responses to perceived rejection differ as a function of the role of the potential rejector. In the present study, a total of 481 participants read two scenarios describing hypothetical situations in which rejection by a specific individual (i.e., significant other, friend, or acquaintance) was ambiguous. After each scenario, participants rated the extent to which they would be likely to anticipate (a) experiencing various negative emotions (e.g., upset) and (b) engaging in various behavioral responses (i.e., act friendly, retaliate, complain, avoid) to the potential rejector. Overall, the potential of being rejected by another person with whom one has a close and valued relationship (i.e., a significant other and, to a lesser degree, a friend) was associated with heightened negative emotion and a heightened likelihood of engaging in an active response, either prosocial (i.e., act friendly) or antisocial (i.e., retaliate or complain). In contrast, potential rejection by an acquaintance was associated with relatively little negative emotion and relatively little desire to engage the other (i.e., avoid). In sum, the participants’ relationship with specific individuals was found to influence both the intensity of their anticipated negative emotional response to ambiguous rejection and the pattern of their anticipated behavioral response to the potential rejectors.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40110284', 'name': 'Tucker L.

The underlying processes of this link and the couple interplay between attachment and well‐being are notably less explored. Using a dyadic framework, this study examines both couple members' emotion regulation strategies as potential mediators of this link. Method One hundred and nineteen heterosexual couples completed self‐report measures on attachment style, psychological well‐being, tendency to suppress emotions, and emotion expression. Analyses were performed using the actor–partner interdependence mediation model that distinguishes between intrapersonal and interpersonal influences. Results Results showed that controlling for relationship length, there was an intrapersonal indirect effect of attachment avoidance on psychological well‐being through emotion suppression. Moreover, interpersonal indirect effects were found (a) with individual attachment avoidance being associated with partner's psychological well‐being through own emotion expression and (b) individual's attachment anxiety being associated with partner's psychological well‐being through both own's emotion expression and partner's emotion suppression. Conclusions These findings highlight the complex associations among attachment, emotion regulation, and well‐being and point out the role of emotion regulation as a potential underlying pathway explaining these associations.

In the recent years there are strong movement for shifting from ability and aptitude testing to competence testing. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to process emotion-laden information competently, and to use it to guide cognitive activities like problem solving and to focus energy on required behaviors. According to Mayer and Salovey model EI involves four main abilities: a) to perceive accurately, appraise, and express emotion, b) to access and/or generate feelings when they facilitate thought, and c) to understand emotions and emotional knowledge ; and d) the ability to regulate emotions to promote emotional and intellectual growth (Mayer & Salovey, 1997, p. 5). Using that model of emotional intelligence self-reported instrument ESCQ (Taksic, 2001) consists of three subscales with appropriate psychometric properties was constructed. The subscales are measure of co-called trait emotional intelligence and are labeled ability to: a) perceived and understands emotions (PU), b) express and label emotions (EL), and c) manage and regulate emotions (MR). The results of series of studies demonstrated that ESCQ could be mentioned as an indicator of emotional competence in various situations: a) the highest correlation was obtained between trait emotional intelligence of supervisors and followers rating of their quality of supervising (leadership ; r=0.61), b) correlation between ESCQ and self perceived (un)competence was r=-0.33, and the highest was with MR subscale (r=-0.41), c) significant correlation was between the ESCQ and a school achievement.

A major disappointment to me was the almost exclusive reliance in the examples on a rather old automobile fuel efficiency dataset (there is one observation for a Datsun 1200 vehicle).

After a four page “Deployment” chapter, the book ends with a “Conclusions” chapter containing one large-scale example involving data on the incidence of diabetes among Pima Indians. Here we find histograms, box plots, a two-sample t test, some derived associative rules which I did not find overly insightful, and a brief summary of prediction results via neural networks. I think students coming out of an undergraduate regression course could do a fine job of analyzing these data without resorting to the bells and whistles of data mining. And once again, where are the business applications? Although the text does give a brief snapshot of the subject, it is lacking in detail, applications, and opportunities for practice.

SIMPSON AND W STEVEN RHOLES, EDS.: Attachment Theory and Close Relationships. The Guilford Press, New York, 1998, 438 pp., $50.00, ISBN 1-57230-102-3. Attachment theory, as first espoused by John Bowlby, became a pervasive theoretical influence on clinicans and researchers working with children, parents, and families. The work of Mary Ainsworth introducing the methodology of the Strange Situation made it possible to observe parent-child dyads and assess the type of relationship. The categories of secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-anxious attachment, later extended to include disorganized attachment, were ways of describing different attachment patterns. According to Bowlby, attachment paradigms are encoded in internal working models, the theorized basis for developing attachment systems. Both Bowlby and Ainsworth assumed internal working models formed in early childhood persisted throughout life and continued to be vital into maturity, and beyond maturity into old age. The concept of internal working models was used to account for continuity in relationships and transmission of trauma between generations. Can the attachment model be extended meaningfully to adult relationships and development throughout a lifetime? The purpose of this intriguing and informative synthetic volume edited by Jeffrey Simpson and Steven Rholes is to orient us to important theoretical and empirical advances that have taken place in the area of adult attachment during the last decade. They distinguish two components within attachment theory. The first component is normative and attempts to explain stages of development through which nearly all human beings pass. A second component is focused on individual differences and attempts to explain stable deviations from modal behavioral patterns. Simpson and Rholes note the study of individual differences has dominated research for adults as well as children. The authors distinguish two traditions emanating from the study of individual differences. The first tradition, the nuclear family tradition, is exemplified by the work of Mary Main and her colleagues. They developed the Adult Attachment Interview to predict the Strange Situation behavior of respondents' children. The peer/romantic partner tradition, on the other hand, focuses on contemporary views and perceptions of current life partners. These studies utilize self-report questionnaires, accessing a more conscious domain of feelings. In this book, Simpson and Rholes focus almost exclusively on research and clinical work utilizing self-report measures. They recognize that the two traditions of research diverge not only in methodology, but also in generalizability of results. …"", 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 164, 'authors': [{'authorId': '32043538', 'name': 'S.

They share some amount of common variance with similar well-established constructs such as alexithymia, social skills, and personality traits, but they are not correlated with cognitive abilities. However, due to its sufficient reliability, a great deal of unique variance remains. This unique variance of the ESCQ scales has an incremental contribution in explaining life satisfaction and empathy (as the crucial criteria for EI), and has significant relations with relevant real-life criteria such as quality of leadership, health risk behaviors, and school achievement.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 60, 'citationCount': 52, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3613570', 'name': 'Vladimir Takšić'}, {'authorId': '40425103', 'name': 'T.

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR. Future studies could aim to test the efficacy of social support for people with difficulties in self-regulation, for example individuals with high social anxiety, with a view to developing training programs in VR.",2023,0,1,"{'name': 'Int.

15,15,15,15,17,12b4d66926317199bdefa781333edbbe5e91ab6c,On the rationality of emotion regulation,"ABSTRACT Much of the recent work in psychology (and affective science) has shown that humans regulate their emotions nearly constantly, sometimes well and sometimes poorly. I argue that properly regulating one’s emotions displays emotional rationality, and failing to do so displays emotional irrationality. If an agent feels an emotion that is obviously problematic for the agent to feel and she is aware that it is problematic, then the agent ought to regulate her emotions in future similar situations. To capture this aspect of emotional rationality, I introduce the concept of imprudence, which is meant to capture a familiar way that we assess each other’s emotions, despite the fact that it has yet

To examine goals, we randomly assigned participants to either increase positive emotion or decrease negative emotion to a negative stimulus. To examine tactics, we categorized participants' reports of how they reappraised. To examine reappraisal outcomes, we measured experience and electrodermal responding. Findings indicated that (a) the goal of increasing positive emotion led to greater increases in positive affect and smaller decreases in skin conductance than the goal of decreasing negative emotion, and (b) use of the reality challenge tactic was associated with smaller increases in positive affect during reappraisal. These findings suggest that reappraisal can be implemented in the service of different emotion goals, using different tactics.

Disgust has recently been riding a swell of scholarly attention, especially from those in the cognitive sciences and those in the humanities in the midst of the ""affective turn."" Kelly proposes a cognitive model that can accommodate what we now know about disgust. He offers a new account of the evolution of disgust that builds on the model and argues that expressions of disgust are part of a sophisticated but largely automatic signaling system that humans use to transmit information about what to avoid in the local environment. He shows that many of the puzzling features of moral repugnance tinged with disgust are by-products of the imperfect fit between a cognitive system that evolved to protect against poisons and parasites and the social and moral issues on which it has been brought to bear.

On all trials, gaze was directed to a circumscribed area of the pictures. Even with gaze held constant across conditions, increase reappraisals led to higher ratings of emotional intensity, greater corrugator activity, and greater autonomic arousal. In addition, decrease reappraisals led to lower ratings of emotional intensity and lower corrugator activity, the latter of which held only when gaze was directed to arousing information.

It looks at all the typical characteristics and components of emotions, distinguishes emotions from other affective phenomena, classifies the emotions and covers such related issues as emotional intelligence, regulating emotions, and emotions and morality. The second part discusses individual emotions, including envy, jealousy, pleasure-in-others\'-misfortune, pity, compassion, anger, hate, disgust, love, sexual desire, happiness, sadness, pride, regret and shame.

Plato envi\xad sions tyranny as a kind of madness (see 573c ff.). As I imagine the tyrant, his relation to his obsession is like a psychotic\'s relation to his delusion: he is able, and prepared, to organize everything else around it, but at the expense of a loss of his grip on reality, on the world.

According to one proponent of this view, when we reason about probability we fall victim to “inevitable illusions” (Piattelli-Palmarini 1994). Other proponents maintain that the human mind is prone to “systematic deviations from rationality” (Bazerman & Neale 1986) and is “not built to work by the rules of probability” (Gould 1992). It has even been suggested that human beings are “a species that is uniformly probability-blind” (Piattelli-Palmarini 1994). This provocative and pessimistic interpretation of the experimental findings has been challenged from many different directions over the years. One of the most recent and energetic of these challenges has come from the newly emerging field of evolutionary psychology, where it has been argued that it’s singularly implausible to claim that our species would have evolved with no “instinct for probability” and, hence, be “blind to chance” (Pinker 1997, 351).

For instance, envy might be thought appropriate when one's rival has something good which one lacks. But someone might grant that a circumstance has these features, yet deny that envy is appropriate, on the grounds that it is wrong to be envious. These two senses of 'appropriate' have much less in common than philosophers have supposed.

The contemplated effects of the actions are represented as a transition operator that hopefully transforms the present state into a more desirable future state. As a case study, the model is applied to the self-regulation of glycemia in type-2 diabetes. An outline for the extension of the model to multi-agent, multidimensional self-regulation is also suggested.",2013,34,0,"{'name': 'Cybernetics and Systems', 'pages': '627 - 640', 'volume':

The Report sets out to answer the following broad questions: What is systems thinking and how can researchers and policy-makers apply it? How can we use this perspective to better understand and exploit the synergies among interventions to strengthen health systems? How can systems thinking contribute to better evaluations of these system-level interventions? This Report argues that a stronger systems perspective among designers implementers stewards and funders is a critical component in strengthening overall health-sector development in low- and middle-income countries.

The current study evaluated the effectiveness of two variants of the Secret Agent Society social skills program for children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (HFASD) in a mainstream school context. Sixty-nine students aged 7–12 took part in one of two different 10-week versions of the program (structured versus unstructured) to determine their relative effectiveness. Results suggested that both program variants led to improvements in emotion regulation abilities, social skills, and behavior at school and home, maintained at 6-week follow-up. However, the structured intervention generally led to superior treatment outcomes.

Previous research has found the curriculum to improve social engagements of children with ASD during unstructured recess periods but has been limited in research design and lack of maintenance data. Five elementary-age participants with current placements in inclusive public school settings were included in the study. A multiple baseline design across participants was used to determine the effects of the intervention on social engagement during unstructured recess periods, as well as teacher ratings of social functioning and sociometric status. Visual and statistical analyses of data indicate increased social engagement of participants during recess periods following introduction of social skills training. Improvements were also observed in teacher ratings of social functioning and sociometric status. Limitations of the current study are also discussed.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 32, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3874724', 'name': 'Keith C.

These impairments are considered to be the primary deficit (Fein, Pennington, Markowitz, Braverman, & Waterhouse, 1986) and can be seen across the lifespan. They reflect difficulties in understanding others’ minds, engaging in interaction which is truly reciprocal, and understanding concepts such as friendship. For individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the impact of these difficulties is severe, affecting the ability to make and sustain satisfying friendships and other relationships, and contributing to difficulties accessing education and later employment. The need to provide appropriate and effective intervention is therefore paramount. In this chapter, we therefore describe and reflect on a two-year project which aimed to develop and assess social interaction and understanding groups for children and adolescents with ASD.

In this remarkable set of CDs he has taken up the challenge of teaching these skills in a unique manner. \n \nOnce installed, the child or youth (and even adults) signs on their unique identifier and enters one of three main centres: Emotions Library, Learning Center, and Games Zone. The material is graded into 6 levels of complexity, and various forms of help (e.g. a happy robot ‘Emoto’, somewhat like a talking MicroSoft Office Assistant) are easily available allowing even young children to explore on their own. \n \nIn the Emotions Library, 412 emotions are arranged in 24 groups. Once the child picks a group, she or he can click on an emotion in that group and see actors (6 different ones representing various ages, cultures and both sexes) in a brief video with a narrator describing the emotion and what to watch for. In addition, there are sample story lines illustrating the emotion (at the younger levels, clicking on a line leads to the narrator speaking it), sample voice expressions of the emotion and information about the emotion (definition, whether it is seen as positive or negative, notes about how others usually react to it). Students get a chance to make and keep notes under their log-on name. \n \nIn the Learning Center, the emotions groups are similar to the library but the structure is more conducive to learning and exploration, again with videos, stories and vocal expressions separately. The lessons contain test questions and give students a chance to concentrate on the beginners 100 or top 20 along with questions and rewards. The quizzes give a chance to find faces with specific emotions, match emotional statements and faces, match statements with people in a picture. \n \nRewards are built into much of the practice and include hundreds of objects with a variety of information or movement. Objects include flags, butterflies, trains, birds, objects of the universe and more. If all the train cars are collected, it can be assembled to drive around a track. Other objects can be enlarged under a microscope, time lapse movies can be constructed and, my favourite, band instruments play–the more instruments collected, the more interesting the music that can be constructed. One reward is building up time to spend in the Games Zone. \n \nThe Games Zone includes matching games, hand-eye coordination games, real world face games and the opportunity to control Daniel Radcliffe (aka Harry Potter) in a variety of emotions. \n \nIt is not enough merely to teach the emotions, make the lessons fun, earn rewards and play games. Behind the whole set-up is Mind Reading Manager. This sets the parameters for a number of components of the three major sections thus allowing parents, teachers or professionals to track progress of a child, limit time in games, set limits on emotions (e.g. removing the ‘romantic’ emotions from beginner levels for children), fix levels and more. It is possible to track students’ overall engagement with different components, lists of emotions completed, average scores and more. \n \nMy own delay in forwarding a book review was that I wanted a chance to test it out for real with a day treatment service (age groups 5 to 9, 10 to 12 and 13 to 18 years). Attendees included those with disruptive behavioural disorders, depression, anxiety and pervasive developmental disorders. The program was particularly suited to group work with children with developmental disorders, but our staff used it for anger management training, social skills training and reward time for children and teens. When it can be used as a reward, you can learn one more important item, this program is fun! The final word from staff and children was that they were so pleased that separate orders for additional CDs were made and for other mental health programs that came to demonstrations. \n \nThe CDs or DVD can be installed on notebook computers, desk top computers, or, our favourite, connected to an LCD projector for group work. Technical support is available and it has proven helpful for us (a couple of minor questions). The cost is reasonable and the quality of the production, directing and acting is all excellent. \n \nMy overall conclusion is to support the staff I work with; Simon Baron-Cohen and team have done excellent work for children, youth and mental health professionals everywhere.

An incipient corpus of research shows that interpersonal affect regulation can be characterized as a goal-directed behavior that uses self-control processes which, according to the strength model of self-regulation, consumes a limited resource that is also used by other self-control processes. Using interpersonal affect-improving and affect-worsening regulation strategies can increase agent's resource depletion but there is reason to think that effects will partially rely on target's feedback in response to the regulation. Using a healthcare paradigm, an experiment was conducted to test the combined effects of interpersonal affect regulation use and patient feedback on healthcare workers' resource depletion, measured as self-reported experienced and expected emotional exhaustion, and persistence on a self-regulation task. Medical students (N = 78) were randomly assigned to a 2(interpersonal affect regulation: affect-worsening vs. affect-improving) × 2(patients' feedback: positive vs. negative) factorial between-subjects design and given instructions to play the role of doctors in interactions with two professional actors trained to act as patients. Analysis of covariance showed that affect-worsening was more depleting than affect-improving for all measures, whereas the recovery effects of positive feedback varied depending on strategy type and measure. The findings confirm the characterization of interpersonal affect regulation as potentially depleting, but suggest that the correspondence between the agent's strategy and the target's response needs to be taken into consideration. Use of affect-improving and positive feedback showed positive effects on self-rated performance, indicating that interpersonal affect regulation is relevant for organizational as well as personal

Meta-analytical summaries reveal that deep acting (summoning up the appropriate feelings one wants to display) generally has positive outcomes. Unlike surface acting (faking emotions), deep acting does not harm employee well-being, and deep acting is positively related with job satisfaction, organizational commitment, job performance, and customer satisfaction. Emerging research also suggests that a third form of emotional labor, natural and genuine emotional labor, is a frequently used emotional labor strategy that has positive effects for both employees and customers. We examine how identity processes shape how employees experience emotional labor, and we maintain that when employees identify with their roles, emotional labor augments and affirms their identity. Person-job fit is an important moderator that influences whether emotional labor enhances or hinders employee well-being. Emotional labor may also have positive outcomes when organizations grant more autonomy and adopt positive display rules that call for the expression of positive emotions. Recent research also indicates that emotional labor strategies may improve leadership effectiveness. Research opportunities on the bright side of emotional labor are abundant."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 98, 'citationCount': 293, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5995795', 'name': 'R.

The model captured our imagination and brought much-needed attention on an important yet neglected psychological construct. Despite its success, basic issues with the model remain. Here, we ask six questions: (i) Does self-control really wane over time? (ii) Is ego depletion a form of mental fatigue? (iii) What is the resource that is depleted by ego depletion? (iv) How can changes in motivation, perception, and expectations replenish an exhausted resource? (v) Has the revised resource model unwittingly become a model about motivation? (vi) Do self-control exercises increase self-control?

Using a call center simulation with three ""customer"" interactions, the authors found that participants given positive display rules (e.g., be enthusiastic and hide frustration) reported more postsimulation exhaustion and made more errors on the order form compared to those with display autonomy. Customer hostility during one of the calls also increased exhaustion overall and the number of errors during that specific call, though proposed interactions with display rules were not supported. Surface-level emotion regulation, but not deep-level, was the mechanism for the energy depletion effect of display rules, while display rules had a direct effect on performance decrements. Theoretical and practical implications for display rules as part of job requirements are discussed.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 471, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48655562', 'name': 'Lori S.

We propose that physicians consider empathy as emotional labor (ie, management of experienced and displayed emotions to present a certain image). Since the publication of Hochschild's The Managed Heart in 1983, researchers in management and organization behavior have been studying emotional labor by service workers, such as flight attendants and bill collectors. In this article, we focus on physicians as professionals who are expected to be empathic caregivers. They engage in such emotional labor through deep acting (ie, generating empathy-consistent emotional and cognitive reactions before and during empathic interactions with the patient, similar to the method-acting tradition used by some stage and screen actors), surface acting (ie, forging empathic behaviors toward the patient, absent of consistent emotional and cognitive reactions), or both. Although deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when immediate emotional and cognitive understanding of patients is impossible. Overall, we contend that physicians are more effective healers--and enjoy more professional satisfaction--when they engage in the process of empathy. We urge physicians first to recognize that their work has an element of emotional labor and, second, to consciously practice deep and surface acting to empathize with their patients. Medical students and residents can benefit from long-term regular training that includes conscious efforts to develop their empathic abilities.

Aluminum, Sheller tells us, changed mobility and mobilized modern life. It enabled air power, the space age and moon landings.

Sheller describes aluminum's shiny utopia but also its dark side. The unintended consequences of aluminum's widespread use include struggles for sovereignty and resource control in Africa, India, and the Caribbean; the unleashing of multinational corporations; and the pollution of the earth through mining and smelting (and the battle to save it).

We describe this climate and how it differs from other work climates. We then propose that a work unit with a climate of authenticity should provide a self-regulatory break from emotional labor with patients, thus replenishing resources and buffering against strain from emotional labor. We tested this multilevel prediction by surveying 359 health care providers nested within 48 work units at a large, metropolitan hospital. We find that medical workers experiencing more mistreatment by patients are more likely to be managing emotions with patients, and this response further contributes to the employees\' job-related burnout.

The relationships among these three factors are examined. The scale was found useful in research on social behavior, and its implications for research and therapy are discussed. Self Jawareness is a central concept in several divergent approaches to behavior and life. In psychoanalysi s, increased awareness of the self is both a tool and a goal. Self-examination enables the person to recognize his unconscious thoughts, motives, and defenses; one result of the therapy is increased insight, i.e., greater self-awareness. Rogerian therapy, existential analysis, and a variety of other insight therapies have also emphasized the importance of attending to and understanding one\'s inner thoughts and feelings. Relatively newer traditions, such as transactional analysis, encounter groups, and sensitivity training, have stressed the value of ""getting in touch with oneself"" and recognizing how one\'s behavior affects others. The quest for self-insight may also be seen in the widespread interest in the practice of meditation. Previous interest in self-awarenes s has derived from either a therapeutic orientation or a philosophical approach to life. Recently, self-awareness has been approached from an entirely different perspective—that of social psychology. Argyle (1969) has speculated about the impact of self ^awareness on social interaction, and Duval and Wicklund (1972) have elaborated an entire theory of selfawareness.

The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students’ varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash™, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent’s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent’s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state. The paper provides exploratory findings of the first 2 years of this 5-year scaling-up research study. The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability. Therefore, findings are reported as changes within subjects instead of across subjects. While these exploratory observations serve as a basis for longer term research on a larger population, this paper focuses less on student learning and more on evolving technology in AIC and supporting

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders vary considerably according to variables such as index subject characteristics, study setting, sampling frame, diagnostic methods used, as well as country of geographic origin. To date, most studies comprise clinical or treatment referral samples in tertiary care or subjects enrolled in clinical trials and genetic cohort collections. Such samples carry the potential for overestimation of both the frequency and severity of psychiatric comorbidity. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases restricted to population-based study publications in the English between May 1, 2015, and May 31, 2020. A comprehensive keyword list was generated to investigate co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. A wide range of DSM-5 based disorders such as anxiety, mood, ADHD, intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder, eating/feeding, gender dysphoria and sleep-wake disorders were assessed. Initial search revealed a total of 1674 articles after removal of duplicates. Two independent researchers conducted a parallel-blinded screening process to identify the eligible studies based on titles and abstracts; 39 studies were analyzed in the current review. The main findings show prevalence estimates of 22.9% (95% CI: 17.7- 29.2) for intellectual disability; 26.2% (22-31) for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 11.1% (8.6-14.1) for anxiety disorders; 19.7% (11.9-30.7) for sleep disorders; 7% (5.2- 9.3) for disruptive disorders; 2% (1.3- 3.1) for bipolar disorders; 2.7% (1.8- 4.2) for depression; 1.8% (0.4–8.7) for obsessive-compulsive disorder; and 0.6% (0.3–1.1) for psychosis. Psychiatric comorbidity in population-based studies is lower than in clinical and referred samples. However, our results also indicate that the frequency of psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with ASD in the population context is considerable, without the influence of referral bias implicit in clinical and treatment samples. There is a need for better targeted diagnostic tools to detect psychiatric comorbidity in children and youth in future population-based studies, as an essential component in providing care as well as new insights into the nature and mechanisms of its underlying associations.

The integration of social robots to support learners has already shown promise to benefit the learning process in this area. In this paper, we focus on the applicability of an adaptive robotic tutor in a university setting. To this end, we conducted a long-term field study implementing an adaptive robotic tutor to support students with exam preparation over three sessions during one semester. In a mixed design, we compared the effect of an adaptive tutor to a control condition across all learning sessions. With the aim to benefit not only motivation but also academic success and the learning experience in general, we draw from research in adaptive tutoring, social robots in education, as well as our own prior work in this field. Our results show that opting in for the robotic tutoring is beneficial for students. We found significant subjective knowledge gain and increases in intrinsic motivation regarding the content of the course in general. Finally, participation resulted in a significantly better exam grade compared to students not participating. However, the extended adaptivity of the robotic tutor in the experimental condition did not seem to enhance learning, as we found no significant differences compared to a non-adaptive version of the robot.', 'year': 2022, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '151110885', 'name': 'Melissa Donnermann'}, {'authorId': '11715171', 'name': 'Philipp Schaper'}, {'authorId': '2117313647', 'name': 'Birgit Lugrin'}]}, {'paperId': 'b0f94c3cd564840471487fe2fcfa72ad350997ca', 'title': 'Facial Expression Recognition By Using a Disentangled Identity-Invariant Expression Representation', 'abstract': 'Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a challenging task because many factors of variation such as pose, illumination, and identity-specific attributes are entangled with the expression information in an expressive face image.

In this paper, we present Transfer-based Expression Recognition Generative Adversarial Network (TER-G AN) that combines the effectiveness of a novel feature disentanglement technique with the concept of identity-invariant expression representation learning for FER. More specifically, TER-GAN learns a disentangled expression representation by extracting expression features from one image and transferring the expression information to the identity of another image. To improve the feature disentanglement process and to learn an identity-invariant expression representation, we introduce a novel expression consistency loss and an identity consistency loss that exploit expression and identity information from both real and synthetic images.

However, whether this could be demonstrated using more realistic facial emotion recognition stimuli and applied to autistic females was unclear. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed online self-report measures of autism spectrum condition severity and alexithymia, and afacial emotion recognition deficit that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition severity, were associated with less accurate facial emotion recognition. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy. However, alexithymia (and autism spectrum condition severity) was not associated with speed of emotion processing. The findings are primarily discussed with the theoretical view that perceiving and experiencing emotions share the same neural networks, thus being able to recognise one’s own emotions may facilitate the ability to recognise others’. This study is in line with previous similar research on autistic males and suggests impairments in facial emotion recognition in autistic females should be attributed to co-occurring alexithymia. Lay abstract Research with autistic males has indicated that difficulties in recognising facial expressions of emotion, commonly associated with autism spectrum conditions, may instead be due to co-occurring alexithymia (a condition involving lack of emotional awareness, difficulty describing feelings and difficulty distinguishing feelings from physical bodily sensations) and not to do with autism. We wanted to explore if this would be true for autistic females, as well as to use more realistic stimuli for emotional expression. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed self-report measures of autism spectrum condition traits and alexithymia and completed a visual test that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition features, were associated with less accuracy in identifying emotions. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy.

Also, the lack of publicly available datasets for children with annotated emotion labels leads most researchers to focus on adults. In this paper, we introduce a newly collected multimodal emotion dataset of children between the ages of four and fourteen years old.

The purpose of this review is to configure primarily qualitative and mixed methods findings from studies meeting our selection and quality criterion to answer the review question: How do robotic construction kits function as computational manipulatives in P–12 STEM education? Our synthesis of the literature has resulted in four key insights that are new to the field. First, RCKs have a unique double application: They may be used for direct instruction in robotics (first-order uses) or as analogical tools for learning in other domains (second-order uses). Second, RCKs make possible additional routes to learning through the provision of immediate feedback and the dual modes of representation unique to RCKs. Third, RCKs support a computational thinking learning progression beginning with a lower anchor of sequencing and finishing with a high anchor of systems thinking. And fourth, RCKs support evolving problem-solving abilities along a continuum, ranging from trial and error to heuristic methods associated with robotics study. Furthermore, our synthesis provides insight into the second-order (analogical) uses of RCKs as computational manipulatives in the disciplines of physics and biology.

Frequency and duration of peer interaction behaviours were coded.

The impact of the environment on the frontal lobe is of great relevance since the so-called Executive Functions (EF) are developed there. EFs are in charge of planning, anticipating, executing behavior and emotional regulation. Developing of intervention strategies that favor prosocial behaviors in children by promoting listening, dialogue, decision, and transcendence could generate changes in behavior and benefits processes related to executive functions. The Education by Experience (ExE) Model focuses on addressing issues related to respect, commitment, coexistence in harmony, gender equality, human rights, care for nature, health, and well-being, taking into account the school as an agent of change through the participation of students, teachers and parents. 
  
Method. The objective of this study was to know the effect of the ExE intervention program on the EFs of childhood and adolescence in the Mexican state of Hidalgo. A total of 316 boys, girls, and adolescents aged 8 to 15 (142 men and 174 women), 4th, 5th, and 6th grade of primary school and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade of secondary school, both from public schools, participated. Participants were selected by simple random sampling and assigned to one of the two experimental groups or to the control group. A pre-post pre-experimental type design was used with three groups (Experimental Group A, Experimental Group B, and Control Group). The recommendations and guidelines of the Code of Ethics of the Psychologist were followed. The evaluation consisted of applying a battery of neuropsychological instruments suitable for the Mexican child and adolescent population, known as BANFE-2, for its acronym in Spanish. The experimental and replica group received training in 10 of the components of the EXE model. Subsequently, the data were analyzed.

The measurements of the neuropsychological tasks of the EFs carried out before and after participating with the ExE Model allowed to identify that the children of the primary and middle school presented improvements in EFs mainly related to the orbitomedial region and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The most obvious changes were observed in the primary school participants, where there were statistically significant differences between the pre and post-evaluation of the experimental groups, which were not observed in the control group. These improvements are linked in primary school participants to the identification and regulation of emotions, while in middle school adolescents, the changes are related to the ability to plan, organize and solve problems. In both primary and middle schools, it is observed that the effect size index ranges from low to moderate. 
  
Discussion and Conclusion.  The students who participated in the ExE program showed an increase in the scores in executive functions tasks, specifically in those obtained in the orbitomedial and dorsolateral subscales, which are related to the identification and regulation of emotions. This study allows us to recognize the impact of the ExE educational model as a preventive strategy and facilitator of personal and social resources with positive results in the tasks of executive functions. Finally, the role of teachers as facilitating agents of change and the advantages of implementing a model based on values as a strategy for the promotion of well-being in educational settings is discussed.",2022,0,0,{'name': 'Electronic Journal of Research in Education Psychology'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-2.628859519958496, -2.542764186859131, -2.7157819271087646,

Most of these people are cared for by informal caregivers at home, i.e. people who are not paid for their work and who are usually family members without professional training. The lack of skills and knowledge necessary to carry out this work causes stress and leads to increased levels of overload, anxiety, and depression in informal caregivers. This paper presents work in progress on the design of an intelligent assistant (IA), named Alzaid Assistant, for informal caregivers of people with dementia (PwD). This IA aims to promote social support in informal caregivers of PwD by providing them with information and strengthening coping strategies for problem solving and emotional regulation to reduce levels of overload, anxiety, and depression. Particularly, the phases of requirements elicitation, design, implementation, and preliminary validations are presented. A high-fidelity prototype of the IA was evaluated by 20 participants using a questionnaire based on the technology acceptance model to assess the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Alzaid Assistant was perceived as quite likely useful and quite likely easy to use by potential users.",2022,39,0,"{'name': '2022 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and

Proper nutrition and good eating behavior show promise for preventing and slowing the progression of ADRD and consequently improving patients with ADRD’s health status and quality of life. Most ADRD care is provided by informal caregivers, so assisting caregivers to manage patients with ADRD’s diet is important. Objective This study aims to design, develop, and test an artificial intelligence–powered voice assistant to help informal caregivers manage the daily diet of patients with ADRD and learn food and nutrition-related knowledge. Methods The voice assistant is being implemented in several steps: construction of a comprehensive knowledge base with ontologies that define ADRD diet care and user profiles, and is extended with external knowledge graphs; management of conversation between users and the voice assistant; personalized ADRD diet services provided through a semantics-based knowledge graph search and reasoning engine; and system evaluation in use cases with additional qualitative evaluations. Results A prototype voice assistant was evaluated in the lab using various use cases. Preliminary qualitative test results demonstrate reasonable rates of dialogue success and recommendation correctness. Conclusions The voice assistant provides a natural, interactive interface for users, and it does not require the user to have a technical background, which may facilitate senior caregivers’ use in their daily care tasks. This study suggests the feasibility of using the intelligent voice assistant to help caregivers manage patients with ADRD’s diet.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 19, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2116823876', 'name': 'Juan Li'}, {'authorId': '123041694', 'name': 'Bikesh Maharjan'}, {'authorId': '2077526566', 'name': 'Bo Xie'}, {'authorId': '34394575', 'name': 'Cui Tao'}]}, {'paperId': '81ee28c026d1bcf5ef1d0f6e7832930d5936d912', 'title': 'A single mindfulness session with informal caregivers of seniors living with dementia: a pilot qualitative descriptive study', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 4, 'authors': [{'authorId': '84561447', 'name': 'F.

Supporting Family Caregivers with Technology for Dementia Home Care (FamTechCare) is a multisite randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of a telehealth intervention on caregiver well-being and PWD behavioral symptoms. The FamTechCare intervention provides individualized dementia-care strategies to in-home caregivers based on video recordings that the caregiver creates of challenging care situations. A team of dementia care experts review videos submitted by caregivers and provide interventions to improve care weekly for the experimental group. Caregivers in the control group receive feedback for improving care based on a weekly phone call with the interventionist and receive feedback on their videos at the end of the 3-month study. Using linear mixed modeling, we will compare experimental and control group outcomes (PWD behavioral symptoms and caregiver burden) after 1 and 3 months. An exploratory descriptive design will identify a typology of interventions for telehealth support for in-home dementia caregivers. Finally, the cost for FamTechCare will be determined and examined in relation to hypothesized effects on PWD behavioral symptoms, placement rates, and caregiver burden.

All the authors and investigators of dementia studies who provided us more specific data from their work. foreword Today, over 46 million people live with dementia worldwide, more than the population of Spain. This number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 2050. Dementia also has a huge economic impact. Today, the total estimated worldwide cost of dementia is US $818 billion, and it will become a trillion dollar disease by 2018. This means that if dementia care were a country, it would be the world's 18th largest economy, more than the market values of companies such as Apple (US$ 742 billion), Google (US$ 368 billion) and Exxon (US$ 357 billion). In many parts of the world, there is a growing awareness of dementia, but across the globe it remains the case that a diagnosis of dementia can bring with it stigma and social isolation. Today, we estimate that 94% of people living with dementia in low and middle income countries are cared for at home. These are regions where health and care systems often provide limited or no support to people living with dementia or to their families. The 2015 World Alzheimer Report updates data on the prevalence, incidence, cost and trends of dementia worldwide. It also estimates how these numbers will increase in the future, leaving us with no doubt that dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and other causes, is one of the biggest global public health and social care challenges facing people today and in the future. The two organisations we lead are ADI, the only worldwide federation of Alzheimer associations and global voice on dementia, and Bupa, a purpose-driven global health and care company that is the leading international provider of specialist dementia care, caring for around 60,000 people living with dementia each year. Together, we are committed to ensuring that dementia becomes an international health priority. We believe national dementia plans are the first step towards ensuring all countries are equipped to enable people to live well with dementia, and help to reduce the risk of dementia for future generations. There is now a growing list of countries which have such provision in place or which are developing national dementia plans, but it's not enough.

Few studies have tested the association of coping and health longitudinally. Method: This study examined factors associated with the use of coping strategies over time and their associations with physical and mental health outcomes in a population-based sample of 226 dementia caregivers in Cache County, Utah, USA. Caregivers annually completed the Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a health interview. Care-recipient cognitive and functional abilities were obtained using the Mini-Mental State Exam and the Clinical Dementia Rating. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Results: Caregivers most frequently identified providing care as a problem (37.6%). Linear mixed models of caregiver coping strategies found that the use of most strategies were stable except for increasing Avoidance among adult child caregivers (β = 0.14, p = 0.048). On average, increased Wishful Thinking (β = 2.48, p < 0.001) or Blames Self (β = 1.06, p = 0.002) was associated with higher anxiety scores. Increased use of Blames Others among males (interaction, β = 0.28, p = 0.02) and greater use of Wishful Thinking among younger caregivers (interaction, β = −0.01, p = 0.01) were associated with more caregiver health conditions.

One hundred twenty-five family carers of people with Alzheimer's disease completed the Brief COPE at time 1, 92 (82.9% of eligible carers) a year later, and 74 (77.1%) 2 years later. Internal consistencies were good for emotion-focused, problem-focused, and dysfunctional subscales (&agr; = 0.72, 0.84, 0.75). Test-retest reliability over a year was demonstrated for emotion-focused, problem-focused, and dysfunctional subscales among carers in whom burden scores did not change significantly (r = 0.58, r = 0.72, r = 0.68; p < 0.001). Change in burden score over 2 years correlated with change in problem-focused and dysfunctional (r = 0.33, r = 0.32; p < 0.01) subscales, indicating sensitivity to change, but not with change on the emotion-focused scale. Change in emotion-focused coping correlated with change in problem-focused and dysfunctional coping (r = 0.40, r = 0.26; p < 0.05). Regression analyses indicated convergent and concurrent validity: emotion-focused coping was predicted by secure attachment (&bgr; = 0.23) and by problem-focused coping (&bgr; = 0.68); dysfunctional coping by burden (&bgr; = 0.36) and less secure attachment (&bgr; = −0.25) and problem-focused coping (&bgr; = 0.31;all p < 0.05).

Prevention Dementia is defined as a decline in cognitive function from baseline. It is a syndrome caused by a variety of disorders, the most common of which are Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. The incidence and prevalence of dementia increase with age. It is estimated that by the year 2047, more than 9 million Americans will have some form of it (1). Institutionalization is ultimately required for many patients with dementia, and 67% die in nursing homes (2). Although there is currently no cure for most forms of dementia, research findings and accumulated clinical experience support a set of practices that serve to maximize the function and overall well-being of patients with dementia and their caregivers. What medical interventions or health behaviors can help patients prevent dementia? Although there are several risk factors for different types of dementia, data supporting the effectiveness of specific preventive measures are limited. Hypertension Untreated hypertension in mid-life and later is a proven risk factor for both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia (3). A number of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that treating hypertension reduces the risk for dementia. A large, placebo-controlled RCT with 2418 participants demonstrated that treating systolic hypertension in patients over the age of 60 years reduced the incidence of dementia by 50%, from 7.7 cases to 3.8 cases per 1000 patient-years (4). Another placebo-controlled RCT with 6106 participants showed that treating hypertension with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril with or without the thiazide diuretic indapamide reduced the incidence of recurrent stroke with dementia by 34% and of recurrent stroke with any cognitive decline by 45% in patients with past stroke or transient ischemic attack (5). Hypercholesterolemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hypercholesterolemia, particularly in mid-life, is associated with an increased incidence of both Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, (6), and case-control studies have shown an association between use of cholesterol-lowering medications and reduced incidence of dementia (7). Diabetes has been shown in both longitudinal cohort and case-control studies to be an independent risk factor for vascular dementia (8, 9). However, as with hypercholesterolemia, there are no trials that demonstrate that treating diabetes prevents dementia. Lifestyle Modifications Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk for stroke, although the evidence for an association with Alzheimer disease is mixed (10). Head injury earlier in life has been shown in a number of epidemiologic studies to be associated with dementia later in life (11). Finally, physical inactivity, both in mid-life and later, has been associated with an increased risk for dementia in both retrospective and prospective studies 12, 13). Thus, counseling patients to quit smoking; engage in behaviors to reduce the risk for head injury, such as wearing seat belts and bike helmets; and be physically active may reduce the risk for dementia. Medications Clinicians should regularly review the medication regimens of elderly patients and minimize use of medications that can cause cognitive impairment, such as benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, barbiturates, and other sedative-hypnotics. A number of studies have shown that elderly patients taking benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics perform more poorly on cognitive tests than those not taking these medications (14). Because inflammation is present in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease and epidemiologic evidence links use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) earlier in life to a lower risk for Alzheimer disease (15), some have questioned whether NSAIDs might prevent dementia. However, prospective studies to date have not shown a protective effect of NSAIDs, and they are not recommended for prevention of dementia (16). Significant epidemiologic evidence links mid-life estrogen use to a lower incidence of dementia later in life (17). However, in prospective prevention trials, including the large Women\'s Health Initiative Memory Study, use of estrogen plus progestin for prevention of dementia was associated with an increased incidence of dementia, as well as other medical complications (18). Clinical Bottom Line: Prevention Although there are few data to support specific measures to prevent dementia, clinicians should treat cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes, and encourage smoking cessation and regular exercise. They should also counsel patients about avoiding head injury and avoid prescribing medications that can alter cognitive function. Neither NSAIDs nor estrogen should be recommended for prevention of dementia. Screening Should clinicians screen for dementia? The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against widespread screening for dementia in elderly patients (19). However, many patients with dementia in the primary care setting, even those in more advanced stages of the disease, remain undiagnosed despite having routine general medical care (20). Moreover, patients referred to dementia specialists after ""screening"" have been diagnosed at an earlier stage of illness than those referred from physicians or families (21). Therefore, given the high prevalence of dementia and its associated morbidity, the clinician should consider secondary case-finding measures for dementia in elderly patients with unexplained functional decline, deterioration in hygiene, questionable adherence to medication regimens, or new-onset psychiatric symptoms. What methods should clinicians use when looking for dementia? When looking for dementia in elderly patients, clinicians should use a standardized screening instrument together with a brief history from the patient and a knowledgeable informant. The screening instrument should be easy to use, demonstrate high sensitivity, be widely available, and be supported by normative population data relevant to the patient. Two examples of such instruments are the Mini-Mental Status Examination (22) and the Mini-Cog (23). Clinical Bottom Line: Screening There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening asymptomatic people for dementia. However, clinicians should be alert for unexplained functional decline, deterioration in hygiene, questionable adherence to medication regimens, or new-onset psychiatric symptoms in elderly patients and use standardized instruments, such as the Mini-Mental Status Examination or the Mini-Cog, to look for cognitive dysfunction in such patients. Diagnosis What elements of the history are most important in evaluating patients with suspected dementia? Clinicians should use the patient\'s history to characterize the cognitive deficits, generate a differential diagnosis, and attempt to determine the cause of the dementia. This is best accomplished by identifying medical, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms that may be clues to the cause of the cognitive problems and detailing their order of appearance, severity, and associated features. In the case of cognitive difficulties, it is mandatory to try to obtain collateral information from a knowledgeable informant, because cognitive dysfunction can impair the patient\'s ability to serve as an accurate reporter. It is often easier to collect this information, as well as information about psychiatric symptoms, without the patient present. In taking the history, it is critical for clinicians to be knowledgeable about the differential diagnosis and natural history of the most common types of dementia (Table 1). For example, in classic Alzheimer disease, early symptoms are dominated by difficulties with short-term memory, subtle language and visuospatial perception difficulties, and changes in executive function with significant reductions in efficiency and organizational abilities of which the patient may or may not be aware. Symptoms begin insidiously and are slowly progressive. Overall level of alertness remains unimpaired. Patients or families may not label these difficulties as memory problems per se but may instead report multiple repetitions of questions or conversations with no recollection of previous discussions, increased forgetfulness manifested by losing objects or becoming confused while shopping, or simply overall increased disorganization and decreased efficiency. Symptoms are often first noticed or reported at the time of a life change, such as the death of a spouse or a move into a new residence. See the Box for clinical diagnostic criteria for definite and probable Alzheimer disease (24). Clinical Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease (AD) Definite AD: Clinical criteria for probable AD plus histopathology confirmation Probable AD: Dementia by clinical examination and standardized instrument (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination) Deficits in >2 areas of cognition Progressive cognitive decline Normal levels of consciousness Onset between age 40 and 90 years No other cause Supportive factors, including positive family history, cerebral atrophy on neuroimagining, normal electroencephalogram and lumbar puncture Table 1. Differential Diagnosis of Cognitive Difficulties Many elderly patients report minor cognitive problems, such as mild forgetfulness, difficulty remembering names, and mildly reduced concentration. In patients without dementia, these symptoms are typically sporadic, do not worsen significantly over time, are easily compensated for, and do not affect function. In contrast, in early dementia, the symptoms insidiously become established as a pattern, worsen over time, are difficult to compensate for, and eventually affect speech fluency and hamper the performance of routine activities, such as meal prepa', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 805, 'authors': [{'authorId': '8049385', 'name': 'D.

At the same time, such interactions necessitate social cognition. The question thus arises how stress affects social cognition and how personality attributes modulate this effect. The aim of the current study was to investigate the link between emotional reactivity, physical exercise, and social cognition under stress. As a measure of social cognition, we used spontaneous perspective taking, i.e., the degree to which participants represented the mental state of another agent. Studying young female participants, we investigated how physiological regulation, measured through resting heart-rate variability, is related to spontaneous social perspective taking under stress, and to predicted anger in an ambiguous social scenario. When controlling for resting heart rate, vagally mediated heart-rate variability was negatively correlated with the effect of stress on perspective taking, indicating that good physiological regulation supports social cognition under stress. Further, participants who reported to exercise at least once a week showed higher perspective taking under stress than less active participants. Finally, we found tentative evidence for participants who exercised regularly to show reduced predicted anger in response to an ambiguous provocation. Our findings suggest that good physiological regulation and regular physical exercise support social cognition under stress.",2021,55,0,"{'name': 'Stress', 'pages': '753 - 762', 'volume':

Although such mimicry is thought to be a relatively automatic process, research indicates that contextual factors can influence mimicry, especially in humans. Here, we extend this work by investigating the effect of acute psychosocial stress on spontaneous facial mimicry. Participants performed a spontaneous facial mimicry task with facial electromyography (fEMG) at baseline and approximately one month later, following an acute psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test). Results show that the magnitude of the endocrine stress response reduced zygomaticus major reactivity, and specifically spontaneous facial mimicry for positive social stimuli (i.e. smiles). Individuals with higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol showed a more blunted fEMG response to smiles, but not to frowns. Conversely, stress had no effect on corrugator supercilii activation (i.e. frowning to frowns). These findings highlight the importance of the biological stress response system in this basic element of social–emotional experience.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 8, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6534557', 'name': 'Jonas P.

However, the question remains as to whether cyclical changes in estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), or both are responsible for HRV fluctuations. We present the first studies to use repeated measures of E2, P4, and HRV across the cycle to model both the unique and interactive effects of person-centered E2 and P4 on HRV in multilevel models. In study one, 40 naturally-cycling participants were assessed weekly across four weeks, and were blind to the cycle focus of the study. In study two, 50 naturally-cycling participants were examined in three precisely defined cycle phases via ovulation testing. Both studies revealed that only P4 was correlated with HRV, such that higher-than-usual P4 significantly predicted lower-than-usual HRV within a given participant. In line with this, cycle phase comparisons revealed lower HRV in the mid-luteal phase (characterized by elevated P4) than in other phases. No significant main or interactive effects of E2 on HRV were found. Future female health studies should investigate individual differences in these effects and potential consequences of cyclical HRV changes on daily functioning.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 76, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31616861', 'name': 'K.

However, the understanding of sources of within-person change (i.e., intra-individual variance) in CVA is lagging behind. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes and quantifies current empirical evidence of within-person changes in measures of CVA across the menstrual cycle in naturally-cycling premenopausal females. We conducted an extensive literature search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement in five databases to identify observational studies with repeated measures of CVA in at least two menstrual cycle phases. A broad meta-analysis (nstudies = 37; nindividuals = 1,004) revealed a significant CVA decrease from the follicular to luteal phase (d = −0.39, 95% CI (−0.67, −0.11)). Furthermore, 21 studies allowed for finer-grained comparisons between each of two cycle phases (menstrual, mid-to-late follicular, ovulatory, early-to-mid luteal, and premenstrual). Significant decreases in CVA were observed from the menstrual to premenstrual (nstudies = 5; nindividuals = 200; d = −1.17, 95% CI (−2.18, −0.17)) and from the mid-to-late follicular to premenstrual phases (nstudies = 8; nindividuals = 280; d = −1.32, 95% CI (−2.35, −0.29)). In conclusion, meta-analyses indicate the presence of CVA fluctuations across the menstrual cycle. Future studies involving CVA should control for cycle phase.

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel and ticlopidine plus Ginkgo biloba in clopidogrel-resistant patients undergoing CAS. Methods: In this multi-center, randomized, controlled trial, we used platelet reactivity test to select patients undergoing CAS who showed clopidogrel resistance, and compared treatments using clopidogrel and ticlopidine plus ginkgo. The primary outcome was the incidence of new ischemic lesion in the ipsilateral hemisphere of CAS. Detection of microembolic signal on transcranial Doppler was the secondary outcome. The clinical outcomes were also monitored. Results: This trial was discontinued after 42 patients were randomized after preplanned interim sample size re-estimation indicated an impractical sample size. The primary endpoint occurred in 12/22 patients (54.5%) in the clopidogrel group and 13/20 patients (65.0%) in the ticlopidine–ginkgo group (P = 0.610). No significant differences in the presence of microembolic signal (15.0 vs. 11.8%, P = 0.580), clinical outcomes (ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, 0.0 vs. 5.5%; acute myocardial infarction 0.0 vs. 0.0%; all-cause death, 4.5 vs. 0.0%), or incidence of adverse events were found in the two groups. In terms of resistance to clopidogrel, treatment with ticlopidine–ginkgo significantly increased the P2Y12 Reaction Units (difference, 0.0 [−0.3–3.0] vs. 21.0 [6.0–35.0], P < 0.001). Conclusions: In patients who showed clopidogrel resistance, ticlopidine–ginkgo treatment was safe and increased P2Y12 Reaction Units; however, compared to clopidogrel, it failed to improve surrogate and clinical endpoints in patients undergoing CAS.

Frequent exercise is robustly associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality as well as the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Physically active individuals have lower blood pressure, higher insulin sensitivity, and a more favorable plasma lipoprotein profile. Animal models of exercise show that repeated physical activity suppresses atherogenesis and increases the availability of vasodilatory mediators such as nitric oxide. Exercise has also been found to have beneficial effects on the heart. Acutely, exercise increases cardiac output and blood pressure, but individuals adapted to exercise show lower resting heart rate and cardiac hypertrophy. Both cardiac and vascular changes have been linked to a variety of changes in tissue metabolism and signaling, although our understanding of the contribution of the underlying mechanisms remains incomplete. Even though moderate levels of exercise have been found to be consistently associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk, there is evidence to suggest that continuously high levels of exercise (e.g., marathon running) could have detrimental effects on cardiovascular health. Nevertheless, a specific dose response relationship between the extent and duration of exercise and the reduction in cardiovascular disease risk and mortality remains unclear. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms that impart cardiovascular benefits of exercise in order to develop more effective exercise regimens, test the interaction of exercise with diet, and develop pharmacological interventions for those unwilling or unable to exercise.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 151, 'citationCount': 366, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5010415', 'name': 'M.

Objective: The goal of this scoping review was to determine which factors pose a significant risk for the onset of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress in patients with heart disease, as well as to identify what might protect them from these afflictions. Method: We conducted a thorough search of relevant medical and psychological databases (Scopus, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Sage Journals, and MEDLINE) and identified 41 studies that met inclusion criteria, which included all types of heart disease. Results: The results of our review indicate that mental health history, the tendency to stifle negative emotional experiences (known as “type D personality”), and social support in patients with heart disease are related to the onset of or protection from depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. These factors, along with gender and younger age, seem to be relatively consistent predictors of mental health problems in this population. Conclusions: As per our results, it is important for clinicians to attend to the mental health history, type D personality, and presence and quality of social support in patients with heart disease. More research into prevention and gender differences is necessary to hone the detection and treatment of these problems in people with heart disease. Clinical Implications: Attention to their mental health history, their ability to express and regulate affect, their age, and their gender will most likely assist in identifying symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress in people with cardiac disease.

The implementation of such fight-or-flight decisions is a central aspect in the genesis and evolution of aggression episodes, yet it is usually investigated only indirectly or in nonsocial situations. In the present fMRI study, we aimed to distinguish brain regions associated with aggressive and avoidant responses to interpersonal provocation in humans. Participants (thirty-six healthy young women) could either avoid or face a highly (HP) and a lowly (LP) provoking opponent in a competitive reaction time task: the fight-or-escape (FOE) paradigm. Subjects avoided the HP more often, but retaliated when facing her. Moreover, they chose to fight the HP more quickly, and showed increased heart rate (HR) right before confronting her. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and sensorimotor cortex were more active when participants decided to fight, whereas the mentalizing network was engaged when deciding to avoid. Importantly, avoiding the HP relative to the LP was associated with both higher activation in the right basolateral amygdala and lower relative activity in several mentalizing regions [e.g., medial and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), temporal-parietal junction (TPJ)]. These results suggest that avoidant responses to provocation might result from heightened threat anticipation and are associated with reduced perspective taking. Furthermore, our study helps to reconcile conflicting findings on the role of the mentalizing network, the amygdala, and the OFC in aggression.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 108, 'citationCount': 22, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1423438118', 'name': 'Macià Buades-Rotger'}, {'authorId': '39512687', 'name': 'Frederike Beyer'}, {'authorId': '31451042', 'name': 'U.

Typically, features of emotion regulation are assessed with self-report questionnaires. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an objective measure proposed as an index of emotional regulation capacity. A limited number of studies have shown that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation are associated with HRV. However, results from prior studies are inconclusive, and an ecological validation of the association has not yet been tested. Therefore, further exploration of the relation between self-report questionnaires and psychophysiological measures of emotional regulation is needed. The present study investigated the contribution of self-reported emotion regulation difficulties on HRV in a student sample. We expected higher scores on emotion regulation difficulties to be associated with lower vagus-mediated HRV (vmHRV). Sixty-three participants filled out the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and their resting HRV was assessed. In addition, a subsample of participants provided ambulatory 24-h HRV data, in order to ecologically validate the resting data. Correlation analyses indicated that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation was negatively associated with vmHRV in both resting HRV and 24-h HRV.

Comparisons with nonhuman apes point to our early‐emerging cooperative‐communicative abilities as crucial to the evolution of all forms of human cultural cognition, including language. The human self‐domestication hypothesis proposes that these early‐emerging social skills evolved when natural selection favored increased in‐group prosociality over aggression in late human evolution. As a by‐product of this selection, humans are predicted to show traits of the domestication syndrome observed in other domestic animals. In reviewing comparative, developmental, neurobiological, and paleoanthropological research, compelling evidence emerges for the predicted relationship between unique human mentalizing abilities, tolerance, and the domestication syndrome in humans.

In humans, androstadienone (ANDR), a synthetic male steroid, is a socially relevant chemosignal exhibited to increase positive mood and cortisol levels specifically in (periovulatory) females in positively arousing contexts. In a negative context, we expected that such effects of ANDR could amplify social evaluative threat depending on the stress sensitivity, which differs between menstrual cycle phases. Therefore, this fMRI study aimed to examine psychosocial stress reactions on behavioral, hormonal and neural levels in 31 naturally cycling females, between 15 early follicular (EF) and 16 mid-luteal (ML) females tested with ANDR and placebo treatment in a repeated-measures design. Regardless of odor stimulation, psychosocial stress (i.e., mental arithmetic task with social evaluative threat) led to elevated negative mood and anxiety in all females. A negative association of social threat related amygdala activation and competence ratings appeared in ML-females, indicating enhanced threat processing by ANDR, particularly in ML-females who felt less competent early in the stress experience. Further, ML-females showed reduced performance and stronger stress-related hippocampus activation compared to EF-females under ANDR. Hippocampal activation in ML-females also correlated positively with post-stress subjective stress. Contrarily, such patterns were not observed in EF-females or under placebo in either group. Strikingly, unlike passive emotional processing, ANDR in a stressful context decreased cortisol concentration in all females. This points to a more complex interaction of ovarian/gonadal hormones in social threat processing and stress reactivity. Our findings suggest that ANDR enhanced initial evaluation of self-related social threat in ML-females. Female stress reactions are related to stress sensitivity through enhanced awareness and processing of social cues in a stressful context, with menstrual cycle phase being a critical factor.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 34, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2107172587', 'name': 'K.

We hypothesized that emotional reactivity, measured as fear potentiation (FP) of the startle response, would be negatively associated with aggressive behavior and would modulate neural activity during an aggressive interaction. In 30 healthy female participants, FP was measured as the difference between blink amplitudes while watching threatening vs neutral pictures.

During the TAP, participants selected a punishment level for either a highly provoking or a nonprovoking opponent.

Acute mental stress can activate the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis, eliciting the release of catecholamines (NE and EPI) resulting in the elevation of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Combined stress (psychological and physical) can exacerbate these cardiovascular responses, which may partially contribute to the elevated risk of CVD and increased proportionate mortality risks experienced by some occupations (e.g., firefighting and law enforcement). Studies have supported the benefits of physical activity on physiological and psychological health, including the cardiovascular response to acute stress. Aerobically trained individuals exhibit lower sympathetic nervous system (e.g., HR) reactivity and enhanced cardiovascular efficiency (e.g., lower vascular reactivity and decreased recovery time) in response to physical and/or psychological stress. In addition, resistance training has been demonstrated to attenuate cardiovascular responses and improve mental health. This review will examine stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity and plausible explanations for how exercise training and physical fitness (aerobic and resistance exercise) can attenuate cardiovascular responses to stress. This enhanced functionality may facilitate a reduction in the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction.

We examined relations between temperament and false-belief understanding in 102 preschool-age children from China and the United States. Temperament was measured via parental ratings of behavior as well as with physiological measures of children's reactivity (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis reactivity gauged via salivary cortisol). In accord with an emotional reactivity hypothesis, children with certain reactive temperaments--specifically, those who were more aggressive and those who were both socially withdrawn and physiologically reactive--evidenced poorer social-cognition. However, our findings also force amendment to the ontogenetic emotional reactivity hypothesis. For the majority of children in both countries, physiological reactivity predicted more advanced ToM, perhaps by facilitating social engagement and attention to social stimuli. Moreover, children who were withdrawn from social interaction yet nonreactive, especially Chinese children of this temperament, evidenced advanced ToM.

Holding two such beliefs in mind—one false and one true—is no simple feat, and up until a few years ago, it was generally accepted that such a capacity did not arise until children were 3 to 4 years old. Since then, a flurry of studies, using a variety of interrogation measures, has suggested that much-younger humans might, in fact, possess this capacity, commonly referred to as a theory of mind. Kovács et al. (p. 1830) devised an ingenious behavioral paradigm and applied it both to adults and to infants, which suggests that the representations of others' beliefs are indeed formed in the same way in adults and in infants. Knowledge of what others believe is present in 7-month-old infants. Human social interactions crucially depend on the ability to represent other agents’ beliefs even when these contradict our own beliefs, leading to the potentially complex problem of simultaneously holding two conflicting representations in mind. Here, we show that adults and 7-month-olds automatically encode others’ beliefs, and that, surprisingly, others’ beliefs have similar effects as the participants’ own beliefs. In a visual object detection task, participants’ beliefs and the beliefs of an agent (whose beliefs were irrelevant to performing the task) both modulated adults’ reaction times and infants’ looking times. Moreover, the agent’s beliefs influenced participants’ behavior even after the agent had left the scene, suggesting that participants computed the agent’s beliefs online and sustained them, possibly for future predictions about the agent’s behavior. Hence, the mere presence of an agent automatically triggers powerful processes of belief computation that may be part of a “social sense” crucial to human societies."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 21, 'citationCount': 702, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145454261', 'name': 'Á.

The program was assessed to determine if it improved social skills at school and home, and whether improvements were maintained. Methods: Eighty-four students participated. Key outcomes were parent and teacher ratings of emotion regulation, social skills, and direct child social problem-solving measures. The standard school curriculum served as the control condition. Phase 1 was a two-group waitlist-control comparison of SAS versus the standard curriculum. Phase 2 was a follow up of all participants before and after the intervention and at 12-months post-intervention. Results: Parent and child measures improved after the intervention but not in the waitlist condition. Improvements in parent, child, and teacher measures were apparent at 12 months.

This study compares child outcomes of two social skills interventions conducted in schools with children in Kindergarten through fifth grade.\n\n\nMETHOD\nChildren with ASD were randomized to one of two interventions that varied on group composition (mixed typical and ASD vs. all ASD or social difficulties) and intervention approach (didactic SKILLS based vs. activity-based ENGAGE groups). Interventions were implemented at school for 8 weeks (16 sessions) with an 8-week follow-up. Innovative measures of peer nomination and playground peer engagement, as well as teacher reports of child behavior problems and teacher-child relationship were analyzed for 137 children with ASD across four sites.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOn the primary outcome of social network connections from the peer nomination measure, there was no main effect of treatment, but there were moderator effects. Children with low teacher-child closeness or high conflict improved more in their social connections if they received the SKILLS intervention, whereas children with higher teacher-child closeness improved more if they received the ENGAGE intervention. Only two secondary outcome measures yielded significant effects of treatment. Children in the SKILLS groups increased peer engagement and decreased isolation during recess. Child behavior problems and teacher-child closeness moderated peer engagement such that children with higher behavior problems and lower closeness benefitted more from SKILLS groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that social skills groups conducted at school can affect both peer engagement during recess as well as peer acceptability. Child characteristics and teacher-child relationship prior to intervention yield important information on who might benefit from a specific social skills intervention.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 25, 'citationCount': 118, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2592071', 'name': 'C.

UOT is contextually-based because it is implemented in school and at home, the contexts in which a child uses EF skills.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of UOT compared with a social skills intervention (SS), 3rd-5th graders with ASD (mean IQ\xa0=\xa0108; UOT n\xa0=\xa047; SS n\xa0=\xa020) received interventions delivered by school staff in small group sessions. Students were matched for gender, age, race, IQ, ASD symptomotolgy, medication status, and parents' education. Interventions were matched for 'dose' of intervention and training. Measures of pre-post change included classroom observations, parent/teacher report, and direct child measures of problem-solving, EF, and social skills.

ADDM surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase consists of screening and abstracting comprehensive evaluations performed by professional providers in the community. Multiple data sources for these evaluations include general pediatric health clinics and specialized programs for children with developmental disabilities. In addition, most ADDM Network sites also review and abstract records of children receiving special education services in public schools. The second phase involves review of all abstracted evaluations by trained clinicians to determine ASD surveillance case status. A child meets the surveillance case definition for ASD if a comprehensive evaluation of that child completed by a qualified professional describes behaviors consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for any of the following conditions: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (including atypical autism), or Asperger disorder. This report provides updated prevalence estimates for ASD from the 2010 surveillance year. In addition to prevalence estimates, characteristics of the population of children with ASD are described.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor 2010, the overall prevalence of ASD among the ADDM sites was 14.7 per 1,000 (one in 68) children aged 8 years. Overall ASD prevalence estimates varied among sites from 5.7 to 21.9 per 1,000 children aged 8 years. ASD prevalence estimates also varied by sex and racial/ethnic group. Approximately one in 42 boys and one in 189 girls living in the ADDM Network communities were identified as having ASD. Non-Hispanic white children were approximately 30% more likely to be identified with ASD than non-Hispanic black children and were almost 50% more likely to be identified with ASD than Hispanic children. Among the seven sites with sufficient data on intellectual ability, 31% of children with ASD were classified as having IQ scores in the range of intellectual disability (IQ ≤70), 23% in the borderline range (IQ = 71-85), and 46% in the average or above average range of intellectual ability (IQ >85). The proportion of children classified in the range of intellectual disability differed by race/ethnicity. Approximately 48% of non-Hispanic black children with ASD were classified in the range of intellectual disability compared with 38% of Hispanic children and 25% of non-Hispanic white children. The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 53 months and did not differ significantly by sex or race/ethnicity.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThese findings from CDC's ADDM Network, which are based on 2010 data reported from 11 sites, provide updated population-based estimates of the prevalence of ASD in multiple communities in the United States. Because the ADDM Network sites do not provide a representative sample of the entire United States, the combined prevalence estimates presented in this report cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the United States population. Consistent with previous reports from the ADDM Network, findings from the 2010 surveillance year were marked by significant variations in ASD prevalence by geographic area, sex, race/ethnicity, and level of intellectual ability. The extent to which this variation might be attributable to diagnostic practices, underrecognition of ASD symptoms in some racial/ethnic groups, socioeconomic disparities in access to services, and regional differences in clinical or school-based practices that might influence the findings in this report is unclear.\n\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTION\nADDM Network investigators will continue to monitor the prevalence of ASD in select communities, with a focus on exploring changes within these communities that might affect both the observed prevalence of ASD and population-based characteristics of children identified with ASD. Although ASD is sometimes diagnosed by 2 years of age, the median age of the first ASD diagnosis remains older than age 4 years in the ADDM Network communities. Recommendations from the ADDM Network include enhancing strategies to address the need for 1) standardized, widely adopted measures to document ASD severity and functional limitations associated with ASD diagnosis; 2) improved recognition and documentation of symptoms of ASD, particularly among both boys and girls, children without intellectual disability, and children in all racial/ethnic groups; and 3) decreasing the age when children receive their first evaluation for and a diagnosis of ASD and are enrolled in community-based support systems."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 2335, 'authors': [{'authorId': '123588846', 'name': 'J.

Social skills groups are a common intervention for individuals with ASD. Although a frequently recommended practice, the few studies that have addressed the efficacy of social skills groups have shown mixed results.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the effectiveness of social skills groups for improving social competence, social communication, and quality of life for people with ASD who are six to 21 years of age.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the following databases in December 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 50, 2011), PsycINFO (1887 to December Week 2, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), OCLC WorldCat (12 December 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 16 December 2011), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (20 December 2011). We also searched the reference lists of published papers.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population. No differences were found between treatment and control groups in relation to emotional recognition (ES = 0.34, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.21) assessed in two studies or social communication as related to the understanding of idioms (ES = 0.05, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.72, P = 0.89), which was assessed in only one study. Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported. Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere is some evidence that social skills groups can improve social competence for some children and adolescents with ASD.

Whereas NHST uses probability levels (e.g., p < .05) to evaluate the results of studies, effect size analyses focus on the magnitude of differences between groups or contrasting conditions and the strength of the relationship among variables of interest to report and interpret study results. Two families of effect sizes are described (mean difference, correlation coefficients) that are likely to be applicable to most intellectual and developmental disability studies.

Autism is diagnosed when features meet the criteria defined in the ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)1 and the DSM-IV-TR (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, revised)2 for “pervasive developmental disorder” and have a considerable impact on function. Core autism behaviours are typically present in early childhood, but are not always apparent until the circumstances of the child or young person change—for example, when the child goes to nursery or primary school or moves to secondary school. Autism is also associated with several coexisting conditions including neurodevelopmental, medical, and mental health problems. Autism was once thought to be an uncommon developmental disorder, but recent studies have reported increased prevalence and the condition is now thought to occur in at least 1% of children.3 4 5 This has increased demand for diagnostic services for children and young people of all ages in the health service. This article summarises the most recent recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on how to recognise and diagnose autism in children and young people up to the age of 19 years.6 This summary focuses on recommendations for the non-specialist on how to recognise the condition and when to refer to a specialist autism team.\n\nNICE recommendations are based on systematic reviews of best available evidence and explicit consideration of cost effectiveness.

If the prevalence of autism is increasing, rates in older adults would be expected to be lower than rates among younger adults.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo estimate the prevalence and characteristics of adults with ASD living in the community in England.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA stratified, multiphase random sample was used in the third national survey of psychiatric morbidity in adults in England in 2007. Survey data were weighted to take account of study design and nonresponse so that the results were representative of the household population.\n\n\nSETTING\nGeneral community (ie, private households) in England.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nAdults (people 16 years or older).\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nAutism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Module 4 in phase 2 validated against the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders in phase 3. A 20-item subset of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient self-completion questionnaire was used in phase 1 to select respondents for phase 2. Respondents also provided information on sociodemographics and their use of mental health services.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 7461 adult participants who provided a complete phase 1 interview, 618 completed phase 2 diagnostic assessments. The weighted prevalence of ASD in adults was estimated to be 9.8 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 3.0-16.5). Prevalence was not related to the respondent's age. Rates were higher in men, those without educational qualifications, and those living in rented social (government-financed) housing. There was no evidence of increased use of services for mental health problems.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nConducting epidemiologic research on ASD in adults is feasible. The prevalence of ASD in this population is similar to that found in children. The lack of an association with age is consistent with there having been no increase in prevalence and with its causes being temporally constant. Adults with ASD living in the community are socially disadvantaged and tend to be unrecognized."", 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 839, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2062837957', 'name': 'T.

This study sought to improve social communication for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by means of a groupwork intervention focusing on social and emotional perspective‐taking, conversation skills, and friendship skills. It also aimed to address some of the limitations of previous interventions, including a lack of generalisation to other settings, so as to maximise inclusion in the community.

24,24,24,24,35,4e413298a71799a6088c973ad8eb4a2cf3f107cb,Individual differences in valence bias: fMRI evidence of the initial negativity hypothesis,"Abstract Facial expressions offer an ecologically valid model for examining individual differences in affective decision-making. They convey an emotional signal from a social agent and provide important predictive information about one’s environment (presence of potential rewards or threats). Although some expressions provide clear predictive information (angry, happy), others (surprised) are ambiguous in that they predict both positive and negative outcomes. Thus, surprised faces can delineate an individual’s valence bias, or the tendency to interpret ambiguity as positive or negative. Our initial negativity hypothesis suggests that the initial response to ambiguity is negative, and that positivity relies on emotion regulation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing brain activity during explicit emotion regulation (reappraisal) and while freely viewing facial expressions, and measuring the relationship between brain activity and valence bias. Brain regions recruited during reappraisal showed greater activity for surprise in individuals with an increasingly positive valence bias. Additionally, we linked amygdala activity with an initial negativity, revealing a pattern similarity in individuals with negative bias between viewing surprised faces and maintaining negativity. Finally, these individuals failed to show normal habituation to clear negativity. These results support the initial negativity hypothesis, and are consistent with emotion research in both children and adult populations.",2018,95,34,"{'name': 'Social Cognitive and Affective

For example, although some facial expressions (e.g. happy, angry) convey a clear affective meaning, others (e.g. surprise) are ambiguous, in that their meaning is determined by the context. Here, we used mouse-tracking to examine the underlying process of resolving uncertainty. Previous work has suggested an initial negativity, in part via faster response times for negative than positive ratings of surprise. We examined valence categorizations of filtered images in order to compare faster (low spatial frequencies; LSF) versus more deliberate processing (high spatial frequencies; HSF). When participants categorised faces as “positive”, they first exhibited a partial attraction toward the competing (“negative”) response option, and this effect was exacerbated for HSF than LSF faces. Thus, the effect of response conflict due to an initial negativity bias was exaggerated for HSF faces, likely because these images allow for greater deliberation than the LSFs. These results are consistent with the notion that more positive categorizations are characterised by an initial attraction to a default, negative response.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 11, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144448112', 'name': 'M.

However, little research has examined the relationship between PA and decision-making within emotionally ambiguous contexts. The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between reported amount and intensity of PA and interpretations of emotional ambiguity. Methods Adults (n = 611) recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk were assessed on their interpretations of ambiguous and clear (unambiguous) emotional stimuli and reported habitual PA and exercise. Results More positive ratings of ambiguity were associated with greater amount of vigorous activity (p = .002), but not with moderate activity (p = .826) or walking (p = .673). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that this relationship between vigorous PA and positive interpretations of ambiguity was most pronounced when comparing individuals who reported any amount of vigorous PA to those who reported no vigorous activity at all. Conclusions Our findings suggest that higher amounts of vigorous, but not moderate, PA are associated with more positive interpretations of ambiguity, and that even small amounts of PA seem to be sufficient to promote this more positive valence bias when compared to individuals conducting no vigorous PA at all.

Without a clarifying context, surprise is interpreted as positive by some and negative by others, and this valence bias is stable across time. When compared to fearful expressions, which are consistently rated as negative, surprise and fear share similar morphological features (e.g., widened eyes) primarily in the upper part of the face. Recently, we demonstrated that the valence bias was associated with a specific pattern of eye movements (positive bias associated with faster fixation to the lower part of the face). In this follow-up, we identified two participants from our previous study who had the most positive and most negative valence bias. We used their eye movements to create a moving window such that new participants viewed faces through the eyes of one our previous participants (subjects saw only the areas of the face that were directly fixated by the original participants in the exact order they were fixated; i.e., Simulated Eye-movement Experience). The input provided by these windows modulated the valence ratings of surprise, but not fear faces. These findings suggest there are meaningful individual differences in how people process faces, and that these differences impact our emotional perceptions.

While some expressions clearly signal negative (anger) or positive (happy) events, other expressions (e.g. surprise) are more ambiguous in that they can predict either valence, depending on the context. Here, we sought to determine whether unpredictable presentations of ambiguous facial expressions would bias participants to interpret them more negatively. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and facial electromyography (EMG) to characterize responses to predictable vs unpredictable presentations of surprised faces. We observed moderate but sustained increases in amygdala reactivity to predictable presentations of surprised faces, and relatively increased amygdala responses to unpredictable faces that then habituated, similar to previously observed responses to clearly negative (e.g. fearful) faces. We also observed decreased corrugator EMG responses to predictable surprised face presentations, similar to happy faces, and increased responses to unpredictable surprised face presentations, similar to angry faces.

We used a meta-analysis of 397 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography studies (containing 914 experimental contrasts and 6827 participants) to test 3 competing hypotheses about the brain basis of valence: the bipolarity hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by a brain system that monotonically increases and/or decreases along the valence dimension, the bivalent hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by independent brain systems, and the affective workspace hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by a flexible set of valence-general regions.

Despite these individual differences in valence bias, the more automatic interpretation is negative, and positivity appears to require regulation. Interestingly, extant research has shown that there is an age-related positivity effect such that relative to young adults, older adults attend to and remember positive more than negative information. In this report, the authors show that this positivity effect extends to emotional ambiguity (Experiment 1). Eighty participants (aged 19-71, 42 females) rated the valence of images with a clear or ambiguous valence. They found that age correlated with valence bias, such that older adults showed a more positive bias, and they took longer to rate images, than younger adults. They also found that this increase in reaction times was sufficient to bias positivity (Experiment 2). Thirty-four participants (aged 18-28, 24 females) rated ambiguous and clear images, before and after an instruction to delay their RTs. They also found that although ratings among individuals with a positive bias did not change, those with a negative bias became more positive when encouraged to delay. Indeed, participants with the strongest negativity bias showed the greatest increase in RTs. Taken together, this work demonstrates that the valence bias, which represents a stable, trait-like difference across people, can be moved in the positive direction, at least temporarily, when participants are encouraged to take their time and consider alternatives.

Given the hedonic potency of odor stimuli and the amygdala's anatomical proximity to the peripheral olfactory system, we combined high-resolution fMRI with pattern-based multivariate techniques to examine how valence information is encoded in the amygdala. Ten human subjects underwent fMRI scanning while smelling 9 odorants that systematically varied in perceived valence. Representational similarity analyses showed that amygdala codes the entire dimension of valence, ranging from pleasantness to unpleasantness. This unidimensional representation significantly correlated with self-reported valence ratings but not with intensity ratings. Furthermore, within-trial valence representations evolved over time, prioritizing earlier differentiation of unpleasant stimuli. Together, these findings underscore the idea that both spatial and temporal features uniquely encode pleasant and unpleasant odor valence in the amygdala. The availability of a unidimensional valence code in the amygdala, distributed in both space and time, would create greater flexibility in determining the pleasantness or unpleasantness of stimuli, providing a mechanism by which expectation, context, attention, and learning could influence affective boundaries for guiding behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our findings elucidate the mechanisms of affective processing in the amygdala by demonstrating that this brain region represents the entire valence dimension from pleasant to unpleasant. An important implication of this unidimensional valence code is that pleasant and unpleasant valence cannot coexist in the amygdale because overlap of fMRI ensemble patterns for these two valence extremes obscures their unique content. This functional architecture, whereby subjective valence maps onto a pattern continuum between pleasant and unpleasant poles, offers a robust mechanism by which context, expectation, and experience could alter the set-point for valence-based behavior. Finally, identification of spatial and temporal differentiation of valence in amygdala may shed new insights into individual differences in emotional responding, with potential relevance for affective disorders."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 84, 'citationCount': 75, 'authors': [{'authorId': '50736596', 'name': 'Jingwen Jin'}, {'authorId': '5175168', 'name': 'C.

These behavioral findings might reflect anxiety-related biases in stimulus representation within the human amygdala. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) together with a continuous adaptation design to investigate the representation of faces from three expression continua (surprise-fear, sadness-fear, and surprise-sadness) within the amygdala and other brain regions implicated in face processing. Fifty-four healthy adult participants completed a face expression categorization task. Nineteen of these participants also viewed the same expressions presented using type 1 index 1 sequences while fMRI data were acquired. Behavioral analyses revealed an anxiety-related categorization bias in the surprise-fear continuum alone. Here, elevated anxiety was associated with a more rapid transition from surprise to fear responses as a function of percentage fear in the face presented, leading to increased fear categorizations for faces with a mid-way blend of surprise and fear. fMRI analyses revealed that high trait anxious participants also showed greater representational similarity, as indexed by greater adaptation of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, between 50/50 surprise/fear expression blends and faces from the fear end of the surprise-fear continuum in both the right amygdala and right fusiform face area (FFA). No equivalent biases were observed for the other expression continua. These findings suggest that anxiety-related biases in the processing of expressions intermediate between surprise and fear may be linked to differential representation of these stimuli in the amygdala and FFA.

One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala, whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC, and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions. This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus, and these altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 133, 'citationCount': 1419, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4522200', 'name': 'J.

In this study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the time course of amygdala activity in healthy adults in response to presentation of negative images. We split the amygdala time course into an initial reactivity period and a recovery period beginning after the offset of the stimulus. We find that initial reactivity in the amygdala does not predict trait measures of affective style. Conversely, amygdala recovery shows predictive power such that slower amygdala recovery from negative images predicts greater trait neuroticism, in addition to lower levels of likability of a set of social stimuli (neutral faces).

Under typical environmental conditions, prefrontal cortex connections with the amygdala are immature during childhood and become adult-like during adolescence. Rodent models show that maternal deprivation accelerates this development as an ontogenetic adaptation to adversity. Here, we demonstrate that, as in the rodent, children who experienced early maternal deprivation exhibit early emergence of mature amygdala–prefrontal connectivity. Evidence suggests that the adult-like neural phenotype, which is mediated by cortisol levels, confers some degree of enhanced emotion regulation, as maternally deprived youths with adult-like phenotypes are less anxious than their counterparts with immature phenotypes. Accelerated amygdala–prefrontal development may serve as an ontogenetic adaptation in the human in response to early adversity. Under typical conditions, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) connections with the amygdala are immature during childhood and become adult-like during adolescence. Rodent models show that maternal deprivation accelerates this development, prompting examination of human amygdala–mPFC phenotypes following maternal deprivation. Previously institutionalized youths, who experienced early maternal deprivation, exhibited atypical amygdala–mPFC connectivity. Specifically, unlike the immature connectivity (positive amygdala–mPFC coupling) of comparison children, children with a history of early adversity evidenced mature connectivity (negative amygdala–mPFC coupling) and thus, resembled the adolescent phenotype. This connectivity pattern was mediated by the hormone cortisol, suggesting that stress-induced modifications of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis shape amygdala–mPFC circuitry. Despite being age-atypical, negative amygdala–mPFC coupling conferred some degree of reduced anxiety, although anxiety was still significantly higher in the previously institutionalized group. These findings suggest that accelerated amygdala–mPFC development is an ontogenetic adaptation in response to early adversity.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 73, 'citationCount': 669, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2264433', 'name': 'D.

However, much of this work has been conducted in the context of semantic and low-level visual processing. An open question is whether ambiguity in social signals (e.g., emotional facial expressions) is processed similarly or whether a unique set of processors come on-line to resolve ambiguity in a social context. Our work has examined ambiguity using surprised facial expressions, as they have predicted both positive and negative outcomes in the past. Specifically, whereas some people tended to interpret surprise as negatively valenced, others tended toward a more positive interpretation. Here, we examined neural responses to social ambiguity using faces (surprise) and nonface emotional scenes (International Affective Picture System). Moreover, we examined whether these effects are specific to ambiguity resolution (i.e., judgments about the ambiguity) or whether similar effects would be demonstrated for incidental judgments (e.g., nonvalence judgments about ambiguously valenced stimuli). We found that a distinct task control (i.e., cingulo-opercular) network was more active when resolving ambiguity. We also found that activity in the ventral amygdala was greater to faces and scenes that were rated explicitly along the dimension of valence, consistent with findings that the ventral amygdala tracks valence.

We hypothesized that during childhood, the default negativity mode would be more evident than in adulthood and, as a group, children would show a negativity bias when processing ambiguous facial expressions. We examined ratings of two ambiguous expressions, surprised and neutral expressions, from childhood through adolescence and recorded facial corrugator muscle activity, a physiological index of negative appraisals. Surprised faces were rated as conveying clear negative affect by younger participants as indexed by fast RTs and negative ratings, and corrugator data showed a corresponding increase in activity to surprised faces. By adolescence, positive ratings of surprised faces became more frequent and RTs slowed, suggesting that surprised faces were perceived as having more ambiguous meaning. Accordingly, corrugator activity also decreased during adolescence. Neutral faces also produced negative ratings by children, but were also rated as conveying negative affect by older participants. Accordingly, neutral faces also elicited high corrugator activity that was similar to that elicited by negative expressions.

Our investigation focused on two key brain regions involved in response to novelty—the amygdala and the hippocampus. Habituation to neutral faces in the amygdala and hippocampus differed significantly by temperament group. Individuals with an uninhibited temperament demonstrated habituation in both the amygdala and hippocampus, as expected. In contrast, in individuals with an inhibited temperament, the amygdala and hippocampus failed to habituate across repeated presentations of faces. The failure of the amygdala and hippocampus to habituate to faces represents a novel neural substrate mediating the behavioral differences seen in individuals with an inhibited temperament.

In a separate line of research, it has been shown that surprised facial expressions are ambiguous in that they can be interpreted as either negatively or positively valenced. More negative interpretations of surprise are associated with increased ventral amygdala activity. In this report, we show that LSF presentations of surprised expressions bias the interpretation of surprised expressions in a negative direction, a finding suggesting that negative interpretations are first and fast during the resolution of ambiguous valence.

The authors recently reported that in healthy volunteers the pregenual anterior cingulate regulates emotional conflict on a trial-by-trial basis by dampening activity in the amygdala. The authors also showed that this process is specific to the regulation of emotional, compared to nonemotional, conflict. Here the authors examined whether this form of noninstructed emotion regulation is perturbed in generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n\nMETHOD\nSeventeen patients with generalized anxiety disorder and 24 healthy comparison subjects underwent functional MRI while performing an emotional conflict task that involved categorizing facial affect while ignoring overlaid affect label words. Behavioral and neural measures were used to compare trial-by-trial changes in conflict regulation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nComparison subjects effectively regulated emotional conflict from trial to trial, even though they were unaware of having done so. By contrast, patients with generalized anxiety disorder were completely unable to regulate emotional conflict and failed to engage the pregenual anterior cingulate in ways that would dampen amygdalar activity. Moreover, performance and brain activation were correlated with symptoms and could be used to accurately classify the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data demonstrate that patients with generalized anxiety disorder show significant deficits in the noninstructed and spontaneous regulation of emotional processing.

Sixteen patients underwent functional MRI while reacting to negative self-beliefs and while regulating negative emotions using 2 types of attention deployment emotion regulation-breath-focused attention and distraction-focused attention. Post-MBSR, 14 patients completed neuroimaging assessments. Compared with baseline, MBSR completers showed improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms and self-esteem. During the breath-focused attention task (but not the distraction-focused attention task), they also showed (a) decreased negative emotion experience, (b) reduced amygdala activity, and (c) increased activity in brain regions implicated in attentional deployment.

Taken together, prior research on amygdala function and development reveals a need for more work examining developmental changes in the amygdala's response to fearful faces and in amygdala functional connectivity during face processing. The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare 31 adolescents (917 years old) and 30 adults (2140 years old) on activation to fearful faces in the amygdala and other regions implicated in face processing. Moreover, these data were used to compare patterns of amygdala functional connectivity in adolescents and adults. During passive viewing, adolescents demonstrated greater amygdala and fusiform activation to fearful faces than did adults. Functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus in adults than in adolescents. Within each group, variability in age did not correlate with amygdala response, and sex-related developmental differences in amygdala response were not found. Eye movement data collected outside of the magnetic resonance imaging scanner using the same task suggested that developmental differences in amygdala activation were not attributable to differences in eye-gaze patterns.

Regulation also modulated activity in the amygdala, a key emotion-processing region. Regulation effects on amygdala activity were larger for positive than for negative stimuli, potentially reflecting a greater malleability of positive emotional reactions.

Both mechanisms are related to a system for control and modulation of visceral function stretching from the spinal cord to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and mediodorsal thalamus, the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the brainstem reticular formation and autonomic nuclei. Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the PAG and hypothalamus coordinate these to produce more concerted responses. The amygdala interacts with the cortical sensory systems in the assessment of fear‐related stimuli and modulates the reflex responses through projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, especially the “medial prefrontal network,” is connected to the amygdala, hypothalamus, and PAG, and allows cortical control over the system in relation to a wider set of emotions. This cortical region is involved both in the assessment of reward and in mood disorders and it plays a central role in the ability to discern the consequences of one's actions and make appropriate behavioral choices. It also forms an interconnected circuit with specific cortical areas in the rostral superior temporal cortex, posterior parahippocampal cortex, and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex.

In the present fMRI study, we sought to assess amygdalamedial prefrontal cortex responsivity when the interpretations of surprised faces were determined by contextual experimental stimuli, rather than subjective judgment. Subjects passively viewed individual presentations of surprised faces preceded by either a negatively or positively valenced contextual sentence (e.g., She just found 500 vs. She just lost 500). Negative and positive sentences were carefully matched in terms of length, situations described, and arousal level. Negatively cued surprised faces produced greater ventral amygdala activation compared to positively cued surprised faces. Responses to negative versus positive sentences were greater within the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas responses to positive versus negative sentences were greater within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

In this article, this body of research and theory is applied specifically to positive affect and well-being. The central substrates and peripheral biological correlates of well-being are described. A resilient affective style is associated with high levels of left prefrontal activation, effective modulation of activation in the amygdala and fast recovery in response to negative and stressful events. In peripheral biology, these central patterns are associated with lower levels of basal cortisol and with higher levels of antibody titres to influenza vaccine.

An urban community sample of 205 (114 females, 90 males; 27% minority) children were recruited in elementary school and followed over 10 years. Multiple methods and informants were utilized to assess three major domains of competence from childhood through adolescence (academic achievement, conduct, and peer social competence), multiple aspects of adversity, and major psychosocial resources. Both variable-centered and person-centered analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized significance of resources for resilience. Better intellectual functioning and parenting resources were associated with good outcomes across competence domains, even in the context of severe, chronic adversity. IQ and parenting appeared to have a specific protective role with respect to antisocial behavior. Resilient adolescents (high adversity, adequate competence across three domains) had much in common with their low-adversity competent peers, including average or better IQ, parenting, and psychological well-being. Resilient individuals differed markedly from their high adversity, maladaptive peers who had few resources and high negative emotionality.

Although subjects reported seeing only neutral faces, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in the amygdala was significantly higher during viewing of masked fearful faces than during the viewing of masked happy faces. This difference was composed of significant signal increases in the amygdala to masked fearful faces as well as significant signal decreases to masked happy faces, consistent with the notion that the level of amygdala activation is affected differentially by the emotional valence of external stimuli. In addition, these facial expressions activated the sublenticular substantia innominata (SI), where signal increases were observed to both fearful and happy faces—suggesting a spatial dissociation of territories that respond to emotional valence versus salience or arousal value.

This paper describes a direct amygdaloid projection to medullary sensory and motor structures involved in cardiovascular regulation, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the dorsal motor nucleus (DVN), by the use of autoradiographic anterograde transport and retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) techniques in rabbits. Since all of these structures are highly heterogeneous structurally and functionally, details of the specific areas of the neuronal origin and efferent distribution of the projection were examined in relation to these features and with reference to a cytoarchitecture description of the relevant forebrain regions in the rabbit. Amygdaloid projections to the NTS and DVN, as determined from HRP experiments, arise from an extensive population of neurons concentrated exclusively within the ipsilateral central nucleus and confined to and distributed throughout a large medial subdivision of this nucleus. Projection neurons, however, also distribute without apparent interruption beyond the amygdala dorsomedially into the sublenticular substantia innominata and the lateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and thus delineate a single entity of possible anatomical unity across all three structures, extending rostrocaudally within the basal forebrain as a diagonal band. Descending central nucleus connections, based upon autoradiographic experiments, project heavily and extensively to both the NTS and the DVN. Within both nuclei, the projections have a highly specific distribution pattern, appearing to correspond largely to structural subdivisions, including the dorsomedial, medial, ventrolateral, ventral, and commissural NTS, and to cell group “a,” a caudally located dorsomedial region, and peripheral regions of the DVN, some of which appear to be involved in cardiovascular regulation. The existence of such an extensive projection system connecting these specific regions is significant evidence in support to its potential for participation in the amygdaloid expression of cardiovascular influences and has important implications for the cellular analysis of the functional role of these influences.', 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 437, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2087042574', 'name': 'J.

They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task.

During a critical period of time, however, there is an urgent need for the information contained in this book. I, and others interested in getting the latest update of a rapidly changing field, might do well to push our local libraries to obtain this handy and informative volume. Both William James and Sigmund Freud believed in their time that the neural basis of emotion and memory is a most compelling but elusive area of study. Despite the great advances made in the neurosciences in the last decade, the study of psychobiology is still an unsettled frontier. A wealth of new techniques have, however, finally opened this fundamental area of research to experimental analysis. John Aggleton, of the University of Durham, has assembled a formidable group of clinical and laboratory investigators to present the latest and most exciting findings in the field of psychobiology in The Amygdala: Neurobiological Aspects of Emotion, Memory, and Mental Dysfunction. The amygdala complex, a mass of gray matter located in the medial part of the temporal lobe, is a critical structure in the generation of emotion and memory. Despite abundant evidence implicating the amygdala in affect and memory formation , stress responsivity, epilepsy, senile dementia, schizophrenia, pathologic aggression , and even stomach ulceration, it has been a decade since a book devoted to the subject has been published. But it has been worth the wait. Dr. Aggleton\'s The Amygdala is an authoritative and comprehensive volume, which is essential reading for anyone, whether expert or newcomer, who is interested in emotion and memory. The name of this subcortical structure (from the Latin for almond, a somewhat obscure reference to this structure\'s anatomical appearance) may be less familiar than its better studied cortical cousin, the hippocampus. Nevertheless, both brain areas have been considered allied structures since the time of Pierre Paul Broca, who included both in his le grand lobe limbique over a century ago (and indeed, modern neuroanatomical techniques have revealed abundant connections between the amyg-dala and the hippocampus). In 1952, Paul MacLean, then at Yale University, reintroduced Broca\'s term ""limbic"" for those structures which form an annular ring of tissue on the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres. MacLean elaborated on the Papez theory of 1937 that these limbic structures are involved in the generation of emotion. But how do the amygdala and other limbic structures give rise …', 'year': 1992, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 541, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2061876793', 'name': 'L.

In addition, brain research indicated hyper-responsiveness and sustained activation instead of habituation of amygdala activation to emotional faces in both groups. Little is known, however, about whether the same patterns of amygdala habituation are present in these two groups. The current study examined habituation patterns of amygdala activity to emotional faces (fearful, happy and neutral) in adolescents with a DSM-IV depressive and/or anxiety disorder (N = 25), adolescents with CSA-related PTSD (N = 19) and healthy controls (N = 26). Behaviourally, the adolescents from the internalizing and CSA-related PTSD group reported more anxiety to fearful and neutral faces than adolescents from the control group and adolescents from the CSA-related PTSD group reacted slower compared to the internalizing group. At the whole brain level, there was a significant interaction between time and group within the left amygdala. Follow-up ROI analysis showed elevated initial activity in the amygdala and rapid habituation in the CSA-related PTSD group compared to the internalizing group. These findings suggest that habituation patterns of amygdala activation provide additional information on problems with emotional face processing. Furthermore, the results suggest there are differences in the underlying neurobiological mechanisms related to emotional face processing for adolescents with internalizing disorders and adolescents with CSA-related PTSD. Possibly CSA-related PTSD is characterized by a stronger primary emotional response driven by the amygdala.', 'year': None, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 23, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4965226', 'name': 'B.

The paper outlines a new and broadly inclusive conceptual itinerary for the scientific study of personality development across the human life course. From the standpoint of the person as a social actor, a first line of development runs from the temperament dimensions observed in infancy through the establishment of adult personality traits, tracking a movement toward greater elaboration and regulation of the person’s socio-emotional performance style. A second line of development traces continuity and change in the motivated agent, running from the child’s consolidation of theory of mind, through an age 5–7 shift, to the articulation in adolescence and adulthood of life goals and values. From the perspective of the autobiographical author, a third line of personality development runs from the sharing of episodic memories between preschool children and their parents to the emergence of autobiographical reasoning skills in adolescence, ultimately resulting in the construction of an integrative lif...",2015,72,57,"{'name': 'European Psychologist', 'pages': '252-264', 'volume':

A Comparison of Theoretical Perspectives and Empirical Evidence', 'abstract': 'Increasing numbers of empirical studies provide compelling evidence that personality traits change across the entire lifespan. What initiates this continuing personality development and how does this development proceed? In this paper, we compare six theoretical perspectives that offer testable predictions about why personality develops the way it does and identify limitations and potentials of these perspectives by reviewing how they hold up against the empirical evidence. While all of these perspectives have received some empirical support, there is only little direct evidence for propositions put forward by the five–factor theory of personality and the theory of genotype → environment effects. In contrast, the neo–socioanalytic theory appears to offer a comprehensive framework that fits the empirical findings and allows the integration of other, more specialized, perspectives that focus on specific aspects of personality development like the role of time, systematic differences between categories of social roles or the active partake of the person himself or herself. We draw conclusions on the likely driving factors for adult personality development and identify avenues for future research.

When carried out on longitudinal data, behavioural genetic studies also offer promising ways to examine the genetic and environmental origins of personality stability and change. Here, we review the findings of longitudinal twin studies, discuss their implications for our understanding of adult personality development, and point out open questions that need to be addressed by future research. Three general conclusions stand out. First, there is a strong and relatively stable genetic foundation of individual differences in personality throughout the adult life span; second, environmental influences become more important and contribute to an increasing rank–order stability of personality traits from early to middle adulthood; and third, both genetic and nonshared environmental influences contribute to both stability and change in personality traits. Equipped with this knowledge, the most urgent tasks for the next generation of behavioural genetic studies on personality development will be to (i) identify measurable environmental factors that matter and (ii) to capture the interplay between genetic and environmental influences on personality stability and change throughout adulthood.

In the research reported here, we examined how the spread of reputational information through gossip promotes cooperation in mixed-motive settings. Results showed that individuals readily communicated reputational information about others, and recipients used this information to selectively interact with cooperative individuals and ostracize those who had behaved selfishly, which enabled group members to contribute to the public good with reduced threat of exploitation. Additionally, ostracized individuals responded to exclusion by subsequently cooperating at levels comparable to those who were not ostracized. These results suggest that the spread of reputational information through gossip can mitigate egoistic behavior by facilitating partner selection, thereby helping to solve the problem of cooperation even in noniterated interactions.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 287, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31921569', 'name': 'M.

Personality and temperament are conceptualized as regulatory systems that start as physiological reactivity to environmental features early in life, but are increasingly supplemented by regulation efforts oriented toward reference values such as personal goals and social norms. These reference values change during development as society expects increasingly mature behaviors, but it takes regulatory resources and incremental practice before people can conform to these higher standards. Consistent with this view, a meta-analysis of mean-level development of personality traits in adolescence revealed a decrease in conscientiousness and openness during early adolescence. Negative discrepancies between reference values and actual behavior are apparently responsible for decreases in perceived maturity, but more direct evidence is needed to support this claim.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 203, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4179775', 'name': 'Jaap J.

Two leading theories offer different explanations for these pervasive age trends: Five-factor theory proposes that personality maturation is largely determined by genetic factors, whereas social-investment theory proposes that personality maturation in early adulthood is largely the result of normative life transitions to adult roles. In the research reported here, we conducted the first systematic cross-cultural test of these theories using data from a large Internet-based sample of young adults from 62 nations (N = 884,328).

A small cohort of colleagues received invitations from the Journal of General Education: A Curricular Commons of the Humanities and Sciences: “Please read Edward O. Wilson’s controversial new book, The Social Conquest of Earth. Use it as a springboard to produce an essay about general education.” The journal provided scant guidance other than that the ideals and observations kindled by reading The Social Conquest should enable contributors to generate challenging deliberations about a curriculum—a general education—that reaches well beyond disciplinary majors and professional concentrations that are intended to launch careers in commerce or the academy. The Wilson colloquium, the invitation explained, should consist neither of book reviews and critiques in the usual sense nor of defenses or denunciations of Wilson’s views on “group versus kin selection.” Nor should it focus exclusively on Wilson’s declaration that the “myths” of the humanities and religion cannot explain any of three fundamental questions: Where did we come from? What are we? Where are we going? The journal did invite the contributors to consider some fundamental general education issues. Can general education serve as a leveling device, that is, as a means to raise among all of our students an understanding of the world about them and their place in it? Can we identify the humanities and sciences necessary to nurture such a task? Just what is it that education should nurture for undergraduates and their faculty? “Mythmaking could never discover the origin and meaning of humanity,” Wilson writes in The Social Conquest. Perhaps not. Yet for many people, folklore and stories, philosophy and ethics, history and theology, are at least as important to their understanding of who they are and who they should be as is the biological relationship of our genes to our emotions and behaviors.

Predictions were made in line with humanistic and gerontology theories, which suggest that sources of personal meaning consolidate across the life span toward intrinsically motivated pursuits. Findings supported these predictions, showing that although there was a tendency for aspirations to decline with age, the proportion of intrinsically motivated aspirations increased, as did total meaning and the interrelationship between meaning and intrinsic aspirations. There were also gender differences in personal meaning and aspirations, which suggested a more pronounced midlife dip in intrinsic and purposive goal striving for men, and a greater focus on intrinsic aspirations in women.

Diverse lines of research support dyadic morality. First, perceptions of mind are linked to moral judgments: dimensions of mind perception (agency and experience) map onto moral types (agents and patients), and deficits of mind perception correspond to difficulties with moral judgment. Second, not only are moral judgments sensitive to perceived agency and experience, but all moral transgressions are fundamentally understood as agency plus experienced suffering—that is, interpersonal harm—even ostensibly harmless acts such as purity violations. Third, dyadic morality uniquely accounts for the phenomena of dyadic completion (seeing agents in response to patients, and vice versa), and moral typecasting (characterizing others as either moral agents or moral patients).

However, this conclusion is surprising given that there is almost no data on the ability of traits to predict distributions of naturally occurring, representative behaviors of individuals (and that there are many studies showing that traits do indeed predict specific behaviors). The authors describe a meta-analysis of 15 experience-sampling studies, conducted over the course of 8 years, amassing over 20,000 reports of trait manifestation in behavior. Participants reported traits on typical self-report questionnaires, then described their current behavior multiple times per day for several days as the behavior was occurring. Results show that traits, contrary to expectations, were strongly predictive of individual differences in trait manifestation in behavior, predicting average levels with correlations between .42 and .56 (approaching .60 for stringently restricted studies).

The 5 principles suggest a framework for integrating the Big Five model of personality traits with those self-defining features of psychological individuality constructed in response to situated social tasks and the human need to make meaning in culture."", 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 135, 'citationCount': 1541, 'authors': [{'authorId': '79588481', 'name': 'D.

Two manifestations of the life story, life narratives and autobiographical reasoning, are delineated in terms of 4 types of global coherence (temporal, biographical, causal, and thematic).

Three principles are involved. First, evolutionary selection pressure predicts a negative age correlation, and, therefore, genome-based plasticity and biological potential decrease with age. Second, for growth aspects of human development to extend further into the life span, culture-based resources are required at ever-increasing levels. Third, because of age-related losses in biological plasticity, the efficiency of culture is reduced as life span development unfolds. Joint application of these principles suggests that the lifespan architecture becomes more and more incomplete with age. Degree of completeness can be defined as the ratio between gains and losses in functioning. Two examples illustrate the implications of the lifespan architecture proposed. The first is a general theory of development involving the orchestration of three component processes: selection, optimization, and compensation. The second considers the task of completing the life course in the sense of achieving a positive balance between gains and losses for all age levels. This goal is increasingly more difficult to attain as human development is extended into advanced old age.', 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 91, 'citationCount': 389, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2166230', 'name': 'P.

Children’s behavioral differences emerge in the first months of life, and those differences become more pronounced and complex as children move through the toddler, preschool, school-age, and adolescent years. In different research contexts, the individual differences that are consistent across time and situations are known as either temperament traits or personality traits. Parents, educators, physicians, mental health workers, and policy makers all ask important questions about these early emerging differences in children: What are the most important individual differences that can be observed in youth? To what extent do children’s personalities change and through what processes? Do the family environment and the broader context make a difference in the formation of children’s personalities? During the past several decades, research on early temperament and personality development has begun to yield answers to these questions. The research addressing these questions has been aided by a growing consensus about what the most important temperament and personality traits are in childhood and adolescence. This chapter reviews current research on temperament and personality trait development. It begins with an introductory section that describes the differences and similarities in how temperament and personality are conceived. The second section turns to a more in-depth discussion of the measurement and structure of temperament and personality traits in childhood and reviews current work on a core set of traits: extraversion–positive emotionality, neuroticism–negative emotionality, conscientiousness–effortful control, agreeableness, and openness to experience–intellect. The third section explores what is known about stability and change in mean levels and rank ordering of traits during childhood and adolescence and reviews some of the work on genetic and environmental sources of change in youth’s traits. The fourth and final section summarizes key findings from the chapter and offers suggestions for future research on the relationship between temperament and personality traits early in life, the structure of youths’ traits, and stability and change in traits during childhood and adolescence.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 139, 'citationCount': 26, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6372265', 'name': 'Rebecca L Shiner'}]}, {'paperId': '139739e7d61fead3aaa81ca87ed72899fc3b2bef', 'title': 'The interplay of personality and self-regulation.', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 21, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7305241', 'name': 'R.

In the first section, we address two topics that are fundamental in defining the most important traits at each point in the life span: the relationship between temperament and personality and the methods used to ascertain the structure of traits in the temperament and personality research traditions. We argue in this section that temperament and personality are different ways of describing the same basic traits, with temperament research primarily focused on early-emerging individual differences and personality research focused on individual differences that appear later in childhood and continue into adulthood. In the second section, we describe the current status of the most prominent models of temperament, as well as the most widely-accepted personality trait model, the Big Five. In the third section, we articulate a structural model that integrates contemporary findings on temperament and personality traits from early childhood through adulthood. We use the Big Five trait structure, along with the trait of activity level, to organize this taxonomy. In the fourth section, we discuss the current research on the psychological and biological processes that underlie individual differences in the Big Five traits in childhood and adulthood. In the final sections, we offer concluding thoughts on the nature of personality trait development and suggestions for future research.

Research on personal strivings and other motivational constructs provides a second perspective on personality, one that becomes psychologically salient in childhood with the consolidation of an agentic self and the articulation of more-or-less stable goals.

Ratings were made to estimate the ages at which each culture assumed responsibility or teachability in children or assigned a more mature social, sexual, or cultural role. The ratings were made in 27 categories. Inter-rater reliability averaged 63 % when calculated in a way that took into account failures to rate and disagreements about age, 84 % when calculated in a way that took into account only disagreements about age. Inspection of the 27 histograms obtained by this procedure suggested that for 16 of the 27 categories there appeared to be a modal cultural assignment of social responsibility in the 5- to 7-year age range. Four of the remaining eleven categories showed a mode at puberty, while the remaining seven seemed to be assigned across a broad age range. The inherent accuracy of the HRAF data demands cautious inference. Analysis of the data revealed that, in some respects at least, diverse human cultures assign new roles and responsibilities to children in the 5- to 7-year age range.', 'year': 1975, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 134, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1997116', 'name': 'B.

They will be interested in his general socio-economic status, his concep tion of self, his attitude toward them, his compe tence, his trustworthiness, etc. Although some of this information seems to be sought almost as an end in itself, there are usually quite practical reasons for acquiring it. Information about the individual helps to define the situation, enabling others to know in advance what he will expect of them and what they may expect of him. Informed in these ways, the others will know how best to act in order to call forth a desired response from him. For those present, many sources of information become accessible and many carriers (or “signvehicles”) become available for conveying this information. If unacquainted with the individual, observers can glean clues from his conduct and appearance which allow them to apply their previ ous experience with individuals roughly similar to the one before them or, more important, to apply untested stereotypes to him. They can also assume from past experience that only individuals of a par ticular kind are likely to be found in a given social setting. They can rely on what the individual says about himself or on documentary evidence he provides as to who and what he is. If they know, or know of, the individual by virtue of experience prior to the interaction, they can rely on assumptions as to the persistence and generality of psychological traits as a means of predicting his present and future behavior. However, during the period in which the indi vidual is in the immediate presence of the others, few events may occur which directly provide the others with the conclusive information they will need if they are to direct wisely their own activity . Many crucial facts lie beyond the time and place of interaction or lie concealed within it. For example, the “true” or “real” attitudes, beliefs, and emotions of the individual can be ascertained only indirectly , through his avowals or through what appears to be involuntary expressive behavior. Similarly , if the individual offers the others a product or service, they will often find that during the interaction there will be no time and place immediately available for eating the pudding that the proof can be found in. They will be forced to accept some events as con ventional or natural signs of something not directly available to the senses. In Ichheiser ’s terms, 1 the individual will have to act so that he intentionally or unintentionally expresses himself, and the others will in turn have to be impressed in some way by him.…', 'year': 1959, 'referenceCount': 5, 'citationCount': 34739, 'authors': [{'authorId': '16678797', 'name': 'E.

My reply is in two parts. First, I discuss the boundaries of emotion as a phenomenon and whether sensory preferences can be regarded as emotions; second, I make an analysis of the evidence Zajonc regards as supporting his claims for the independence of cognition and emotion and the primacy of emotion. My aims are to sharpen the philosophical and empirical issues that underlie our disagreement and to emphasize the indeterminancy of the issue of cognitive versus emotional primacy. This latter issue is less important than the task of exploring the cognitive contents or meanings that shape each kind of emotional reaction. Finally, I offer a brief programmatic statement about what cognitivists can do to advance our understanding of emotion over the life course. The latest riposte by Zajonc (1984) has, in my view, not helped to clarify our understanding of the relationship between cognition and emotion. Zajonc takes my reasoning (Lazarus, 1982) to task in two major ways. First he complains that my position cannot be falsified because I defined emotion as requiring cognitive appraisal, then that I have ignored the evidence that emotion can occur without cognitive activity, which he cites. I believe he is wrong about my epistemological position and wrong that the evidence supports the primacy of emotion or its independence from cognition. The body of this reply consists of a discussion of the definitional issue and why I think the empirical case he makes is specious. My objective is to sharpen the issue and sustain my position and that of like-minded cognitivists. The Definitional Issue Definitions do not arise out of the blue; they are an integral part of a theory that helps delimit the phenomena of interest and organize observations. In my view, emotion reflects a constantly changing personenvironment relationship. When central life agendas (e.g., biological survival, personal and social values and goals) are engaged, this relationship becomes a source of emotion. Therefore, an emotional experience cannot be understood solely in terms of what happens inside the person or in the brain, but grows out of ongoing transactions with the environment that are evaluated. Cognitive activity is a necessary precondition of emotion because to experience an emotion, people must comprehend—whether in the form of a primitive evaluative perception or a highly differentiated symbolic process—that their well-being is implicated in a transaction, for better or worse. A creature that is oblivious to the significance of what is happening for its well-being does not react with an emotion. This same point has been stated cogently in various ways by numerous multidisciplinary scholars who responded recently to an article on a general psychobiological theory of emotions by Panksepp (1982) appearing in The Behavioral and Brain Sciences. The conception that the meaning or significance of a transaction is crucial to emotion forces us to restrict its definition to some psychophysiological phenomena and to reject others as outside its purview. The searching question is what an emotion is or is not. Zajonc evades this question. Thus, he takes me to task for doing what any good theorist should do with definitions, but he does not do himself—namely, specify the phenomena of interest. Emotion, for example, is not just physiological arousal, though such arousal is one of the traditional defining attributes. Arousal can be produced by exercising vigorously or entering a hot or cold room. Doing this will produce an emotion only if we appraise the encounter (e.g., the physical and social conditions and the bodily state it produces) as having a bearing on our well-being, as when, for example, it presents some physical danger or brings blissful relief from discomfort. Startle is a reaction that has long but erroneously been included under the rubric of emotion. Ekman (in press) presents new experimental evidence that startle might better be regarded as a reflex, like the knee jerk, because it does not behave as do other reactions we call emotions. He examined facial and bodily responses under four conditions: when subjects did not know at what moment a blank pistol would be fired; when they did know the moment; when they tried to inhibit the startle reaction; and when they attempted to simulate a genuine startle. Ekman contrasted emotions with startle. He found that the startle was easy to elicit and was consistently the initial response to a gunshot; in contrast, there is no single elicitor that will always call forth the same emotion in adults. Moreover, the startle response could not 124 February 1984 • American Psychologist Copyright 1984 by the American Psychological Association, Inc. Vol. 39, No. 2, 124-129 be totally inhibited; in contrast, emotions can. Nor could the startle be simulated correctly by any subject. On the basis of these findings, the startle response seems fixed and rigid in comparison to emotions, and once elicited it seems to run its course. Thus, from the perspective of a relational and cognitive conceptualization of emotion, I think we should exclude startle from the rubric of emotion, as I advocated in my earlier discussion in this journal (Lazarus, 1982). Historically, there has been much concern about diverse phenomena for which emotion terms are employed, such as moods, sentiments, emotion traits, and actual emotional reactions (cf. Ortony & Clore, 1981). Moods usually refer to sustained general states, such as sadness and contentment, that may or may not be considered emotions depending on theoretical and definitional conventions. Sentiments refer to characteristic ways a person evaluates an object (person, idea, thing); they operate as dispositions to react emotionally to that object but are not in themselves emotions. Another questionable category of emotion consists of personality traits, such as cheerful, which could in some instances describe an actual emotion, as in ""I feel cheerful,"" but could in other instances describe a trait, not an actual emotional response, as in ""I am a cheerful person."" Some emotion terms are heavily detached, lukewarm, or cold, such as interested, whereas others, such as enraged, are hot. As Ortony and Clore pointed out, it makes a considerable difference how such terms are used by subjects in emotion research. In the 1940s and 1950s, a period characterized by the scientific outlook sometimes called logical positivism, the dominant view in psychology was that emotions could not be defined and studied as such but represented intervening variables (cf. Brown & Farber, 1951; Lazarus, 1968; Lazarus, Kanner, & Folkman, 1980). Although similar attitudes still exist, the more restrictive treatment of emotions in the past has given way to a view that allows much greater latitude in their study; this view depends heavily on what subjects report, but can be supplemented by simultaneous assessments of behavioral and physiological response variables. Emotions are commonly conceptualized and studied as an organic mix of action impulses and bodily expressions, diverse positive or dysphoric (subjective) cognitive-affective states, and physiological disturbances. Although there are arguments about whether these physiological disturbances are diffuse or patterned, an emotion is not I acknowledge with appreciation several valued colleagues who carefully read, criticized, and made suggestions on an earlier draft of this article. They include Paul Ekman, Susan Folkman, Barbara Mellers, and Philip Tetlock; Carol Carr warrants special mention for her skilled editorial assistance. Regrettably, acute limitations in our resources dictate that reprints will not be available. definable solely by behavior, subjective reports, or physiological changes; its identification requires all three components, since each one can be generated by conditions that do not necessarily elicit emotion, as in the example of arousal by exercise given above. An emotion researcher must worry about which response states or processes can be called emotions and which cannot; meeting one or even two of the three response criteria is not enough. With respect to the debate between Zajonc and me, a critical question is, On what basis should preferences (e.g., for taste, smell, or photographs of faces) be regarded as emotions? We must ask a similar question about aesthetic reactions to a pretty picture, a pleasing sunset, a stirring piece of music, or a fine piece of literature. Some years ago, while examining emotion and feeling in psychology and art, Arnheim (1958) pointed out that emotion in artistic experience is not merely a passive receipt or apprehension of information, but requires active, involved participation. As with sensory preferences, what may pass for an emotional (aesthetic) response may be nothing more than a pro forma statement that implies emotion but does not necessarily reflect it, as when one casually says, ""That\'s a pretty picture"" in a manner more indicative of labeling than emotion. Although preferences can involve emotions, even strong ones, they often seem to fall at the ambiguous borderline between emotion and nonemotion. On the one hand, statements of preference can be ""cold cognitions"" expressing merely a social requirement to make a choice, or on the other hand, they can be expressions of genuine emotional involvement. In the research Zajonc cites, we do not know whether in expressing a preference (e.g., ""I like him more"") subjects are experiencing an emotion, as indicated by multileveled response criteria, or merely expressing an intellectual choice. If the latter, then preferences must be excluded from the category of emotions; if the former, they fall under the rubric of emotion. Zajonc fails to come to grips with this problem, and he makes no mention of the alternative st', 'year': 1984, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 1238, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5628684', 'name': 'R.

It therefore opposes the •stance taken by Zajonc, which reflects two widespread misunderstandings about what is meant by cognitive processes in emotion: (a) that a cognitive appraisal of the significance of an encounter for one\'s well-being must occur in fixed stages through the information processing of initially meaningless inputs from the environment; and (b) that such an appraisal is necessarily deliberate, rational, and conscious. Some of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic implications of a cognitive theory of emotion are also discussed briefly. Recent years have seen a major change in the way psychologists view emotion—the rediscovery that emotions are products of cognitive processes. The emotional response is elicited by an evaluative perception in lower animals, and in humans by a complex \'cognitive appraisal of the significance of events for one\'s well-being. Although there are many other issues concerning the relations between emotion and cognition, my comments will focus on the role of thought in the emotional response. I will refer often to Zajonc\'s (1980) challenge to the assumption that cognition occurs prior to emotion. I use his views to illustrate widespread misunderstandings of what it means to speak of cognition as a causal antecedent of emotion; I also use his views as a point of departure for rny argument that cognitive activity is a necessary as well as sufficient condition of emotion. Do Emotions Require Cognitive Mediation? My own position on this question is a variant of a family of theories of emotion centered on the concept of cognitive appraisal. Campos and Sternberg (1981) state, for example, that ""The recent history of the study of emotion has been dominated by approaches stressing cognitive factors. In theories of adult emotional response, cognitive appraisal now functions as the central construct"" (p. 273). Its role is, to mediate the relationship between the person and the environment. The appraisal process gives rise to a particular emotion with greater or lesser intensity depending on how the relationship is evaluated with respect to the person\'s well-being. Cognitive appraisal means that the way one interprets one\'s plight at any given moment is crucial to the emotional response. Cognition and emotion are usually fused in nature (Folkman, Schaefer, & Lazarus, 1979), although they can be dissociated in certain unusual or abnormal states. For example, cognitive coping processes (cf. Lazarus, 1981) such as isolation and intellectualization (or detachment), which are aimed at regulating feelings, can create a dissociation between thoughts and feelings. Moreover, attack can occur without anger, and avoidance without fear. These latter conditions are also instances in which the usual link between thought and feeling has been loosened or broken. Yet such separations are less often a rule of living and more often a product of coping under special circumstances. The full experience of emotion (as opposed to sham rage, for example) normally includes three fused components: thoughts, action impulses, and somatic disturbances. When these components are dissociated we are left with something other than what we mean by a true emotional state. Our theories of emotion must reflect the normal fusion, and separating thoughts, action impulses, and so^ matic disturbances except under certain specifiable conditions (as was done in the old days of faculty psychology—which treated cognition, emotion, and motivation as independent entities) distorts rather than clarifies the structure of the mind (cf. Lazarus, Coyne, & Folkman, 1982). One bit of fallout from the above analysis is the implication, often derived from statements of cognitive theory, that cognitive appraisal is a necessary I wish to thank my research colleague, Susan Folkman, and my secretary, Carol Carr, for providing substantial editorial advice on this article.

AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST • SEPTEMBER 1982 • 1019 0003-066X/82/3709-1019$00.75 I as well as sufficient condition of emotion. Such a position has been criticized trenchantly by Zajonc (1980). He writes that affect is erroneously regarded in contemporary psychological theory as postcognitive, occurring only after extensive cognitive operations have taken place, and that in actuality affective judgments are fairly independent of, and even precede, the perceptual and cognitive activities on which they are said to depend. Zajonc argues that not only can affect occur without extensive perceptual and cognitive encoding—and even before—but that affect and cognition are controlled by separate and partially independent neural systems (see also Tomkins, 1981). Zajonc thus seems to be saying two things contrary to what I have argued: first, that the proposed directionality in which cognition determines affect is wrorig and that the actual direction is affect to cognition; and second, that cognition and affect should be regarded as relatively independent subsystems rather than as fused and highly interdependent. Building his argument, Zajonc cites a stanza of poetry from e. e. cummings (1973): since feeling is first who pays any attention to the syntax of things will never wholly kiss you. (p. 160) He also cites Wundt\'s (1907) concept of affective primacy, and Bartlett (1932), Ittelson (1973), Osgood (1962), and Premack (1976) as having adopted the view that feelings come first. He states, for example: . < In fact, it is entirely possible that the very first stage of the organism\'s reaction to stimuli and the very first elements in retrieval are affective. It is further possible that we can like something or be afraid of it before we know precisely what it is and perhaps even without knowing what it is. (p. 154) The most serious mistake in Zajonc\'s analysis lies in his approach to cognition, which is characteristic of much of present-day cognitive psychology. In this approach information and meaning stem from the conception of mind as an analogue to a computer (Shannon & Weaver, 1962), a view illustrated also by the work of Newell and Simon (1961) and Weiner (I960). This conception has been rebutted by Dreyfus (1972), Polanyi (1958, 1966), and others, although the rebuttal has not affected the mainstream of cognitive psychology. The mainstream stance is that meanings for decision and action are built up from essentially meaningless stimulus display elements or bits and that systematic scanning of this display generates information. Thus, human cognition, like the operations of a computer, proceeds by serially receiving, registering, encoding, storing for the shortor longrun, and ""retrieving meaningless bits—a transformation to meaning that is called ""information processing."" Meanings and their associated emotions, or hot cognitions as Abelson (1963) referred to them, are built through such processing. As Erdelyi (1974) and others (e.g., Neisser, 1967) have suggested, however, emotion can influence the process at any of its stages. With this in mind, it is not surprising that Zajonc might be troubled by the implication that emotion lies at the end of a tortuous cognitive chain of information processing, and therefore find it necessary to suggest an independent system making possible rapid, nonreflective emotional reactions. As many have argued (Folkman et al., 1979; Wrubel, Benner, & Lazarus, 1981), humans are meaning-oriented, meaning-creating creatures who constantly evaluate events from the perspective of their well-being and react emotionally to some of these evaluations. Zajonc is therefore correct in asserting that meanings are immediately inherent in emotionally laden transactions without lengthy or sequential processing, but for the wrong reasons. In my view, the concept of meaning defined by the traditional information processing approach subscribed to by Zajonc has a perfectly reasonable-—and better—alternative. We do not always have to await revelation from information processing to unravel the environmental code. As was argued in the New Look movement in perception, personal factors such as beliefs, expectations, and motives or commitments influence attention and appraisal at the very outset of any encounter. Concern with individual differences leads inevitably to concern with personal meanings and to the factors that shape such meanings. We actively select and shape experience and in some degree mold it to our own requirements (see also Rychlak, 1981). Information processing as an exclusive model of cognition is insufficiently concerned with the person as a source of meaning. The history of debate about the phenomenon of subception is instructive (see Eriksen, 1956, 1960, 1962; Lazarus, 1956; Lazarus & McCleary, 1951). In a controversial experiment, McCleary and I showed that by associating a set of nonsense syllables to the threat of a painful electric shock, subjects would later react with a galvanic skin response selectively to the shock-associated syllables, even when they had misperceived and misreported, them. We referred to this phenomenon as ""autonomic discrimination without awareness,"" or ""sub1020 • SEPTEMBER 1982 • AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST ception,"" arguing that subjects somehow sensed the threat without consciously recognizing the syllables. The debate sparked by this interpretation touched on many complex issues, but it mainly centered on a claim by Bricker and Chapanis (1953) and Eriksen (1956, 1960, 1962) that even though the subjects had misreported what had been flashed on the screen, they probably had registered perceptually some of the structural elements of the syllables and had, in effect, reacted automatica', 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 1452, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5628684', 'name': 'R.

The development of a principal-agent relationship in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in which medical practitioners used their specialist knowledge to make decisions for and on behalf of their patients provided one way of managing this uncertainty. However the development of a less deferential and more consumerist culture associated with medical scandals in which trust has been betrayed have led to increased regulation of medical practice, especially the development of national standards based on encoded knowledge. Even if governments can overcome the practical problems of using such systems to structure decision-making, because these systems fail to address the personal and emotional components of trust they are likely to create a ‘trust deficit,’ a system that may work better, but is trusted less.",2007,47,74,"{'name': 'Health, Risk & Society', 'pages': '1 - 10', 'volume': '9'}","{'model': 'specter_v1',

Health professionals' claims to authority, for identifying and managing risk, are increasingly being challenged through the imposition of bureaucratic devices to control their professional behaviour. This paper examines the extent to which professional decision making is constrained in an organization that is characterized by the generation and application of rules for encoding knowledge and for monitoring compliance in order to ensure unified and predictable behaviour and outputs; a machine bureaucracy. Thirty nurse advisors in one NHS Direct site were interviewed, observation of the call centres and analysis of routine monitoring data were also carried out. The data revealed that respondents' behaviour was deceptive, giving the appearance of being controlled and standardized but in reality representing that of a professional working autonomously. By casting the encoded knowledge as a source of risk, respondents were able to invoke the use of professional judgement to manage the risks it posed. Informal risk management strategies and a focus on individual rather than organizational needs enabled respondents to subvert managerial control."", 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 35, 'authors': [{'authorId': '67218184', 'name': 'A.

In the UK, the current government is devoting considerable resources to welfare state reform and (arguably) achieving real improvements in services such as the NHS and education. Despite this, the reforms remain highly controversial and there is considerable concern about lack of trust in the new welfare policies. A decline in trust may undermine the public acceptability of the reforms and threaten the ability of government to gain electoral support for them. Recent work in sociology, political science and psychology indicates that rational deliberative and non-rational valued-based or affective factors contribute to trust in institutions. At the same time, theoretical arguments suggest an increasing need for public trust. Trust facilitates the co-ordination of complex enterprises under conditions of uncertainty, especially valuable at a time when rising demand and intensifying pressures for spending constraint provide a continuing impetus for reform. One possibility is that policies designed within a rational actor framework may erode the non-rational aspects of trust, so that the service improves but trust in it declines, with consequences for the political sustainability of reformed health care systems. Risk research in health care has a good opportunity to consider issues of institutional trust and to build inter-disciplinary links in doing so.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 44, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1422150939', 'name': 'P.

In the last three decades, the governing arrangements have been in turmoil and the country has been a pioneer in economic reform, and in public sector change. In this book, Michael Moran examines and explains the contrast between these two epochs. What turned Britain into a laboratory of political innovation? Britain became a formal democracy at the start of the twentieth century but the practice of government remained oligarchic. From the 1970s this oligarchy collapsed under the pressure of economic crisis. The British regulatory state is being constructed in its place. Moran challenges the prevailing view that this new state is liberal or decentralizing. Instead he argues that it is a new, threatening kind of interventionist state which is colonizing, dominating, and centralizing hitherto independent domains of civil society.

Stocks (1947), using standardized death rates to allow for these population changes, shows the following trend: rate per 100,000 in 1901-20, males 1.1, females 0.7; rate per 100,000 in 1936-9, males 10.6, females 2.5. The rise seems to have been particularly rapid since the end of the first world war, between 1921-30 and 1940-4 the death rate of men at ages 45 and over increased sixfold and of women of the same ages approximately threefold. This increase is still continuing. It has occurred, too, in Switzerland, Denmark, the U.S.A., Canada, and Australia, and has been reported from Turkey and Japan. Many writers have studied these changes, considering whether they denote a real increase in the incidence of the disease or are due merely to improved standards of diagnosis. Some believe that the latter factor can be regarded as wholly, or at least mainly, responsible-for example, Willis (1948), Clemmesen and Busk (1947), and Steiner (1944). On the other hand, Kennaway and Kennaway (1947) and Stocks (1947) have given good reasons for believing that the rise is at least partly real. The latter, for instance, has pointed out that "" the increase of certified respiratory cancer mortality during the past 20 years has been as rapid in country districts as in the cities with the best diagnostic facilities, a fact which does not support the view that such increase merely reflects improved diagnosis of cases previously certified as bronchitis or other respiratory affections."" He also draws attention to differences in mortality between some of the large cities of England and Wales, differences which it is difficult to explain in terms of diagnostic standards. The large and continued increase in the recorded deaths even within the last five years, both in the national figures and in those from teaching hospitals, also makes it hard to believe that improved diagnosis is entirely responsible. In short, there is sufficient reason to reject that factor as the whole explanation, although no one would deny that it may well have been contributory. As a corollary, it is right and proper to seek for other causes.', 'year': 1950, 'referenceCount': 3, 'citationCount': 1475, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4300751', 'name': 'R.

Statistical studies at the Charity Hospital of New Orleans (Ochsner and DeBakey), 1 the St. Louis City Hospital (Wheeler) 2 and the Veterans Administration Hospital of Hines, Ill. (Avery) 3 have revealed that at these hospitals cancer of the lung is now the most frequent visceral cancer in men. Autopsy statistics throughout the world show a great increase in the incidence of bronchiogenic carcinoma in relation to cancer in general. Kenneway and Kenneway, 4 in a careful statistical study of death certificates in England and Wales from 1928 to 1945, have presented undoubted evidence of a great increase in deaths from cancer of the lung. In this country statistics compiled by the American Cancer Society show a similar trend during the past two decades. 5 Tobacco as a Possible Cause', 'year': 1950, 'referenceCount': 6, 'citationCount': 285, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46967108', 'name': 'E.

The over-arching aim of the NDU was to promote individualised patient care. This requires the experiences and life goals of the patient, including the patient’s and family construction of risk, to inform the care planning process. Two projects, undertaken by nurses on the ward, one on inpatient self-medication and the other on the management of falls, are analysed as case studies in order to address the questions: (1) How do nurses develop and research patient-centred care? (2) What are the implications of their choice of methodology in relation to their stated aims of individualising care? The paper demonstrates how conventions about research methodology and outcomes dominated the nurses’ interpretation of research, the hospital research agenda and the literature on the research topics. These conventions shaped the construction of risk and safety within the hospital setting compromising practice developments designed to support the implementation of individualised care processes.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '67116495', 'name': 'usan'}, {'authorId': '2105397192', 'name': 'Rocter'}]}, {'paperId': '2ffc41e2787ab9ec5908ddb7d1ef1463c7e94173', 'title': 'Emotions and sociology', 'abstract': '1.

A literature review was completed to examine the current understanding of the epidemiology, characterization, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of pseudobulbar affect. This review revealed that it is common in neurodegenerative disorders but is poorly recognized, placing significant impacts on patients and their families. The disorder appears to result from a disruption of the cortico-limbicsubcortical-thalamic-pontocerebellar network involved in emotional expression and regulation with resulting disruptions of neurotransmitter systems. Effective treatment is available with agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dextromethorphan combined with quinidine, but further well-designed comparative studies are needed. Advances in technology such as neuroimaging may enhance knowledge about the pathophysiology of this disorder, and help guide future interventions.",2013,170,13,,"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

However, it remains poorly understood. The authors present a case report and analyze all the cases in the literature to try to localize a putative faciorespiratory center. This 13-year-old girl developed a pontine abscess subsequent to sphenoid sinusitis. This increased in size despite antibiotic treatment, and she developed PLC. The abscess was then stereotactically aspirated, with resolution of the symptoms. A PubMed search of the term ""pathological laughter and crying"" was performed. From these papers all reported cases of PLC were identified. Cases without neuroimaging were excluded. The remaining cases were categorized as small lesions permitting accurate localization within the pons, or large nonlocalizing lesions. All images of localizing lesions were magnified to the same size and placed on a grid. From this an area of maximal overlap was identified. The authors identified 7 cases of small localizing lesions with adequate imaging. The area of maximal overlap was in the region of the anterior paramedian pons. All the lesions involved this region of the pons. There were 28 further reports of large lesions that either resulted in gross compressive distortion of the pons or diffusely infiltrated it, and thus, although implicating involvement of a pontine center, did not allow for localization of a specific region of the pons. The authors report a case of PLC caused by a pontine abscess. Symptoms were reversible with stereotactically assisted aspiration and antibiotic administration. Analysis of the lesions reported in the literature showed a pattern toward a regulatory center in the pons.

The aetiology is poorly understood, but clinical descriptions suggest a disorder of emotion regulation. The goals of this study were: (i) to characterize the subjective, behavioural and physiological emotional reactions that occur during episodes of pathological laughing and crying; (ii) to compare responses during these episodes to those that occur when emotions are elicited under standard conditions (watching sad and amusing emotional films, being startled); and (iii) to examine the ability of patients with this disorder to regulate their emotions under standardized conditions. Twenty-one patients with pathological laughing and crying due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 14 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but no pathological laughing and crying were studied. Emotional measures included self-reported emotional experience, video recordings of facial reactivity and peripheral physiological responses (skin conductance, heart rate and somatic activity). Nineteen of the 21 patients with histories of pathological laughing and crying had at least one episode in the laboratory that they agreed constituted pathological laughing or crying (a total of 56 episodes were documented). Compared with viewing sad and amusing films, the episodes were associated with greater facial and physiological activation. Contrary to many clinical descriptions, episodes were often induced by contextually appropriate stimuli and associated with strong experiences of emotion that were consistent with the display. When instructed to regulate their facial responses to emotion-eliciting films, patients with pathological laughing and crying showed impairments compared with patients who did not have a history of this disorder. These findings support the idea that pathological laughing and crying represents activation of all channels of emotional responding (i.e. behavioural, physiological and subjective). Furthermore, they support previously advanced theories that, rather than being associated with general emotional hyperreactivity, this disorder may be due to dysfunction in frontal neural systems that support voluntary regulation of emotion.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 44, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6178154', 'name': 'N.

A behavioral phenotype can be defined as a characteristic cognitive, linguistic, social, and motor profile that is associated with a definite genotype. The study of behavioral phenotypes aims to identify the link between the behavioral components of the syndrome and the genotype. Careful study of individuals with known neurogenetic disorders is helping our understanding of the relationship between genetic variables and behavior. However, the influence of environment on behavior must always be kept in mind, in the rational approach to the understanding of behavioral phenotypes. Diagnosis of behavioral phenotypes provides the clinician with a systematic framework in which to identify and manage medical and behavioral features, all of which are the product of standardized and systematic observations of affected individuals, performed worldwide. A definite diagnosis, in addition, helps the family to recognize how the behavior is linked to the genetic disorder [O’Brien and Pearson, 2004]. The purpose of this issue of the American Journal of Medical Genetics— Seminars in Medical Genetics—is to provide recent advances in understanding behavioral phenotypes in those neurogenetic syndromes most frequently encountered in clinical practice. The genetic disorders with distinct behavior phenotypes, herein discussed, are due to different molecular-cytogenetic mechanisms: aneuploidy (Down syndrome, DS), subtelomeric deletion of contiguous genes (Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, WHS); imprinting [Angelman syndrome (AS)/Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS); idic(15) syndrome], interstitial microdeletion of genes (Smith–Magenis syndrome, SMS); trinucleotide repeat expansion (fragile X syndrome, FXS); single gene mutation (FG syndrome, FGS). The first article of the issue has been selected to give an overview of the advances in understanding behavioral phenotypes in neurogenetic syndromes. The ensuing articles address recent advances in understanding behavioral phenotypes in WHS and in other subtelomeric microdeletion syndromes, in AS, in PWS, in idic(15) syndrome, in SMS, in FXS, and in the FG (Opitz– Kaveggia) syndrome. The issue is closed by an article focusing on mouse models of cognitive disabilities in DS. James Harris provides a comprehensive overview of different facets of behavioral phenotypes, concerning historical aspects, current definitions, methodical issues, and discussing possible treatments for the different disorders. In their article Gene Fisch and collaborators examine the cognitivebehavioral features of children with WHS and compare them to children with other subtelomeric deletions that also produce intellectual disability (ID). Children with WHS were found to be more severely impacted cognitively and with a lower adaptive behavior than children from the other groups. They; however, exhibited strengths in socialization skills and lower rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autistic-like features compared to the other groups. In the next two articles a pair of well-characterized syndromes with distinctive behavioral phenotypes— Williams syndrome (WS) and AS—are comprehensively reviewed by two authorities on the respective conditions.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 1, 'citationCount': 3, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144896413', 'name': 'A.

This case report illustrates the beneficial effect of quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent with enhancing serotonergic neurotransmitter activity, in a patient with post-stroke PL.

All subjects experienced PL as a simple phonic tic, accompanied by characteristic premonitory urges and significant impairment in social interactions. In addition, all patients presented with multiple tic‐related symptoms (mainly self‐injurious behaviors and echolalia, n = 7; palilalia, n = 6; coprolalia/mental coprolalia, n = 5), and six patients had comorbid conditions (in particular obsessive‐compulsive disorder/behaviors, n = 7; attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder, n = 4).

Major depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders in MS with an approximate 50% lifetime prevalence rate. Early recognition and management of depression in MS is of major importance because it is a key predictor of morbidity, mortality, quality of life, possibly physical outcome and disease exacerbations, adherence to immunomodulatory treatments and suicide risk in MS patients, as well as of the caregiver's distress and quality of life. The etiopathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders in MS has been incompletely investigated. It is postulated that a complex interplay of biological, disease-related, behavioural and psychosocial factors contribute to the pathophysiology of most of them.

To examine in a pilot study inappropriate crying and laughing (also termed pseudobulbar affect (PBA)) and underlying mood disturbances in a large clinic based population of Parkinson's disease and movement disorder patients. Background. PBA is characterized by uncontrollable laughter without mirth, or alternatively crying without the feeling of sadness. It is a common condition affecting more than one million people with neurological diseases. While PBA has been studied in many neurological diseases, little is known about its prevalence in movement disorders, or its relationship to more chronic mood disturbances. We carried out this pilot study to examine this relationship. Methods. Seven hundred and nineteen out of 860 consecutive patients who visited our Movement Disorders Center met inclusion criteria (i.e. ≥18 years of age, formal diagnosis by a movement disorder specialist, completion of PBA questionnaire, and absence of brain surgery including deep brain stimulation). All subjects were interviewed for symptoms of PBA during their visit. In addition, 661 of these patients completed both the Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS) and Beck Depression Inventory I (BDI-I). Results. Thirty-seven of the 719 reported PBA symptoms; 75.7% (28/37) had pathological ‘crying’, 13.5% (5/37) had pathological ‘laughing’ and 10.8% (4/37) had both. The prevalence of PBA in individual diagnostic categories was: 4.7% (18/387) of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), 2.7% (2/74) of primary dystonia, 3.1% (2/65) of essential tremor (ET), 7.8% (8/108) of patients with other forms of Parkinsonism, 21.7% (5/23) of psychogenic movement disorders, 0% (0/18) of patients with combined PD and ET, and 4.5% (2/44) of other movement disorders. Patients with PBA had a higher total BDI score (P =0.0278) and VAMS ‘tiredness’ score (P=0.0109). In patients on antidepressant therapy the prevalence of PBA was 7.1% compared to 2.7% in the group not on therapy (P=0.0094). Conclusion. PBA was present in most movement disorders, but especially prevalent in parkinsonism. PBA patients in this cohort had more chronic depressive symptoms and tiredness."", 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 39, 'authors': [{'authorId': '38619465', 'name': 'M.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 49-year-old woman had developed weekly complex partial seizures consisting of nonverbal vocalization and unresponsiveness followed by laughter. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a round tumorous lesion at the posterior side of the right rectal gyrus and medial orbitofrontal gyrus. Neuroimaging studies and electrophysiological examinations, including intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring, suggested the existence of an epileptogenic zone in the ipsilateral orbitofrontal gyrus, including the lesion. INTERVENTION After partial right prefrontal lobectomy including lesionectomy, the patient became seizure-free during a follow-up period of 33 months. We speculated that the limbic system, including the orbitofrontal lobe and temporal structures, which have a strong connection with the pontine nuclei, might be involved in this patient's gelastic seizure. CONCLUSION Except for impaired consciousness, the clinical manifestations did not correspond to the characteristics of orbitofrontal seizure described by the International League Against Epilepsy.

PBA is a disorder of emotional regulation, characterized by uncontrollable outbursts of laughing and/or crying that are disproportionate to the emotions being experienced. The pathophysiology of PBA is currently unknown, although the disorder is thought to occur exclusively in the setting of neurological disease. The most influential theory on PBA posits that emotional outbursts are being generated autonomously in the brain stem due to loss of regulatory control by the frontal lobe. Although rarely life-threatening, PBA can have significant impact on patient quality of life, and thus merits treatment. There are currently no approved treatments for PBA. Several agents have been found to be effective in small placebo-controlled trials and case series, with the most commonly used agents being tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Both these treatments are inexpensive and relatively low-risk, although the quality and quantity of data available on their efficacy are not optimal. DM has several pharmacological mechanisms of action relevant to the brain. It is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which prompted investigators to study its potential for slowing progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where glutamate toxicity is thought to be a factor. The combination agent DM/Q was developed to slow the metabolism of DM by P450 2D6 enzymes in the liver. DM/Q was not effective in slowing ALS progression, but patients noted that it helped to control their emotional outbursts, suggesting it might be useful as a treatment for PBA. DM is also a sigma-1 receptor agonist. These receptors are widely distributed in the brain, but probably most heavily in the limbic system, suggesting that DM may exert its emotion-controlling effects via these receptors. The endogenous ligands for sigma-1 receptors are not altogether known, although they appear to include gonadal steroids. DM/Q was recently shown to be effective in reducing the severity of PBA in two large studies of ALS and multiple sclerosis, which are probably the most common neurological settings. These are the largest treatment studies of PBA ever done. The agent was safe and relatively well tolerated. Further studies are being conducted to see if efficacy can be maintained with lower doses of quinidine. If DM/Q is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of PBA, it would be the first agent approved for this purpose. Currently, the antidepressants are probably the most attractive pharmacologic options for treatment of PBA. The choice of whether to use DM/Q in this setting will likely depend on individual patient factors as well as cost.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 32, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2184196', 'name': 'H.

BackgroundEC implies that a person has difficulty keeping his emotional behavior under control and it occurs in a number of neurologic disorders. MethodIntensive literature searches were carried out to address the following 4 questions: (1) What is EC and what effects does it have? (2) In which disorders is EC common? (3) How can EC be diagnosed? and finally, (4) Can EC be treated? ResultsEC is common in a variety of neurologic disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, and multiple sclerosis whereas brain regions implicated may be both focal and/or diffuse. Both in a qualitative and quantitative way, EC does not clearly differ from crying in normal adults. There is a remarkable similarity between the precipitating factors in normal crying and EC. Three questionnaires for the diagnosis of EC have been developed. Treatment with low doses of antidepressants yields promising results. ConclusionsWe recommend choosing one term for the phenomenon of EC that does justice to the fact that the threshold for such crying is exceptionally low. This may reduce confusion in the literature and among health professionals. The neurologic origin of EC has yet to be fully mapped out. Antidepressants are the treatment of choice for EC whereas early treatment should be the goal for both patients and their carers.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 93, 'citationCount': 13, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1402972886', 'name': 'R.

We originally coined the term status gelasticus for a presentation at the 2004 meeting of the Southern Pediatric Neurology Society (abstract published in the Journal of Child Neurology). We described a 30-monthold boy who underwent successful emergent transcallosal resection of his hypothalamic hamartoma for this condition, which had persisted for nearly 2 months. In the subsequently published case report appearing a year later, we indicated that status gelasticus is “near continuous gelastic-seizure (laughing) activity.” In response to the 2005 publication by Palmini et al of a patient with status gelasticus, we clarified the definition of status gelasticus as “a prolonged cluster of gelastic seizures (i.e., for greater than 20–30 minutes, a period similar to that of status epilepticus)” and reiterated this in a later publication. It was good to learn that the patient of Shahar et al responded well to small doses of clonazepam and that the abundance of benzodiazepine receptors in the hypothalamic region could explain the effect. Unfortunately, we have seen many patients with epilepsy symptomatic from hypothalamic hamartoma who have failed numerous antiepileptic drugs, including the various benzodiazepines. The hypothalamic hamartoma, with its wide spectrum of clinical presentations, seems to be the best example of subcortical epileptogenesis and encephalopathy. The traditional belief has been that the parahypothalamic (pedunculated form) type of hypothalamic hamartoma typically presents with isolated precocious puberty, whereas the intrahypothalamic (sessile) subtype presents with the epileptic encephalopathy picture including refractory epilepsy and the trademark gelastic seizures. However, as more patients have been accumulated, a large overlap between the various subtypes and clinical pictures has become apparent. Likely, there are also “normal people” who have asymptomatic hypothalamic hamartomas. We have had good surgical outcomes and excellent seizure response rates following operations on many patients from among the more refractory (epilepsy) group. Long-term follow-up of our most recent 37 hypothalamic hamartoma patients with refractory symptomatic epilepsy who were treated with endoscopic resection resulted in 49% becoming seizure-free and 93% with greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. In addition, duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter than our previously published group of patients who had been treated by transcallosal resection. Thus, hypothalamic hamartoma patients can present with a wide range of clinical features from (near) normal to isolated precocious puberty to severe progressive epileptic encephalopathy. Treatment for the epileptic patients should be individualized, probably in a systematic stepwise manner from low-dose antiepileptic drug monotherapy to multiple antiepileptic drugs to surgery as necessary. However, it is important to recognize that several patients appear to have a developmental regression if there is delay in curative treatment (surgical resection or gamma knife surgery) of refractory seizures. Therefore, as soon as it becomes clear that ongoing medical management will be unsuccessful, timely consideration of surgical interventions is necessary.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 8, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2238941', 'name': 'Yu‐tze Ng'}]}, {'paperId': 'cd67ad7a192ca72fe59004c6f28c6818eb48dc08', 'title': 'Pathological crying in patients with Machado‐Joseph disease', 'abstract': 'Ann Neurol 1995;38:825-828. 7.

The reDear Sir, Poststroke pathological laughter can develop during the acute or chronic stage following cerebral infarcts. The latter delayed-onset type, commonly known as emotionalism, is usually associated with the bilateral involvement of the descending corticobulbar pathways as a component of pseudobulbar palsy [1, 2] . The former, called ‘fou rire prodromique’ by Fere in 1903 [3] , has been reported in just a few cases and is often confused with the delayed-onset form. This acute-onset type has been considered to be a unique situation rather than a symptom of acute ischemia because the spells of laughter are generally transient, often herald stroke as a single episode [4] or immediately follow the onset of focal deficits [5] . However, the clinical significance of the acute-onset type remains controversial.

The patient reported that, after his stroke 2 weeks ago, he has been crying “for no reason” several times a day. He described that the crying spells last several seconds and cannot be resisted. The patient denies depressed mood or symptoms consistent with a mood disorder. On examination, stereotyped paroxysms of crying lasting 5–10 seconds were noted during the interview, incongruent to any emotional themes discussed. The patient was diagnosed with pathological crying and was started on citalopram 10 mg orally at night. On follow-up, he reported that his crying spells stopped within days of initiating the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication. \n \nPathological laughing and crying (PLC) is one of the most common poststroke affective disorders. The cardinal feature of this disorder is a markedly lowered threshold for exhibiting affective behaviour (crying, laughing or both) that is out of proportion to underlying feelings of happiness or sadness. At an extreme, the expression of affect is completely incongruous to the reported underlying emotional experience. Pure pathological crying is by far the most common presentation, representing approximately 80% of cases of post-stroke PLC. Estimates of the prevalence of PLC vary from 7% to up to 48.5% of stroke survivors, with a greater prevalence found in inpatient populations and during the acute post-stroke period. \n \nAlthough it is important to consider the presence of a depressive episode in people who present with excessive emotionality, most people with PLC do not have a diagnosable mood disorder, and many do not manifest depressive symptoms at all. \n \nThe etiology of PLC is unknown. Converging lines of evidence suggest that monoaminergic neurotransmission is altered in those who develop PLC after a stroke. \n \nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of PLC have been reported in the English literature. In pooled data of 93 people from these placebo-controlled trials of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, 96% of patients who received antidepressant medication demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the number of crying episodes at the end of the treatment trials, compared with 27.5% of patients who received placebo, yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes after a stroke, often within days, rather than the weeks typically expected before antidepressant effects are seen. SSRIs should be regarded as the first-line choice when treating poststroke PLC, given the greater tolerability of SSRIs and their lower propensity to have effects on the cardiovascular system, compared with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. The doses of the SSRI medications that were effective in treating PLC in the studies described above (fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg and citalopram 10–20 mg) are at the low end of the therapeutic range used for treating depression. Case reports suggest that bupropion, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and lamotrigine may be effective for PLC in people who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, SSRIs. \n \nThere are limited data to guide clinicians on how long patients should remain on treatment. For most stroke patients, the natural history of PLC is for the symptoms to gradually improve over time. However, it is estimated that 10%–15% of people continue to manifest symptoms a year after a stroke. Reports have suggested that PLC can reemerge after discontinuing the antidepressant drug, whereas reinstatement of the medication leads to swift amelioration of these symptoms. The need for long-term treatment needs to be evaluated on an individual basis. \n \nPeter Giacobbe, MD Alastair Flint, MB Department of Psychiatry University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Toronto, Ont.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 11, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3710455', 'name': 'P.

Diagnosis of PBA can be difficult and relies on careful characterization of episodes and differentiation from depression.

The objective of this study was to validate the CNS Emotional Lability Scale (CNS-LS) in MS patients and to correlate the results with the frequency and intensity of episodes of PLC. Physicians at seven private practice referral centers in the United States made a diagnosis concerning PLC based on patient interviews. Clinical coordinators separately administered the CNS-LS, a self-report measure of PLC with seven questions, to MS patients, including patients known to exhibit PLC, patients thought to be free of PLC, and newly diagnosed patients where PLC status was unknown, and the physician was blinded as to the results. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to define a cut-off best correlating with the physician’s diagnosis. Of 90 MS patients selected to complete the survey, 50 were physician diagnosed with PLC; 40 were without PLC, and 15 of these 90 patients were newly diagnosed with MS (B-6 months). Scores of 17 or higher corresponded to a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.83 (LR -/5.5, LR -/0.07); 89% of patients were correctly diagnosed. The area under the ROC curve was 0.95.

Affected patients often have deficits in informationprocessing speed and memory and exhibit psychopathological states such as depression. A minority of patients have rarer affect/mood disorders such as euphoria sclerotica and pathological laughter/crying. Neuropsychological impairment is a major predictor of low quality of life, unemployment, and caregiver distress. Studies evaluating correlations between neuropsychological impairment and findings on magnetic resonance imaging show that neuropsychological dysfunction is associated with lesion burden and diffuse disease in normalappearing brain tissue. However, measures of tissue atrophy including whole‐brain and central atrophy are especially well correlated with and predictive of cognitive impairment. Moreover, recent studies have shown that conventional measures of brain atrophy explain more variance in neuropsychological dysfunction than do measures of lesion burden. In particular, neuropsychological outcomes correspond highly with linear measures of subcortical atrophy such as ventricle enlargement. Within the domain of emotional dysfunction, both lesion burden and atrophy are related to major depressive disorder. Brain atrophy also predicts euphoria and disinhibition. The preliminary data suggest that although lesion burden primarily predicts depressive disorder, both lesion burden and atrophy predict the presence of euphoria. Euphoria and disinhibition likely represent personality change associated with worsening cognition as the disease progresses. Taken together, this growing body of data on magnetic resonance imaging to neuropsychological correlations supports the clinical relevance and validity of brain atrophy as a measure of disease progression in multiple sclerosis.

Investigations into their neurological correlates remain fragmentary and the following review is a first attempt to collate and evaluate these studies, most of which have been published over the last two decades. By employing the classical methods of neurology, brain regions associated with symptomatic (pathological) laughter have been determined and catalogued under other diagnostic signs and symptoms of such conditions as epilepsy, strokes and circumspect brain lesions. These observations have been complemented by newer studies using modern non-invasive imaging methods. To summarize the results of many studies, the expression of laughter seems to depend on two partially independent neuronal pathways. The first of these, an 'involuntary' or 'emotionally driven' system, involves the amygdala, thalamic/hypo- and subthalamic areas and the dorsal/tegmental brainstem. The second, 'voluntary' system originates in the premotor/frontal opercular areas and leads through the motor cortex and pyramidal tract to the ventral brainstem. These systems and the laughter response appear to be coordinated by a laughter-coordinating centre in the dorsal upper pons. Analyses of the cerebral correlates of humour have been impeded by a lack of consensus among psychologists on exactly what humour is, and of what essential components it consists. Within the past two decades, however, sufficient agreement has been reached that theory-based hypotheses could be formulated and tested with various non-invasive methods. For the perception of humour (and depending on the type of humour involved, its mode of transmission, etc.) the right frontal cortex, the medial ventral prefrontal cortex, the right and left posterior (middle and inferior) temporal regions and possibly the cerebellum seem to be involved to varying degrees.

PLC is a disorder of emotional expression rather than a primary disturbance of feelings, and is thus distinct from mood disorders in which laughter and crying are associated with feelings of happiness or sadness. The traditional and currently accepted view is that PLC is due to the damage of pathways that arise in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex and descend to the brainstem to inhibit a putative centre for laughter and crying. In that view, the lesions 'disinhibit' or 'release' the laughter and crying centre. The neuroanatomical findings in a recently studied patient with PLC, along with new knowledge on the neurobiology of emotion and feeling, gave us an opportunity to revisit the traditional view and propose an alternative. Here we suggest that the critical PLC lesions occur in the cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathways and that, as a consequence, the cerebellar structures that automatically adjust the execution of laughter or crying to the cognitive and situational context of a potential stimulus, operate on the basis of incomplete information about that context, resulting in inadequate and even chaotic behaviour."", 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 394, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153836271', 'name': 'J.

METHODS Potential questionnaire items were identified through interviews with patients and families and expert review. Potential items, as well as measures of affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression were administered to 99 patients with ALS for item selection and the examination of factor structure and construct validity. Test-retest reliability was examined using an additional sample of 31 patients with ALS, and criterion related validity was examined by comparing CNS-LS scores with physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability in a sample of 77 patients with ALS. RESULTS A seven item questionnaire emerged, composed of two subscales measuring labile laughter (four items) and labile tearfulness (three items). The CNS-LS showed a pattern of associations with affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression consistent with a scale measuring affective lability. The CNS-LS also showed good test-retest reliability and internal consistency, and successfully predicted physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability. An auxiliary subscale measuring labile frustration, anger, and impatience also emerged. CONCLUSIONS The CNS-LS is a short, easily administered, and psychometrically sound measure of affective lability for use with patients with ALS. It has potential applications as both a clinical screening device and a research tool.

Two kinds of preparation are used--firstly, human normal immunoglobulin, derived from normal donors, and, secondly, human specific immunoglobulin, derived from coivalescent donors, which contains increased amounts of antibody against a specified disease.\' Human normal immunoglobulin is available from blood transfusion centres in Britain, but human specific immunoglobulin is in very limited supply. Chicken-pox is one of the mildest of the childhood fevers, and in most cases there is little reason to seek a means of immunization against it. But it can occasionally be a severe and even fatal infection, so that passive immunization may have a useful-if occasional-role against it as well as against the other virus diseases for which this form of prophylaxis is more often used. Passive immunization with human normal immunoglobulin modifies but does not prevent an attack of chicken-pox.2 I Children treated in this way developed the disease as often as controls but had fewer skin vesicles and lower temperatures.\' The modifying effect was greatest when doses of 06 ml. per lb. body weight (1-3 ml. per kg.) were given, but there was some slight modification of the disease even among children who received doses of only 01 ml. per lb. (02 ml. per kg.). Recently P. A. Brunell and colleagues in New York have shown that chicken-pox may be prevented by inoculation with human specific immunoglobulin prepared from donors who were recovering from herpes zoster.4 The human anti-zoster globulin was given within three days of exposure to one of two children in six families in which a third child had developed chicken-pox. The remaining child in each family was given human normal immunoglobulin as a control. None of the six children given human anti-zoster immunoglobulin developed either clinical chicken-pox or antibody to varicellazoster virus. In contrast, all six children treated with human normal immunoglobulin developed chicken-pox and four showed rising titres to varicella-zoster virus. There is clearly no indication for this form of passive immunization when normal healthy children are exposed to chicken-pox, but there is an increased risk of a serious outcome when certain types of patient contract the disease. Children suffering from leukaemia or being treated with steroids or antimetabolites have an increased susceptibility to chickenpox and are especially liable to develop a severe infection.\'-8 Like other childhood fevers, chicken-pox tends to be more severe in adults, and the adult disease may be accompanied by pneumonia.9-2 Chicken-pox pneumonia varies in severity from a serious illness which may be fatal to a mild or even symptomless complication. Four cases of fatal chicken-pox have been described in pregnant women.""3 Though this suggests that pregnancy may sometimes predispose to severe attack, other studies have described cases of chicken-pox during pregnancy which were generally mild, and the risk seems no greater than in any adult who contracts the disease."" 1 Fortunately varicella-zoster virus does not seem to cause congenital anomalies in the foetus, but i. occasionally gives rise to severe disseminated disease in the newborn.16 In these various circumstances, where there are factors known to predispose to the development of severe chicken-pox, prompt administration of human anti-zoster globulin after known exposure to chicken-pox may prevent infection. In established cases of severe chicken-pox-which are also seen occasionally in patients in whom there are no apparent predisposing factors17 18-treatment with human specific immunoglobulin\'9 or, if this is not available, human normal immunoglobulin3 may reduce the severity of the disease.', 'year': 1969, 'referenceCount': 6, 'citationCount': 5, 'authors': []}, {'paperId': '220111baec86c235c6b4ddf51c7510618fd6b382', 'title': 'The Use of Imipramine (“Tofranil”) and Other Psychotropic Drugs in Organic Emotionalism', 'abstract': 'Emotionalism, occurring as excessive or inappropriate weepiness or laughter, is a common and distressing symptom of the pseudobulbar state.

Also, major progress has been made by the discovery of genes relevant for the disease, and pathogenetic concepts have been suggested which imply that not one, but multiple genetic and cell biological hits are involved in the causation of the disease. Progress in interventional therapies has remained poor; important recent examples are the failure of the interventional lithium and pioglitazone trials. However, a study of a third interventional compound - dexpramipexol - raises substantial hopes that the class of chemicals originally represented by riluzole - benzothiazoles - may provide additional therapeutic progress for ALS patients.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nTremendous progress has been made in the field of ALS based on recent neuropathological and genetic discoveries.

The behaviors that we witnessed and that were described by patients and families included distractibility and hyperactivity, impulsiveness, disinhibition, anxiety, ritualistic and stereotypical behaviors, illogical thought and lack of empathy, as well as aggression and irritability. Ruminative and obsessive behaviors, dysphoria and depression, tactile defensiveness and sensory overload, apathy, childlike behavior, and inability to appreciate social boundaries and assign ulterior motives were also evident. We grouped these disparate neurobehavioral profiles into five major domains, characterized broadly as disorders of attentional control, emotional control, and social skill set as well as autism spectrum disorders, and psychosis spectrum disorders. Drawing on our dysmetria of thought hypothesis, we conceptualized the symptom complexes within each putative domain as reflecting either exaggeration (overshoot, hypermetria) or diminution (hypotonia, or hypometria) of responses to the internal or external environment. Some patients fluctuated between these two states.

Even though ALS remains fatal, several advances have been made during the last decade in improving the consequences of motor dysfunction, quality of life and survival time of patients. Treatment of ALS cannot be restricted to riluzole, the only molecule that has been proved to modify the evolution of the disease. Symptomatic treatments have an important role in controlling the major consequences of the disease, such as pain, sleep disorders, spasticity, hypersialhorroea, emotional lability, depression and digestive disorders (constipation and reflux). All these symptoms need to be recognized and their possible causes identified in order to provide the most appropriate management of patients with ALS. However, an advance in the daily care of patients is the identification of two important phenomena that occur during the evolution of the disease: swallowing difficulties and the occurrence of diaphragmatic dysfunction. For both, specific medical interventions have been developed to allow correction of the consequences (i.e. weight loss and respiratory insufficiency). Although no controlled trials have been performed, observational studies suggest that gastrostomy and non-invasive ventilation may improve at least quality of life and survival. All of these various approaches, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical therapies, are prescribed according to individual symptoms and require the involvement of a large range of health professionals. This multidisciplinary approach in ALS clinics is considered to be one of the more important factors impacting on survival rate and appears to be the gold standard of medical care of ALS patients. Important findings have been made in understanding the nature of the degenerative process that affects the motor neurons.

Buchman and Wichter in which they described a patient who recovered from ""locked-in"" syndrome. We had the opportunity of seeing a patient who developed multiple episodes of the ""locked-in"" state from which he always recovered completely. The patient was a 71 -year-old man with a long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for which he had just been admitted. He suddenly became mute and completely immobile and was only able to close his eyelids and move his eyes horizontally on command. He was not able to move his tongue or swallow. At the time of the episode his blood pressure was 100/60 torr. CT scan of the head was normal. The event resolved completely within a few hours, and the patient became neurologically normal. After regaining his ability to speak, he related a history of having had two or three similar episodes within the previous week. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin, and attempts were made to keep his systolic blood pressure above 130 torr. He was considered to be a poor risk for long-term anticoagulation owing to his overall debilitated health. Heparin was therefore discontinued after 2 weeks, and he was started on aspirin. After 2 more weeks of observation, he was discharged home without any further episodes. We think that our patient had reversible ""locked-in"" syndrome secondary to vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which decompensated after periods of hypotension. We postulate that the ""locked-in"" state cannot only be reversible, but it may also recur as the result of multiple episodes of transient vertebrobasilar ischemia.', 'year': 1987, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 216, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144757727', 'name': 'C.

30,30,30,30,52,f9f3a4a3269d7ed86543144cd0579d81ecbd104b,A real reason for patients with pseudobulbar affect to smile,"Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a dramatic disorder of emotional expression and regulation characterized by uncontrollable episodes of laughing and crying that often cause embarrassment, curtailment of social activities, and reduction in quality of life. The disorder occurs in patients with brain injury caused by many types of neurological disease, including stroke, tumors, and neurodegenerative gray and white matter disorders. Although the pathophysiology is unknown, PBA may relate to release of brainstem emotional control centers from regulation by the frontal lobes. Diagnosis of PBA can be difficult and relies on careful characterization of episodes and differentiation from depression. Although there are no US Food and Drug Administration–approved treatments for PBA, several agents have been shown to be effective, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and a new agent containing dextromethorphan and quinidine. The growing number of treatment options, some of great benefit to patients, highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis of this disorder.

Investigations into their neurological correlates remain fragmentary and the following review is a first attempt to collate and evaluate these studies, most of which have been published over the last two decades. By employing the classical methods of neurology, brain regions associated with symptomatic (pathological) laughter have been determined and catalogued under other diagnostic signs and symptoms of such conditions as epilepsy, strokes and circumspect brain lesions. These observations have been complemented by newer studies using modern non-invasive imaging methods. To summarize the results of many studies, the expression of laughter seems to depend on two partially independent neuronal pathways. The first of these, an 'involuntary' or 'emotionally driven' system, involves the amygdala, thalamic/hypo- and subthalamic areas and the dorsal/tegmental brainstem. The second, 'voluntary' system originates in the premotor/frontal opercular areas and leads through the motor cortex and pyramidal tract to the ventral brainstem. These systems and the laughter response appear to be coordinated by a laughter-coordinating centre in the dorsal upper pons. Analyses of the cerebral correlates of humour have been impeded by a lack of consensus among psychologists on exactly what humour is, and of what essential components it consists. Within the past two decades, however, sufficient agreement has been reached that theory-based hypotheses could be formulated and tested with various non-invasive methods. For the perception of humour (and depending on the type of humour involved, its mode of transmission, etc.) the right frontal cortex, the medial ventral prefrontal cortex, the right and left posterior (middle and inferior) temporal regions and possibly the cerebellum seem to be involved to varying degrees.

Sigma receptors are non-opioid, non-phencyclidine receptors that contain two subtypes: sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. The sigma-1 receptor has been cloned and its sequence does not resemble that of any mammalian protein. Sigma-2 receptors have not been cloned. The focus of this review will be on sigma-1 receptors. Sigma-1 receptors contain 223 amino acids and reside primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum. Sigma-1 receptors exist mainly in the central nervous system, but also in the periphery. Sigma-1 receptor ligands include cocaine, (+)-benzomorphans like (+)-pentazocine and (+)N-allyl-normetazocine (or (+)-SKF-10047), and endogenous neurosteroids like progesterone and pregnenolone sulfate. Many pharmacological and physiological actions have been attributed to sigma-1 receptors. These include the regulation of IP3 receptors and calcium signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum, mobilization of cytoskeletal adaptor proteins, modulation of nerve growth factor-induced neurite sprouting, modulation of neurotransmitter release and neuronal firing, modulation of potassium channels as a regulatory subunit, alteration of psychostimulant-induced gene expression, and blockade of spreading depression. Behaviorally, sigma-1 receptors are involved in learning and memory, psychostimulant-induced sensitization, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, and pain perception. Notably, in almost all the aforementioned biochemical and behavioral tests, sigma-1 agonists, while having no effects by themselves, caused the amplification of signal transductions incurred upon the stimulation of the glutamatergic, dopaminergic, IP3-related metabotropic, or nerve growth factor-related systems. Thus, it is hypothesized that sigma-1 receptors, at least in part, are intracellular amplifiers creating a supersensitized state for signal transduction in the biological system.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 189, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144305331', 'name': 'T.

The episodes occur either without an apparent triggering stimulus or following a stimulus that would not have led the subject to laugh or cry prior to the onset of the condition. PLC is a disorder of emotional expression rather than a primary disturbance of feelings, and is thus distinct from mood disorders in which laughter and crying are associated with feelings of happiness or sadness. The traditional and currently accepted view is that PLC is due to the damage of pathways that arise in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex and descend to the brainstem to inhibit a putative centre for laughter and crying. In that view, the lesions 'disinhibit' or 'release' the laughter and crying centre. The neuroanatomical findings in a recently studied patient with PLC, along with new knowledge on the neurobiology of emotion and feeling, gave us an opportunity to revisit the traditional view and propose an alternative. Here we suggest that the critical PLC lesions occur in the cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathways and that, as a consequence, the cerebellar structures that automatically adjust the execution of laughter or crying to the cognitive and situational context of a potential stimulus, operate on the basis of incomplete information about that context, resulting in inadequate and even chaotic behaviour."", 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 394, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153836271', 'name': 'J.

In 1924, Wilson postulated a supranuclear pontobulbar center for affective synergisms that is controlled by cortex and thalamus.

To clarify the functional role of sigma receptors in a stressful situation, we investigated the behavioral and neurochemical effects of various sigma receptor ligands on this psychological stress-induced motor suppression, defined as a conditioned fear stress. (+)-SKF-10,047 and dextromethorphan, putative sigma receptor agonists, reversed the conditioned fear stress. However, other sigma receptor ligands, (+)-pentazocine and 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine had no effect. Further, (+)-SKF-10,047, but not (+)-pentazocine, restored the decreased dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens in the stressed group to the control level, the effect being consistent with its behavioral effect. We indicated that these controversial results may be due to the presence of multiple types of sigma receptors, and that the activation of phenytoin-sensitive sigma 1 receptors may be involved in the ameliorating effects of sigma receptor agonists on this stress. Our findings suggest that the dysfunction in the mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons is responsible for the development of conditioned fear stress, and that this stress response is restored through phenytoin-sensitive sigma 1 receptors, which are closely connected to the dopaminergic neuronal systems.', 'year': 1998, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 17, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1972849', 'name': 'H.

METHODS Potential questionnaire items were identified through interviews with patients and families and expert review. Potential items, as well as measures of affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression were administered to 99 patients with ALS for item selection and the examination of factor structure and construct validity. Test-retest reliability was examined using an additional sample of 31 patients with ALS, and criterion related validity was examined by comparing CNS-LS scores with physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability in a sample of 77 patients with ALS. RESULTS A seven item questionnaire emerged, composed of two subscales measuring labile laughter (four items) and labile tearfulness (three items). The CNS-LS showed a pattern of associations with affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression consistent with a scale measuring affective lability. The CNS-LS also showed good test-retest reliability and internal consistency, and successfully predicted physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability. An auxiliary subscale measuring labile frustration, anger, and impatience also emerged. CONCLUSIONS The CNS-LS is a short, easily administered, and psychometrically sound measure of affective lability for use with patients with ALS.

The 54 acute stroke patients were used to evaluate the Pathological Laughter and Crying Scale, and the 28 patients with pathological emotional display were randomly assigned to nortriptyline treatment or placebo in a 6-week double-blind trial to assess the efficacy of a tricyclic antidepressant in treatment of this disorder.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe interrater reliability on the Pathological Laughter and Crying Scale for a subgroup of 15 patients was 0.93, and the test-retest reliability of the scale was excellent. After 4 and 6 weeks of treatment, scores on the Pathological Laughter and Crying Scale showed significantly greater improvement in the 14 patients given nortriptyline than in the 14 given placebo.

Since ALS occurs mostly in older age groups, this brings up the possibility that aging changes in the brain could play a causative role in the origin of such spells. To rule out or at least reduce the complicating factor of aging, a study was made of the incidence of pathologic laughter and crying in patients whose motor neuron disease had started before the age of 45 years. The data were collected from 73 such individuals, all with confirmed ALS. All told, 36 had experienced episodes of pathologic laughter and/or crying. Of these, 20 had bouts of both laughter and crying. 9 bouts of crying alone and 7 spells of laughter alone. Nearly all with such emotional spells had developed bulbar involvement with the illness.

The RVLM contains barosensitive neurones that maintain resting blood pressure via their projections to sympathetic preganglionic neurones in the thoracic spinal cord. In this study on rats, we used combined anterograde neuronal tracing of CeA projections with confocal and electron microscopic immunohistochemical detection of phenylethanolamine‐N‐methyltransferase, the adrenaline‐synthesizing enzyme present in C1 catecholamine neurones of the RVLM, and Fos, the protein product of the c‐fos proto‐oncogene. Fos expression in barosensitive neurones was stimulated by an intravenous infusion of the hypotensive agent sodium nitroprusside. Injection of the tracer biotin dextran amine (10‐kDa form) into the CeA resulted in anterograde labelling of axons and varicosities throughout the RVLM without retrograde labelling of somata in any brain area. With confocal microscopy, presumptive CeA terminals were found in close apposition to adrenergic (phenylethanolamine‐N‐methyltransferase‐immunoreactive) and non‐adrenergic neurones that displayed Fos‐immunoreactive nuclei in response to decreased blood pressure. Electron microscopic analysis confirmed that some labelled terminals of CeA axons made synaptic contact with c‐fos‐activated adrenergic neurones. The results provide evidence that cardiovascular influences elicited from the CeA during stressful events may be mediated, at least in part, via monosynaptic neural projections to barosensitive sympathetic blood pressure‐regulating neurones in the RVLM.",2005,51,41,"{'name': 'European Journal of Neuroscience', 'volume': '21'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [0.8781315684318542,

The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) plays a key role in sleep generation and, as such, might be an important target of the SCN circadian signal. However, direct SCN projections to the VLPO are limited, suggesting that most of the SCN output to the VLPO might be conveyed indirectly. We examined this possibility by microinjecting selected known major targets of SCN efferents with biotinylated dextran‐amine and/or cholera toxin B subunit, followed by analyses of retrograde labelling in the SCN and anterograde labelling in the VLPO. Retrograde labelling results confirmed that the medial preoptic area, subparaventricular zone, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and posterior hypothalamic area all received projections from the SCN; these projections arose predominantly from the shell, as opposed to the core, of the SCN. Anterograde labelling results indicated that these same nuclei also projected to the VLPO, mainly its medial and ventral aspects. Comparison of the results of injections of similar sizes across different target groups indicated that the rostral part of the medial preoptic area and the caudal part of the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus were particularly noteworthy for the abundance of both SCN source neurons and efferent fibres and terminals in the VLPO. These results suggest that the SCN might provide indirect input to the VLPO via the medial preoptic area and the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, and that these indirect neuronal pathways might play a major role in circadian control of sleep–wake cycles.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 88, 'citationCount': 91, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31558465', 'name': 'S.

This monosynaptic input includes adrenergic (C1), peptidergic, and noncatecholaminergic neurons. Some of the cells in this pathway are suspected to be glutamatergic, but conclusive evidence is lacking. In the present study we sought to determine whether these presympathetic neurons express the vesicular glutamate transporter BNPI/VGLUT1 or the closely related gene DNPI, the rat homolog of the mouse vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2. Both BNPI/VGLUT1 and DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNAs were detected in the medulla oblongata by in situ hybridization, but only DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA was present in the RVLM. Moreover, BNPI immunoreactivity was absent from the thoracic spinal cord lateral horn. DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA was present in many medullary cells retrogradely labeled with Fluoro‐Gold from the spinal cord (T2; four rats). Within the RVLM, 79% of the bulbospinal C1 cells contained DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA. Bulbospinal noradrenergic A5 neurons did not contain DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA. The RVLM of six unanesthetized rats subjected to 2 hours of hydralazine‐induced hypotension contained tenfold more c‐Fos‐ir DNPI/VGLUT2 neurons than that of six saline‐treated controls. c‐Fos‐ir DNPI/VGLUT2 neurons included C1 and non‐C1 neurons (3:2 ratio). In seven barbiturate‐anesthetized rats, 16 vasomotor presympathetic neurons were filled with biotinamide and analyzed for the presence of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and/or DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA. Biotinamide‐labeled neurons included C1 and non‐C1 cells. Most non‐C1 (9/10) and C1 presympathetic cells (5/6) contained DNPI/VGLUT2 mRNA. In conclusion, DNPI/VGLUT2 is expressed by most blood pressure‐regulating presympathetic cells of the RVLM. The data suggest that these neurons may be glutamatergic and that the C1 adrenergic phenotype is one of several secondary phenotypes that are differentially expressed by subgroups of these cells. J.

However, rats with selective lesion of A5 cells by microinjection of 6‐hydroxydopamine into the pons showed no deficits to stimulation of the RVLM. 7 In summary, the loss of 84% of bulbospinal adrenergic neurones does not alter the ability of RVLM to maintain SNA and arterial pressure at rest in anaesthetized rats, but this loss reduces the sympathoexcitatory and pressor responses evoked by RVLM stimulation.

To clarify the nature of this involvement, immuno‐ and hybridization histochemical methods were used to follow c‐fos expression in these neurons in response to acute stimuli that differentially affect blood pressure and volume. From low basal levels, hypotensive hemorrhage (15%) provoked a progressive increase in the number and distribution of Fos‐immunoreactive (ir) nuclei in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the Al and C1 cell groups of the ventrolateral medulla, and in the pontine A5, locus coeruleus, and lateral parabrachial cell groups peaking at 2.0–2.5 hours after the challenge. Fos‐ir ventrolateral medullary neurons, subsets of which were identified as projecting to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus or spinal cord, were predominantly aminergic, whereas most of those in the NTS were not. Infusion of an angiotensin II antagonist blunted hemorrhage‐induced Fos expression in the area postrema, and attenuated that seen elsewhere in the medulla and pons. Nitroprusside‐induced isovolemic hypotension yielded a pattern of c‐fos induction similar to that seen following hemorrhage, except in the area postrema and the Al cell group, where the response was muted or lacking. Phenylephrineinduced hypertension stimulated a restricted pattern of c‐fos expression, largely limited to non‐aminergic neurons, whose distribution in the NTS conformed to the termination patterns of primary baroreceptor afferents, and in the ventrolateral medulla overlapped in part with those of vagal cardiomotor and depressor neurons. These findings underscore the importance of brainstem catecholaminergic neurons in effecting integrated homeostatic responses to cardiovascular challenges and their ability to responding strategically to specific modalities of cardiovascular information. They also foster testable predictions as to effector neuron populations that might be recruited to respond to perturbations in individual circulatory parameters. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.', 'year': 1994, 'referenceCount': 177, 'citationCount': 309, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49534406', 'name': 'Raymond K.

Chemical stimulation produced significantly fewer (25%) depressor responses. Similar results were obtained with injections of 1.0 M DLH. To eliminate the influence of the anesthetic on these responses, AP was recorded in nine conscious rats while stimulating the amygdala. Changes in behavior and AP in these animals could be obtained only by electrical stimulation.

A total of 138 units were found which were inhibited by transient increases in mean arterial pressure elicited by intravenous injection of norepinephrine, aortic occlusion, or electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus, with 100% inhibition occurring at 148 mm Hg. Histograms of postsystolic activity showed that these units had pulse-synchronous rhythms which grew more prominent as arterial pressure increased. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve, which elicited a vasodepressor response, strongly inhibited these units. Thus, these neurons were termed negatively correlated cardiovascular units. At least half of these cells project to or through the thoracic spinal cord. In addition, arterial pressure sensitivity is conveyed through carotid sinus and aortic arch afferents. Approximately half of the cardiovascular units are also excited by hypothalamic stimulation. Finally, analysis of neighboring cells showed that it is possible to distinguish between cardiovascular and respiratory units.

Details of the pathways and transmitters that mediate tonic and reflex control of AP are emerging. Afferent fibers of cardiopulmonary receptors in the ninth and tenth nerves terminate bilaterally in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). Although some neurons contain substance P, the primary neurotransmitter appears to be the excitatory amino acid L-glutamate (L-glu). Neurons in rostral ventrolateral medulla, which most probably comprise the C1 group of epinephrine neurons, are also critical in AP control. C1 neurons project to innervate cholinergic preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the spinal cord. Stimulation of the C1 area electrically or with L-glu increases AP, while lesions or local injection of the inhibitory amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) lowers AP to levels comparable to spinal cord transection. Lesions of C1 neurons or their pathways abolish vasodepressor reflexes from baroreceptors and vagal afferents. In contrast, noradrenergic neurons of the caudal ventrolateral medulla, the A1 group, project rostrally to innervate, in part, vasopressin neurons of the hypothalamus. Stimulation of A1 neurons lowers AP, while lesions or GABA elevates it. We propose that C1 neurons comprise the so-called tonic vasomotor center of the brain stem and also mediate, via a projection from the NTS, the vasodepressor limb of baroreflexes.

Locations of most active pressor responses were compared to regions containing neurons labeled immunocytochemically for phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of adrenaline. Elevations of arterial pressure (+81.6 +/- 2.5 mm Hg) and cardioacceleration (+73 +/- 13.6 bpm) were elicited with low current (5 times threshold of 9.5 +/- 1.1 microA) electrical stimulation in a region of rostral ventrolateral medullary reticular formation we have termed the nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis (RVL). Electrical stimulation of the RVL increased plasma catecholamines (16.8-fold for adrenaline, 5.3-fold for noradrenaline, and 1.9-fold for dopamine) and vasopressin (1.7-fold before spinal transection, 4.7-fold after). The location of the most active pressor region in the ventrolateral medulla corresponded closely with the location of C1 adrenaline-synthesizing (PNMT-containing) neurons. In addition, the location of the most active pressor region in the dorsomedial medulla corresponded with the location of a bundle of PNMT-containing axons. Unilateral injections into the RVL of the excitatory amino acid monosodium L-glutamate (50 pmol to 10 nmol), but not saline, caused transient dose-dependent and topographically specific elevations (maximum +71.6 +/- 4.9 mm Hg) of arterial blood pressure and tachycardia. Injections of the rigid structural analogue of glutamate, kainic acid, caused large, prolonged (at least 15 min) pressor responses and tachycardia. Unilateral injections of the inhibitory amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the RVL caused transient dose-dependent hypotension (maximum -40.8 +/- 6.6 mm Hg) and bradycardia, whereas the specific GABA antagonist bicuculline caused prolonged (10 to 20 min) elevations (+64.2 +/- 6.8 mm Hg) of arterial pressure and tachycardia. By contrast, injections of the glycine antagonist strychnine had no significant effect. Bilateral injections of the neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, dropped arterial pressure to low levels (51.7 +/- 4.7) not changed by subsequent spinal cord transection at the first cervical segment (52.5 +/- 6.2). We propose the following. (1) Neurons within the RVL, most probably C1 adrenaline- synthesizing neurons, exert an excitatory influence on sympathetic vasomotor fibers, the adrenal medulla, and the posterior pituitary.

After placing injections of true blue in the dorsal vagal complex or in upper thoracic segments of the spinal cord, series of evenly spaced sections through the PVH were stained with antisera directed against oxytocin, vasopressin, somatostatin, methionine‐enkephalin, or leucine‐encephalin. The results indicate that both oxytocin‐ and vasopressin‐stained cells in the PVH project to the spinal cord and (or) to the dorsal vagal complex, although about three times as many oxytocinstained cells were doubly labeled after injections centered in either terminal field. The oxytocin‐ and vasopressin‐stained cells that give rise to these long descending projections were found primarily in caudal parts of the parvo cellular division of the PVH, where immunoreactive cells were shown to be significantly smaller than oxytocin‐ and vasopressin‐stained cells in parts of the nucleus that project to the posterior pituitary. Small populations of cells in the PVH that cross‐react with antisera against somatostatin, leucine‐enkephalin, or methionine‐enkephalin were also shown to project directly to the region of the dorsal vagal complex and to the spinal cord, and to have a unique distribution within the PVH. Collectively, the total number of doubly labeled cells that were identified in these experiments accounts for only about one‐fourth of the total number of PVH neurons with long descending projections, thus suggesting that additional neuroactive substances are contained within these pathways.', 'year': 1982, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 1106, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3922952', 'name': 'P.

The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the nature of METH-induced changes in the NPY system by examining the effect of multiple, high doses of METH on preproNPY (ppNPY) mRNA expression in the striatum and the role that dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors might play in these changes. Rats were administered five injections of 10 mg/kg METH at 6-h intervals, along with the D1 receptor antagonist 7-chloro-8-hydoxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benazepine hydrochloride (SCH22390) or the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride, and they were sacrificed 3 h after the last dose of METH. The number of neurons expressing ppNPY mRNA in striatum was examined using in situ hybridization histochemistry. An acute dose of METH as well as multiple, high doses of METH increased the number of neurons expressing ppNPY mRNA in all regions of striatum examined. There was no change in the number of prosomatostatin (pSOM) mRNA-containing neurons. The increase in the number of ppNPY mRNA-expressing neurons was abolished by pretreatment with SCH22390. Eticlopride alone increased the number of ppNPY mRNA-expressing neurons in striatum, and METH treatment did not further increase the number. These findings suggest that exposure to multiple, high doses of METH increases the number of neurons expressing detectable levels of ppNPY mRNA and that this phenomenon is dependent on DA D1-receptor activation.",2006,37,21,"{'name': 'Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics', 'pages': '414 - 421', 'volume': '319'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-4.463094234466553,

In the present study, injections of METH to mice were found to cause the death of enkephalin-positive projection neurons but not the death of neuropeptide Y (NPY)/nitric oxide synthase-positive striatal interneurons. In addition, these METH injections were associated with increased expression of neuropeptide Y mRNA and changes in the expression of the NPY receptors Y1 and Y2. Administration of NPY in the cerebral ventricles blocked METH-induced apoptosis, an effect that was mediated mainly by stimulation of NPY Y2 receptors and, to a lesser extent, of NPY Y1 receptors. Finally, we also found that neuropeptide Y knock-out mice were more sensitive than wild-type mice to METH-induced neuronal apoptosis of both enkephalin- and nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons, suggesting that NPY plays a general neuroprotective role within the striatum. Together, our results demonstrate that neuropeptide Y belongs to the class of factors that maintain neuronal integrity during cellular stresses. Given the similarity between the cell death patterns induced by METH and by disorders such as Huntington's disease, our results suggest that NPY analogs might be useful therapeutic agents against some neurodegenerative processes."", 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 60, 'citationCount': 92, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5083024', 'name': 'N.

Dopamine, glutamate, or their combined effects have been hypothesized to mediate striatal DA nerve terminal damage. Although it is known that METH releases DA via reverse transport, it is not known how METH increases the release of GLU. We hypothesized that METH increases GLU indirectly via activation of the basal ganglia output pathways. METH increased striatonigral GABAergic transmission, as evidenced by increased striatal GAD65 mRNA expression and extracellular GABA concentrations in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The METH-induced increase in nigral extracellular GABA concentrations was D1 receptor-dependent because intranigral perfusion of the D1 DA antagonist SCH23390 (10 μm) attenuated the METH-induced increase in GABA release in the SNr. Additionally, METH decreased extracellular GABA concentrations in the ventromedial thalamus (VM). Intranigral perfusion of the GABA-A receptor antagonist, bicuculline (10 μm), blocked the METH-induced decrease in extracellular GABA in the VM and the METH-induced increase in striatal GLU. Intranigral perfusion of either a DA D1 or GABA-A receptor antagonist during the systemic administrations of METH attenuated the striatal DA depletions when measured 1 week later. These results show that METH enhances D1-mediated striatonigral GABAergic transmission (1), which in turn activates GABA-A receptors in the SNr (2), leading to a decrease in GABAergic nigrothalamic activity (3), an increase in corticostriatal GLU release (4), and a consequent long-term depletion of striatal DA content (5).', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 193, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6153648', 'name': 'Karla A.

We discuss data suggesting the participation of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria‐mediated activation of caspase‐dependent and ‐independent cascades in the manifestation of METH‐induced apoptosis.

Although the activities mediated by most dopamine receptor subtypes have already been determined, the role of the D5 receptor subtype in the basal ganglia has still not been established. Furthermore, it is often difficult to distinguish between dopamine D5 and D1 receptors as they are stimulated by the same ligands, and they have a similar molecular structure and pharmacology. In an effort to understand the differences between these two receptor subtypes, we have studied the distribution of neurons containing D5 receptors in the striatum, and their molecular phenotype. As a result, we show that the D5 receptor subtype is present in two different populations of striatal neurons, projection neurons and interneurons. Overall, the abundance of this receptor subtype in the striatum is low, particularly in striatal projection neurons of both the direct and indirect projection pathways. In contrast, the expression of D5 receptors in striatal interneurons (cholinergic, somatostatin‐ or parvalbumin‐positive neurons) is high, while low to moderate expression was observed in calretinin‐positive neurons. Our results demonstrate the presence of D5 receptors in all the striatal cell populations so far described, although at different intensities in each. The fact that a large number of striatal neurons express the D5 receptor subtype suggests that this receptor fulfils an important function in the process of integrating information in the striatum.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 69, 'citationCount': 131, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48363480', 'name': 'A.

Although prior work has focused primarily on the effects of methamphetamine on dopamine cells, there is evidence that other neuronal types are affected. The authors measured regional brain glucose metabolism, which serves as a marker of brain function, to assess if there is evidence of functional changes in methamphetamine abusers in regions other than those innervated by dopamine cells.\n\n\nMETHOD\nFifteen detoxified methamphetamine abusers and 21 comparison subjects underwent positron emission tomography following administration of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhole brain metabolism in the methamphetamine abusers was 14% higher than that of comparison subjects; the differences were most accentuated in the parietal cortex (20%). After normalization for whole brain metabolism, methamphetamine abusers exhibited significantly lower metabolism in the thalamus (17% difference) and striatum (where the differences were larger for the caudate [12%] than for the putamen [6%]). Statistical parametric mapping analyses corroborated these findings, revealing higher metabolism in the parietal cortex and lower metabolism in the thalamus and striatum of methamphetamine abusers.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe fact that the parietal cortex is a region devoid of any significant dopaminergic innervation suggests that the higher metabolism seen in this region in the methamphetamine abusers is the result of methamphetamine effects in circuits other than those modulated by dopamine. In addition, the lower metabolism in the striatum and thalamus (major outputs of dopamine signals into the cortex) is likely to reflect the functional consequence of methamphetamine in dopaminergic circuits.

As a first step toward clarifying this issue further, the present study was thus undertaken to assess the toxic effects of methamphetamine in heterozygous and homozygous c-fos knock-out as well as wild-type mice. Administration of methamphetamine caused significant reduction in [125I]RTI-121–labeled dopamine uptake sites, dopamine transporter protein, and tyrosine hydroxylase–like immunohistochemistry in the striata of wild-type mice. These decreases were significantly exacerbated in heterozygous and homozygous c-fos knock-out mice, with the homozygous showing greater loss of striatal dopaminergic markers. Moreover, in comparison with wild-type animals, both genotypes of c-fos knock-out mice showed more DNA fragmentation, measured by the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick-end–labeled nondopaminergic cells in their cortices and striata. In contrast, wild-type mice treated with methamphetamine demonstrated a greater number of glial fibrillary acidic protein–positive cells than did c-fos knock-out mice.

Because of this association, we determined and compared the effects of psychotomimetic drugs on extrapyramidal and limbic NPY systems. We observed that phencyclidine, methamphetamine (METH), (+)methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and cocaine, but not (-)MDMA, similarly reduced the striatal content of NPY-like immunoreactivity from 54% (phencyclidine) to 74% [(+) MDMA] of control. The effects of METH on NPY levels in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra were characterized in greater detail. We observed that METH decreased NPY levels in specific regions of the nucleus accumbens and the caudate, but had no effect on NPY in the globus pallidus or the substantia nigra. The dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 blocked these effects of METH, suggesting that NPY levels throughout the nucleus accumbens and the caudate are regulated through D1 pathways. The D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride did not appear to alter the METH effect, but this was difficult to determine because eticlopride decreased NPY levels by itself. A single dose of METH was sufficient to lower NPY levels, in some, but not all, regions examined. The effects on NPY levels after multiple METH administrations were substantially greater and persisted up to 48 h after treatment; this suggests that synthesis of this neuropeptide may be suppressed even after the drug is gone.

Because the substantial DA overflow produced by multiple m‐AMPH treatments appears to contribute to the subsequent injury, we have investigated the effects of blockade of D1 or D2 receptors on m‐AMPH‐induced DA efflux using in vivo microdialysis. Four treatments with m‐AMPH (4 mg/kg, s.c., 2‐h intervals) produced large increases in striatal DA overflow, with particularly marked overflow (10 times the basal values) following the fourth injection. Administered by themselves, four injections of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 or the D2 antagonist eticlopride (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 2‐h intervals) significantly increased striatal DA overflow. However, treatment with either SCH 23390 or eticlopride 15 min before each of four m‐AMPH injections attenuated the marked DA peak otherwise seen after the fourth m‐AMPH injection. These effects on DA overflow were related to subsequent DA depletions. Although our m‐AMPH regimen produced a 54% reduction in striatal DA tissue content 1 week later, pretreatments with either the D1 or the D2 antagonist completely prevented subsequent DA content depletions. Furthermore, the DA content of striatal tissue remaining 1 week after m‐AMPH treatment was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the cumulative DA overflow during the m‐AMPH treatment (r= ‐0.69). Thus, the extensive DA overflow seen during neurotoxic regimens of m‐AMPH appears critical to the subsequent neurotoxicity, and the neuroprotective action of DA receptor antagonists seems to result from their attenuation of stimulant‐induced DA overflow.', 'year': 1993, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 112, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1394243791', 'name': ""S.

In the caudate-putamen and accumbens nucleus, most of the neurons containing D1 receptor mRNA were characterized as medium-sized substance P neurons and distinct from those containing D2 receptor mRNA. Nevertheless, 15-20% of the substance P neurons did not contain D1 receptor mRNA. The neurons containing preproenkephalin A mRNA did not contain D1 receptor mRNA but contained D2 receptor mRNA. A small number of cholinergic and somatostatinergic neurons exhibited a weak reaction for D1 receptor mRNA. These results demonstrate that dopamine acts on efferent striatal neurons through expression of distinct receptors--namely, D1 and D2 in separate cell populations (substance P and preproenkephalin A neurons, respectively)--and can also act on nonprojecting neurons through D1 receptor expression.', 'year': 1991, 'referenceCount': 3, 'citationCount': 487, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49043049', 'name': 'C.

The gene spans 7.2 kilobase pairs and contains four exons. The exon organization is identical to the pancreatic polypeptide gene, although the amino acid sequences of the neuropeptide Y and pancreatic polypeptide precursors differ extensively. The predicted amino acid sequence of mature rat neuropeptide Y is identical to the human sequence. Also the sequence of the 30-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide of preproneuropeptide Y is highly conserved, which suggests that it is functionally important. Two neuropeptide Y alleles were found to differ at nine positions in 2.5 kilobase pairs at the 5' portion of the gene. No exon difference was found. One nucleotide substitution close to the gene promoter may influence the regulation of expression. Neuropeptide Y mRNA was found in all rat brain subregions tested, which shows that neuropeptide Y is synthesized throughout the brain. Developmentally, mRNA was detected in the rat brain as early as embryonic day 16 and increased rapidly to adult levels.

Further investigation revealed that neurons containing NADPH-d were also resistant to the toxicity of N-methyl-D-aspartate itself but were selectively vulnerable to the toxicity of either kainate or quisqualate. Thus, neurons containing NADPH-d may have an unusual distribution of receptors for excitatory amino acids, with a relative lack of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and a relative preponderance of kainate or quisqualate receptors.

We found that the D1 antagonist, SCH23390, attenuated or blocked the effects of METH on dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, whereas the D2 antagonist, sulpiride, blocked the effects of METH on only the dopaminergic system. The results of the present studies suggest that METH-induced increases in dopaminergic action on both D1 and D2 receptors are associated with the effects of METH on the dopaminergic system.

PBA is a disorder of emotional regulation, characterized by uncontrollable outbursts of laughing and/or crying that are disproportionate to the emotions being experienced. The pathophysiology of PBA is currently unknown, although the disorder is thought to occur exclusively in the setting of neurological disease. The most influential theory on PBA posits that emotional outbursts are being generated in the brainstem autonomously due to loss of regulatory control by the frontal lobes. Although rarely life-threatening, PBA can have significant impact on patients’ quality of life and thus merits treatment. There are currently no approved treatments for PBA. Several agents have been found to be effective in small placebo-controlled trials and case series, with the most commonly used agents being tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Both these treatments are inexpensive and relatively low-risk, although the quality and quantity of the available data on their efficacy are not optimal. is prompted study where was slow the DM by enzymes DM/Q slowing ALS progression, patients noted sigma1 widely emotion-controlling endogenous ligands for sigma1 receptors are not altogether known, although they appear to include gonadal Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which are probably the most common neurological settings. These are the largest treatment studies of PBA ever done. The agent was safe and relatively well tolerated. Further studies are being conducted to see if efficacy can be maintained with lower doses of quinidine. If DM/Q is approved by the FDA for treatment of PBA, this would be the first agent approved for this purpose. Currently, the antidepressants are probably the most attractive pharmacologic options for treatment of PBA. The choice of whether to use DM/ Q in this setting will likely depend on individual patient factors, as well as cost.",2010,37,1,,"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-3.9779224395751953,

Sigma receptors are non-opioid, non-phencyclidine receptors that contain two subtypes: sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. The sigma-1 receptor has been cloned and its sequence does not resemble that of any mammalian protein. Sigma-2 receptors have not been cloned. The focus of this review will be on sigma-1 receptors. Sigma-1 receptors contain 223 amino acids and reside primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum. Sigma-1 receptors exist mainly in the central nervous system, but also in the periphery. Sigma-1 receptor ligands include cocaine, (+)-benzomorphans like (+)-pentazocine and (+)N-allyl-normetazocine (or (+)-SKF-10047), and endogenous neurosteroids like progesterone and pregnenolone sulfate. Many pharmacological and physiological actions have been attributed to sigma-1 receptors. These include the regulation of IP3 receptors and calcium signaling at the endoplasmic reticulum, mobilization of cytoskeletal adaptor proteins, modulation of nerve growth factor-induced neurite sprouting, modulation of neurotransmitter release and neuronal firing, modulation of potassium channels as a regulatory subunit, alteration of psychostimulant-induced gene expression, and blockade of spreading depression. Behaviorally, sigma-1 receptors are involved in learning and memory, psychostimulant-induced sensitization, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, and pain perception. Notably, in almost all the aforementioned biochemical and behavioral tests, sigma-1 agonists, while having no effects by themselves, caused the amplification of signal transductions incurred upon the stimulation of the glutamatergic, dopaminergic, IP3-related metabotropic, or nerve growth factor-related systems. Thus, it is hypothesized that sigma-1 receptors, at least in part, are intracellular amplifiers creating a supersensitized state for signal transduction in the biological system.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 189, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144305331', 'name': 'T.

This case report illustrates the beneficial effect of lamotrigine, a novel antiepileptic drug with antidepressant and mood-stabilizing properties in post-stroke PLC. A 60-year-old woman developed PLC after an ischemic stroke affecting the left frontal and temporal lobes. She was treated with lamotrigine initially at the dose of 50 mg a day, which was gradually increased to 100 mg a day over a 4-week period. There was a significant and rapid recovery in both laughing and crying components of PCL with lamotrigine treatment.

The episodes occur either without an apparent triggering stimulus or following a stimulus that would not have led the subject to laugh or cry prior to the onset of the condition. PLC is a disorder of emotional expression rather than a primary disturbance of feelings, and is thus distinct from mood disorders in which laughter and crying are associated with feelings of happiness or sadness. The traditional and currently accepted view is that PLC is due to the damage of pathways that arise in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex and descend to the brainstem to inhibit a putative centre for laughter and crying. In that view, the lesions 'disinhibit' or 'release' the laughter and crying centre. The neuroanatomical findings in a recently studied patient with PLC, along with new knowledge on the neurobiology of emotion and feeling, gave us an opportunity to revisit the traditional view and propose an alternative. Here we suggest that the critical PLC lesions occur in the cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathways and that, as a consequence, the cerebellar structures that automatically adjust the execution of laughter or crying to the cognitive and situational context of a potential stimulus, operate on the basis of incomplete information about that context, resulting in inadequate and even chaotic behaviour."", 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 394, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153836271', 'name': 'J.

In 1924, Wilson postulated a supranuclear pontobulbar center for affective synergisms that is controlled by cortex and thalamus.

(+)-SKF-10,047 and dextromethorphan, putative sigma receptor agonists, reversed the conditioned fear stress. However, other sigma receptor ligands, (+)-pentazocine and 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine had no effect.

METHODS Potential questionnaire items were identified through interviews with patients and families and expert review. Potential items, as well as measures of affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression were administered to 99 patients with ALS for item selection and the examination of factor structure and construct validity. Test-retest reliability was examined using an additional sample of 31 patients with ALS, and criterion related validity was examined by comparing CNS-LS scores with physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability in a sample of 77 patients with ALS. RESULTS A seven item questionnaire emerged, composed of two subscales measuring labile laughter (four items) and labile tearfulness (three items). The CNS-LS showed a pattern of associations with affect intensity, affective lability in psychopathology, and depression consistent with a scale measuring affective lability. The CNS-LS also showed good test-retest reliability and internal consistency, and successfully predicted physicians’ diagnoses of affective lability. An auxiliary subscale measuring labile frustration, anger, and impatience also emerged.

While the precise biological functions of sigma receptors have not been elucidated, recent work has shed some light on to these enigmatic systems. Sigma receptors have recently been a target of drug development related to psychiatric and neurological disorders. Sigma ligands have also been shown to modulate endothelial cell proliferation and can control angiogenesis which makes them a promising target for oncology applications. Other areas currently being investigated include treatment of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrine and immune system disorders. Of interest is that the human sigma-1 receptor gene contains a steroid binding component, and several gonadal steroids, including progesterone, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), interact with sigma-1 receptors. Of the steroids examined thus far, progesterone binds with the highest affinity to human sigma-1 receptors, with a reported affinity (Ki) as high as 30 nM while the other steroids exhibit lower affinity. For this and other reasons, sigma-1 receptors have been proposed as a link between the central nervous system and the endocrine and reproductive systems. Taken together, the above information highlights an important yet largely unexplored but promising area of research to examine the biological function and therapeutic potential of sigma receptors. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of these sites with a focus on specific areas where in vivo sigma receptor imaging is currently being investigated.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 334, 'citationCount': 82, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3781083', 'name': 'T.

As a repeated, circumscribed unit of developmental interaction, it is conceived to be an agent of developmental process and psychic structure formation. The appeal cycle has four phases: the adaptational phase, the distress phase, the appeal phase, and the interactional phase. The progression from the adaptational into the distress and appeal phases evidences the child's separation anxiety and failure of self-regulation in response to the experimentally induced attenuation of the mother-child relationship. A successful interactional phase reestablishes the relationship, regulates and restores the child's emotional equilibrium, and enables a return to self-regulation and adaptation. Because the interaction reinforces the functions and structures being developed through identification with the mother, the interactional phase is conceived to be an instrumental event in the mediation of psychic structure formation. The appeal cycle is discussed in comparison with similar phenomena in earlier phases of development and with other studies addressing development during the first two years of life. Directions for future research are noted.",1991,33,14,"{'name': 'Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association', 'pages': '1014 - 987', 'volume': '39'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

Concurrently, the child's behavior was observed in a play group situation. One set of rating scales was devised for assessment of the mother-child interaction, and another set for assessment of the child's functioning in the play group.

I know how much I have learned from her ways of perceiving psychological material with the eyes, ears, and other perceptual organs of a psychoanalyst, while I often organize such data in a somewhat different, but I believe congenial, manner. In part this is the case because my psychoanalytic experience is based exclusively on therapeutic work with adults, however regressed or infantile they may have been in aspects of their personalities.

The major dimension of individual differences has been conceptualized in terms of quantitative differences in the ""strength"" of attachments, and a variety of discrete behaviors (touch, look, smile, approach, cling, cry) have been assumed to be valid ""indices"" of this dimension. These behaviors have been assumed to be significantly intercorrelated and stable across situations and over time. Critics have argued strongly that these assumptions cannot be defended empirically. It has further been argued that the study of individual differences in infant-adult ties is unlikely to he a productive research strategy and that attachment (as implying anything more than infant-adult interaction) has outlived its usefulness as a developmental construct. When, however, trait models are abandoned and greater attention is paid to the functions, outcomes, and context sensitivity of attachment behavior and to the underlying behavioral control systems that organize it, the apparent conflict between situational influences and stable individual differences can be resolved. The study of changes in the organization of behavior during development provides a framework for productive individual differences research. When greater emphasis is placed on the organization of behavior, both the stability and the flexibility of attachment behavior can be comprehended, and the attachment construct can continue to play an important integrative role in developmental theory.', 'year': 1977, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 1656, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5244329', 'name': 'L.

Individual differences in four separation-related behaviors--protest, following, and positive greetings or crying on reunion--were examined for 26 infants observed intensively at home during the fourth quarter-year, and considered in relation to one another, to other infant behaviors, and to maternal behavior. Contrary to Freudian and other hypotheses, separation protest was found to be related positively to maternal unresponsiveness to crying and negatively to maternal sensitivity to signals, while positive greetings had the converse of these relationships. The first factor yielded by a factor analysis seemed to reflect a security-insecurity dimension in an infant's organization of attachment behavior to his mother. The anxious cluster of behaviors included separation protest and crying on reunion, as well as crying when put down and frequency and duration of crying in general. The secure cluster included positive greetings on reunion and (to a lesser extent) following on separation, as well as positive responses both to being held and to being put down.

Now that the more spectacular forms of maternal deprivation have lost their urgency, other problems, more obscure, more difficult to investigate and also to deal with, and perhaps even more urgent for humanity in general, claim our attention.

This study aimed (1) to document the current levels of mental health and study engagement among healthcare students in Tunisia, and (2) to investigate the relationships between emotional regulation, optimism, study engagement and common mental health problems (stress, anxiety and depression) among this population. A cross-sectional, electronic survey-based research design was used to draw a sample of 366 health care students from a University in Tunisia. Participants mostly reported mild (34.7%) or moderate (44.3%) levels of depression, moderate (44.7%) or severe (33.6%) levels of anxiety, average (50.8%) or mild (33.8%) levels of stress, and high levels of study engagement (>85%). Through structural equation modelling, the results showed that emotional regulation negatively affected stress, anxiety, and depression. Optimism partially mediated the relationship between emotional regulation, anxiety and depression and fully mediated the relationship between emotional regulation and study engagement. The findings indicated a high prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare university students in Tunisia, and specific protective factors that may be targeted to reduce mental health problems.",2022,105,20,"{'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health', 'volume': '19'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-2.623805046081543, -3.6148195266723633,

An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 923 university students during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. Significant gender differences were found on mental health symptoms, emotional intelligence, and social support. A double mediation model was computed to verify if gender influences on mental health were mediated by emotional intelligence and social support. The results show indirect effects of gender on mental health. However, as both mediators mediate in the opposite direction, the total indirect effects become null.

The pandemic had a more pronounced negative effect on female students' academics, social isolation, stress and mental health compared to male counterparts. Moreover, for females, frequent use of social media as a coping mechanism was associated with greater perceived negative impacts on their academic performance and stress levels, compared to males. However, frequent social media use related to similar negative mental health effects for both males and females. While male and female students both reported using substances to cope, for males the use of cannabis was associated with greater negative impacts on academic outcomes, stress and mental health compared to females.

Also, in line with the SD-R’s assumptions, student burnout predicts life satisfaction negatively (β = −0.34), whereas student engagement predicts life satisfaction positively (β = 0.29). Hence, we were able to introduce the novel SD-R framework and validate its core assumptions.

Methods: A sample of N = 200 students of a large German distance university with elevated levels of depression [Center for Epidemiological Studies’ Depression Scale (CES-D) ≥ 16] will be randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress management intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program for academic stress. The IG consists of eight Internet-based sessions promoting stress management skills using cognitive–behavioral and problem-solving techniques. A mobile App will be employed to facilitate training transfer. Self-report data will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1; 7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up (T2). Potential moderators will be assessed at baseline. The primary outcome is depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and academic outcomes. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle along with sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. Additional health economic analyses will be conducted. Discussion: Results will provide the basis to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of Internet-delivered stress interventions in distance-learning students with symptoms of depression. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been reviewed and approved by the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg ethics committee (Erlangen, Germany; 33_17 Bc). Results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications.

A Systematic Review', 'abstract': 'People with higher levels of emotional intelligence (EI: adaptive emotional traits, skills, and abilities) typically achieve more positive life outcomes, such as psychological wellbeing, educational attainment, and job-related success. Although the underpinning mechanisms linking EI with those outcomes are largely unknown, it has been suggested that EI may work as a “stress buffer.” Theoretically, when faced with a stressful situation, emotionally intelligent individuals should show a more adaptive response than those with low EI, such as reduced reactivity (less mood deterioration, less physiological arousal), and faster recovery once the threat has passed. A growing number of studies have begun to investigate that hypothesis in respect to EI measured as both an ability (AEI) and trait (TEI), but results are unclear. To test the “stress-buffering” function of EI, we systematically reviewed experimental studies that explored the relationship between both types of EI and acute stress reactivity or recovery. By searching four databases, we identified 45 eligible studies. Results indicated that EI was only adaptive in certain contexts, and that findings differed according to stressor type, and how EI was measured. In terms of stress reactivity, TEI related to less mood deterioration during sports-based stressors (e.g., competitions), physical discomfort (e.g., dental procedure), and cognitive stressors (e.g., memory tasks), but did not appear as helpful in other contexts (e.g., public speaking). Furthermore, effects of TEI on physiological stress responses, such as heart rate, were inconsistent. Effects of AEI on subjective and objective stress reactivity were often non-significant, with high levels detrimental in some cases. However, data suggest that both higher AEI and TEI relate to faster recovery from acute stress. In conclusion, results provide mixed support for the stress-buffering effect of EI. Limitations and quality of studies are also discussed.

Throughout seven weeks, the intervention group had meetings focused on emotions, mental health of medical students, gratitude, appreciation, optimism, resilience, qualities and virtues. The control group attended conventional medical psychology classes (psychosomatic aspects in clinical illness, for example). Results The intervention group presented average increase by 2.85 points in the positive emotions scale; average increase by 2.53 points in the satisfaction-with-life scale; and average decrease by 1.79 points in the SRQ-20 scale, when it was compared to the control group.

Academic performance was evaluated by the grade point average (GPA). The results showed that academic burnout was directly and positively associated with maladaptive coping but directly and negatively explained by adaptive coping. In addition, emotional exhaustion was significantly and negatively predicted by optimism. Finally, academic performance was significantly predicted by academic burnout.

Our interest in evaluating this type of intervention is based on the increasing accessibility of the Internet today, the growth of Internet-based interventions for various psychopathological problems, and the observation that despite the prevalence of stress among university students, only a fraction of students ever seek professional help. Methodology: “I’m managing my stress” (“Je gère mon stresse”), an Internet-based self-help program composed of four sessions, was examined in this study. The aforementioned program is based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and was inspired by the “Funambule” program in Quebec. Four questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Scale of Satisfaction in Studies, and General Health Questionnaire) uploaded online were answered thrice: during “preintervention”, “postintervention”, and “follow-up” stages, the latter of which occurred three months after the intervention. The sample comprised 128 university students, with the majority being women (81.25%). The subjects were divided randomly into two groups (an experimental group and a control group that did not follow the program). Results: The self-esteem scores of the control group were significantly higher than those of the experimental group at the preintervention stage, but this difference disappeared at the postintervention and follow-up stages. There were also significantly lower scores on the General Health Questionnaire subfactors of somatic symptoms and anxiety/insomnia in the experimental group than in the control group during the postintervention stage, though no differences were observed before the intervention. These differences no longer remained after three months. ANOVA revealed significant effects of the intervention over time in the experimental group. Effects were observed at both the postintervention and follow-up stages for self-esteem, perceived stress, satisfaction in studies, and in the somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia and severe depression aspects of the General Health Questionnaire (Cohen’s d = 0.38 to 4.58). In contrast, no effects were observed in the control group. Conclusion: This type of Internet-based program has the ability to reach a large number of students due to its rather short format and accessibility. It has already shown improvements in terms of the levels of perceived stress, psychological distress and satisfaction with studies. The option of online interventions could appeal specifically to students who do not seek professional help. However, even though these results are promising at the postintervention stage, they are limited, as indicated by the lack of significant differences between the two groups after the initial three months of follow-up. We still, specifically, need to improve this intervention program and, generally, need more research to address the methodological problems raised by this type of intervention.

Intervention The items of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire were employed to capture the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among the residents. The statistical relationships between anxiety and depression (HAD score) and sociodemographic and work-related data were explored by Poisson regression. Results 1700 out of 2200 (77%) medical residents (mean age: 28.5±2 years, female: 60.8%) answered the questionnaire. The mean working hours per week was 62±21\u2009hours; 73% ensured a mean of 5.4±3\u2009night shifts per month; and only 8% of them could benefit from a day of safety rest. Overall, 74.1% of the participating residents had either definite (43.6%) or probable (30.5%) anxiety, while 62% had definite (30.5%) or probable (31.5%) depression symptoms, with 20% having both definite anxiety and definite depression. The total HAD score was significantly associated with the resident’s age (OR=1.014, 95%\u2009CI 1.006 to 1.023, p=0.001); female gender (OR=1.114, 95%\u2009CI 1.083 to 1.145, p<0.0001); and the heavy burden of work imposed on a weekly or monthly basis, as reflected by the number of night shifts per month (OR=1.048, 95%\u2009CI 1.016 to 1.082, p=0.03) and the number of hours worked per week (OR=1.008, 95%\u2009CI 1.005 to 1.011, p<0.0001).

Despite academic demands, university students also face new stressors, such as different social networks, financial changes, and adaptation to new family and social roles that may have a negative impact on their mental health (Pidgeon & Pickett, 2017). In this sense, resilience literature has gained acceptance explaining how some students successfully adapt to university life while others find great challenges. Since resilience has been defined as the ability to successfully adapt in the face of stress and adversity, it is important to determine what psychological factors contribute enhancing this resilience levels. One of the factors related to life adaptation is optimism, understood as the general expectancy of obtaining positive outcomes in the future (Scheier & Carver, 1985). Hence, the aim of this study is to study the relationship between optimism and resilience among a sample of university students in Spain. The sample was comprised of 132 students from the University of Cadiz (Spain). Participants were selected by quota sampling from first to last year of studies. The majority of students (72.5%) were female and average age was 21.71 (range = 18–48, SD = 3.75). Participants completed the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale (Spanish version adapted by Novella, 2002) and Life Orientation Test (LOT-R Spanish version adapted by Ferrando, Chico & Tous). We performed hierarchical multiple regression analysis and obtained that optimism explained 25% of resilience among university students (R2 = .25, â = .49). No gender and age differences were observed.

Most students with poor mental health, however, do not receive professional help. Internet-based self-help formats may increase the utilization of treatment. Objective The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based, app-supported stress management intervention for college students. Methods College students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4-item version, PSS-4 ≥8) were randomly assigned to either an internet- and mobile-based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group. Self-report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS-4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college-related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies’ Depression Scale >17). Results A total of 106 participants (76.8%) indicated that they were first-time help-seekers, and 77.3% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95% CI 0.36-1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95% CI 0.43-1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95% CI 0.30-0.96), college-related productivity (d=0.33; 95% CI 0.01-0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95% CI 0.01-0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment). Response rates for stress symptoms were significantly higher for the intervention group (69%, 52/75) compared with the waitlist control group (35%, 26/75, P<.001; number needed to treat=2.89, 95% CI 2.01-5.08) at posttest (7 weeks). Effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up, and similar findings emerged in students with symptoms of depression. Conclusions Internet- and mobile-based interventions could be an effective and cost-effective approach to reduce consequences of college-related stress and might potentially attract students with clinically relevant depression who would not otherwise seek help.

The authors appropriately argued that, although most researchers' theoretical interest rests with the latent structure, they still rely on indices of global model fit that simultaneously assess both the measurement and structural portions of the model. As such, Lance et al. proposed indices intended to assess the structural portion of the model in isolation of the measurement model. Unfortunately, although these strategies separate the assessment of the structure from the fit of the measurement model, they do not isolate the structure's assessment from the quality of the measurement model. That is, even with a perfectly fitting measurement model, poorer quality (i.e., less reliable) measurements will yield a more favorable verdict regarding structural fit, whereas better quality (i.e., more reliable) measurements will yield a less favorable structural assessment. This phenomenon, referred to by Hancock and Mueller (2011) as the reliability paradox, affects not only traditional global fit indices but also those structural indices proposed by Lance et al. as well.

Academic pressure is reported as a major trigger. Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress and is popular among students, but its effectiveness in this context needs to be ascertained. In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we hypothesise that the provision of a preventative mindfulness intervention in universities could reduce students' psychological distress during the examination period (primary outcome), improve their resilience to stress up to at least 1\u2005year later, reduce their use of mental health support services and improve academic performance. Methods and analysis At least 550 University of Cambridge students free from active crises or severe mental illness will be randomised to joining an 8-week mindfulness course or to mental health provision as usual (one-to-one allocation rate). Psychological distress will be measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure at baseline, postintervention, examination term and 1-year follow-up. Other outcomes are use of mental health services, inability to sit examinations or special circumstance requests, examination grades, well-being, altruism and coping measured with ecological momentary assessment. Outcome assessment and intention-to-treat primary analysis using linear mixed models adjusted for baseline scores will be blind to intervention allocation. We will also conduct per-protocol, subgroup and secondary outcome analyses. An Independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee will be set up.

Method The World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys were used to examine the associations of mental disorders with college entry and attrition by comparing college students (n = 1572) and non-students in the same age range (18–22 years; n = 4178), including non-students who recently left college without graduating (n = 702) based on surveys in 21 countries (four low/lower-middle income, five upper-middle-income, one lower-middle or upper-middle at the times of two different surveys, and 11 high income). Lifetime and 12-month prevalence and age-of-onset of DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behavioral and substance disorders were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results One-fifth (20.3%) of college students had 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorders; 83.1% of these cases had pre-matriculation onsets. Disorders with pre-matriculation onsets were more important than those with post-matriculation onsets in predicting subsequent college attrition, with substance disorders and, among women, major depression the most important such disorders. Only 16.4% of students with 12-month disorders received any 12-month healthcare treatment for their mental disorders. Conclusions Mental disorders are common among college students, have onsets that mostly occur prior to college entry, in the case of pre-matriculation disorders are associated with college attrition, and are typically untreated. Detection and effective treatment of these disorders early in the college career might reduce attrition and improve educational and psychosocial functioning.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 746, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34821537', 'name': 'R.

Students are limited in seeking help from professionals. As university students are highly connected to digital technologies, Web-based and computer-delivered interventions could be used to improve students’ mental health. The effectiveness of these intervention types requires investigation to identify whether these are viable prevention strategies for university students. Objective The intent of the study was to systematically review and analyze trials of Web-based and computer-delivered interventions to improve depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress in university students. Methods Several databases were searched using keywords relating to higher education students, mental health, and eHealth interventions. The eligibility criteria for studies included in the review were: (1) the study aimed to improve symptoms relating to depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress, (2) the study involved computer-delivered or Web-based interventions accessed via computer, laptop, or tablet, (3) the study was a randomized controlled trial, and (4) the study was trialed on higher education students. Trials were reviewed and outcome data analyzed through random effects meta-analyses for each outcome and each type of trial arm comparison. Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess study quality. Results A total of 17 trials were identified, in which seven were the same three interventions on separate samples; 14 reported sufficient information for meta-analysis. The majority (n=13) were website-delivered and nine interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A total of 1795 participants were randomized and 1480 analyzed. Risk of bias was considered moderate, as many publications did not sufficiently report their methods and seven explicitly conducted completers’ analyses. In comparison to the inactive control, sensitivity meta-analyses supported intervention in improving anxiety (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.56; 95% CI −0.77 to −0.35, P<.001), depression (pooled SMD −0.43; 95% CI −0.63 to −0.22, P<.001), and stress (pooled SMD −0.73; 95% CI −1.27 to −0.19, P=.008). In comparison to active controls, sensitivity analyses did not support either condition for anxiety (pooled SMD −0.18; 95% CI −0.98 to 0.62, P=.66) or depression (pooled SMD −0.28; 95% CI −0.75 to −0.20, P=.25). In contrast to a comparison intervention, neither condition was supported in sensitivity analyses for anxiety (pooled SMD −0.10; 95% CI −0.39 to 0.18, P=.48) or depression (pooled SMD −0.33; 95% CI −0.43 to 1.09, P=.40). Conclusions The findings suggest Web-based and computer-delivered interventions can be effective in improving students’ depression, anxiety, and stress outcomes when compared to inactive controls, but some caution is needed when compared to other trial arms and methodological issues were noticeable. Interventions need to be trialed on more heterogeneous student samples and would benefit from user evaluation.

Higher EC is associated with greater happiness, better mental and physical health, more satisfying social and marital relationships and greater occupational success. While it is well-known that EC (as a whole) predicts a number of important outcomes, it is unclear so far which specific competency(ies) participate(s) in a given outcome. This is because no measure of EC distinctly measures each of the five core emotional competences, separately for one’s own and others’ emotions. This lack of information is problematic both theoretically (we do not understand the processes at stake) and practically (we cannot develop customized interventions). This paper aims to address this issue. We developed and validated in four steps a complete (albeit short: 50 items) self-reported measure of EC: the Profile of Emotional Competence.

Moreover we may be confused because ‘eyeball test’ and ‘formal normality test’ may show incompatible results for the same data. To resolve the problem, another method of assessing normality using skewness and kurtosis of the distribution may be used, which may be relatively correct in both small samples and large samples. 1) Skewness and kurtosis Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry and kurtosis is a measure of ’peakedness’ of a distribution.

A higher number of stressors with negative health consequences are present, especially among nursing professionals. Stress is a psychosocial factor that influences the academic performance and well-being of this group. The interest in analysing sources of stress in nursing students is due to the influence that their training period may have on their perceptions of stress on their future work. \n \nMethods:\u2002 We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature on stressors in nursing students. The search comprised all the articles published at the end of 2010. \n \nResults:\u2002 The most common sources of stress relate to academics (reviews, workload and problems associated with studying, among others).

Research purpose: The aim of this study was to determine how I/O psychologists experience the meaning of their work and to investigate the relationships between their experiences of work-role fit, meaning of work, psychological meaningfulness and work engagement, utilising the happiness framework proposed by Seligman (2002). Motivation for the study: I/O psychologists spend more than 88% of their working day with people, and they are primary role models for happiness in the workplace. Information about their work engagement and experiences of meaning is therefore needed. Research design, approach and method: A survey design was used. A convenience sample (n = 106) was taken of I/O psychologists in South Africa. A biographical questionnaire, the Work-Role Fit Scale, the Work-Life Questionnaire, the Psychological Meaningfulness Scale, the Work Engagement Scale and a survey measuring the actual and desired time spent on six broad categories of work were administered. Main findings: Work-role fit predicted psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. The calling orientation to work predicted both psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. Work-role fit mediated the relationship between the meaning of work and psychological meaningfulness. Work-role fit partially mediated the relationship between a calling orientation to work and work engagement.

The current study investigated the additional impact of psychosocial factors (i.e., performance obstacles and facilitators) as well as psychological well-being (i.e., burnout and engagement) on success (i.e., academic performance).

A total of 527 university students comprised the sample and filled out a questionnaire. We obtained their previous and future academic performance Grade Point Average (GPA) from the university's records. Structural equations modeling showed that the best predictor of future performance was the students’ previous performance. As expected, study engagement mediated the relationship between performance obstacles and facilitators on the one hand, and future performance on the other. Contrary to expectations, burnout did not predict future performance, although, it is significantly associated with the presence of obstacles and the absence of facilitators. Our results illustrate that, although “success breeds success” (i.e., the best predictor of future performance is past performance), positive psychological states like study engagement are also important in explaining future performance, at least more so than negative states like study burnout."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 457, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2040374', 'name': 'M.

Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions, although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by Jöreskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed.

The suicide rate among male physicians is more than 40% higher than among men in the general population, whereas that of female physicians is a staggering 130% higher than among women in the general population (1, 2). The increased risk for suicide among physicians may begin during medical school (3). Available studies suggest that the suicide rate among medical students is higher than in the age-matched population (35). Other small, single-institution studies (610) have reported that 3% to 15% of medical students have suicidal ideation during medical school training. Suicidal ideation is a well-established predictor of suicidal planning and attempts. The National Comorbidity Survey found that 34% of individuals in the general population with suicidal ideation develop a suicide plan and, of those who plan, more than 70% will attempt suicide (11). Notably, 26% of individuals with suicidal ideation progressed directly to an unplanned suicide attempt (11). Suicide is at the extreme end of the personal distress continuum, and it is critical for medical schools to identify students at greatest risk for suicide in the hope of intervening before a tragic outcome. Several multi-institutional studies (1214) reveal that medical students have a substantially lower mental quality of life than similarly aged individuals in the general population and that burnout affects up to 50% of U.S. medical students. We hypothesized that burnout would relate to suicidal ideation among medical students. We used a mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional study design to evaluate the prevalence of suicidal ideation among U.S. medical students and to evaluate the relationship between suicidal ideation and burnout, symptoms of depression, and quality of life. Our objective was to assess the frequency of suicidal ideation among medical students and explore its relationship with burnout. Methods Participants In the spring of 2006 (baseline) and 2007 (1-year follow-up), we invited all medical students at the Mayo Medical School, University of Washington School of Medicine, University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, and University of Alabama School of Medicine to complete Web-based surveys. Students at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences also participated in the 2007 survey. Participation was elective, and responses were anonymized. We included all students who responded to the 2007 survey in the cross-sectional analysis and those who responded in both 2006 and 2007 in the longitudinal analysis. Each institution's institutional review board approved the study before participation of their students. Data Collection Participants returned the surveys electronically. Preserving student confidentiality was an essential feature. We linked individual responses on the 2006 and 2007 surveys for longitudinal analysis by using unique identifiers and stripped all data of identifiers before forwarding them to study statisticians for analysis. Study Measures We used established instruments to measure burnout, symptoms of depression, and quality of life on both the 2006 and 2007 surveys. These surveys also included questions about demographic characteristics, and the 2007 survey included questions about suicidal ideation. Suicidal Ideation We assessed suicidal ideation by asking students: Have you ever had thoughts of taking your own life, even if you would not really do it?, During the past 12 months have you had thoughts of taking your own life?, and Have you ever made an attempt to take your own life? These questions, which originated from an inventory developed by Meehan and colleagues (15) that has been used to assess suicidal ideation among medical students (9), are similar to questions used in large U.S. epidemiologic studies intended to assess suicidality (11, 1618). Burnout, Symptoms of Depression, and Quality of Life The Maslach Burnout Inventory is a 22-item instrument that is considered the gold standard for measuring burnout (1921). This instrument has separate subscales to evaluate each domain of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Tests of discriminant and convergent validity have been acceptable, construct validity of the 3 dimensions has been demonstrated (22, 23), and predictive validity has been suggested by burnout score predicting risk for future sick leave absences (24). The Maslach Burnout Inventory has also been used extensively in studies of both physicians (20,21, 25) and medical students (13, 14, 2628). According to convention, a score of 27 or higher on the emotional exhaustion subscale or 10 or higher on the depersonalization subscale was considered an indicator of professional burnout for medical professionals (19). Health professionals are considered to have a low score on the personal accomplishment scale if their score is 33 or less. Normal scores for health care professionals, including physicians, are 22.19, 7.12, and 36.53 on the emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment subscales, respectively (19). We identified symptoms of depression by using the 2-item Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (29), a screening tool which performs as well as longer instruments (30). This instrument has a sensitivity of 86% to 96% and a specificity of 57% to 75% for major depressive disorder (29, 30). With a reported positive likelihood ratio of up to 3.42 for the diagnosis of major depression (30) and an estimated 25% prevalence of depression among medical students (12), a positive result implies a 50% probability of current major depression. We measured mental and physical quality of life by using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-8 (SF-8) (31, 32), an alternate version of the SF-36. Norm-based scoring methods of responses on this instrument are used to calculate mental and physical quality of life summary scores (31). The mean mental and physical quality of life summary scores for the U.S. population are 49.2 (SD, 9.46) and 49.2 (SD, 9.07), respectively (31). Previous research has demonstrated acceptable reliability and testretest reliability (31). Several studies (31) have demonstrated content, construct, and criterion-related validity for the SF-8, and other studies (33) have demonstrated high convergent validity and good discriminate validity. The SF-8 has also been used in samples of residents (32) and medical students (14, 27, 28). Statistical Analysis Our primary analysis involved descriptive summary statistics for estimating the prevalence of suicidal ideation, burnout, a positive depression screen, and mental and physical quality of life for medical students. We evaluated differences by reported suicidal ideation in the previous year by using the WilcoxonMannWhitney test (for continuous variables) and the Fisher exact test (for categorical variables). We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test rather than parametric tests to account for the interval level nature of the psychological tests. All tests were 2-sided, with a type I error rate of 0.05. We performed collinearity testing to determine whether multiple-way collinearity existed among the independent variables (34). No variables had achieved a level of collinearity that would bias the modeling process. We performed forward stepwise logistic regression to evaluate independent associations of the independent variables with suicidal ideation. We used a saturated model and backward stepping to confirm results of the initial stepwise regression. In all cases, backward stepping produced the same model as the stepwise approach. All analyses were done by using SAS, version 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Role of the Funding Source This work was supported by an Education Innovation award from the Mayo Clinic.

Results Cross-Sectional Survey A total of 2248 (52.4%) of 4287 medical students responded to the 2007 survey. Responders were less likely than the overall population to be male (51.6% vs. 54.9%), between 25 and 30 years of age (55.4% vs. 62.4%), or nonwhite (25.8% vs. 31.0%) (all P< 0.02). Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of cross-sectional survey respondents. Table 1. Participant Characteristics, 2007 Table 2 shows the percentage of responders reporting suicidal ideation, burnout, and symptoms of depression and the mean quality-of-life scores. Of the 2230 responders on the 2007 survey who responded to questions on suicidal ideation, 249 (11.2% [CI, 9.9% to 12.6%]) reported considering suicide in the previous year and 43 (1.9% [CI, 1.4% to 2.6%]) had made a suicide attempt at some point in the past. On sensitivity analysis, assuming that all nonresponders did not have suicidal ideation, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 12 months would be 249 (5.8%) of 4287 students. Table 2. Burnout, Quality of Life, and Depression Symptoms, 2007 Overall, 1069 (49.6%, [CI, 47.5%51.8%]) of 2154 students met the criteria for burnout (94 students did not answer enough Maslach Burnout Inventory questions to be included in this analysis). Among these students, 860 (40.1%) of 2142 had high emotional exhaustion, 648 (31.8%) of 2037 had high depersonalization, and 595 of 1945 (30.6%) had a low sense of personal accomplishment.

The following review was performed independently of LaRose’s other two books. Paraphrasing from the Preface, the goal of this book is to “explore the process of data mining from the point of view of model building.” Nevertheless, the reader will soon be aware that this book is not intended to provide a systematic or comprehensive coverage of various data mining algorithms. Instead, it considers supervised learning or predictive modeling only, and it walks the reader through the data mining process merely with a few selected modeling methods such as (generalized) linear modeling and the Bayesian approach. The book has seven chapters. Chapter 1 introduces dimension reduction, with a focus on principal components analysis (PCA) types of techniques. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 provide a detailed coverage of simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression, respectively. Chapter 5 introduces naive Bayes estimation and Bayesian networks. In Chapter 6, the basic idea of genetic algorithms is discussed. Finally, Chapter 7 presents a case study example of modeling response to direct mail marketing within the CRISP (crossindustry standard process) framework. This book is very easy to read, and this is absolutely the strength which many readers, especially those nonstatistically oriented ones, will greatly appreciate. Predictive modeling is perhaps the most technical part in a data mining process. The author has done an excellent job in making this difficult topic accessible to a broad audience. For example, I like the way in which Bayesian networks are introduced in Chapter 5. After the reader goes through a churn example on naive Bayes estimation in a step-by-step manner, Bayesian belief networks become easily understood as natural extensions. The overall style of the book is clear and patient. The main limitation of the book is its limited coverage. An inspired reader would expect to see a much more extended list of topics. Hastie, Tibishirani, and Friedman (2001) gave a full and more technical account of various data mining algorithms. The inclusion of genetic algorithms in Chapter 6 seems novel when compared to Hastie, Tibishirani, and Friedman (2001), but at the same time, a little unexpected as a separate chapter, since a genetic algorithm involves a stochastics search scheme, which is somewhat involved given the elementary nature of this text. Another noteworthy issue is that the author does not make an attempt to distinguish between conventional statistical analysis and data mining. I found a few errors. On Page 25, for example, it should be ai = 1, instead of ai = 1/4. Also, in the frame on the top of Page 211, it might have been “Posterior Odds,” instead of “Posterior Odds Ratio.” The book uses three different software packages to implement the ideas including SPSS with Clementine, Minitab, and WEKA, which might not be appealing. On the other hand, it is justifiable as it allows one to perform data mining with affordable costs. In summary, I recommend this fairly readable book for adoption in a graduate-level introductory course on data mining, especially when the students come from varied backgrounds.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 6, 'citationCount': 8665, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2057008238', 'name': 'Phil Wood'}]}, {'paperId': '9e1388816388fad6b55334e6c7fc470c4cfb2877', 'title': 'The association between dispositional optimism and mental health problems among disaster victims and a comparison group: a prospective study.', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 49, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34245812', 'name': 'P.

Method Medline and PubMed were searched to identify peer-reviewed English-language studies published between January 1980 and May 2005 reporting on depression, anxiety, and burnout among U.S. and Canadian medical students. Searches used combinations of the Medical Subject Heading terms medical student and depression, depressive disorder major, depressive disorder, professional burnout, mental health, depersonalization, distress, anxiety, or emotional exhaustion. Reference lists of retrieved articles were inspected to identify relevant additional articles. Demographic information, instruments used, prevalence data on student distress, and statistically significant associations were abstracted. Results The search identified 40 articles on medical student psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, burnout, and related mental health problems) that met the authors' criteria. No studies of burnout among medical students were identified. The studies suggest a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students, with levels of overall psychological distress consistently higher than in the general population and age-matched peers by the later years of training. Overall, the studies suggest psychological distress may be higher among female students. Limited data were available regarding the causes of student distress and its impact on academic performance, dropout rates, and professional development. Conclusions Medical school is a time of significant psychological distress for physicians-in-training. Currently available information is insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the causes and consequences of student distress.

According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

The 2 present control intervention groups had lower levels of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms (on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) and perceived stress (on the Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983) relative to the stress-information-only group at posttest and 3-week follow-up (mean between group d at follow-up = .35, mean within group d for intervention groups at follow-up = -.46). Further, mediation analyses revealed that these effects were mediated by changes in present control. Our intervention represents a potentially valuable tool for college mental health services.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 115, 'authors': [{'authorId': '49470838', 'name': 'Samuel Hintz'}, {'authorId': '98750082', 'name': 'P.

While a variety of factors have been linked to suicidal ideation, only few studies have examined role of stress and optimism among adolescents population. This study aimed to determine the relationships between stress and optimism and suicidal ideation among adolescent students. Participants for this study were 200 adolescent students from Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India. Appropriate questionnaires were used for measuring optimism, stress, and suicidal ideation among students. Apart from descriptive statistics for analyzing data, a four-step hierarchical linear regression analysis was used in order to examine main and moderator effects predicting suicidal ideation. Significant moderating effects were also probed and plotted through simple slopes at plus-and-minus one standard deviation of the stress on the association between stress and suicidal ideation within each level of moderator variable i.e. high and low levels. The results of the Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that there was significant positive relationship between stress and suicidal ideation. A significant negative correlation between optimism and suicidal ideation was also found. In addition, boys were more pessimistic and had more suicidal ideation compared to girls. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that stress and optimism predicted suicidal ideation for total sample and for both boys and girls. Moreover, the Stress X Optimism interaction was found to further augment the prediction of suicidal ideation, even after controlling for demographic variables and the main effects of optimism and stress. Consistent with the proposed interaction model, a plot of the significant interactions indicated that the link between stress and suicidal ideation was significantly more exacerbated for pessimistic as compared to optimistic adolescents. Findings from this study would help the healthcare professionals, counsellors, teachers, and parents in understanding how high stress which is peculiar to the stage of adolescence particularly students may have serious consequences in the form of suicidal ideas and that optimistic thinking may be helpful in coping with the stresses of this stage so as to avoid its harmful effects.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 72, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '152517902', 'name': 'Journals Iosr'}, {'authorId': '1460287823', 'name': 'Hameeda Shaheen Dr.'}, {'authorId': '49859054', 'name': 'M.

Young adults were recruited by means of a screening survey sent to all students at the University of Tromsø. Of those responding to the survey, 163 students (mean age 28.2 years) with elevated psychological distress were recruited to the trial and randomized to an Internet intervention condition or the waiting list control group. The Internet condition comprised a depression information website and a self-help Web application delivering automated cognitive behavioural therapy. The participants in the waiting list condition were free to access formal or informal help as usual. Two-thirds of the users who completed the trial initially reported an unmet need for help. The findings demonstrated that an unguided intervention was effective in reducing symptoms of depression and negative thoughts and in increasing depression literacy in young adults. Significant improvements were found at 2-month follow up.

The Aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of psychological distress, anxiety and depression among nursing students in Greece. For that purpose 170 nursing students (34 males, 136 females) of the Department of Nursing of the Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki completed 3 self-report questionnaires, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The mean age was 21.5 years. No difference in stress and depression on the basis of gender was observed. Our results showed that the scores on the GHQ, BDI and STAI tend to increase in the year 2 and 3. The majority of students reported relatively high scores on the GHQ suggesting increased psychiatric morbidity. 52.4% of students experienced depressive symptoms (34.7% mild, 12.9% moderate and 4.7% severe). The scores on the state scale were higher in the years 2 and 3, while the majority of students who had no or mild stress was observed in the first and the last year. Low stress personality traits were also observed in the first and the last year. However, no significant differences between the four years were observed.

The Emotional Eating theoretical model has proposed that the failure in emotional regulation could represent a risk factor for establishing maladaptive overeating behavior that represents an inadequate response to negative emotions and allows increasing body-weight. This systematic review investigates the relationship between overeating and both emotional regulation and emotional intelligence in childhood and adolescence, considering both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Moreover, another goal of the review is evaluating whether emotional regulation and emotional intelligence can cause overeating behaviors. The systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA-statement in the databases Medline, PsychArtcles, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences, and allows 484 records to be extracted. Twenty-six studies were selected according to inclusion (e.g., studies focused on children and adolescents without clinical conditions; groups of participants overweight or with obesity) and exclusion (e.g., studies that adopted qualitative assessment or cognitive-affective tasks to measure emotional variables; reviews, commentary, or brief reports) criteria detailed in the methods. Cross-sectional studies showed a negative association between emotional regulation and overeating behavior that was confirmed by longitudinal studies. These findings highlighted the role of maladaptive emotion regulation on overeating and being overweight. The relationship between these constructs in children and adolescents was consistent. The results indicated the complexity of this association, which would be influenced by many physiological, psychological, and social factors. These findings underline the need for further studies focused on emotion regulation in the development of overeating. They should analyze the mediation role of other variables (e.g., attachment style, peer pressure) and identify interventions to prevent and reduce worldwide overweight

Specifically, it was tested whether attention allocation processes differ between individuals with overweight and normal weight using transient changes of food-related and neutral pictures. Change detection latencies in objects of central interest (CI) or objects of marginal interest (MI) were measured as an index of attention allocation in a sample of fifty-three students with overweight/obesity and sixty students with normal weight during a flicker paradigm with neutral, hypercaloric and hypocaloric food pictures. Both groups of participants showed an attentional bias for food-related pictures as compared to neutral pictures. However, the bias was larger in individuals with overweight than in individuals with normal weight when changes were of marginal interest, suggesting a stronger avoidance of the food-related picture. This study showed that food-related stimuli influence attention allocation processes in both participants with overweight and normal weight. In particular, as compared to individuals with normal weight, those with overweight seem to be characterised by a stronger attentional avoidance of (or smaller attention maintenance on) food-related stimuli that could be considered as a voluntary strategy to resist food consumption.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 82, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

The knowledge of the factors which influences the inappropriate eating behaviors causing excessive body fat is an essential goal for the research. Overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for many health diseases, such as cardiovascular problems, diabetes. Recently, many studies have focused on the relationship between body weight and cognitive processes. Objectives: This systematic review is aimed to investigate the existence and the nature of the relationship between excessive body weight (overweight/obesity) and executive functions, analyzing cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies in order to verify the evidence of a possible causality between these variables. Methods: The review was carried out according to the PRISMA-Statement, through systematic searches in the scientific databases PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo, and PsycArticles. The studies selected examined performance on executive tasks by participants with overweight or obesity, aged between 5 and 70 years. Studies examining eating disorders or obesity resulting from other medical problems were excluded. Furthermore, the results of studies using a cross-sectional design and those using a longitudinal one were separately investigated. Results: Sixty-three cross-sectional studies and twenty-eight longitudinal studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. The results confirmed the presence of a relation between executive functions and overweight/obesity, although the directionality of this relation was not clear; nor did any single executive function emerge as being more involved than others in this relation. Despite this, there was evidence of a reciprocal influence between executive functions and overweight/obesity. Conclusions: This systematic review underlines the presence of a relationship between executive functions and overweight/obesity. Moreover, it seems to suggest a bidirectional trend in this relationship that could be the cause of the failure of interventions for weight reduction. The results of this review highlight the importance of a theoretical model able to consider all the main variables of interest, with the aim to structuring integrated approaches to solve the overweight/obesity problems.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 176, 'citationCount': 84, 'authors': [{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

Increasingly, research points to the role of self-regulation in obesity development, yet existing work has largely focused on young children and/or clinical adult populations. This multi-method longitudinal study (N = 153) utilized a path analysis to delineate links between emotion regulation (age 15), emotional eating and dietary restraint (age 16), and adiposity (% body fat) using a BodPod for body composition assessment (age 19). Emotion regulation was negatively associated with emotional eating (β = −0.30, p < 0.001) and positively associated with dietary restraint (β = 0.15, p < 0.05) at age 16, but was not associated with age 19 adiposity (β = −0.01, p = ns). Emotional eating was positively associated with adiposity (β = 0.24, p < 0.01). Indirect effects suggested that emotional eating, but not dietary restraint, at age 16 serves as a mechanism that helps explain the associations between emotion regulation and adiposity four years later. Results from this study suggest that both emotion regulation and emotional eating represent promising targets for that should be included in future interventions aimed at preventing adolescent obesity.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 75, 'citationCount': 37, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3562685', 'name': 'L.

Accordingly, our aim was to identify demographic and psychological correlates of overeating regulation in a sample of university students, to facilitate greater understanding of this self‐regulatory capacity. Variables of interest included emotion regulation, mindfulness, eating pathology, age, and gender. Method Self‐report measures were completed by 312 Australian university students (68% female; M age = 22 years). Results Exploratory factor analyses indicated three overeating regulation subscales: (1) general overeating regulation (general ability to resist overeating); (2) discomfort overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating when experiencing physical pain or negative emotions); and (3) leisure overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating in leisure contexts and/or in the presence of high calorie foods). Overeating regulation was not associated with age; though young men reported better general overeating regulation capacity than young women. Individuals reporting greater ability to regulate overeating (across all three subscales) reported better emotion regulation and mindfulness, and less eating pathology. Multiple regression analyses showed that the emotion regulation subscales of goal‐directedness, emotional awareness, and impulse control, and the mindfulness subscales of acting with awareness and non‐reactivity to inner experience were unique correlates of the overeating regulation subscales. Conclusions This study offers greater understanding about the different facets of overeating regulation, and highlights the relevance of emotion regulation and mindfulness in this adaptive eating practise.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 18, 'authors': [{'authorId': '51028408', 'name': 'Jessica L.

No differences resulted between adolescents assuming binge behaviors and no bingers as regards CR; conversely, adolescents engaging in binge eating and in both binge behaviors reported the highest levels of ES.

Emotion recognition skills were evaluated using Faces Test and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. The Difficulties in Emotions Regulation Scale was used for evaluating skills of emotion regulation. Results: Children with obesity had lower scores on Faces Test and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, and experienced greater difficulty in emotional regulation skills. Conclusions: Improved understanding of emotional recognition and emotion regulation in young people with obesity may improve their social adaptation and help in the treatment of their disorder.

Negative emotions and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies play a role in the onset and maintenance of binge eating in BED. Anger and sadness, along with negative emotions related to interpersonal experiences (i.e., disappointment, being hurt or loneliness), seem to be particularly relevant. Individuals with BED have a tendency to suppress and ruminate on their unwanted emotions, which leads to increased psychopathological thoughts and symptoms. Compared to healthy controls, they use adaptive strategies, such as reappraisal, less frequently. Evidence concerning the causal relation between negative affect and binge eating is inconclusive and still very limited. While experimental studies in a laboratory setting lack ecological validity, ecological momentary assessment studies offer more promise at unraveling the causal relationship between emotions and binge eating. Increases in negative affect are found to be antecedents of binge eating in BED. However, there seems to be less support for the possibility that binge eating serves as a means to alleviate negative affect. Finally, BED seems to be related to other forms of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as substance abuse and self-harm.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 190, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3662212', 'name': 'A.

Eating in response to negative affect contributes towards obesity, however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Evidence that visceral afferent signals contribute towards the experience of emotion is accumulating rapidly, with the emergence of new influential models of ‘active inference’. No longer viewed as a ‘bottom up’ process, new interoceptive facets based on ‘top down’ predictions have been proposed, although at present it is unclear which aspects of interoception contribute to aberrant eating behaviour and obesity. Study one examined the link between eating behaviour, body mass index and the novel interoceptive indices; interoceptive metacognitive awareness (IAw) and interoceptive prediction error (IPE), as well as the traditional measures; interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and interoceptive sensibility (IS). The dissociation between these interoceptive indices was confirmed. Emotional eaters were characterised by a heightened interoceptive signal but reduced meta-cognitive awareness of their interoceptive abilities. In addition, emotional eating correlated with IPE; effects that could not be accounted for by differences in anxiety and depression.

The current study examined the associations between physical and emotional neglect occurring in childhood and 2 types of disordered eating symptoms (binge eating and drive for muscularity) among college men and women. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the relations between childhood physical and emotional neglect and eating disorder symptoms would be mediated by alexithymia. Participants (N = 1344) completed self-report measures through an online system. Four moderated mediation models were tested to examine our proposed mediation model in the context of potential gender differences. Consistent with prediction, our analyses revealed significant associations between childhood physical and emotional neglect and 2 types of disordered eating symptoms, and alexithymia mediated these relationships. Contrary to our hypothesis, gender moderated the relationship between alexithymia and binge eating, but not drive for muscularity. Childhood neglect, both physical and emotional, was associated with higher levels of binge eating in women, but not men.

More important, suppression is a transactional process, creating stress and disrupting interactions for the suppressor and those in social interactions with individuals who are suppressing emotion.

We examine the possibility that emotion suppression will predict eating behaviors as a secondary emotion regulatory strategy among 1,556 parent–adolescent dyads (N = 3,112), consistent with evidence suggesting that suppression influences eating at the individual-level. Actor-partner interdependence models and structural equation modeling demonstrate that one’s own emotion suppression was associated with emotional eating; greater consumption of hedonic—low nutrient, high energy dense—foods; and lower consumption of fruits and vegetables (actor effects). One’s partner’s emotion suppression was also independently associated with one’s own emotional eating; lower consumption of fruits and vegetables; and greater consumption of hedonic foods (partner effects), although this association was most consistent for adolescents’ suppression and parents’ eating (compared with the converse). These analyses suggest that dyadic emotion regulatory processes have implications on eating behavior.

It is a gateway to ill health, and it has become one of the leading causes of disability and death, affecting not only adults but also children and adolescents worldwide. In clinical practice, the body fatness is estimated by BMI, and the accumulation of intra-abdominal fat (marker for higher metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk) can be assessed by waist circumference. Complex interactions between biological, behavioural, social and environmental factors are involved in regulation of energy balance and fat stores. A comprehensive history, physical examination and laboratory assessment relevant to the patient's obesity should be obtained. Appropriate goals of weight management emphasise realistic weight loss to achieve a reduction in health risks and should include promotion of weight loss, maintenance and prevention of weight regain. Management of co-morbidities and improving quality of life of obese patients are also included in treatment aims. Balanced hypocaloric diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasise. Aerobic training is the optimal mode of exercise for reducing fat mass while a programme including resistance training is needed for increasing lean mass in middle-aged and overweight/obese individuals. Cognitive behavioural therapy directly addresses behaviours that require change for successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Pharmacotherapy can help patients to maintain compliance and ameliorate obesity-related health risks. Surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity in terms of long-term weight loss. A comprehensive obesity management can only be accomplished by a multidisciplinary obesity management team.

It is also associated with poor academic performance and a lower quality of life experienced by the child.

Studies in humans and laboratory animals show that eating can also be regulated by factors unrelated to metabolic control. Several studies suggest a link between stress, access to highly palatable food, and eating disorders. Eating “comfort foods” in response to a negative emotional state, for example, suggests that some individuals overeat to self-medicate. Clinical data suggest that some individuals may develop addiction-like behaviors from consuming palatable foods. Based on this observation, “food addiction” has emerged as an area of intense scientific research. A growing body of evidence suggests that some aspects of food addiction, such as compulsive eating behavior, can be modeled in animals. Moreover, several areas of the brain, including various neurotransmitter systems, are involved in the reinforcement effects of both food and drugs, suggesting that natural and pharmacological stimuli activate similar neural systems. In addition, several recent studies have identified a putative connection between neural circuits activated in the seeking and intake of both palatable food and drugs. The development of well-characterized animal models will increase our understanding of the etiological factors of food addiction and will help identify the neural substrates involved in eating disorders such as compulsive overeating.

Methods: A total of 782 rural second graders (49% girls, 20% American Indian) were followed longitudinally through third grade. During both data collection points, children participated in face-to-face interviews at school using the Children's Emotion Management Scales and the revised Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Results: Correlational analyses revealed that children's emotion regulation was significantly related to both external and emotional eating within and across grades, with reactivity appearing to be more consistently related to eating regulation than was inhibition. Regression analyses showed that second to third grade increases in external and emotional eating were predicted by increases in reactivity to anger and reactivity to worry. Conclusions: Given the established link in previous research between poor behavioral regulation and obesity in children, findings from this study linking child emotional reactivity and emotional and external eating (both forms of behavior dysregulation) are important in informing prevention and treatment programs.

The authors jointly hold the copyright of this article. For details on further use, see the PRISMA Web site (www.prisma-statement.org). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools for summarizing evidence accurately and reliably. They help clinicians keep up-to-date; provide evidence for policy makers to judge risks, benefits, and harms of health care behaviors and interventions; gather together and summarize related research for patients and their carers; provide a starting point for clinical practice guideline developers; provide summaries of previous research for funders wishing to support new research (1); and help editors judge the merits of publishing reports of new studies (2). Recent data suggest that at least 2,500 new systematic reviews reported in English are indexed in MEDLINE annually (3). Unfortunately, there is considerable evidence that key information is often poorly reported in systematic reviews, thus diminishing their potential usefulness (36). As is true for all research, systematic reviews should be reported fully and transparently to allow readers to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the investigation (7). That rationale led to the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement; those detailed reporting recommendations were published in 1999 (8). In this paper we describe the updating of that guidance. Our aim is to ensure clear presentation of what was planned, done, and found in a systematic review. Terminology used to describe systematic reviews and meta-analyses has evolved over time and varies across different groups of researchers and authors (see Box 1). In this document we adopt the definitions used by the Cochrane Collaboration (9). A systematic review attempts to collate all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a specific research question. It uses explicit, systematic methods that are selected to minimize bias, thus providing reliable findings from which conclusions can be drawn and decisions made. Meta-analysis is the use of statistical methods to summarize and combine the results of independent studies. Many systematic reviews contain meta-analyses, but not all. Box 1. Terminology. The QUOROM Statement and Its Evolution Into PRISMA The QUOROM Statement, developed in 1996 and published in 1999 (8), was conceived as a reporting guidance for authors reporting a meta-analysis of randomized trials. Since then, much has happened. First, knowledge about the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews has expanded considerably. For example, The Cochrane Library's Methodology Register (which includes reports of studies relevant to the methods for systematic reviews) now contains more than 11,000 entries (March 2009). Second, there have been many conceptual advances, such as outcome-level assessments of the risk of bias (10, 11), that apply to systematic reviews. Third, authors have increasingly used systematic reviews to summarize evidence other than that provided by randomized trials. However, despite advances, the quality of the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews remains well short of ideal (36). All of these issues prompted the need for an update and expansion of the QUOROM Statement. Of note, recognizing that the updated statement now addresses the above conceptual and methodological issues and may also have broader applicability than the original QUOROM Statement, we changed the name of the reporting guidance to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses). Development of PRISMA The PRISMA Statement was developed by a group of 29 review authors, methodologists, clinicians, medical editors, and consumers (12). They attended a three-day meeting in 2005 and participated in extensive post-meeting electronic correspondence. A consensus process that was informed by evidence, whenever possible, was used to develop a 27-item checklist (Table 1; see also Table S1, for a downloadable template checklist for researchers to re-use) and a four-phase flow diagram (Figure 1; see also Figure S1, for a downloadable template document for researchers to re-use). Items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review were included in the checklist. The flow diagram originally proposed by QUOROM was also modified to show numbers of identified records, excluded articles, and included studies. After 11 revisions the group approved the checklist, flow diagram, and this explanatory paper. Table S1. Template checklist Figure S1. Template document Table 1. Checklist of Items to Include When Reporting a Systematic Review (With or Without Meta-Analysis) Figure 1. Flow of information through the different phases of a systematic review. The PRISMA Statement itself provides further details regarding its background and development (12). This accompanying Explanation and Elaboration document explains the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. A few PRISMA Group participants volunteered to help draft specific items for this document, and four of these (DGA, AL, DM, and JT) met on several occasions to further refine the document, which was circulated and ultimately approved by the larger PRISMA Group. Scope of PRISMA PRISMA focuses on ways in which authors can ensure the transparent and complete reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It does not address directly or in a detailed manner the conduct of systematic reviews, for which other guides are available (1316). We developed the PRISMA Statement and this explanatory document to help authors report a wide array of systematic reviews to assess the benefits and harms of a health care intervention. We consider most of the checklist items relevant when reporting systematic reviews of non-randomized studies assessing the benefits and harms of interventions. However, we recognize that authors who address questions relating to etiology, diagnosis, or prognosis, for example, and who review epidemiological or diagnostic accuracy studies may need to modify or incorporate additional items for their systematic reviews. How To Use This Paper We modeled this Explanation and Elaboration document after those prepared for other reporting guidelines (1719). To maximize the benefit of this document, we encourage people to read it in conjunction with the PRISMA Statement (11). We present each checklist item and follow it with a published exemplar of good reporting for that item. (We edited some examples by removing citations or Web addresses, or by spelling out abbreviations.) We then explain the pertinent issue, the rationale for including the item, and relevant evidence from the literature, whenever possible. No systematic search was carried out to identify exemplars and evidence. We also include seven Boxes that provide a more comprehensive explanation of certain thematic aspects of the methodology and conduct of systematic reviews. Although we focus on a minimal list of items to consider when reporting a systematic review, we indicate places where additional information is desirable to improve transparency of the review process. We present the items numerically from 1 to 27; however, authors need not address items in this particular order in their reports. Rather, what is important is that the information for each item is given somewhere within the report. The PRISMA Checklist Title and Abstract Item 1: Title Identify the report as a systematic review, meta-analysis, or both. Examples Recurrence rates of video-assisted thoracoscopic versus open surgery in the prevention of recurrent pneumothoraces: a systematic review of randomised and non-randomised trials (20). Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis (21). Explanation Authors should identify their report as a systematic review or meta-analysis. Terms such as review or overview do not describe for readers whether the review was systematic or whether a meta-analysis was performed. A recent survey found that 50% of 300 authors did not mention the terms systematic review or meta-analysis in the title or abstract of their systematic review (3). Although sensitive search strategies have been developed to identify systematic reviews (22), inclusion of the terms systematic review or meta-analysis in the title may improve indexing and identification. We advise authors to use informative titles that make key information easily accessible to readers. Ideally, a title reflecting the PICOS approach (participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design) (see Item 11 and Box 2) may help readers as it provides key information about the scope of the review. Specifying the design(s) of the studies included, as shown in the examples, may also help some readers and those searching databases. Box 2. Helping To Develop the Research Question(s): The PICOS Approach. Some journals recommend indicative titles that indicate the topic matter of the review, while others require declarative titles that give the review's main conclusion. Busy practitioners may prefer to see the conclusion of the review in the title, but declarative titles can oversimplify or exaggerate findings.

Pattern 1 type of diet was more common among male subjects, smokers and those living in rural areas. Pattern 2, predominant among female subjects, non-smokers and in urban areas, was characterised by more health-conscious food choices such as vegetables, legumes and nuts, tea, rye, cheese and other dairy products, and also by consumption of alcoholic beverages.

It develops because of a mismatch between energy intake and expenditure that results from behavior (feeding behavior and time spent active) and physiology (resting metabolism and expenditure when active). Both of these traits are affected by environmental and genetic factors. The dramatic increase in the numbers of obese people in Western societies reflects mostly changing environmental factors and is linked to reduced activity and perhaps also increased food intake. However, in all societies and subpopulations, there are both obese and nonobese subjects. These differences are primarily a consequence of genetic factors as is revealed by the high heritability for body mass index. Most researchers agree that energy balance and, hence, body weight are regulated phenomena. There is some disagreement about exactly how this regulation occurs. However, a common model is the ""lipostatic"" regulation system, whereby our energy stores generate signals that are compared with targets encoded in the brain, and differences between these drive our food intake levels, activity patterns, and resting and active metabolisms. Considerable advances were made in the last decade in understanding the molecular basis of this lipostatic system. Some obese people have high body weight because they have broken lipostats, but these are a rare minority. This suggests that for the majority of obese people, the lipostat is set at an inappropriately high level. When combined with exposure to an environment where there is ready availability of food at low energy costs to obtain it, obesity develops. The evolutionary background to how such a system might have evolved involves the evolution of social behavior, the harnessing of fire, and the development of weapons that effectively freed humans from the risks of predation. The lipostatic model not only explains why some people become obese whereas others do not, but also allows us to understand why energy-controlled diets do not work. Drug-based solutions to the obesity problem that work with the lipostat, rather than against it, are presently under development and will probably be in regular use within 5-10 y. However, several lines of evidence including genetic mapping studies of quantitative trait loci associated with obesity suggest that our present understanding of the regulatory system is still rudimentary. In particular, we know nothing about how the target body weight in the brain is encoded. As our understanding in this field advances, new drug targets are likely to emerge and allow us to treat this crippling disorder.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 157, 'citationCount': 272, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3229359', 'name': 'J.

The validity of these norms is influenced by the observed secular increase in body weight and BMI. We hypothesized that the performance of children in health‐related physical fitness tests would be negatively related to increased BMIs, and therefore fitness tests might be used as criteria for developing a more appropriate set of BMI norms. We evaluated the existing data from a nation‐wide fitness survey for students in Taiwan (444 652 boys and 433 555 girls) to examine the relationship between BMI and fitness tests. The fitness tests used included: an 800/1600‐m run/walk; a standing long jump; bent‐leg curl‐ups; and a sit‐and‐reach test. The BMI percentiles developed from the subgroup whose test scores were better than the ‘poor’ quartile in all four tests were compared with those of the whole population and linked to the adult criteria for overweight and obesity. The BMIs were significantly related to the results of fitness testing. A total of 43% of students had scores better than the poorest quartile in all of their tests. The upper BMI percentile curves of this fitter subgroup were lower than those of the total population. The 85th and 95th BMI percentile values of the fitter 18‐year‐old‐students (23.7 and 25.5\u2003kg\u2003m−2 for boys; 22.6 and 24.6\u2003kg\u2003m−2 for girls) linked well with the adult cut‐off points of 23 and 25\u2003kg\u2003m−2, which have been recommended as the Asian criteria for adult overweight and obesity. Hence, the BMI norms for children and adolescents could be created from selected subgroups that have better physical fitness.

Conclusions: The proposed cut off points, which are less arbitrary and more internationally based than current alternatives, should help to provide internationally comparable prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in children.', 'year': 2000, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 12766, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2299556', 'name': 'T.

Binge eaters suffer from high standards and expectations, especially an acute sensitivity to the difficult (perceived) demands of others. When they fall short of these standards, they develop an aversive pattern of high self-awareness, characterized by unflattering views of self and concern over how they are perceived by others. These aversive self-perceptions are accompanied by emotional distress, which often includes anxiety and depression. To escape from this unpleasant state, binge eaters attempt the cognitive response of narrowing attention to the immediate stimulus environment and avoiding broadly meaningful thought. This narrowing of attention disengages normal inhibitions against eating and fosters an uncritical acceptance of irrational beliefs and thoughts.

In Turkey, eating disorders have been increasing in prevalence among adolescents. Family relations and parenting have been studied as sociocultural influences that shape individuals’ eating behaviors and relationships with food. Eating behaviors have psychosocial outcomes for adolescents’ development and are affected by parental warmth and care. This study investigated the relationship between fathers’ parental attitudes and young individuals’ emotion regulation skills and eating behaviors. It focused on fathers’ parental attitudes in Turkey, where a collectivistic and patriarchal culture typically has father figures playing an important role in family as well as in society. The Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26), Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire—Child Form (PARQ-C) were used to collect data from 401 Turkish adolescents. Correlation analyses showed positive correlations between 2 combinations of variables: adolescents’ eating behaviors and emotion regulation skills, and fathers’ parenting and adolescents’ eating behaviors. Multiple regression analysis showed that father’s parenting was predictive of adolescents’ eating behaviors and emotion regulation skills. Based on the results, this research may promote positive social change by identifying the importance of fathers’ parenting attitudes on adolescent health and by raising awareness of eating disorders in Turkey. The study will guide researchers and counselors in designing eating disorders prevention programs and identify tools for involving fathers in developing healthy parenting attitudes and awareness of eating disorders.

In total there were more than 244.2 thousands of primary and secondary Han nationality students aged 7 through 18 years old included in this study. The BMI distribution of various Chinese children and adolescent groups were compared with the NCHS international norm, the percentage values and with advanced ages, were calculated. In the beginning, three temporary norms were set up, using the different combination of P(85), P(90) and P(95) BMI percentages. Based on the intersect testing and varifying of physiological, lipidemia biochemical and body composition measures, the best norm was then selected. B-spline smoothing method was used to correct the curves, both for males and females, composed by cut-off points at different ages.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing samples from the costal developed metropolis, the BMI curves successfully overcame the shortcomings of low and depressive phenomenon of the total population, in particular after the mid-adolescent period. The temporary Norm II, composed by cut-off points of P(85) for overweight and P(95) for obesity, was found to be the best among the three temporary norms, both shown by its sensitivity and specificity. 24 and 28 were used as cut-off points for overweight and obesity in this norm, both for males and females aged 18 years. These two cut-off points were consistent with those shown in the Body Mass Index Reference Norm for Screening Overweight and Obesity in Chinese Adults. Three samples from Beijing, Henan and Sichuan, used as representatives of upper, middle and relative low levels of physical growth of children and adolescents in China, were used for extra tests. The screening results showed that among the male and female subjects aged 7 through 18 years, the prevalence rates were 17.00% and 9.46% for overweight, 9.99% and 6.47% for obesity in Beijing while 10.86% and 6.64% for overweight, 4.27% and 3.07% for obesity in Henan, and 6.95% and 4.23% for overweight and 2.84% and 2.09% for obesity in Sichuan, respectively.

Materials and Methods: The study included 80 patients who met the study criteria according to the DSM-5 criteria and 80 randomly selected healthy individuals with similar sociodemographic characteristics. Panic Agoraphobia Scale, Childhood Trauma Scale (CTQ-28), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) were applied to the participants. Results: A total of 160 cases were included in the study, including 80 patients aged 18-53 and 80 control subjects aged 19-61. In the patient group, the total score of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)) and the Awareness, Openness, Disagreement, Strategies, Impulse and Goals subscales were statistically significantly higher than the control group. The prevalence of those with a CTQ score of ≥35 was 47.5% in the patient group and 26.3% in the control group, which was statistically significantly higher in the patient group. Increase in “Disagreement”, “Awareness”, and “Goals” subscores significantly increased the likelihood of being in the patient group. Conclusion: Pharmacological agents and therapies targeting the affected regions may reduce the adverse effects of childhood trauma and associated emotional regulation difficulties in patients with panic disorder, increasing the success of treatment and quality of life. Amaç: Çalışmamızın birincil amacı panik bozukluğu hastalarında çocukluk çağı travmalarının varlığını saptamak, ikincil amacımız panik bozukluğu hastalarında duygusal işlev bozukluğunun varlığını tespit etmek ve üçüncü amacımız panik bozukluğu hastalarında çocukluk travması ile duygu işlev bozukluğu arasındaki ilişkiyi değerlendirmektir. Gereç ve Yöntem: Çalışmaya, DSM-5 kriterlerine göre çalışma kriterlerini karşılayan 80 hasta ve rastgele seçilmiş benzer sosyo-demografik özelliklere sahip 80 sağlıklı birey dahil edildi. Katılımcılara Panik Agorafobi Ölçeği, Çocukluk Çağı Travma Ölçeği (CTQ-28) ve Duygu Düzenleme Zorluk Ölçeği (DERS) uygulandı. Bulgular: Çalışmaya 18-53 yaş arası 80 hasta grubu ve 1961 yaş arası 80 kontrol grubu dahil toplam 160 olgu dahil edildi. Hasta grubunda Duygusal Düzenleme Zorluk Ölçeği (DERS) ve Farkındalık, Açıklık, Anlaşmazlık, Stratejiler, Dürtü ve Amaç alt ölçeklerinin toplam puanı kontrol grubuna göre istatistiksel olarak anlamlı derecede yüksek bulundu. CTQ skoru ≥35 olanların oranı hasta grubunda %47.5 ve kontrol grubunda %26.3 idi, bu da hasta grubunda istatistiksel olarak anlamlı derecede yüksekti. Anlaşmazlık, Farkındalık, Amaç skorlarında yükselme hasta grubunda olmayı öngörmekte olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Sonuç: Etkilenen alanları hedefleyen farmakolojik ajanlar ve tedaviler ile çocukluk ve buna bağlı duygusal düzenleme güçlüklerinin panik bozukluğu hastaları üzerindeki olumsuz etkileri azaltılabilir. Tedavi başarısı ve yaşam kalitesi arttırılabilir.",2021,35,0,,"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-5.902339458465576, -3.376401901245117, -4.170374870300293, 1.8854496479034424, 0.9202449917793274,

However, the mechanism of this effect, critical to enhancing public health, remains poorly understood. Objective To investigate the neurodevelopmental trajectory of the association between early ACEs and adolescent general and emotional health outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective longitudinal study that began when patients were aged 3 to 6 years who underwent neuroimaging later at ages 7 to 12 years and whose mental and physical health outcomes were observed at ages 9 to 15 years. Sequential mediation models were used to investigate associations between early ACEs and brain structure, emotion development, and health outcomes longitudinally. Children were recruited from an academic medical center research unit. Exposure Early life adversity. Main Outcomes and Measures Early ACEs in children aged 3 to 7 years; volume of a subregion of the prefrontal cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, in children aged 6 to 12 years; and emotional awareness, depression severity, and general health outcomes in children and adolescents aged 9 to 15 years. Results The mean (SD) age of 119 patients was 9.65 (1.31) years at the time of scan. The mean (SD) ACE score was 5.44 (3.46). The mean (SD) depression severity scores were 2.61 (1.78) at preschool, 1.77 (1.58) at time 2, and 2.16 (1.64) at time 3. The mean (SD) global physical health scores at time 2 and time 3 were 0.30 (0.38) and 0.33 (0.42), respectively. Sequential mediation in the association between high early ACEs and emotional and physical health outcomes were found. Smaller inferior frontal gyrus volumes and poor emotional awareness sequentially mediated the association between early ACEs and poor general health (model parameter estimate\u2009=\u20090.002; 95% CI,\u20090.0002-0.056) and higher depression severity (model parameter estimate\u2009=\u20090.007; 95% CI,\u20090.001-0.021) in adolescence. An increase from 0 to 3 early ACEs was associated with 15% and 25% increases in depression severity and physical health problems, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Study findings highlight 1 putative neurodevelopmental mechanism by which the association between early ACEs and later poor mental and physical health outcomes may operate.

This article aims to provide an integrative review of the latest theoretical and empirical developments in this rapidly growing field of research. Recent findings Deficits in emotion regulation appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and treatment of various forms of psychopathology. Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties. Summary Despite some yet to be resolved challenges, the concept of emotion regulation has a broad and significant heuristic value for research in mental health.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 97, 'citationCount': 594, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2581311', 'name': 'M.

Clinical research to date reveals strong correlation between childhood abuse and neglect and anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThis study was conducted in order to assess the level of emotional, physical and sexual childhood abuse as well as the physical and emotional childhood neglect in 40 adult patients suffering from panic disorder, diagnosed in accordance with the 10th International Classification of Disorders diagnostic criteria, compared with the control group of 40 healthy test subjects without a history of psychiatric disorders, using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. The severity of the clinical manifestation in patients with panic disorder was assessed using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThere were no significant differences between the groups as to the level of sexual abuse and physical neglect, whereas in the group of patients with panic disorder, the level of physical and emotional abuse was significantly higher, with emphasis on emotional neglect. With regards to the correlation between the severity of the clinical manifestation in patients with panic disorder and the severity of suffered abuse and neglect in childhood age, significant correlation was found in the physical and emotional abuse as well as emotional neglect.

The objectives of the study were to examine linkages between exposure to childhood abuse and interparental violence and the subsequent development of panic attacks and panic disorder using data gathered on a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand young people studied to the age of 21 years. Method. Data on: (a) exposure to child abuse and interparental violence; (b) the development of panic attacks and panic disorder; and (c) other childhood and related factors were gathered over the course of a 21-year longitudinal study. Results. After adjustment for childhood and related factors, exposure to childhood physical abuse was associated with a significantly increased risk of later panic attack (OR 2·3, 95% CI 1·1–4·9) and panic disorder (OR 3·0, 95% CI 1·1–7·9); childhood sexual abuse was associated with a significantly increased risk of panic attack (OR 4·1, 95% CI 2·3–7·2) and a marginally significant increase risk of panic disorder (OR 2·2; 95% CI 0·98–5·0). Exposure to interparental violence was unrelated to later panic attack or disorder after adjustment. Conclusions. Exposure to childhood sexual and physical abuse was associated with increased risks of later panic attack/disorder even after adjustment for prospectively assessed confounding factors. However, exposure to interparental violence during childhood was not related to increased risk of later panic attack/disorder after adjustment. These data suggest the need for clinicians to be aware that patients with histories of childhood physical and sexual abuse may be at increased risk for panic during young adulthood.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 97, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5867204', 'name': 'R.

AbstractIn this study, relationships among childhood abuse history, difficulties in emotion regulation, interpersonal styles and psychological wellbeing were examined. Besides the mediator role of emotion regulation and interpersonal styles in the relationship between childhood abuse history and psychological wellbeing were examined. The sample is composed of 802 adults aged 18-65. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to assess the participants? abuse experiences before age 18, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to evaluate participants? difficulties in emotion regulation, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) was used to assess the psychological distress level and Interpersonal Relationship Styles Inventory (IRSI) was used to assess participants? interpersonal styles. The results of the study have shown that gender variable has a main effect on all the study variables excluding emotion regulation and education variable also has a main effect on all the study variables excluding negative interpersonal style. Besides it was determined that the group with a higher level of abuse has more difficulties in emotion regulation, has more psychological distress and exhibit more negative interpersonal relation styles than the group with a lower level of abuse. The predictor variables of psychological wellbeing was found to be psychiatric treatment history, education level, age, the education level of the father, gender, trauma history, physical abuse, sexual abuse, negative interpersonal style and dimensions of emotion regulation difficulties including strategies, clarity, impulse control and goals. Results revealed that both emotion regulation difficulties and negative interpersonal style variables mediate the relation between childhood abuse history and psychological wellbeing. The results of this research in general have shown that childhood abuse history might have negative effects on psychological wellbeing, emotion regulation and interpersonal styles in adult life.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2084049725', 'name': 'Gülçim Bilim'}]}, {'paperId': '3271b93681b1b5a3cf9502b24a831a80db3b4b91', 'title': 'The frequency of childhood trauma and relationship with psychopathology in psychiatric patients', 'abstract': 'Objective: Abuse is considered as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. In this study, we aimed to determine the \nfrequency and risk factors of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual in psychiatric outpatient population and \ncompare the diagnostic groups in terms of these factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional, and descriptive epidemiologic study 183 patients whom accept to participate was enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria is being \naged between 15 and 67, diagnosed by DSM-IV (SCID) psychiatric disorder other than mental retardation and \npsychiatric disorder due to general medical condition. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and a survey including \nsociodemografic characteristics and features of abuse were applied by an interview. Results: Of the sample \n65.7% (n=117) reported at least one and 6.1% (n=11) reported all three childhood emotional, physical and sexual \nabuse. The frequency of emotional and physical neglect was %81.6 (n=146) and %72.1(n=129). Whilst the \nreported emotional abuse was significantly more prevalent only in anxiety disorders, the distribution of other \nabuse types were similar in diagnostic groups. The group reported sexual abuse had statistically significant higher \nalcohol-substance abuse/dependence and suicide rates. When we examine family risk factors, low parent \neducation, in families that has interparental violence and in the group which reported being separated from \nparents because of migration, education and divorce, had significant higher rates of abuse. Discussion: The high \nprevalence of abuse in psychiatric patients, especially in mood and anxiety disorders is pointing at the need for \ndevelopment of preventative approaches. The rate of abuse is higher if there is violation between parents and/or \nthe child is separated from parents for a long time. Because of this precausatory measures, togetherness of \nparent-child and decreasing family violence have to be obtained for protecting children.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 17, 'authors': [{'authorId': '8548562', 'name': 'S.

El maltrato se clasifica como fisico, fisico grave, emocional, negligencia y abuso sexual. La prevalencia del maltrato se ha reportado en estudios epidemiologicos (4.5% a 21%) y en estudios de poblacion clinica (6% a 48%) realizados en varios paises. En Mexico la encuesta de maltrato infantil y factores asociados reporto una prevalencia del maltrato de 16% a 20%, siendo el maltrato fisico, el maltrato fisico grave y el maltrato emocional los mas frecuentes. El maltrato infantil es un problema multicausal. Dentro de los factores familiares asociados al maltrato se han mencionado la desintegracion familiar, la violencia entre los padres y el menor nivel educativo de estos. La psicopatologia se ha reportado en 9% de los ninos y adolescentes maltratados, mencionandose al maltrato como predictor de esta. Se ha encontrado mayor frecuencia de trastornos afectivos, ansiosos, conductuales y de abuso de sustancias en sujetos victimas de maltrato cronico. Los objetivos del presente trabajo fueron determinar la frecuencia y tipos de maltrato reportados por pacientes adolescentes con psicopatologia y determinar la frecuencia de los factores demograficos y de funcionamiento familiar que se han asociado al maltrato en estos pacientes. Metodo El diseno del estudio fue transversal y descriptivo. La muestra incluyo adolescentes de 13 a 17 anos de ambos sexos, usuarios de los servicios de consulta externa, urgencias y hospitalizacion del Hospital Psiquiatrico Infantil «Dr. Juan N. Navarro». Los pacientes fueron evaluados con la Entrevista Semiestructurada para Adolescentes para obtener el diagnostico y contestaron la Encuesta de Maltrato Infantil, que incluye apartados para determinar la presencia de maltrato, las creencias del sujeto acerca del mismo, antecedentes de patologia en el adolescente, caracteristicas de la estructura y nivel socioeconomico familiar y su estilo para solucionar conflictos. Se utilizo estadistica descriptiva para el analisis de datos. Resultados: La muestra se conformo de un total de 100 pacientes (50% hombres, edad promedio 14.79±1.60 anos), 56% pertenecia a una familia integrada. Para ambos padres el nivel de escolaridad mas frecuentemente reportado fue de secundaria, 22% reporto violencia entre sus padres. Los diagnosticos mas frecuentemente encontrados fueron episodio depresivo mayor (61%), trastorno por deficit de atencion e hiperactividad (TDAH)(39%), trastorno disocial (31%), abuso de sustancias (31%) y trastornos de ansiedad (17%).Las frecuencias reportadas de los diferentes tipos de maltrato fueron: maltrato emocional 77%, maltrato fisico 41%, negligencia8% y abuso sexual 24%. La madre perpetro el abuso fisico y emocional con mayor frecuencia. Los pacientes con TDAH y trastorno disocial reportaron las frecuencias mas altas de todos los tipos de abuso, los adolescentes con diagnostico de abuso de sustancias tambien reportaron alta frecuencia de abuso emocional. El abuso sexual fue reportado con frecuencia similar por los pacientes con trastornos afectivos, de conducta y por uso de sustancias. Al preguntar a los pacientes las razones por las que sus padres los golpeaban, la desobediencia y la falta de respeto fueron las razones mas frecuentemente reportadas; el maltrato tambien se atribuyo a que los padres estuvieran nerviosos o hubieran consumido sustancias psicoactivas, siendo estas razones mas frecuentemente expuestas por los adolescentes con diagnostico de abuso de sustancias. Conclusiones: La muestra estudiada de adolescentes reporto frecuencias elevadas de maltrato y abuso sexual. Tambien presento indicadores demograficos desfavorables (familias desintegradas, violencia ente los padres y baja escolaridad de los mismos), que deben tomarse en cuenta como factores de riesgo para el maltrato, aunados a la psicopatologia', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 11, 'authors': [{'authorId': '51354688', 'name': 'R.

Each patient was interviewed, and abuse history, DSM-III-R diagnosis, and other characteristics were recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of reported childhood abuse was 18% overall: 9% for sexual abuse (with or without physical abuse), 10% for physical abuse (with or without sexual abuse), and 3% for combined abuse. More female than male patients reported abuse. Alcohol use disorders were more common in victims of physical or combined abuse than in sexually abused or nonabused patients. Axis II diagnoses, particularly borderline personality disorder, were more frequent in abuse victims than in nonabused patients. Histories of drug and alcohol abuse were more common in patients reporting physical or combined abuse than in nonabused patients. Suicidality was also more frequent in abused than nonabused inpatients and was noted in 79% of the patients with histories of combined abuse. Combined abuse in women and physical abuse in men were associated with a family history of psychiatric illness, most commonly alcoholism in male relatives.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings emphasize the need for greater attention to family dynamics, aggressive diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism within the family, and, especially, determination of patients' abuse histories, even if repeated questioning is necessary."", 'year': 1991, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 605, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2107743533', 'name': 'G.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of emotional regulation training on depression, anxiety and stress, and professional quality of life for intensive and critical care nurses. In this experimental comparison trial, 60 intensive and critical care nurses were randomly assigned to treatment and wait-list control groups. The treatment group received six sessions of emotional regulation training, while the wait-list control group received no treatment. Outcome measures were: the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; and the Professional Quality of Life Scale in a pre-post design. The treatment group demonstrated greater improvements in burnout and compassion satisfaction compared with the wait-list control group. No significant reduction in compassion fatigue was found compared with controls. Some cognitive coping strategies improved in the treatment group compared with controls, with greater reductions in depression, anxiety, and stress. This study indicates the benefits of implementing emotional regulation training programs to improve psychological well-being and professional quality of life for intensive and critical care

Suppression of the expression of positive emotions was negatively associated with subjective well-being and positively associated with perceived stress. However, cognitive reappraisal intended to down-regulate negative emotions and suppression as a strategy to inhibit the expression of negative emotions were not associated with daily well-being or perceived stress. Off-days were rated as days with higher subjective well-being and lower perceived stress in contrast to working days. At the between-person level, individuals who reported more daily negative affect reported increased suppression of positive emotions, corroborating the within-person findings.

High levels of stress may result in depression, anxiety, burnout syndrome, and in extreme cases, post-traumatic stress disorder. The aim of this study was to determine which personal, professional, and organizational variables are associated with greater perceived stress among critical care nurses for purposes of developing integrative solutions to decrease stress in the future. Methods: We conducted a correlation research survey using a cross-sectional design and an in-person survey method. The questionnaire consisted of 2 parts: (1) socioeconomic, professional, and institutional variables and (2) work stressors. Surveys were conducted between January 1, 2011, and December 1, 2015. Multistage cluster random sampling was utilized for data collection. Inclusion criteria were (1) age ≥18 years, (2) registered nurse, (3) works in the intensive care unit (ICU), and (4) willing and able to complete the survey. Results: We surveyed 21 767 ICU nurses in Iran and found that male sex, lower levels of peer collaboration, working with a supervisor in the unit, nurse–patient ratios, and working in a surgical ICU were positively associated with greater stress levels. Increasing age and married status were negatively associated with stress. Intensive care unit type (semi-closed vs open), ICU bed number, shift time, working on holidays, education level, and demographic factors including body mass index, and number of children were not significantly associated with stress levels. Conclusion: As the largest study of its kind, these findings support those found in various European, North, and South American studies.

Appropriate databases (Scopus, PubMed) were searched with the aim of finding relevant studies and articles published in the last 15 years. The keywords were burnout, coping mechanisms, job satisfaction, nurses, and intensive care. Two independent reviewers carried out a selection of the studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe literature review found 786 studies about burnout and its association with different variables. Twenty-nine original research papers were discovered in this review process. Open questions still remain concerning burnout and the associations between the considered variables. We also found that studies using a qualitative approach, which could provide better insight into the investigation of burnout, was insufficient in this area.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBurnout syndrome is serious problem for healthcare systems and affects almost all profiles of healthcare workers. Although burnout is an evidence-based public health problem, there is still no systematic approach to prevention.

Characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment it can result in significant personal and professional consequences putting patient care at risk. Emotion regulation describes a capacity to self-modulate emotions to achieve desirable emotional outcomes. Emotional intelligence theory suggests that emotion regulation skills facilitate the maintenance of appropriate emotions, reducing or adapting undesirable emotions in oneself and others. Emotion regulation is usually automatic but can be controlled through learnt strategies. There is evidence that occupationally stressed individuals are less capable of down-regulating negative emotions.

Successful emotion regulation is crucial to sustain health, enable well-being, foster resilience, and prevent burnout or compassion fatigue. Despite the alarmingly high rate of stress-related disorders in physicians, affecting not only physician well-being, but also outcomes such as physician performance, quality of care, or patient satisfaction, research on how to deal with emotionally challenging situations in physicians is lacking. Based on extant literature, the present article proposes a theoretical model depicting emotions, emotion regulation, and empathy-related processes and their relation to well-being in provider-client interactions. This model serves as a basis for future research and interventions aiming at improving physician well-being and professional functioning. As a first step, interviews with 21 psychiatrists were conducted. Results of qualitative and initial quantitative analyses provided detailed descriptions of the model's components confirming its usefulness for detecting mechanisms linking emotion regulation and well-being in psychiatrist-patient interactions. Additionally, results lend preliminary support for the validity of the model, suggesting that successful regulation of emotions (i.e., achieving a desired emotional state) elicited by cyclical transfer processes in provider-client interactions is associated with both short- and long-term well-being and resilience. Furthermore, empathy-related emotions and their regulation seem to be linked to well-being. Based on the results of the present study, a prospective longitudinal study is under preparation, which is intended to inform effective interventions targeting emotion transfer, empathy-related processes, and emotion regulation in physicians' professional lives. The model and results are also potentially applicable to other health care and social services providers."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 133, 'citationCount': 35, 'authors': [{'authorId': '51210685', 'name': 'Sonja Weilenmann'}, {'authorId': '47675704', 'name': 'U.

Currently, the literature does not allow to determine stable similarities and differences in the use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) in anxiety and depression, especially concerning the adaptive strategies. Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify the overlapping and distinctive patterns of CERS use in the recently proposed types of anxiety and depression in a general population. In this dimensional approach, types of anxiety and depression are considered as personality types and distinguished based on their specific structural composition and functional role (reactive or regulative) in stimulation processing. 1,632 participants from a representative sample completed the Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire (measuring the Arousal and Apprehension Types of anxiety and the Valence and Anhedonic Types of depression) and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Regression analyses were conducted with the affective types as predictors. The co-occurrence of the types was accounted for in order to examine their independent relationships with the CERS. We found that reactive arousal anxiety was not related to any strategies, while regulative apprehension anxiety primarily predicted the use of rumination, which is presumably related to the type's cognitive structural components. The strategy specific to reactive valence depression was other-blame (as predicted by the high negative affect in its structure), and the regulative, most structurally complex anhedonic depression predicted the use of the largest number of strategies, including the adaptive ones. The relationships between the types of depression and self-blame and refocus on planning were moderated by sex but the effects were small. These findings fit into the current trend of exploring the shared and specific features of anxiety and depression, which might facilitate their differentiation by identifying CERS that are characteristic for the specific types.

Subsequently, the quality of patient care and outcomes may be threatened if clinicians experience burnout or compassion fatigue. Therefore, the aim of this descriptive, cross-sectional study was to evaluate the prevalence of burnout and compassion fatigue among burn clinicians in Israel. Fifty-five clinicians from Burns, Plastics and Reconstruction Surgery and Intensive Care completed four validated surveys to assess burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), depression (PRIME-MD), health-related quality of life (SF-8), and compassion fatigue (Professional Quality of Life version 5). Burn clinicians were compared with Plastics and Reconstruction Surgery and Intensive Care clinicians. This study identified a high prevalence of burnout (38.2%) among Intensive Care, Plastics and Reconstruction and Burns clinicians, with Burns clinicians having a greatly increased prevalence of burnout compared to Intensive Care clinicians (OR =24.3, P=0.017). Additional factors contributing to compassion fatigue were those without children (P=0.016), divorced (P=0.035), of a younger age (P=0.019), and a registered nurse (P=0.05). Burnout increased clinicians’ risk of adverse professional and personal outcomes and correlated with less free time (P<0.001), increased risk of experiencing work-home disputes (P=0.05), increased depression (P=0.001) and decreased career satisfaction (P=0.01). Burnout was also associated with higher physical (mean difference =3.8, P<0.001) and lower mental (mean difference =−3.5, P<0.001) Quality of Life scores.

Within these broad categories, there was moderate level evidence from multiple prospective studies that high job demands, low job control, high effort–reward imbalance, low relational justice, low procedural justice, role stress, bullying and low social support in the workplace are associated with a greater risk of developing common mental health problems.

This disorder affects important aspects of a person’s life such as professional quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between post-traumatic stress symptoms and professional quality of life among psychiatric nurses. Methods & Materials: In this descriptive analytical study, 160 nurses in psychiatric wards affiliated to Kerman University of Medical Sciences, were selected using census sampling in 2013. Data were collected using questionnaires including professional and demographic characteristics, the Weathers’ PTSD checklist (PCL-C) and Hudnall Stamm’s Professional Quality of Life (PQOL). Data were analyzed by the SPSS software v.20 using the Pearson correlation coefficient, independent t-test, one-way ANOVA and linear regression. Results: There was a significant correlation between PTSD score and professional quality of life scores in psychiatric nurses (r=0.32, P<0.001). Also, PTSD was positively correlated with burnout (r=0.36, P<0.001) and secondary traumatic stress (r=0.61, P<0.001), and conversely correlated with compassion satisfaction (r=-0.29, P<0.001). After removing the effects of age, work experience, previous experience of traumatic events, the correlation between two main research variables was significant as well (P<0.001).

The results and methodological factors were extracted from each study. Results Seventy-eight studies assessed associations between individual-level factors and mental health. The main individual factors shown to have a statistically significant independent association with worse mental health were low income, not living with a partner, lack of social support, female gender, low level of education, low income, low socioeconomic status, unemployment, financial strain, and perceived discrimination. Sixty-nine studies reported associations between area-level factors and mental health, namely neighbourhood socioeconomic conditions, social capital, geographical distribution and built environment, neighbourhood problems and ethnic composition.

Future Directions for Research.', 'abstract': 'Burnout syndrome is a psychological condition experienced in the workplace that is characterized by exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment (1). Burnout syndrome can manifest as physical and emotional health problems. Work-related consequences can include clinician dissatisfaction, decreased quality of care delivered to patients, medical errors, unjustified absenteeism, and intention to leave the organization. Health care organizations and leaders within the critical care community are increasingly concerned about the development of burnout syndrome among intensive care unit (ICU) health care professionals (2, 3). These concerns are fueled by growing awareness of the major adverse consequences burnout can have on individual clinicians, health care organizations, and patients. An official statement addressing burnout syndrome among ICU health care professionals was prepared jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN), and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and was published simultaneously in journals of the participating societies, including the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (4) The statement discusses the prevalence, contributing factors, diagnosis, consequences, prevention, and treatment of burnout syndrome in ICU physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals. This editorial expands on the research needs identified by the multisociety writing panel. Four priorities are highlighted for future research: the diagnosis of burnout syndrome in critical care health care professionals, the general effect of burnout syndrome, preventative measures and treatments, and the dissemination and implementation of effective interventions. Research on burnout syndrome requires the development and validation of appropriate tools for identifying and measuring the severity of the syndrome. The Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) is the most commonly used instrument for the measurement of burnout syndrome (1, 5, 6). The original MBI-HSS is based on a three-factor conceptualization of burnout, which includes the constructs of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Self-assessment instruments of this type are expected to measure the same constructs over a variety of subject cohorts and across repeated applications to the same subjects over time. If those expectations hold true in practice, the analyses of the scores are acceptable and yield meaningful results. However, there have been inconsistent findings based on the three-factor model for the MBI-HSS related to measurement invariance (7–9). Dramatic, unexplained variations in prevalence have been reported. There is also a question of whether the three-factor conceptualization of burnout embedded in the MBI-HSS appropriately defines burnout in the critical care health care professional. Future research should focus on developing briefer screening tests for burnout syndrome, examining the validity of diagnostic tests in the ICU health care professionals specifically, the validity of diagnostic instruments over time, and the responsiveness of the instrument to detect meaningful improvement in symptoms. Other than self-assessment instruments, there are no binding diagnostic criteria for burnout that enable differentiation between adverse consequences of the work environment and primary psychiatric disorders. To enable this differentiation, health care organizations may also benefit from developing a brief screening questionnaire to implement during the hiring of critical care health care professionals. Using existing instruments, estimates of the prevalence of burnout among critical care nurses and physicians have ranged from 25% to 80%, and the average severity has ranged from mild to severe (3, 10, 11) The temporal relationship between burnout and the ICU environment is poorly understood because all these studies have been cross-sectional in design. Therefore, prospective cohort studies are needed to more accurately define the prevalence of burnout and determine how quickly burnout develops. Assessing baseline burnout levels before commencing work in the ICU and repeated measures over time will help address the question of temporality. Other questions need to be addressed to fully understand the effect of burnout on critical care health care professionals and', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 17, 'citationCount': 26, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5026369', 'name': 'M.

BOS also directly affects the mental health and physical well-being of the many critical care physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals who practice worldwide.

This article aims to provide an integrative review of the latest theoretical and empirical developments in this rapidly growing field of research. Recent findings Deficits in emotion regulation appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and treatment of various forms of psychopathology. Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties.

The psychological effects on nurses as a result of working in the ICU are relatively unknown.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether there is an increased prevalence of psychological symptoms in ICU nurses when compared with general nurses.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe surveyed ICU and general nurses from three different hospitals (n=351) and then surveyed ICU nurses throughout the metropolitan area (n=140).\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nIn both cohorts of nurses, we determined the prevalence of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression using validated survey instruments. Within our hospital system, 24% (54/230) of the ICU nurses tested positive for symptoms of PTSD related to their work environment, compared with 14% (17/121) of the general nurses (p=0.03). ICU nurses did not report a greater amount of stress in their life outside of the hospital than general nurses. There was no difference in symptoms of depression or anxiety between ICU and general nurses. In the second survey of ICU nurses from our metropolitan area, 29% (41/140) of the respondents reported symptoms of PTSD, similar to our first cohort of ICU nurses.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nICU nurses have an increased prevalence of PTSD symptoms when compared with other general nurses.

Therefore, success in life depends not only on intellectual abilities, but also on emotion regulation competence. Emotion regulation is of greater importance in professions with high levels of daily occupational stress such as nursing. The aim of this study was to determine cognitive emotion regulation strategies used by a group of Iranian critical care nurses. Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 193 critical care nurses. They were recruited through stratified random sampling from ICU, CCU, and Hemodialysis center and Emergency departments of six hospitals under supervision of Qazvin university of medical science, qazvin, Iran,. The 36-item Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was used for data gathering. Descriptive statistics measures (frequency, mean, and SD) and inferential statistics (T test, Pearson correlation analysis) were used for data description and analysis. Results: There were significant differences among nurses of different units respecting the mean scores of strategies Acceptance (P = 0.002), Rumination (P = 0.001), Catastrophizing (P = 0.046), and Self-blame (P = 0.029). Age and work experience were correlated with acceptance and putting into perspective strategies while work experience was inversely correlated with rumination strategies.

As an attempt to shed more light on the relationships among teacher psychological factors in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context, this study examined the role of teacher self-efficacy and emotional regulation as predictors of teaching stress among Iranian EFL teachers. In so doing, a sample of 256 teachers completed three questionnaires measuring these constructs. Structural Equation Modeling was employed to test the hypothesized relationships among the variables. The findings revealed that emotional regulation accounted for 14.2% of the variance and teacher self-efficacy accounted for 22.1% of the variance in teaching stress. Although each of the two variables had a unique effect on teaching stress, teacher self-efficacy outweighed emotional regulation in predicting teaching stress.

Survey method was used to collect data on measures of job satisfaction, emotion regulation, and stress. Two emotion regulation strategies, reappraisal (regulation of cognition) and suppression (regulation of the behavior) were considered. Data were analyzed by using structural equation modeling, and conventional statistical analysis. Findings show that emotion regulation is associated with decreased stress and increased job satisfaction, and stressors in life do not need to be workrelated to decrease job satisfaction. Managerial style, job control, and job insecurity also highly influence job satisfaction. Emotion regulation increases in older age, and emotion regulation is associated with job satisfaction only in older, but not in younger adults.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 5, 'authors': [{'authorId': '115179007', 'name': 'M.

First, the suitability of the original QEEW stress scales for use in the beginning teachers (BTs) context was investigated using a sample of 356 beginning teachers from 52 different secondary school locations in the Netherlands. Confirmatory Factor Analyses, Principal Component Analyses and Mokken scaling item reduction was applied to create high concise and precise scales.

Participants (839 teachers working in English schools) completed an online survey that contained questions about demographics, self-reported pressure from imposed curriculum changes, teacher self-efficacy, and perceived stress. Pressure from imposed curriculum changes was positively, and teacher self-efficacy negatively, related to perceived stress. Teacher-self efficacy moderated relations between pressure from imposed curriculum changes and perceived stress. High teacher self-efficacy was associated with lower perceived stress, relative to low teacher self-efficacy, when pressure from imposed curriculum changes was low.

We then highlight growing evidence that automatic and habitual forms of ER, characterized by low resource demands and low conscious awareness, have an important influence on the stress response and its link to psychopathology and well-being. We propose the Dynamic Fit Model of Stress and ER, which posits that (1) both deliberative and automatic ER contribute to the link between stress and psychopathology; (2) the fit between stress demands and ER strategy selection can be mapped along the dimensions of automaticity and flexibility; and (3) negative effects of stress on well-being and psychological functioning emerge when there is a poor fit between stress demands and ER.

The results yielded via structural equation modeling substantiated the negative role of these constructs in burnout. The emotion regulation was measured via the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire developed by Gross and John. The scale comprises two subscales: cognitive reappraisal (an antecedent-focused factor aimed at changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact) and expressive suppression (a response-focused element targeted at inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings). Emotional labor strategies were assessed through the Teacher Emotional Labor Strategy Scale designed by Yin. This test consists of three parts: surface acting (which refers to strategy in which people hinder and cover their felt emotions or fake unfelt feeling for the aim of showing the appropriate emotions needed for their profession), deep acting (which refers to the kind of strategy in which individuals try to change their felt emotions with the aid of some cognitive techniques, such as distraction so as the appropriate emotion occurs), and natural acting (which refers to the instance when individuals simultaneously experience and present the appropriate emotion for their job).

Participants and Courses Involved in the Study This study utilized both traditional and nontraditional students the author taught in the past fifteen years. The undergraduate students (pre-service teachers) in the study were working toward bachelor’s degrees in teaching and not actually teaching when they wrote their essays. Most of the graduate students were in-service education professionals who had returned to school for advanced degrees. “Traditional” students were defined as on-campus students with tuition support from parents or student loans. “Nontraditional” students were defined as those living off campus and working or raising a family. 61 The students were enrolled in various courses, some held during the day, others at night. The courses included Methods of Teaching Science; Methods of Teaching Math; Methods of Teaching Social Studies; Curriculum Development; Child Development; Introduction to Special Education; Problems in the Elementary School; Educational Technology; and Teaching in the Urban Setting. More than one thousand students matriculated through these undergraduate and graduate classes, held in the United States, Canada, Bermuda, and the Caribbean. Several students from Africa participated. The courses were taught at both predominately white and historically black institutions, including two private colleges; three public universities; a junior college; and a technical college. The multiplicity of institutions and courses over the years provided the study with a diverse student population: young and old, black and white, Hispanic, those of Asian nationality, males, and females. The students were mainly early childhood majors, training to teach nursery to grade three (N–3); elementary education majors, training to teach kindergarten to sixth grade (K–6); and secondary education majors, training to teach seventh to twelfth grades (7–12) in specific subject areas such as physical education, mathematics, science, history, and music.

A partir de los datos obtenidos de 140 trabajadores que utilizan nuevas tecnologias en sus puestos, se constata que, en general, la autoeficacia modula las relaciones entre los estresores y sus consecuencias, en el sentido de que bajos niveles de autoeficacia estan asociados a mayores niveles de estres experimentado. Los resultados de los analisis de regresion multiple jerarquica senalan que, aunque encontramos mas efectos de interaccion en el caso de la autoeficacia profesional, ambos tipos de autoeficacia son complementarias en cuanto a su rol modulador en los procesos de estres, dependiendo su modulacion del tipo de estresor y de la consecuencia de estres especifica considerada. En concreto encontramos que los trabajadores bajos en autoeficacia generalizada manifiestan mayor agotamiento emocional cuando la autonomia laboral es mayor; mientras que los trabajadores bajos en autoeficacia profesional manifiestan mayores niveles de cinismo cuando la rutina y el conflicto de rol son altos, y menores niveles de compromiso organizacional cuando tienen niveles elevados de conflicto de rol. Para los trabajadores altos en niveles de autoeficacia, tanto generalizada como especifica, valores altos de los estresores no estan asociado con consecuencias negativas del estres. Finalmente se analizan las limitaciones de este estudio y las implicaciones que se derivan de los resultados.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 157, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2098339424', 'name': 'R.

Consistent with a bioecological framework, where culture is part of the macrosystem, philosophical foundations and core cultural values that are relevant to Chinese parenting and parental socialization of children’s emotion and emotional self-regulation processes are discussed. In addition, major changes that have been observed in Chinese societies and cultures across the 20th and 21st centuries are discussed in relation to parenting and emotional self-regulation processes. In light of such cultural values and dynamics, transactional or bidirectional influences between parent and child factors on children’s emotional self-regulation processes and psychosocial adjustment, along with promising future research directions, are highlighted and discussed.",2022,0,4,{'name': 'The Oxford Handbook of Emotional Development'},"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':
