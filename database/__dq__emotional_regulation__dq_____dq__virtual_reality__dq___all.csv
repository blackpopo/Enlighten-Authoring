000f7f109efafd00af5733915ae5183818a412a9,"Intelligent user interfaces have traditionally been used to create systems that respond intelligently to user input. However there is a recent trend towards Empathic Interfaces that are designed to go beyond understanding user input and to recognize emotional state and user feelings. In this presentation we explore how Augmented Reality (AR) can be used to convey that emotional state and so allow users to capture and share emotional experiences. In this way AR not only overlays virtual imagery on the real world, but also can create deeper understanding of user's experience at particular locations and points in time. The recent emergence of truly wearable systems, such as Google Glass, provide a platform for Empathic Communication using AR. Examples will be shown from research conducted at the HIT Lab NZ and other research organizations, and key areas for future research described.","[{'authorId': '1684805', 'name': 'M.

People have different perceptions and understanding of what it is like to live with dementia, particularly those that are new to dementia care, whether in a professional capacity, or as a friend or family member. Arguably the most powerful way in which to enhance understanding is to give people a glimpse of what living with dementia might be like. Design/methodology/approach – The myShoes project aimed to create a resource that would augment a virtual environment and expose the user to an experience that gives them a sense of what living with dementia might be like. The resource was created using the latest VR and game development software. A sample group of students from a mixed range of health professions tested the resource providing in depth feedback on its immediate impact and ideas for further development.

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are both widely used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There has, however, been debate regarding the advantages of one approach over the other. This study sought to determine whether there was any evidence that one treatment was superior to the other. Method. We performed a systematic review of the literature dating from 1989 to 2005 and identified eight publications describing treatment outcomes of EMDR and CBT in active–active comparisons. Seven of these studies were investigated meta-analytically. Results. The superiority of one treatment over the other could not be demonstrated. Trauma-focused CBT and EMDR tend to be equally efficacious. Differences between the two forms of treatment are probably not of clinical significance. While the data indicate that moderator variables influence treatment efficacy, we argue that because of the small number of original studies, little benefit is to be gained from a closer examination of these variables. Further research is needed within the framework of randomized controlled trials. Conclusions. Our results suggest that in the treatment of PTSD, both therapy methods tend to be equally efficacious. We suggest that future research should not restrict its focus to the efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency of these therapy methods but should also attempt to establish which trauma patients are more likely to benefit from one method or the other. What remains unclear is the contribution of the eye movement component in EMDR to treatment outcome.","[{'authorId': '72935940', 'name': 'G. Seidler'}, {'authorId': '32578025', 'name': 'F.

00be5ef748ea1b202ca11006cbb64b211e93365c,"ABSTRACT A novel, heuristic model based upon chaotic complex systems theory and quantum mechanics is proposed to overcome the dichotomy between mind and body. The mind–body interface represents a chaotic system, ruled by the probability principle, as shown in quantum mechanics. Neuronal activity shows many patterns of chaotic behavior, and applications of chaotic patterns seem to be relevant for research regarding the mind–body relationship and the process of trance. A quantum consciousness theory has been proposed, largely controversial, since quantum physics applies to subatomic world and not to macrostructures, such as the brain. Quantum cognition is an emerging field that applies the formalism of quantum theory to model cognitive phenomena such as information processing by the human brain; it overcomes limits and shortcomings of cartesian dualism as well as quantum general theory. As hypnosis is a state of consciousness, it applies to hypnotic cognitive functioning rather than hypnotic structure.","[{'authorId': '4000182', 'name': 'G.

Method The sample comprised of 50 participants from the general public and various psychology undergraduate programs. Participants completed pre‐test measures exploring knowledge of diagnosis, attitudes, and empathetic understanding, before being exposed to an immersive VR simulation of a psychotic episode. Participants then completed the original measures with the addition of a user‐experience scale, which explored sub‐factors understood to share a relationship with VR effectiveness (i.e., fidelity, immersion, presence, and user buy‐in). Results Participants’ scores were significantly enhanced at post‐test across each outcome measure, with significant correlations found between a number of the gain and user‐experience scores. Conclusions The findings suggest that VR‐based simulations of psychopathology may offer a promising platform for delivering a constructionist approach to psychology education.","[{'authorId': '114952113', 'name': 'Nicholas J.

We report results from a 4-condition, between subjects experiment (N = 112), wherein participants were exposed to either a virtual simulation of schizophrenia, a written empathy-set induction of schizophrenia, a combination of both the simulation and written empathy conditions, or a control condition. The results indicated that the virtual simulation + empathy condition induced greater empathy and more positive perceptions toward people suffering from schizophrenia than the control or written empathy-set condition. Interestingly, the simulation-only condition resulted in the greatest desire for social distance whereas not significantly differing on empathy and attitude measures from either the written empathy or simulation + empathy conditions.

So in real life application, detection of emotion is very challenging task. Facial expression recognition system requires to overcome the human face having multiple variability such as color, orientation, expression, posture and texture so on. In our framework we have taken frame from live streaming and processed it using Grabor feature extraction and neural network. To detect the emotion facial attributes extraction by principal component analysis is used and a clusterization of different facial expression with respective emotions. Finally to determine facial expressions separately, the processed feature vector is channeled through the already learned pattern classifiers.","[{'authorId': '9440286', 'name': 'Debishree Dagar'}, {'authorId': '9118932', 'name': 'Abir Hudait'}, {'authorId': '153696840', 'name': 'H.

Many researchers have applied linear or partial nonlinear processing in feature reduction and classification, but these applications did not work well. Therefore, this paper proposed a comprehensive nonlinear method to solve this problem. On the one hand, as traditional feature reduction may cause the loss of significant amounts of feature information, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) based on radial basis function (RBF) was introduced to map the data into a high-dimensional space, extract the nonlinear information of the features, and then reduce the dimension. This method can provide many features carrying information about the structure in the physiological dataset. On the other hand, considering its advantages of predictive power and feature selection from a large number of features, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) was used as a nonlinear ensemble classifier to improve the recognition accuracy. The comprehensive nonlinear processing method had a great performance on our physiological dataset.

This study examined associations between daily physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors and depressive symptoms (a) at a macrolevel, over the course of an Experience Sampling (ESM) self-monitoring intervention, and (b) at a microlevel, by examining daily within-person associations. Second, we examined the effects of the ESM self-monitoring intervention on these daily life behaviors.


METHODS
Individuals with a diagnosis of depression (N = 102) receiving pharmacological treatment were randomized to 1 of 2 six-week ESM intervention conditions or a control condition. Physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors as well as depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively in every-day life at baseline, postintervention, and during the ESM interventions.


RESULTS
Change in physical activity and talking from baseline to postintervention was associated with change in depressive symptoms from baseline to postintervention. Within-person daily fluctuations in talking, physical activity, doing nothing/resting, and being alone predicted end-of-day depressive symptoms over and above depressive symptoms at the previous day. The ESM interventions contributed to change in talking, doing nothing/resting, and being alone over time in comparison with the control group. The analyses revealed individual differences in the amount of behavioral change over time and in the within-subject associations between daily behaviors and depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that physical, sedentary, and social behaviors have affective implications for daily mental health of individuals with depression. Self-monitoring using ESM may be a useful add-on tool to achieve behavioral change and to gain personalized insight in behaviors that improve daily depressive symptoms.","[{'authorId': '6467792', 'name': 'E.

It is therefore important to understand the determinants of emotion regulation choice. Many prior studies have examined person-specific, internal determinants of emotion regulation choice. Recently, it has become clear that external variables that are properties of the stimulus can also influence emotion regulation choice. In the present research, we consider whether reappraisal affordances, defined as the opportunities for re-interpretation of a stimulus that are inherent in that stimulus, can shape individuals’ emotion regulation choices. We show that reappraisal affordances have stability across people and across time (Study 1), and are confounded with emotional intensity for a standardised set of picture stimuli (Study 2). Since emotional intensity has been shown to drive emotion regulation choice, we construct a context in which emotional intensity is separable from reappraisal affordances (Study 3) and use this context to show that reappraisal affordances powerfully influence emotion regulation choice even when emotional intensity and discrete emotions are taken into account (Study 4).","[{'authorId': '47763916', 'name': 'G.

We used a Virtual Reality version of the Multiple Errand Test (VMET) - developed dusing the free NeuroVR software (http://www.neurovr.org) - to evaluate the executive functions in daily life in 10 OCD patients and 10 controls. It is performed in a shopping setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The execution time for the whole task was higher in patients with OCD compared to controls, suggesting that patients with OCD need more time in planning than controls. The same difference was found in the partial errors during the task. Furthermore, the mean rank for and for interpretation failures is higher for controls, while the values of divided attention and the of self correction seems to be lower in controls. We think that obsessive patients tend to work with greater diligence and observance of rules than controls. In conclusion, these results provide initial support for the feasibility of VMET as assessment tool of executive functions. Specifically, the significant correlation found between the VMET and the neuropsychological battery support the ecological validity of VMET as an instrument for the evaluation of executive functions in patients with OCD.","[{'authorId': '38562906', 'name': 'F.

These feelings of control over bodily actions, or the sense of agency, and the ownership of body parts are two fundamental aspects of the way we consciously experience our bodies. However, little is known about how these processes are functionally linked. Here, we introduce a version of the rubber hand illusion in which participants control the movements of the index finger of a model hand, which is in full view, by moving their own right index finger. We demonstrated that voluntary finger movements elicit a robust illusion of owning the rubber hand and that the senses of ownership and agency over the model hand can be dissociated. We systematically varied the relative timing of the finger movements (synchronous versus asynchronous), the mode of movement (active versus passive), and the position of the model hand (anatomically congruent versus incongruent positions). Importantly, asynchrony eliminated both ownership and agency, passive movements abolished the sense of agency but left ownership intact, and incongruent positioning of the model hand diminished ownership but did not eliminate agency. These findings provide evidence for a double dissociation of ownership and agency, suggesting that they represent distinct cognitive processes. Interestingly, we also noted that the sense of agency was stronger when the hand was perceived to be a part of the body, and only in this condition did we observe a significant correlation between the subjects’ ratings of agency and ownership. We discuss this in the context of possible differences between agency over owned body parts and agency over actions that involve interactions with external objects. In summary, the results obtained in this study using a simple moving rubber hand illusion paradigm extend previous findings on the experience of ownership and agency and shed new light on their relationship.","[{'authorId': '2456922', 'name': 'Andreas Kalckert'}, {'authorId': '144940712', 'name': 'H.

There is a growing body of evidence to support the efficacy of cognitive remediation for cognitive and emotional difficulties in ED. Playmancer/ Islands is a video game (VG) designed to specifically treat mental disorders, characterized by problems in impulse control. The objective of the game is to increase self-control over emotions, decision making and behaviours. The aim of this study is to describe the results from a consecutive series of nine bulimia nervosa patients who were treated with the VG in addition to cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). The outcomes included clinical and psychopathological questionnaires, and physiological measures were obtained during the VG. Emotional regulation improved, heart rate variability increased, and respiratory rate and impulsivity measures reduced after the treatment. These findings suggest that VG training may enhance treatment for ED.","[{'authorId': '4026148', 'name': 'A. B. Fagundo'}, {'authorId': '36916560', 'name': 'J.

A between-group design was used, and 40 volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions (stereoscopy vs. no stereoscopy) and to one of two emotional VEs (relaxation or joy). The participants' emotions were assessed before and after the VR experience. Presence was measured with two postexperiment questionnaires (ITC-SOPI and SUS). Results show that there were no differences between stereoscopic and monoscopic presentations in VEs (neither subjective sense of presence nor emotional reactions). Practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed herein.","[{'authorId': '2072640353', 'name': 'M.

Although instances of interpersonal (i.e., one-to-one) helping, in which one person provides assistance to another, have dominated investigations into prosocial behavior for many years, theory and research has since broadened from this initial focus to consider collective forms of prosocial behavior (e.g., volunteerism and participation in social movements) and the dynamics of cooperation within and between collectives. Investigators have sought to understand what leads people to engage in these behaviors, identifying sources of prosocial motivation that are internal (such as personal needs and drives) and external (such as situational demands and social norms). We review theory and research seeking to understand diverse sources of prosocial motivation across three distinct categories of prosocial behavior: interpersonal prosocial behavior, collective prosocial behavior, and cooperation within and between collectives.

Previous research has suggested that institutionalization increases the co-existing symptoms of dementia, such as aggression, depression, apathy, lack of motivation and loss of interest in oneself and others. Despite the importance of supporting the mental well-being of people with dementia, in many cases, it remains undertreated. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions aiming to improve the Health-Related Quality of Life for people with dementia within long-term care. With computer technology and especially Virtual Reality offering endless opportunities for mental support, we must consider how Virtual Reality for people with dementia can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences. Working closely with 24 dementia patients and 51 medical and paramedical personnel, we co-designed an intelligent and personalized Virtual Reality system to enhance symptom management of dementia patients residing in long-term care. Through this paper, we thoroughly explain the screening process and analysis we run to identify which environments patients would like to receive as a Virtual Reality intervention to minimize the aforementioned co-existing symptoms of dementia, and the development of an intelligent system using the selected environments, that adapts the content of the Virtual Reality experience based on physiological and eye-tracking data from the patients and their personal preferences.","[{'authorId': '25238328', 'name': 'M.

A growing body of evidence suggests that rhythmic neural activity in the alpha frequency band (8–12 Hz) tracks the spatial locus of covert attention, which suggests that alpha activity is integral to spatial attention. However, extant work has not provided a compelling test of another key prediction: that alpha activity tracks the temporal dynamics of covert spatial orienting. In the current study, we examined the time course of spatially specific alpha activity after central cues and during visual search. Critically, the time course of this activity tracked trial-by-trial variations in orienting latency during visual search. These findings provide important new evidence for the link between rhythmic brain activity and covert spatial attention, and they highlight a powerful approach for tracking the spatial and temporal dynamics of this core cognitive process.","[{'authorId': '23594755', 'name': 'Joshua J.

 The validity of environmental simulations depends on their capacity to replicate responses produced in physical environments. However, very few studies validate navigation differences in immersive virtual environments, even though these can radically condition space perception and therefore alter the various evoked responses. The objective of this paper is to validate environmental simulations using 3D environments and head-mounted display devices, at behavioural level through navigation. A comparison is undertaken between the free exploration of an art exhibition in a physical museum and a simulation of the same experience. As a first perception validation, the virtual museum shows a high degree of presence. Movement patterns in both ‘museums’ show close similarities, and present significant differences at the beginning of the exploration in terms of the percentage of area explored and the time taken to undertake the tours. Therefore, the results show there are significant time-dependent differences in navigation patterns during the first 2 minutes of the tours. Subsequently, there are no significant differences in navigation in physical and virtual museums. These findings support the use of immersive virtual environments as empirical tools in human behavioural research at navigation level.

Researchers from the fields of virtual reality (VR) and game design highlight the potential of VR technologies as a great tool to promote empathy. However, there is little empirical and systematic knowledge on how to use VR technology to help promote empathy in young children. To address this gap, we developed a VR Empathy Game prototype to explore how VR experiences can inculcate empathy development in young children. To evaluate this prototype, we conducted a qualitative study with 15 children from 6 to 9 years old. We used an interpretive case study to provide an in-depth understanding of children’s experiences with the VR Empathy Game. To guide participant selection, we used a purposeful sampling approach and intentionally included K-3 children with different empathy and social skills levels. 
  
This paper describes one case representing a challenge that children with a low level of empathy can experience while playing the VR Empathy Game. This case explains the game experience of a seven-year-old boy, Gabe. The case is entitled: “The VR Empathy Game Experience with a Focus on Exploring the Environment and Looking for Clues.” Gabe confused intrinsic and extrinsic game goals and played the game focusing only on the VR environment. He perceived the game characters as an information source rather than building relationships with them unlike the children with a higher level of empathy. This case represents the group of four boys who participated in our study. In comparison with other participants, Gabe’s case provided very little evidence of noticing the characters' emotions. Our findings suggest that game designers should provide additional scaffolding for children with little levels of empathy, including additional reflective questions and reminders to interact with the characters. We also suggest a follow-up study exploring how different storylines would help children’s game experience.","[{'authorId': '3439826', 'name': 'Ekaterina Muravevskaia'}, {'authorId': '1403600070', 'name': 'Christina Gardner-Mccune'}]",0.0,{'name': 'European Conference on Games Based Learning'},18.0,Case Study on VR Empathy Game: Challenges with VR Games Development for Emotional Interactions with the VR Characters,2022.0

In this paper, we focus on deepening into the research on AR/MR technologies to foster students’ comprehension of socio-cultural values in historical contexts. We address this challenge by exploring the potential of the interaction paradigm called World-as-Support (WaS). We present a case study of an educational Virtual Heritage experience with primary students for a bomb shelter built during the Spanish Civil War. Our findings showed that the experience enhanced students’ capabilities to reflect upon high-level issues related to value human dignity, to grasp some of the essential qualities of the value solidarity and to connect historical events with present political situations in Spain. Finally, we discuss four design recommendations for learning activities based on the WaS concerning (1) the enhancement of students’ competences in collaboration, and communication; (2) critical thinking; (3) contextualization of historical contents; and (4) moral and ethical considerations for digital augmentation.","[{'authorId': '1884378', 'name': 'Marie-Monique Schaper'}, {'authorId': '2844133', 'name': 'N.

Nevertheless, laboratory experiments and retrospective assessments have been the 2 most common strands of ER research; thus, leaving open several crucial questions about ER antecedents and consequences in daily life. Beyond traditional methods, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has the potential to capture ER dynamics during the flow of daily experiences, in real-life settings and through repeated measurements. Here, we discuss what we currently know about ER antecedents and consequences. We will compare findings from previous literature to findings from EMA studies, pointing out both similarities and differences, as well as questions that can be answered better with the EMA approach.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).","[{'authorId': '5983047', 'name': 'Dario Bombari'}, {'authorId': '2284257', 'name': 'M.

However, it is not clear how to use the information extracted from electrophysiological signals to create visual representations of the affective states of Virtual Reality (VR) users. Visualization of users’ affective states in VR can lead to biofeedback therapies for mental health care. Understanding how to visualize affective states in VR requires an interdisciplinary approach that integrates psychology, electrophysiology, and audio-visual design. Therefore, this review aims to integrate previous studies from these fields to understand how to develop virtual environments that can automatically create visual representations of users’ affective states. The manuscript addresses this challenge in four sections: First, theories related to emotion and affect are summarized. Second, evidence suggesting that visual and sound cues tend to be associated with affective states are discussed. Third, some of the available methods for assessing affect are described. The fourth and final section contains five practical considerations for the development of virtual reality environments for affect visualization.","[{'authorId': '39989232', 'name': 'A.

Observers were required to provide a continuous rating of their sense of presence using a handheld slider. The first experiment investigated the effects of manipulating stereoscopic and motion parallax cues within video sequences presented on a 20 in. stereoscopic CRT display. The results showed that the presentation of both stereoscopic and motion parallax cues was associated with higher presence ratings. One possible interpretation of Experiment 1 is that CRT displays that contain the spatial cues of stereoscopic disparity and motion parallax are more interesting or engaging. To test this, observers in Experiment 2 rated the same stimuli first for interest and then for presence. The results showed that variations in interest did not predict the presence ratings obtained in Experiment 1. However, the subsequent ratings of presence differed significantly from those obtained in Experiment 1, suggesting that prior experience with interest ratings affected subsequent judgments of presence. To test this, Experiment 3 investigated the effects of prior experience on presence ratings. Three groups of observers rated a training sequence for interest, presence, and 3-Dness before rating the same stimuli as used for Experiments 1 and 2 for presence. The results demonstrated that prior ratings sensitize observers to different features of a display resulting in different presence ratings. The implications of these results for presence evaluation are discussed, and a combination of more-refined subjective measures and a battery of objective measures is recommended.","[{'authorId': '48770354', 'name': 'J.

We report how often landscape features and human factors are controlled for within these experiments, thereby—for the first time—recording specifically what elements of “nature” and the built/social environment are used when testing the benefits of green space and blue space exposure. We also document all the simulation methods that are used (e.g., duration, number of exposures, senses engaged, and devices used). Next, to determine what methodological decisions influence study findings, we compare positive versus mixed/null or negative findings across 14 potential moderators. Only study quality and outcome measure influence findings; experiments without control groups or randomized treatments reported more positive findings than expected. Experiments studying perceived restoration also reported more positive findings than expected—remarkably, 95% of such experiments reported simulated nature was indeed restorative. We discuss the possibility that these findings may indicate publication bias in favor of overreporting the salutory impacts of natural landscapes.

Technologies, like augmented reality (AR), have the ability to catch the children’s imagination and to promote their attention, as they can experiment artificial, safe and fascinating environments. Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) usually have difficulty to recognize facial expressions and to understand associated emotions. We propose to design and develop an innovative GameBook to assist children with ASD to recognize and acquire emotions by engaging their attention and motivation, increasing their competence on this handicap. The GameBook will contain a story that can be read by text or listen by audio. The story will describe some scenarios and real world situations which will conduct the children to become involved on fictional contents associated with emotions. The child will have to interact with these scenarios, by playing with one 3D AR avatar with different facial expressions and choosing the correct one to the right situation and environment described in any page of the GameBook. This GameBook will promote the interaction between the child/storyteller and his/her imagination as well as will help the child to identify the correct emotional face to the situation. The GameBook can be played on any mobile device, such as a tablet, a smartphone or a laptop, with either an external web camera or an inbuilt camera.","[{'authorId': '145811147', 'name': 'Jorge Brandão'}, {'authorId': '145064614', 'name': 'Pedro Cunha'}, {'authorId': '143783591', 'name': 'José Vasconcelos'}, {'authorId': '144714819', 'name': 'V.

We show that friend faces are recognized more quickly than unfamiliar faces in upright but not in inverted orientations, suggesting that configural processing underlies this particular advantage.

The data were collected in the 2018-2019 academic year using the interview technique and thematized using content analysis. The findings of the study suggested that teachers defined the classroom management as a skill to form effective learning environment. Lack of professional experience and knowledge, and academic shortcomings were found as poor skills. The ability of teachers to increase the effective and cognitive skills of their students was taken as evidence that teachers’ classroom management skills were strong.

In the context of mobile technologies that foster location-based linking, we make the case for the centrality of in situ real-time observational research on how emotional engagement unfolds and for the inclusion of bodily aspects of interaction. We propose that multimodal methods offer tools for observing emotion as a central facet of person–environment interaction and provide an example of these methods put into practice for a study of emotional engagement in mobile history learning. A multimodal analysis of video data from 16 pairs of 9- to 10-year-olds learning about the World War II history of their local Common is used to illustrate how students’ emotional engagement was supported by their use of mobile devices through multimodal layering and linking of stimuli, the creation of digital artifacts, and changes in pace. These findings are significant for understanding the role of digital augmentation in fostering emotional engagement in history learning, informing how digital augmentation can be designed to effectively foster emotional engagement for learning, and providing insight into the benefits of multimodality as an analytical approach for examining emotion through bodily interaction.","[{'authorId': '49147427', 'name': 'M.

0a311eaa99c20a1c88625cea0249f5430b895932,"Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.","[{'authorId': '145065504', 'name': 'D.

Three groups were analyzed: 1) 19 women had normal labors (uncomplicated course of labor, vaginal delivery, no unusual FHR tracings, and 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores of at least 7 and 9, respectively; 2) 15 women had presumed fetal distress (severe cord or late decelerations, bradycardia, or tachycardia; delivery by cesarean with both arterial and venous cord pH above 7.20); and 3) 20 women had acidotic fetuses (both venous and arterial cord pH less than 7.20). Hourly mean (± SD) ApEn values for the three groups were: acidotic fetuses, 0.924 ± 0.235,102 hours; normal fetuses, 1.051 ± 0.145, 97 hours; and nonacidotic “distressed” fetuses, 1.043 ± 0.147, 74 hours. The ApEn values for nonacidotic, presumed distressed fetuses were not significantly different from those of normal fetuses (P >.75). Acidotic fetuses had many more instances of ApEn hourly values less than 0.8 (28%, 29 of 102) than did the normal and the nonacidotic, presumed distressed fetuses combined (5%, nine of 171). The probability that ApEn was less than 0.8 was larger for acidotic fetuses than for the other groups (P <.00003), supporting the hypothesis that extremely regular FHR patterns imply a greater likelihood of acidosis. Significant hourly deviations in ApEn generally corresponded to drug administration or to physiologic changes such as cord compression and its relief. Thus ApEn, a major departure from variability statistics, appears to be able to detect subtle and possibly important differences in heart rate that are not visually apparent.","[{'authorId': '36205381', 'name': 'Steven M.

Correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the MAAS measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. An experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. Finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.","[{'authorId': '4715567', 'name': 'K.

However, given the everyday problems that patients struggle with, questions of ecological validity arise. For example, abstract tasks have little meaning to patients and decrease motivation to practice skills frequently. This study proposes a spatial memory task with high ecological validity that can be integrated into any virtual environment. Environments and target objects can be individually designed for each user to provide a relevant context and high motivation for patients with cognitive deficits. The task has been evaluated with both brain-injured and healthy individuals. 45 participants completed the virtual task and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Strong associations have been found with established tests of visual short-term memory. Due to high variability of test scores, no significant relationship with tests of spatial abilities has been established. High ecological validity of the spatial memory task caused five patients to show awareness of their cognitive deficits.

0b98cf62799ff0dd4900e937a7a5d2f8c56af110,"Abstract The capacity to manage emotion is based on the growth of self-regulatory capacities in the early years, but is also affected by situational demands, influences from other people, and the child's goals for regulating emotion in a particular setting. For most children growing up in supportive contexts, the growth of emotional regulation is associated with enhanced psychosocial well-being and socioemotional competence. But for children who are at risk for the development of psychopathology owing to environmental stresses or intrinsic vulnerability (or their interaction), emotional regulation often entails inherent trade-offs that make nonoptimal strategics of managing emotion expectable, perhaps inevitable, in a context of difficult environmental demands and conflicting emotional goals. This analysis discusses how emotional regulation in children at risk may simultaneously foster both resiliency and vulnerability by considering how emotion is managed when children (a) are living with a parent who is depressed, (b) witness or experience domestic violence, or (c) are temperamentally inhibited when encountering novel challenges. In each case, the child's efforts to manage emotion may simultaneously buffer against certain stresses while also enhancing the child's vulnerability to other risks and demands. This double-edged sword of emotional regulation in conditions of risk for children cautions against using “optimal” emotional regulation as an evaluative standard for such children or assuming that emotional regulation necessarily improves psychosocial well-being. It also suggests how the study of emotional regulation must consider the goals for regulating emotion and the contexts in which those goals are sought.","[{'authorId': '2246294034', 'name': 'Ross A.

In addition, there is an increasing number of studies on immersive virtual reality (iVR) full-body gesture-based standing exergames, but the suitability and usefulness of seated exergames remain largely unexplored. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the difference between playing a full-body gesture-based iVR standing exergame and seated exergame in terms of gameplay performance, intrinsic motivation, and motion sickness. Methods A total of 52 participants completed the experiment. The order of the game mode (standing and sitting) was counterbalanced. Gameplay performance was evaluated by action or gesture completion time and the number of missed gestures. Exertion was measured by the average heart rate (HR) percentage (AvgHR%), increased HR%, calories burned, and the Borg 6-20 questionnaire. Intrinsic motivation was assessed with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), whereas motion sickness was assessed via the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ). In addition, we measured the fear of falling using a 10-point Likert scale questionnaire. Results Players missed more gestures in the seated exergame than in the standing exergame, but the overall miss rate was low (2.3/120, 1.9%). The analysis yielded significantly higher AvgHR%, increased HR%, calories burned, and Borg 6-20 rating of perceived exertion values for the seated exergame (all P<.001). The seated exergame was rated significantly higher on peripheral sickness (P=.02) and sopite-related sickness (MSAQ) (P=.004) than the standing exergame. The score of the subscale “value/usefulness” from IMI was reported to be higher for the seated exergame than the standing exergame. There was no significant difference between the seated exergame and standing exergame in terms of intrinsic motivation (interest/enjoyment, P=.96; perceived competence, P=.26; pressure/tension, P=.42) and the fear of falling (P=.25). Conclusions Seated iVR full-body gesture-based exergames can be valuable complements to standing exergames. Seated exergames have the potential to lead to higher exertion, provide higher value to players, and be more applicable in small spaces compared with standing exergames. However, gestures for seated exergames need to be designed carefully to minimize motion sickness, and more time should be given to users to perform gestures in seated exergames compared with standing exergames.","[{'authorId': '9765913', 'name': 'Wenge Xu'}, {'authorId': '39935739', 'name': 'Hai-Ning Liang'}, {'authorId': '104243972', 'name': 'Qiuyu He'}, {'authorId': '113075935', 'name': 'Xiang Li'}, {'authorId': '1693385751', 'name': 'Kangyou Yu'}, {'authorId': '1692726362', 'name': 'Yuzheng Chen'}]",30.0,,93.0,Results and Guidelines From a Repeated-Measures Design Experiment Comparing Standing and Seated Full-Body Gesture-Based Immersive Virtual Reality Exergames: Within-Subjects Evaluation,2020.0

The objective of the present study was to investigate the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of depressed patients, which can be used to test the feasibility of identifying major depressive individuals from healthy controls. Multivariate pattern analysis was employed to classify 24 depressed patients from 29 demographically matched healthy volunteers. Permutation tests were used to assess classifier performance. The experimental results demonstrate that 94.3% (P < 0.0001) of subjects were correctly classified by leave-one-out cross-validation, including 100% identification of all patients. The majority of the most discriminating functional connections were located within or across the default mode network, affective network, visual cortical areas and cerebellum, thereby indicating that the disease-related resting-state network alterations may give rise to a portion of the complex of emotional and cognitive disturbances in major depression. Moreover, the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, which exhibit high discriminative power in classification, may play important roles in the pathophysiology of this disorder. The current study may shed new light on the pathological mechanism of major depression and suggests that whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging may provide potential effective biomarkers for its clinical diagnosis.","[{'authorId': '40092507', 'name': 'L.

To further investigate the role of the autonomic nervous system in RSA and to understand the complex links between respiratory activity and arterial pressure, we determined the transfer functions between respiration, heart rate (HR), and phasic, systolic, diastolic, and pulse arterial pressures in 14 healthy subjects during 6-min periods in which the respiratory rate was controlled in a predetermined but erratic fashion. Pharmacological autonomic blockade with atropine, propranolol, and both, in combination with changes in posture, was used to characterize the sympathetic and vagal contributions to these relationships, as well as to dissect the direct mechanical links between respiration and arterial pressure from the effects of the RSA on arterial pressure. We found that 1) the pure sympathetic (standing + atropine) HR response is characterized by markedly reduced magnitude at frequencies greater than 0.1 Hz and a phase delay, whereas pure vagal (supine + propranolol) modulation of HR is characterized by higher magnitude at all frequencies and no phase delay; 2) both the mechanical links between respiration and arterial pressure and the RSA contribute significantly to the effects of respiration on arterial pressure; 3) the RSA contribution to arterial pressure fluctuations is significant for vagal but not for sympathetic modulation of HR; 4) the mechanical effects of respiration on arterial pressure are related to the negative rate of change of instantaneous lung volume; 5) the mechanical effects have a higher magnitude during systole than during diastole; and 6) the mechanical effects are larger in teh standing than the supine position.

There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. Approach. We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. Main results. We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. Significance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.","[{'authorId': '2890785', 'name': 'F. Lotte'}, {'authorId': '1765001', 'name': 'L.

To determine the effect of immersive 3D cultural simulation on nursing students' empathy towards culturally and linguistically diverse patients.


BACKGROUND
Accelerated globalisation has seen a significant increase in cultural diversity in most regions of the world over the past forty years. Clinical encounters that do not acknowledge cultural factors contribute to adverse patient outcomes and health care inequities for culturally and linguistically diverse people. Cultural empathy is an antecedent to cultural competence. Thus, appropriate educational strategies are needed to enhance nursing students' cultural empathy and the capacity to deliver culturally competent care.


DESIGN
A one-group pretest, post-test design was used for this study. The simulation exposed students to an unfolding scene in a hospital ward of a developing county.


METHODS
A convenience sample of second-year undergraduate nursing students (n = 460) from a semi-metropolitan university in Australia were recruited for the study. Characteristics of the sample were summarised using descriptive statistics. T-tests were performed to analyse the differences between pre- and post simulation empathy scores using an eight item modified version of the Kiersma-Chen Empathy Scale.


RESULTS
Students' empathy towards culturally and linguistically diverse patients significantly improved after exposure to the 3D simulation experience. The mean scores for the Perspective Taking and Valuing Affective Empathy subscales also increased significantly postsimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
The immersive 3D simulation had a positive impact on nursing students' empathy levels in regards to culturally and linguistically diverse groups. Research with other cohorts and in other contexts is required to further explore the impact of this educational approach.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Immersive cultural simulation experiences offer opportunities to enhance the cultural empathy of nursing students. This may in turn have a positive impact on their cultural competence and consequently the quality of care they provide to culturally and linguistically diverse patients.","[{'authorId': '46472822', 'name': 'Naleya Everson'}, {'authorId': '1390157007', 'name': 'T.

This reflects the power of presence – seen as the feeling of being located in a perceived, external world – in developing and affecting psychological wellbeing. Until today Virtual reality Environments (VEs) have been incorporated into a variety of clinical and everyday settings to improve mental health. Nevertheless many areas in the health field can be still explored by using this innovative technology. One example is represented by stress management area, one of the leading mental health problems of western societies linked to several pathologies. Following this trend our proposal is to investigate with a non clinical sample the efficacy of a relaxing narrative through a virtual experience. In a controlled study we compared three different media: Immersive VR, DVD and Audio speaker, by using the same therapeutic narrative and protocol. A control group without treatment was also included in the study. The sample included 60 university students, randomly divided in four experimental conditions. Non parametric test and correlation were used to analyse self-reports and physiological parameters. Within groups analysis - in both VR and DVD conditions - showed a significant improvement of the emotional state and significative physiological changes. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that a relationship exists between the sense of presence and the outcome achieved by the mediated experience. However, the absence of significant differences from the analysis between groups suggests that the principal determinant of presence might be the content proposed within the mediated experience. Further reflections about sense of presence in relaxing virtual environments will be discussed.","[{'authorId': '103238720', 'name': 'D. Villani'}, {'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

Consistent with these revisions, we postulate two models of emotion dysregulation in PTSD in which fear is not the prevailing emotion but is only one of several components implicated in a dysregulated emotional system that also mediates problems regulating anger, guilt, shame, dissociation, and numbing. We discuss whether there is a relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems that may help further our understanding of PTSD and its underlying neurocircuitry. Two pathways describing the relationship between fear and other emotion regulation systems in PTSD are proposed. The first pathway describes emotion dysregulation as an outcome of fear conditioning through stress sensitization and kindling. The second pathway views emotion dysregulation as a distal vulnerability factor and hypothesizes a further exacerbation of fear and other emotion regulatory problems, including the development of PTSD after exposure to one or several traumatic event(s) later in life. Future research and treatment implications are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2725179', 'name': 'R. Lanius'}, {'authorId': '2063570', 'name': 'P. Frewen'}, {'authorId': '143978558', 'name': 'E.

The purpose of this paper is to examine virtual team effectiveness by taking a deeper look at the Virtual World Teams (VWTs) of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs).,The paper investigates the effects of leaders’ emotional intelligence and transformational leadership on virtual team effectiveness, including three sub-factors of team effectiveness: team performance, viability and team member satisfaction. In addition, the indirect effect of emotional intelligence on team effectiveness via transformational leadership was examined. In total, 500 MMOG players that belonged in virtual world teams participated in the study. Hypotheses were tested through a series of multiple linear regression analyses, and one-way ANOVA tests were used to explore the impact of gender on the key factors of team effectiveness.,The analysis revealed a significant predictive relationship between perceived leader emotional intelligence and virtual team effectiveness sub-factors, mediated by transformational leadership behavior. Further analysis revealed gender differences in players’ perceptions of their leader emotional intelligence, transformational leadership and virtual team effectiveness.,This paper adds to the literature by revealing important predictors of virtual team effectiveness. These findings suggest implications for research and practice in the fields of Human Resources (HR), Human Resource Development (HRD) and training programs for e-leaders. The results of the analysis based on gender differences also have theoretical and managerial implications.,The study provides evidence that transformational leadership mediates the relationship between leaders’ emotional intelligence and team effectiveness in a virtual team.","[{'authorId': '2255525', 'name': 'S.

They are mainly caused by the failures of the drivers to perceive the changes of the traffic lights or the unexpected conditions happening accidentally on the roads. In this paper, we devised a quantitative analysis for assessing driver's cognitive responses by investigating the neurobiological information underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments in a virtual-reality (VR) dynamic driving environment. The VR technique allows subjects to interact directly with the moving virtual environment instead of monotonic auditory and visual stimuli, thereby provides interactive and realistic tasks without the risk of operating on an actual machine. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate and extract noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A temporal filter is used to solve the time-alignment problem of ERP features and principle component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce feature dimensions. The dimension-reduced features are then input to a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic events, the accuracy can be reached 87% in average eight subjects in this visual-stimuli ERP experiment. It demonstrates the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that represent operators' cognitive states and responses to task events.","[{'authorId': '123260450', 'name': 'Chin-Teng Lin'}, {'authorId': '5586188', 'name': 'I.

In this case study, the use of VR as a distractor to alleviate pain and anxiety associated with an invasive medical procedure for a pediatric cancer patient was explored. An A-B-C-A design during four consecutive medical appointments in an outpatient oncology clinic compared no distraction (A), non-VR distraction on a computer screen (B), and VR distraction with a head set (C). Behavioral observations of distress by the researcher and reports of pain and anxiety by the patient, parent, and nurse were taken before and during the procedure. The child's pulse was monitored throughout the procedure. The findings from this case study suggest benefit from using VR distraction, as indicated by lower pain and anxiety ratings, reduced pulse, and fewer observed behavioral indices of distress.

Interventions to reduce the incidence of psychiatric disorder following psychological trauma may be classified into three categories. Primary prevention includes the selection, preparation and training of individuals likely to be exposed to potentially traumatizing events. Secondary prevention comprises a variety of brief psychological techniques immediately or shortly after traumatizing life events, the best known of which is Psychological Debriefing. Tertiary interventions comprise the treatment of established PTSD and others. Psychiatric morbidity was studied in 106 British soldiers returning from UN peace-keeping duties in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. All 106 soldiers received an Operational Stress Training Package prior to their deployment and a randomly selected group also received a post-operational PD. Very low rates of PTSD and other psychopathology were found overall and the Operational Stress Training Package may have contributed to this. Elevated CAGE scores suggestive of significant alcohol misuse were observed in both groups and chemical avoidance behaviours arising from this may have masked psychopathology. CAGE scores diminished significantly in the debriefed group by the end of the follow-up period suggesting that PD may have been of benefit despite the apparent absence of PTSD. This study also demonstrates that a high incidence of psychiatric morbidity is not an inevitable consequence of military conflict.","[{'authorId': '47228112', 'name': 'M.

This communication is constantly evolving towards the goal of making it as human and real as possible. One way of humanizing such interaction is to provide a framework that can recognize the emotions present in the communication or the emotions of the involved users in order to enrich user experience. For example, by providing insights to users for personal preferences and automated recommendations based on their emotional state. In this work, we propose a framework for emotion classification in English sentences where emotions are treated as generalized concepts extracted from the sentences. We start by generating an intermediate emotional data representation of a given input sentence based on its syntactic and semantic structure. We then generalize this representation using various ontologies such as Word Net and Concept Net, which results in an emotion seed that we call an emotion recognition rule (ERR). Finally, we use a suite of classifiers to compare the generated ERR with a set of reference ERRs extracted from a training set in a similar fashion. The used classifiers are k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with handcrafted similarity measure, Point Mutual Information (PMI), and PMI with Information Retrieval (PMI-IR). When applied on different datasets, the proposed approach significantly outperformed the existing state-of-the art machine learning and rule-based classifiers with an average F-Score of 84%.","[{'authorId': '49507383', 'name': 'Shadi Shaheen'}, {'authorId': '1402224224', 'name': 'W.

Yet, previous studies on human brain activity during navigation focus on stationary setups, neglecting vestibular and kinesthetic feedback. The aim of our work is to uncover the influence of those sensory modalities on cortical processing. We developed a fully immersive virtual reality setup combined with high-density mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Participants traversed one leg of a triangle, turned on the spot, continued along the second leg, and finally indicated the location of their starting position. Vestibular and kinesthetic information was provided either in combination, as isolated sources of information, or not at all within a 2 × 2 full factorial intra-subjects design. EEG data were processed by clustering independent components, and time-frequency spectrograms were calculated. In parietal, occipital, and temporal clusters, we detected alpha suppression during the turning movement, which is associated with a heightened demand of visuo-attentional processing and closely resembles results reported in previous stationary studies. This decrease is present in all conditions and therefore seems to generalize to more natural settings. Yet, in incongruent conditions, when different sensory modalities did not match, the decrease is significantly stronger. Additionally, in more anterior areas we found that providing only vestibular but no kinesthetic information results in alpha increase. These observations demonstrate that stationary experiments omit important aspects of sensory feedback. Therefore, it is important to develop more natural experimental settings in order to capture a more complete picture of neural correlates of spatial navigation.","[{'authorId': '46483677', 'name': 'Benedikt V.

This paper investigates the potential of physiological signals as reliable channels for emotion recognition. All essential stages of an automatic recognition system are discussed, from the recording of a physiological data set to a feature-based multiclass classification. In order to collect a physiological data set from multiple subjects over many weeks, we used a musical induction method that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states, without any deliberate laboratory setting. Four-channel biosensors were used to measure electromyogram, electrocardiogram, skin conductivity, and respiration changes. A wide range of physiological features from various analysis domains, including time/frequency, entropy, geometric analysis, subband spectra, multiscale entropy, etc., is proposed in order to find the best emotion-relevant features and to correlate them with emotional states. The best features extracted are specified in detail and their effectiveness is proven by classification results. Classification of four musical emotions (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, and positive/low arousal) is performed by using an extended linear discriminant analysis (pLDA). Furthermore, by exploiting a dichotomic property of the 2D emotion model, we develop a novel scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification (EMDC) and compare its performance with direct multiclass classification using the pLDA. An improved recognition accuracy of 95 percent and 70 percent for subject-dependent and subject-independent classification, respectively, is achieved by using the EMDC scheme.","[{'authorId': '11384820', 'name': 'Jonghwa Kim'}, {'authorId': '1742930', 'name': 'E.

Accurate timing is important for the interplay of neurons, neuronal circuitries, brain areas and human individuals. In the human brain, multiple temporal integration windows are hierarchically organized, with temporal scales ranging from microseconds to tens and hundreds of milliseconds for perceptual, motor and cognitive functions, and up to minutes, hours and even months for hormonal and mood changes. Accurate timing is impaired in several brain diseases. From the current repertoire of non-invasive brain imaging methods, only magnetoencephalography (MEG) and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) provide millisecond time-resolution; our focus in this paper is on MEG. Since the introduction of high-density whole-scalp MEG/EEG coverage in the 1990s, the instrumentation has not changed drastically; yet, novel data analyses are advancing the field rapidly by shifting the focus from the mere pinpointing of activity hotspots to seeking stimulus- or task-specific information and to characterizing functional networks. During the next decades, we can expect increased spatial resolution and accuracy of the time-resolved brain imaging and better understanding of brain function, especially its temporal constraints, with the development of novel instrumentation and finer-grained, physiologically inspired generative models of local and network activity. Merging both spatial and temporal information with increasing accuracy and carrying out recordings in naturalistic conditions, including social interaction, will bring much new information about human brain function.","[{'authorId': '143873866', 'name': 'R.

Immersive virtual reality (VR) distraction provides clinically effective pain relief and increases subjective reports of ""fun"" in medical settings of procedural pain. The goal of this study was to better describe the variable of ""fun"" associated with VR distraction analgesia using the circumplex model (pleasure/arousal) of affect.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seventy-four healthy volunteers (mean age, 29 years; 37 females) received a standardized, 18-minute, multimodal pain sequence (alternating thermal heat and electrical stimulation to distal extremities) while receiving immersive, interactive VR distraction. Subjects rated both their subjective pain intensity and fun using 0-10 Graphic Rating Scales, as well as the pleasantness of their emotional valence and their state of arousal on 9-point scales.


RESULTS
Compared with pain stimulation in the control (baseline, no VR) condition, immersive VR distraction significantly reduced subjective pain intensity (P < 0.001). During VR distraction, compared with those reporting negative affect, subjects reporting positive affect did so more frequently (41 percent versus 9 percent), as well as reporting both greater pain reduction (22 percent versus 1 percent) and fun scores (7.0 ± 1.9 versus 2.4 ± 1.4). Several factors-lower anxiety, greater fun, greater presence in the VR environment, and positive emotional valence-were associated with subjective analgesia during VR distraction.


CONCLUSIONS
Immersive VR distraction reduces subjective pain intensity induced by multimodal experimental nociception. Subjects who report less anxiety, more fun, more VR presence, and more positive emotional valence during VR distraction are more likely to report subjective pain reduction. These findings indicate VR distraction analgesia may be mediated through anxiolytic, attentional, and/or affective mechanisms.","[{'authorId': '3348169', 'name': 'S.

0f3768d7585a82bafffd8667feb9218efb80f544,"Virtual Reality (VR) has been touted as an effective empathy intervention, with its most ardent supporters claiming it is “the ultimate empathy machine.” We aimed to determine whether VR deserves this reputation, using a random-effects meta-analysis of all known studies that examined the effect of virtual reality experiences on users’ empathy (k = 43 studies, with 5,644 participants). The results indicated that many different kinds of VR experiences can increase empathy, however, there are important boundary conditions to this effect. Subgroup analyses revealed that VR improved emotional empathy, but not cognitive empathy. In other words, VR can arouse compassionate feelings but does not appear to encourage users to imagine other peoples’ perspectives. Further subgroup analyses revealed that VR was no more effective at increasing empathy than less technologically advanced empathy interventions such as reading about others and imagining their experiences. Finally, more immersive and interactive VR experiences were no more effective at arousing empathy than less expensive VR experiences such as cardboard headsets. Our results converge with existing research suggesting that different mechanisms underlie cognitive versus emotional empathy. It appears that emotional empathy can be aroused automatically when witnessing evocative stimuli in VR, but cognitive empathy may require more effortful engagement, such as using one’s own imagination to construct others’ experiences. Our results have important practical implications for nonprofits, policymakers, and practitioners who are considering using VR for prosocial purposes. In addition, we recommend that VR designers develop experiences that challenge people to engage in empathic effort.","[{'authorId': '27605295', 'name': 'Alison Jane Martingano'}, {'authorId': '2129017337', 'name': 'Fernanda Hererra'}, {'authorId': '1831886', 'name': 'S.

In this article, which is the second in a three‐part series, the authors discuss the role of exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP) and cognitive therapy (CT) in the treatment of adults with OCD. They first describe EX/RP and review the studies that have demonstrated that it is a very efficacious treatment for OCD, both alone and in combination with pharmacotherapy with SRIs. The limitations of treatment with EX/RP are also described. These include high rates of patient refusal and drop‐out, the continuing presence of some residual symptoms, the subsequent loss of treatment gains, possibly reduced effectiveness in certain clinical subtypes of OCD and in OCD accompanied by other comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder), and the shortage of therapists trained in EX/RP for OCD. Recent research to develop even more effective modifications of EX/RP therapy for OCD are also described. Finally, the authors discuss when to refer patients with OCD for EX/RP treatment. In the second half of the article, the authors describe CT for OCD and discuss how helpful it may be for OCD. They conclude that there is no convincing evidence that any particular set of cognitive procedures is as good or better than potent EX/RP, but they note problems in the research, especially in disentangling the two types of therapy, since EX/RP often involves a number of CT procedures, while CT often includes some interventions that are closely related to EX/RP. The authors describe recent efforts to refine the cognitive theory of OCD and to determine when and how to use CT in OCD. They also describe presentations of OCD for which it may be helpful to consider a referral for CT. The next and final article in this series will cover psychopharmacological treatment for OCD.

0f7bd82199cdba0b4624b03c530b8357c2c660f6,"Background Our body schema gives the subjective impression of being highly stable. However, a number of easily-evoked illusions illustrate its remarkable malleability. In the rubber-hand illusion, illusory ownership of a rubber-hand is evoked by synchronous visual and tactile stimulation on a visible rubber arm and on the hidden real arm. Ownership is concurrent with a proprioceptive illusion of displacement of the arm position towards the fake arm. We have previously shown that this illusion of ownership plus the proprioceptive displacement also occurs towards a virtual 3D projection of an arm when the appropriate synchronous visuotactile stimulation is provided. Our objective here was to explore whether these illusions (ownership and proprioceptive displacement) can be induced by only synchronous visuomotor stimulation, in the absence of tactile stimulation. Methodology/Principal Findings To achieve this we used a data-glove that uses sensors transmitting the positions of fingers to a virtually projected hand in the synchronous but not in the asynchronous condition. The illusion of ownership was measured by means of questionnaires. Questions related to ownership gave significantly larger values for the synchronous than for the asynchronous condition. Proprioceptive displacement provided an objective measure of the illusion and had a median value of 3.5 cm difference between the synchronous and asynchronous conditions. In addition, the correlation between the feeling of ownership of the virtual arm and the size of the drift was significant. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that synchrony between visual and proprioceptive information along with motor activity is able to induce an illusion of ownership over a virtual arm. This has implications regarding the brain mechanisms underlying body ownership as well as the use of virtual bodies in therapies and rehabilitation.","[{'authorId': '1384107200', 'name': 'Maria V.

The design was a cross-sectional survey and the setting was in 11 NHS Trusts. The participants were 35 stroke physiotherapists working in acute and rehabilitation settings who recorded the treatment of 132 patients in 644 treatment sessions using the Stroke Physiotherapy Intervention Recording Tool. Analysis was carried out by descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVAS and chi-squares which were used to describe content of interventions and effects of the aim of treatment. Results and conclusions. Physiotherapists' clinical practice focused on therapist-led interventions, which aimed to normalize muscle tone and promote normal movement patterns. The most frequent interventions were ‘preparation for treatment’ (n = 1969, 43%), ‘practising balance and walking activities’ (n = 1583, 34%) and ‘practising functional tasks’ (n = 703, 15%).

The introduction of a new therapeutic approach called interreality has brought us one step further towards e-health. If virtual worlds are considered as ‘closed’ experiences, separated from thoughts and emotions experienced by the patient in the real life, interreality, conversely, is an advanced technological tool whose main novelty is the creation of a hybrid, closed-loop, empowering experience bridging both the physical and virtual worlds.

That is, the person is seeing an image composed of a visualization of the real world, and a series of virtual elements that, at that same moment, are super-imposed on the real world. The most important aspect of AR is that the virtual elements supply to the person relevant and useful information that is not contained in the real world. AR has notable potential, and has already been used in diverse fields, such as medicine, the army, coaching, engineering, design, and robotics. Until now, AR has never been used in the scope of psychological treatment. Nevertheless, AR presents various advantages. Just like in the classical systems of virtual reality, it is possible to have total control over the virtual elements that are super-imposed on the real world, and how one interacts with those elements. AR could involve additional advantages; on one side it could be less expensive since it also uses the real world (this does not need to be modeled), and it could facilitate the feeling of presence (the sensation of being there), and reality judgment (the fact of judging the experience as real) of the person since the environment he or she is in, and what he or she is seeing is, in fact the ""reality."" In this paper, we present the data of the first case study in which AR has been used for the treatment of a specific phobia, cockroaches phobia.

However, there is a lack of unified models that integrate generation, user responses and interaction. 
 
This paper addresses this by revisiting existing Interactive Narrative paradigms, granting explicit status to users' disposition towards story characters as part of narrative generation as well as adding support for new forms of interaction. We demonstrate this with a novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) design, incorporating empathy for a main character derived from brain signals within filmic conceptions of narrative which drives generation using planning techniques. 
 
Results from an experimental study with a fully-implemented system demonstrate the effectiveness of a EEG neurofeedback-based approach, showing that subjects can successfully modulate empathic support of a character in a medical drama. MRI analysis also shows activations in associated regions of the brain during expression of support.","[{'authorId': '35199977', 'name': 'Stephen W. Gilroy'}, {'authorId': '144312529', 'name': 'J.

They then continuously rated their subjective emotional arousal while viewing a replay of their experience. The association between emotional arousal and parieto-occipital alpha power was tested and confirmed by (1) decomposing the continuous EEG signal while maximizing the comodulation between alpha power and arousal ratings and by (2) decoding periods of high and low arousal with discriminative common spatial patterns and a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network.

Affective neuroscience finds that chronic activation of the body’s emergency response system inhibits neurogenesis, disrupts neuronal plasticity, and is detrimental to physical and mental health. Patterns of faulty discrimination skills, for example, over-estimation of threat and danger and under-estimation of their coping capacity, fuel this over-arousal. Similarly, contributory patterns of reduced self-regulation skills are shown by “stuck” attention to and poor control of their exaggerated psychophysiological reactivity and somatization. This article considers the literature and focuses on cognitive hypnotherapy to enhance these under-developed capacities. A case illustration highlights various hypnotic phenomena and techniques, psychoeducation, and relaxation training that address the goals of interrupting these unproductive, interconnected patterns and fostering new patterns of more realistic and accurate discrimination capacities and sturdier psychophysiological self-regulation skills.","[{'authorId': '35907506', 'name': 'P.

The integration of social robots to support learners has already shown promise to benefit the learning process in this area. In this paper, we focus on the applicability of an adaptive robotic tutor in a university setting. To this end, we conducted a long-term field study implementing an adaptive robotic tutor to support students with exam preparation over three sessions during one semester. In a mixed design, we compared the effect of an adaptive tutor to a control condition across all learning sessions. With the aim to benefit not only motivation but also academic success and the learning experience in general, we draw from research in adaptive tutoring, social robots in education, as well as our own prior work in this field. Our results show that opting in for the robotic tutoring is beneficial for students. We found significant subjective knowledge gain and increases in intrinsic motivation regarding the content of the course in general. Finally, participation resulted in a significantly better exam grade compared to students not participating. However, the extended adaptivity of the robotic tutor in the experimental condition did not seem to enhance learning, as we found no significant differences compared to a non-adaptive version of the robot.","[{'authorId': '151110885', 'name': 'Melissa Donnermann'}, {'authorId': '11715171', 'name': 'Philipp Schaper'}, {'authorId': '2117313647', 'name': 'Birgit Lugrin'}]",7.0,,37.0,Social Robots in Applied Settings: A Long-Term Study on Adaptive Robotic Tutors in Higher Education,2022.0

However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and “meltdowns”). In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

We designed a new program called MYLO that utilizes the principles of Method of Levels (MOL) therapy - based upon Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). Aims: We tested the efficacy of MYLO, tested whether the psychological change mechanisms described by PCT mediated its efficacy, and evaluated effects of client expectancy. Method: Forty-eight student participants were randomly assigned to MYLO or a comparison program ELIZA. Participants discussed a problem they were currently experiencing with their assigned program and completed measures of distress, resolution and expectancy preintervention, postintervention and at 2-week follow-up. Results: MYLO and ELIZA were associated with reductions in distress, depression, anxiety and stress. MYLO was considered more helpful and led to greater problem resolution. The psychological change processes predicted higher ratings of MYLO's helpfulness and reductions in distress. Positive expectancies towards computer-based problem solving correlated with MYLO's perceived helpfulness and greater problem resolution, and this was partly mediated by the psychological change processes identified. Conclusions: The findings provide provisional support for the acceptability of the MYLO program in a non-clinical sample although its efficacy as an innovative computer-based aid to problem solving remains unclear. Nevertheless, the findings provide tentative early support for the mechanisms of psychological change identified within PCT and highlight the importance of client expectations on predicting engagement in computer-based self-help.","[{'authorId': '4167880', 'name': 'Hannah Gaffney'}, {'authorId': '2430001', 'name': 'W.

However, the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions, which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates. Further investigation needs to be conducted to understand how to better leverage the improvements in frame-level accuracy towards better word error rates.","[{'authorId': '1753223', 'name': 'Alex Graves'}, {'authorId': '3111912', 'name': 'N.

Neuropsychological evidence has given rise to alternative models on brain asymmetry in emotion, each with different implications concerning the biological basis of individual differences in affective responses. The present study tested these implications. Resting EEG and self-reported emotions after the presentation of film clips were collected on four occasions of measurement. Subjects with greater right-sided and smaller left-sided cortical activity reported greater intensities of felt emotions after the presentation of films irrespective of valence. This finding is in line with a recent formulation of the right-hemisphere hypothesis, which proposes that the right hemisphere may play an important role in the automatic generation of emotional responses, whereas the left hemisphere may be involved in the control and modulation of emotional reactions.","[{'authorId': '3469845', 'name': 'D.

We examined the possibility that maintenance cognitive behavior therapy (M-CBT) may improve the likelihood of sustained improvement and reduced relapse in a multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial of patients who met criteria for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.


METHOD
Participants were all patients (N = 379) who first began an open trial of acute-phase CBT. Patients completing and responding to acute-phase treatment were randomized to receive either 9 monthly sessions of M-CBT (n = 79) or assessment only (n = 78) and were then followed for an additional 12 months without treatment.


RESULTS
M-CBT produced significantly lower relapse rates (5.2%) and reduced work and social impairment compared to the assessment only condition (18.4%) at a 21-month follow-up. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models showed that residual symptoms of agoraphobia at the end of acute-phase treatment were independently predictive of time to relapse during 21-month follow-up (hazards ratio = 1.15, p < .01).


CONCLUSIONS
M-CBT aimed at reinforcing acute treatment gains to prevent relapse and offset disorder recurrence may improve long-term outcome for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia.","[{'authorId': '2247128925', 'name': 'Kamila S.

A convenient, although not comprehensive, presentation of required sample sizes is provided here. Effect-size indexes and conventional values for these are given for operationally defined small, medium, and large effects. The sample sizes necessary for .80 power to detect effects at these levels are tabled for eight standard statistical tests: (a) the difference between independent means, (b) the significance of a product-moment correlation, (c) the difference between independent rs, (d) the sign test, (e) the difference between independent proportions, (f) chi-square tests for goodness of fit and contingency tables, (g) one-way analysis of variance, and (h) the significance o f a multiple or multiple partial correlation. The preface to the first edition of my power handbook (Cohen, 1969) begins: During my first dozen years o f teaching and consulting o n applied statistics with behavioral scientists, 1 became increasingly impressed with the importance of statistical power analysis, an importance which was increased an order of magnitude by its neglect in our textbooks and curricula. The case for its importance is easily made: What behavioral scientist would view with equanimity the question of the probability that his investigation would lead to statistically significant results, i.e., its power? (p. vii) This neglect was obvious through casual observation and had been confirmed by a power review of the 1960 volume of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, which found the mean power to detect medium effect sizes to be .48 (Cohen, 1962). Thus, the chance of obtaining a significant result was about that of tossing a head with a fair coin. I attributed this disregard of power to the inaccessibility of a meager and mathematically difficult literature, beginning with its origin in the work of Neyman and Pearson (1928,1933). The power handbook was supposed to solve the problem. It required no more background than an introductory psychological statistics course that included significance testing. The exposition was verbal-intuitive and carried largely by many worked examples drawn from across the spectrum of behavioral science. In the ensuing two decades, the book has been through revised (1977) and second (1988) editions and has inspired dozens of power and effect-size surveys i n many areas of the social and life sciences (Cohen, 1988, pp. xi-xii).

The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of ""gaming"" has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so.","[{'authorId': '2745623', 'name': 'I.

and clinical practice and the explosion of information in the scientific literature,
research results must be synthesized. Meta-analyses are increasingly used
to address this problem, and they often evaluate observational studies. A
workshop was held in Atlanta, Ga, in April 1997, to examine the reporting
of meta-analyses of observational studies and to make recommendations to aid
authors, reviewers, editors, and readers.ParticipantsTwenty-seven participants were selected by a steering committee, based
on expertise in clinical practice, trials, statistics, epidemiology, social
sciences, and biomedical editing. Deliberations of the workshop were open
to other interested scientists. Funding for this activity was provided by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.EvidenceWe conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the
conduct and reporting of meta-analyses in observational studies using MEDLINE,
Educational Research Information Center (ERIC), PsycLIT, and the Current Index
to Statistics. We also examined reference lists of the 32 studies retrieved
and contacted experts in the field. Participants were assigned to small-group
discussions on the subjects of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity,
study categorization, and statistical methods.Consensus ProcessFrom the material presented at the workshop, the authors developed a
checklist summarizing recommendations for reporting meta-analyses of observational
studies. The checklist and supporting evidence were circulated to all conference
attendees and additional experts. All suggestions for revisions were addressed.ConclusionsThe proposed checklist contains specifications for reporting of meta-analyses
of observational studies in epidemiology, including background, search strategy,
methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Use of the checklist should
improve the usefulness of meta-analyses for authors, reviewers, editors, readers,
and decision makers. An evaluation plan is suggested and research areas are
explored.","[{'authorId': '2226901697', 'name': 'PhD MSc Donna F. Stroup'}, {'authorId': '2226911905', 'name': 'ScD Jesse A. Berlin'}, {'authorId': '2226908696', 'name': 'PhD Sally C.

1335ebdb34a8d4a8c1ca7135f345dcb17b115173,"The aim of this article is to define a term that has been widely used by both researchers and practitioners in the field since at least 1924 (Miller, 1924), but has never been included in any official nomenclature: emotional disorder. Our reasons for doing so are twofold. First, the literature on emotion and emotion regulation has been plagued by widespread variability in the terminology used to refer to emotion‐related constructs and processes (Gross, 2015; Gross, Sheppes, & Urry, 2011). For example, terms like affect, emotion, and mood are often used interchangeably or in the absence of any definition. This lack of conceptual clarity over key terms continues to impede scholarly efforts to consolidate and integrate existing research findings. We will demonstrate that the frequent use of the term emotional disorder, in the absence of explicit operationalization, has only contributed to an illusory consensus whereby the same term is being used with different meanings. Even without a clear definition, the term emotional disorder continues to feature prominently in contemporary literature; Google Scholar indexed over 1,300 publications for the year 2017 with emotional disorder in the article. Given that use of the term emotional disorder is a popular umbrella term and is likely to persist, there is considerable advantage to leveraging its use. Second, and more importantly, by presenting a definition for emotional disorder that connects putative mechanisms to clinical syndromes, we are also proposing a heuristic for grouping disorders together that transcends traditional diagnostic categories by reclustering disorders into larger groups Received: 17 July 2018 | Revised: 10 December 2018 | Accepted: 10 January 2019 DOI: 10.1111/cpsp.12278","[{'authorId': '4458881', 'name': 'J.

Although there has been a considerable amount of research on automatic emotion recognition in adults, emotion recognition in children has been understudied. This problem is more challenging as children tend to fidget and move around more than adults, leading to more self-occlusions and non-frontal head poses. Also, the lack of publicly available datasets for children with annotated emotion labels leads most researchers to focus on adults. In this paper, we introduce a newly collected multimodal emotion dataset of children between the ages of four and fourteen years old. The dataset contains 1102 audio-visual clips annotated for 17 different emotional states: six basic emotions, neutral, valence and nine complex emotions including curiosity, uncertainty and frustration. Our experiments compare unimodal and multimodal emotion recognition baseline models to enable future research on this topic.

The possibility that delusions of influence could be related to abnormal recognition of one's own actions was investigated in persons with schizophrenia.


METHOD
Schizophrenic patients with (N=6) and without (N=18) delusions of influence were compared with normal subjects (N=29) on an action recognition task. The image of a virtual right hand holding a joystick was presented to the subjects through a mirror so that the image was superimposed on their real hand holding a real joystick. Subjects executed discrete movements in different directions. Angular biases and temporal delays were randomly introduced in some trials, such that the movement of the virtual hand departed from the movement executed by the subjects. After each trial, subjects were asked whether the movement they saw was their own.


RESULTS
Compared with normal subjects, both patient groups made significantly more recognition errors in trials with temporal delays. In trials with angular biases, the error rate of patients with delusions of influence significantly differed from that of comparison subjects and from that of patients without delusions of influence.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings support the hypothesis that delusions of influence are associated with a quantifiable difficulty in correct self-attribution of actions. This difficulty may be related to a specific impairment of a neural action attribution system.","[{'authorId': '46434985', 'name': 'N. Franck'}, {'authorId': '3595346', 'name': 'C.

Embodying sensory-rich experiences of animals in IVEs led to greater feeling of embodiment, perception of being present in the virtual world, and interconnection between the self and nature compared to video. Heightened interconnection with nature elicited greater perceptions of imminence of the environmental risk and involvement with nature, which persisted for 1 week.

These two types of disgust reaction are presumed to be connected by a common evolutionary function of avoiding either food- or blood-borne contaminants. However, reactions to bloody injuries are typically conflated with reactions to the potential pain being experienced by the victim. This may explain why the two forms of ""disgust"", although similarly communicated (through self-report and facial expressions), evince different patterns of physiological reactivity. Therefore, we tested whether the communicative similarities and physiological dissimilarities would hold when markers of potential contamination in the latter category are removed, leaving only painful injuries that lack blood or explicit body-envelope violations. Participants viewed films that depicted imagery associated with (a) core disgust, (b) painful injuries, or (c) neutral scenes while we measured facial, cardiovascular, and gastric reactivity. Whereas communicative measures (self-report and facial muscles) suggested that participants experienced increased disgust for core disgust and painful injuries, peripheral physiology dissociated the two: core disgust decreased normal gastric activity and painful-injury disgust decelerated heart rate and increased heart rate variability. These findings suggest that expressions of disgust toward bodily injuries may reflect a fundamentally different affective response than those evoked by core disgust and that this (cardiovascularly mediated) response may in fact be more closely tied to pain perceptions (or empathy) rather than contaminant-laden stimuli.","[{'authorId': '2160770', 'name': 'A.

But, does this presence influence psychological outcomes of reading news, such as memory for story content, perceptions of credibility, and empathy felt toward story characters? We propose that two key technological affordances of VR (modality and interactivity) are responsible for triggering three presence-related cognitive heuristics (being-there, interaction, and realism), which influence news readers' memory and their perceptions of credibility, empathy, and story-sharing intentions. We report a 3 (storytelling medium: VR vs. 360°-video vs. Text) × 2 (story: ""The displaced"" and ""The click effect"") mixed-factorial experiment, in which participants (N = 129) experienced two New York Times stories (that differed in their emotional intensity) using one of the three mediums (VR, 360°-video, Text). Participants who experienced the stories using VR and 360°-video outperformed those who read the same stories using text with pictures, not only on such presence-related outcomes as being-there, interaction, and realism, but also on perceived source credibility, story-sharing intention, and feelings of empathy. Moreover, we found that senses of being-there, interaction, and realism mediated the relationship between storytelling medium and reader perceptions of credibility, story recall, and story-sharing intention. These findings have theoretical implications for the psychology of virtual reality, and practical applications for immersive journalism in particular and interactive media in general.","[{'authorId': '153638564', 'name': 'S.

Imagination seems not to be a long-lasting procedure to elicit presence. However, VR helps users to stay there as time goes by.

The clinical evaluation of ASD requires its consideration as a continuum of deficits, and there is a need to identify biologically significant parameters (biomarkers) that have the power to automatically characterize each individual at different stages of neurological development. The emerging field of computational psychiatry (CP) attempts to meet the needs of precision diagnosis by developing powerful computational and mathematical techniques. A growing scientific activity proposes the use of implicit measures based on biosignals for the classification of ASD. Virtual reality (VR) technologies have demonstrated potential for ASD interventions, but most of the work has used virtual reality for the learning / objective of interventions. Very few studies have used biological signals for recording and detailed analysis of behavioral responses that can be used to monitor or produce changes over time. In this paper the concept of behavioral biomarkers based on VR or VRBB is introduced. VRBB will allow the classification of ASD using a paradigm of computational psychiatry based on implicit brain processes measured through psychophysiological signals and the behavior of subjects exposed to complex replicas of social conditions using virtual reality interfaces.","[{'authorId': '2065592222', 'name': 'M.

In this perspective, the use of virtual reality showed huge potential in the assessment of executive functions; however, unfortunately, to date, no study on the assessment of these patients took advantage of the use of virtual environments. One of the main problems faced within assessment protocols is the use of a limited number of variables and tools when tailoring a personalized program. The main aim of this study was to provide a heuristic decision tree for the future development of tailored assessment protocols. To this purpose, we conducted a study that involved 58 participants (29 OCD patients and 29 controls) to collect both classic neuropsychological data and precise data based on a validated protocol in virtual reality for the assessment of executive functions, namely, the VMET (virtual multiple errands test). In order to provide clear indications for working on executive functions with these patients, we carried out a cross-validation based on three learning algorithms and computationally defined two decision trees. We found that, by using three neuropsychological tests and two VMET scores, it was possible to discriminate OCD patients from controls, opening a novel scenario for future assessment protocols based on virtual reality and computational techniques.","[{'authorId': '3346433', 'name': 'E.

The extant literature has focused on associations between negative emotional eating and disordered eating to the exclusion of positive emotional eating. Emotion regulation may help explain relationships between emotional eating and disordered eating. Emotion regulation difficulties was examined as a moderator of relationships between negative and positive emotional eating and disordered eating including dietary restraint, eating, weight, and shape concerns, and global scores of disordered eating, a general index of disordered eating. A cross-sectional study was employed using a university student population in the United States. Participants completed surveys assessing negative (Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire; Emotional Appetite Questionnaire) and positive (Emotional Appetite Questionnaire) emotional eating, emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale), and disordered eating (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire). Moderation analyses were calculated with emotion regulation difficulties as the moderator of relationships between negative and positive emotional eating and disordered eating. Across two separate measures of negative emotional eating, higher negative emotional eating was associated with higher weight concerns and global scores of disordered eating when emotion regulation difficulties was average and increased (+1 SD). Higher positive emotional eating was associated with lower dietary restraint and global scores of disordered eating when emotion regulation difficulties was decreased (-1 SD). Emotion regulation difficulties strengthened relationships between negative, not positive, emotional eating and disordered eating. Research and clinical implications for the contribution of emotional eating and emotion regulation on disordered eating are discussed.","[{'authorId': '143810130', 'name': 'Wesley R.

An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.","[{'authorId': '2742204', 'name': 'B.

The VR literature includes definitions rooted in behavioral response, signal detection theory, and philosophy, but has generally ignored the emotional aspects of experience. The purpose of this paper is to reexamine the concept of presence in terms of people's emotional engagement with reality and their environment. Emotions are an essential part of how people experience the world. Any theory of presence must take emotional factors into account. This thesis has implications about how research should be conducted to further our understanding of presence. Validated psychological techniques for assessing emotions by subjective report, behavioral observations, and facial analysis can all be applied to increase our understanding of virtual presence. Further understanding of the interaction between presence and emotional state will improve our understanding of the construct of presence as well as better inform us about how virtual environments can be applied in creating emotional effects or treating emotional disorders.","[{'authorId': '40091679', 'name': 'Milton P.

The retrospective and subjective nature of these methods leads to recall and interviewer biases. Therefore, there is a clear need for more objective and standardized assessment methods to support the diagnostic process. The introduction of virtual reality (VR) creates the possibility to simultaneously provoke and measure psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, VR could contribute to the objectivity and reliability in the assessment of psychiatric disorders. Objective In this literature review, we will evaluate the assessment of psychiatric disorders by means of VR environments. First, we investigate if these VR environments are capable of simultaneously provoking and measuring psychiatric symptoms. Next, we compare these measures with traditional diagnostic measures. Methods We performed a systematic search using PubMed, Embase, and Psycinfo; references of selected articles were checked for eligibility. We identified studies from 1990 to 2016 on VR used in the assessment of psychiatric disorders. Studies were excluded if VR was used for therapeutic purposes, if a different technique was used, or in case of limitation to a non-clinical sample. Results A total of 39 studies were included for further analysis. The disorders most frequently studied included schizophrenia (n = 15), developmental disorders (n = 12), eating disorders (n = 3), and anxiety disorders (n = 6). In attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the most comprehensive measurement was used including several key symptoms of the disorder. Most of the studies, however, concerned the use of VR to assess a single aspect of a psychiatric disorder. Discussion In general, nearly all VR environments studied were able to simultaneously provoke and measure psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, in 14 studies, significant correlations were found between VR measures and traditional diagnostic measures. Relatively small clinical sample sizes were used, impeding definite conclusions. Based on this review, the innovative technique of VR shows potential to contribute to objectivity and reliability in the psychiatric diagnostic process.","[{'authorId': '49225154', 'name': 'M.

It first makes the case that interactivity is an attribute of the technology and not that of the user. It exposes the tautology of studying the effects of perceived interactivity and calls for the consideration of ontological aspects that constitute interactivity while specifying its social and psychological effects. Theoretical explorations may be categorized in terms of three classes of outcome measures—behavioral, attitudinal, and cognitive—as we investigate the role played by interactivity in initiating action, changing attitudes, and altering the nature of information processing.

Up to now several studies have presented promising results in using the power and convenience of the Internet for clinical care. While multiple contributions focus on the potential and the advantages of therapies delivered through the Internet, mental health practitioners may take into account new technological opportunities to improve their practice. Mobile phone diffusion is expanding worldwide at breath-taking speed. In fewer than 20 years, mobile phones have gone from being rare and expensive pieces of equipment used primarily by the business elite, to a pervasive low-cost personal item. In many countries, mobile phones now outnumber land-line telephones, with most adults and many children now owning mobile phones. With high levels of mobile telephone penetration, a mobile culture has evolved, where the phone becomes a key social and cultural tool. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potentialities that mobile phones may offer in clinical care. The paper will investigate in which areas of clinical interventions mobile phones have already been successfully applied. Moreover, the paper will discuss these opportunities by presenting the results of two different studies based on the use of the mobile phone for anxiety management.","[{'authorId': '3234117', 'name': 'A.

Objective This study examined (1) whether older adults’ health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others’ homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or “other” racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults’ learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users. Computer/Internet training for older adults and computer/Internet use for various purposes need to consider the significant role their social capital can play.","[{'authorId': '3590083', 'name': 'N.

Perceptions of partners' emotions as well as partners' actual emotions were assessed multiple times in couples' conflict discussions (Study 1) and daily during a 3-week period in 2 independent samples (Study 2). Using partners' reports of their own emotional experiences as the accuracy benchmark, we simultaneously tested whether attachment insecurity was associated with the degree to which individuals (a) accurately detected shifts in their partners' negative emotions (tracking accuracy), and (b) perceived their partners were feeling more negative relationship-related emotions than they actually experienced (directional bias). Highly avoidant perceivers were equally accurate at tracking their partners' changing emotions compared to less avoidant individuals (tracking accuracy), but they overestimated the intensity of their partners' negative emotions to a greater extent than less avoidant individuals (directional bias). In addition, more negative perceptions of partners' emotions triggered more hostile and defensive behavior in highly avoidant perceivers both during conflict discussions (Study 1) and in daily life (Study 2). In contrast, attachment anxiety was not associated with tracking accuracy, directional bias, or hostile reactions to perceptions of their partners' negative emotions. These findings demonstrate the importance of assessing biased perceptions in actual relationship interactions and reveal that biased perceptions play an important role in activating the defenses of avoidantly attached people.","[{'authorId': '5342380', 'name': 'N.

Anxiety among health science students is a potential problem that may diminish their performance during OSCEs. This investigation aimed to fill the gap in the literature regarding the effectiveness of VR to reduce anxiety in OT students. Objective This investigation aimed to uncover the effectiveness of immersive VR in reducing state anxiety in OT students who were preparing for OSCEs. Methods A prospective, experimental, nonrandomized controlled trial compared levels of state anxiety, test anxiety, and academic self-efficacy in two groups of first-year OT students; these levels were measured at four different time points by self-reported psychometric scales, analyzed with a mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). Members of Phase 1 (NoVR) were not exposed to the VR simulation and acted as a control group for members of Phase 2 (YesVR), who were exposed to the VR simulation. VR simulation featured a virtual clinic and a standardized patient who students could interview in natural language. Measures of student study strategies and previous experience with VR were also recorded. Results A total of 49 participants—29 in the NoVR group and 20 in the YesVR group—showed that state anxiety had a rise-then-fall trend, peaking at the time point just before the OSCE. At that point, the YesVR students showed significantly less state anxiety than did the NoVR students (t46.19=2.34, P=.02, Cohen d=0.65, ηp2=0.105). The mean difference was 6.78 units (95% CI 0.96-12.61). In similar trends for both groups, student test anxiety remained relatively static across the time points, while academic self-efficacy continually increased. A moderate positive correlation was found for total time spent studying and peak state anxiety (NoVR r=.46, n=28, P=.01; YesVR r=.52, n=19, P=.02). Conclusions This investigation shows evidence of immersive VR’s capability to reduce state anxiety in OT students preparing for clinical practical exams. Immersive VR simulation, used for the reduction of anxiety in health science students, can potentially lead to a future of positive mental health change from the virtual to the real world.","[{'authorId': '1392936787', 'name': 'B.

17e5f11f32f9de8263ea3fed72f677de0bd9ebed,To facilitate a multidimensional approach to empathy the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) includes 4 subscales: Perspective-Taking (PT) Fantasy (FS) Empathic Concern (EC) and Personal Distress (PD). The aim of the present study was to establish the convergent and discriminant validity of these 4 subscales. Hypothesized relationships among the IRI subscales between the subscales and measures of other psychological constructs (social functioning self-esteem emotionality and sensitivity to others) and between the subscales and extant empathy measures were examined. Study subjects included 677 male and 667 female students enrolled in undergraduate psychology classes at the University of Texas. The IRI scales not only exhibited the predicted relationships among themselves but also were related in the expected manner to other measures. Higher PT scores were consistently associated with better social functioning and higher self-esteem; in contrast Fantasy scores were unrelated to these 2 characteristics. High EC scores were positively associated with shyness and anxiety but negatively linked to egotism. The most substantial relationships in the study involved the PD scale. PD scores were strongly linked with low self-esteem and poor interpersonal functioning as well as a constellation of vulnerability uncertainty and fearfulness. These findings support a multidimensional approach to empathy by providing evidence that the 4 qualities tapped by the IRI are indeed separate constructs each related in specific ways to other psychological measures.,"[{'authorId': '47994338', 'name': 'Mark H.

This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent ""High Throughput"" methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.","[{'authorId': '32837403', 'name': 'J.

There is limited information regarding the effects of interactive virtual reality (VR) games on psychological and physical well-being among adults with physical disabilities. We aimed to examine the impact of VR games on psychological well-being, upper limb motor function and reaction time in adults with physical disabilities.


METHODS
Fifteen participants completed the intervention using Wii VR games in this pilot study. Depressive, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) and Capabilities of Upper Extremity (CUE) questionnaires were used to measure psychological well-being and upper limb motor function respectively. Upper limb reaction time was measured using reaction time test.


RESULTS
Results showed that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in DASS questionnaire and average reaction time score after intervention.


CONCLUSION
There is a potential for using interactive VR games as an exercise tool to improve psychological wellbeing and upper limb reaction time among adults with disabilities.","[{'authorId': '2107815173', 'name': 'D.

The DSS integrates different biosensor data (ECG, breathing rate, EEG) and behavioral data (body gestures correlated with stress), following a training process in which self-rated and clinical-rated stress levels are used as ground truth.

A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to correctly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper, we propose and implement an effective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT system to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of its corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary. Our experiments on the WMT’14 English to French translation task show that this method provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique. With 37.5 BLEU points, our NMT system is the first to surpass the best result achieved on a WMT’14 contest task.","[{'authorId': '1821711', 'name': 'Thang Luong'}, {'authorId': '1701686', 'name': 'Ilya Sutskever'}, {'authorId': '2827616', 'name': 'Quoc V.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogeneous condition, in which subtypes have been proposed. Previous studies suggested that gender plays a relevant role in OCD phenotypic expression. This study aimed to review the literature on gender differences in clinical, genetic or familial aspects of OCD.


METHOD
A conventional review was conducted, including all papers that investigated demographic, clinical, and genetic aspects of OCD according to gender. The search was based on data available in Medline and PsycINFO databases in the last 20 years, using as keywords: obsessive-compulsive disorder; and: gender, sex, male, female, demographic characteristics, clinical features, clinical characteristics, genetic, genes, genetics gender OCD, genes OCD, genes OCD males, genes OCD females.


RESULTS
Sixty three of 487 phenotypical and genetics studies were selected. Most studies indicate that male patients are more likely than females to be single, present early onset of symptoms and chronic course of the disorder, greater social impairment, more sexual-religious and aggressive symptoms, and greater comorbidity with tic and substance use disorders. Female patients present more contamination/cleaning symptoms and greater comorbidity with eating and impulse-control disorders. Genetic and family studies are inconclusive, but suggest that gender may play a role in the disease expression.


CONCLUSIONS
Gender is a relevant factor that should be taken into account when evaluating OCD patients. More studies are necessary to determine whether in fact it defines a homogeneous and particular group in OCD.","[{'authorId': '37305091', 'name': 'M.

Parent-rated levels of emotional lability served as a marker for self-regulation of emotion. Results: Nearly half of the children affected by AD/HD displayed significantly elevated levels of emotional lability versus 15% of those without this disorder. Children with AD/HD also displayed significantly higher rates of functional impairment, comorbidity, and treatment service utilization. Emotional lability partially mediated the association between AD/HD status and these outcomes.

Previous studies investigating the effects of top-down factors on stimulus encoding revealed similar modulation of late ERPs and alpha-band desynchronization (α-ERD) by relevant target stimuli. Focusing on the bottom-up effects of emotional content and picture size, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship of the late positive potential (LPP) and α-ERD during the viewing of emotional pictures. Results showed similar affective modulation by picture arousal of the LPP and α-ERD. Moreover, picture size reduction diminished overall magnitude of both responses, but did not dampen affective modulation of either response. These results suggest that, during affective picture viewing, these two brain responses similarly reflect the engagement of motivational systems in order to facilitate perception.","[{'authorId': '118209321', 'name': 'Andrea De Cesarei'}, {'authorId': '3355595', 'name': 'M.

Starting from a three-way classification of construals of the world––events, the attribution of responsibility for events, and objects––the authors propose a systematic account of emotion differentiation. Rejecting the oft-favored features of bodily feelings, emotion-related behaviors, and facial expressions as too intensity-dependent and insufficiently diagnostic, they provide a detailed analysis of emotion differentiation in terms of the cognitive underpinnings of emotion types. Using numerous examples, they explain how different variables influence emotion intensity, and show how emotions can be formalized for computational purposes. Now with a contributed chapter describing the OCC model's influence, this book will interest a wide audience in cognitive, clinical, and social psychology, as well as in artificial intelligence and affective computing, and other cognitive science disciplines.","[{'authorId': '1802934', 'name': 'A.

However, studies assessing physiological reactions to social rejection are rare and results of these studies were found to be ambiguous. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. In addition, results revealed gender-specific response patterns suggesting that sample characteristics such as differences in gender may account for ambiguous findings of physiological reactions to social rejection.","[{'authorId': '4973279', 'name': 'Benjamin Iffland'}, {'authorId': '6999691', 'name': 'L.

In that time planning has emerged as the dominant technology and has featured in a number of prototype systems. Nevertheless key issues remain, such as how best to control the shape of the narrative that is generated (e.g., by using narrative control knowledge, i.e., knowledge about narrative features that enhance user experience) and also how best to provide support for real-time interactive performance in order to scale up to more realistic sized systems. Recent progress in planning technology has opened up new avenues for IS and we have developed a novel approach to narrative generation that builds on this. Our approach is to specify narrative control knowledge for a given story world using state trajectory constraints and then to treat these state constraints as landmarks and to use them to decompose narrative generation in order to address scalability issues and the goal of real-time performance in larger story domains. This approach to narrative generation is fully implemented in an interactive narrative based on the “Merchant of Venice.” The contribution of the work lies both in our novel use of state constraints to specify narrative control knowledge for interactive storytelling and also our development of an approach to narrative generation that exploits such constraints. In the article we show how the use of state constraints can provide a unified perspective on important problems faced in IS.","[{'authorId': '144312529', 'name': 'J.

Among these, an emerging approach is the use of virtual reality (VR) within exposure-based protocols for anxiety disorders, and in particular posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no systematically tested VR protocols are available for the management of psychological stress. Objective Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, for the management and prevention of psychological stress. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and the real world achieved through experiential virtual scenarios (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and improve self-efficacy) with real-time monitoring and support (identifying critical situations and assessing clinical change) using advanced technologies (virtual worlds, wearable biosensors, and smartphones). Methods The study was designed as a block randomized controlled trial involving 121 participants recruited from two different worker populations—teachers and nurses—that are highly exposed to psychological stress. Participants were a sample of teachers recruited in Milan (Block 1: n=61) and a sample of nurses recruited in Messina, Italy (Block 2: n=60). Participants within each block were randomly assigned to the (1) Experimental Group (EG): n=40; B1=20, B2=20, which received a 5-week treatment based on the Interreality paradigm; (2) Control Group (CG): n=42; B1=22, B2=20, which received a 5-week traditional stress management training based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and (3) the Wait-List group (WL): n=39, B1=19, B2=20, which was reassessed and compared with the two other groups 5 weeks after the initial evaluation. Results Although both treatments were able to significantly reduce perceived stress better than WL, only EG participants reported a significant reduction (EG=12% vs CG=0.5%) in chronic “trait” anxiety. A similar pattern was found for coping skills: both treatments were able to significantly increase most coping skills, but only EG participants reported a significant increase (EG=14% vs CG=0.3%) in the Emotional Support skill. Conclusions Our findings provide initial evidence that the Interreality protocol yields better outcomes than the traditionally accepted gold standard for psychological stress treatment: CBT. Consequently, these findings constitute a sound foundation and rationale for the importance of continuing future research in technology-enhanced protocols for psychological stress management.

The design and management of restorative environments can be aided with an instrument for measuring qualities of restorative person-environment transactions. This paper reports a study carried out to further develop such a measure, the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS). Initial PRS development studies raised questions about item characteristics and a potentially related lack of correspondence between PRS indicators and the constructs set out in attention restoration theory, the theoretical basis for the PRS. The study takes up scale development and validity issues raised in the previous studies by including new items, revising previously used items, and applying confirmatory factor analysis to test different models relating PRS indicators to theoretical constructs. Data used in the primary analyses were evaluations from 313 university undergraduates of a non-spectacular freshwater marsh, an environment about which people could be expected to have widely diverging views with respect to restorative qualities. The results point to the suitability of a 4-factor model that is consistent with attention restoration theory. Restorative environments enable the renewal of cognitive resources needed for effective functioning. Conceivably, any environment can aid this process for someone at sometime, though a moment’s reflection tells us that some environments are much more likely than others to be sources of restorative experiences. Indeed, some environments are stereotyped through reference to their high restorative potential. For some, the stereotypical restorative environment is the home, the place one retreats to at the end of a long work day. For others, it is a campsite beside a lake in the mountains, a place where one is far away from the traffic, noise, and crowds of the city. Yet such places are not universally regarded as places for restoration. For some, the residence is just another workplace or the setting for tense interpersonal relations, and the lakeside campsite is associated with coldness, biting insects, bad food, and poor sleep. Even for those who regularly seek them out for restoration, the restorativeness of such places may well diminish over periods of time spent in them; after two weeks in the mountains, the city may regain some appeal. So it is: The restorative potential seen in a place varies from one person to another, and over time for any one person. No one environment, then, is restorative for all people at all times. In fact, no one environment can be restorative for any one person all of the time.

Irrespective of the experimental setting, EEG recordings are contaminated with noise that has to be removed before the data can be functionally interpreted. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a commonly used tool to remove artifacts such as eye movement, muscle activity, and external noise from the data and to analyze activity on the level of EEG effective brain sources. While the effectiveness of filtering the data as one key preprocessing step to improve the decomposition has been investigated previously, no study thus far compared the different requirements of mobile and stationary experiments regarding the preprocessing for ICA decomposition. We thus evaluated how movement in EEG experiments, the number of channels, and the high-pass filter cutoff during preprocessing influence the ICA decomposition. We found that for commonly used settings (stationary experiment, 64 channels, 0.5 Hz filter), the ICA results are acceptable. However, high-pass filters of up to 2 Hz cutoff frequency should be used in mobile experiments, and more channels require a higher filter to reach an optimal decomposition. Fewer brain ICs were found in mobile experiments, but cleaning the data with ICA proved to be important and functional even with 16 channels. Based on the results, we provide guidelines for different experimental settings that improve the ICA decomposition.","[{'authorId': '9461914', 'name': 'Marius Klug'}, {'authorId': '3128704', 'name': 'K.

The sample was randomly assigned into four conditions: the Vidnar group experienced the mobile narrative on a mobile phone during their daily train trip; the Nonar group experienced only video content proposed on a mobile phone; the MP3 group experienced only the audio content proposed on an MP3 player; and the Control group provided a no-intervention condition. The study measured participants' emotional state (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] State questionnaire), trait (STAI Trait questionnaire, Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale), and sense of presence (Slater-Usoh-Steed Questionnaire [UCL-SUS] and the International Test Commission-Sense of Presence Inventory [ITC-SOPI]) before and after the experience. The main results showed a significant decrease in anxiety level (p < 0.05, assessed by STAI State questionnaire) and an increase in relaxation level (p < 0.001) assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). No significant differences were found in other conditions.","[{'authorId': '37052084', 'name': 'Alessandra Grassi'}, {'authorId': '1700503', 'name': 'A.

Signals from 23 participants were recorded along with the participants self-assessment of their affective state after each stimuli, in terms of valence, arousal, and dominance. All the signals were captured using portable, wearable, wireless, low-cost, and off-the-shelf equipment that has the potential to allow the use of affective computing methods in everyday applications. A baseline for participant-wise affect recognition using EEG and ECG-based features, as well as their fusion, was established through supervised classification experiments using support vector machines (SVMs). The self-assessment of the participants was evaluated through comparison with the self-assessments from another study using the same audio-visual stimuli. Classification results for valence, arousal, and dominance of the proposed database are comparable to the ones achieved for other databases that use nonportable, expensive, medical grade devices. These results indicate the prospects of using low-cost devices for affect recognition applications. The proposed database will be made publicly available in order to allow researchers to achieve a more thorough evaluation of the suitability of these capturing devices for affect recognition applications.","[{'authorId': '2067851', 'name': 'Stamos Katsigiannis'}, {'authorId': '1728223', 'name': 'N.

Children with chronic illness are known to have an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems. In the present population-based study children with asthma, neurological disorders and other chronic illnesses were compared with children without chronic illnesses to assess differences in psychological presentation across illness groups.


METHODS
A total of 537 children with parent-reported chronic illness in the Bergen Child Study were categorized into three groups: asthma, neurological disorders and other chronic illnesses. Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.


RESULTS
All three illness groups had an increased rate of emotional and behavioural problems, as well as increased probability of a psychiatric disorder compared with children without a chronic illness. Most children with asthma and other chronic illnesses did not have emotional and behavioural problems, and effect sizes were small in both groups. In children with neurological disorders the effect sizes ranged from moderate to large, with emotional problems, inattention hyperactivity and peer problems being the most frequent problems.


CONCLUSIONS
The increased rate of emotional and behavioural problems in children with chronic illness, especially neurological disorders, emphasizes the importance of early detection of mental health problems in these children.","[{'authorId': '4081393', 'name': 'M.

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in ""blind"" signal processing.","[{'authorId': '144187218', 'name': 'A. J.

It can provide a safe setting in which to practice skills that might carry too many risks in the real world. Unlike human tutors, computers are infinitely patient and consistent. Virtual worlds can be manipulated in ways the real world cannot be and can convey concepts without the use of language or other symbol systems. Published applications for this client group have all been as rehabilitative interventions. These are described in three groups: promoting skills for independent living, enhancing cognitive performance, and improving social skills. Five groups of studies are reviewed that utilize virtual technology to promote skills for independent living: grocery shopping, preparing food, orientation, road safety, and manufacturing skills. Fears that skills or habits learnt in a virtual setting would not transfer to the real world setting have not been supported by the available evidence, apart from those studies with people with autistic spectrum disorders. Future directions are in the development of more applications for independent living skills, exploring interventions for promoting motor and cognitive skills, and the developments of ecologically valid forms of assessment.","[{'authorId': '48419109', 'name': 'P.

1e1c7c6bc4482d4def21439fe29c4b34b59c7451,"Clinical conceptualizations of emotion that stress its disruptive influences and functional models of emotion that emphasize its adaptive aspects can be integrated into a developmental psychopathology framework. Under certain conditions, emotion regulation may develop dysregulatory aspects that can become a characteristic of an individual's coping style. This style may then jeopardize or impair functioning and become associated with symptomatic, disordered functioning. Emotional development provides a critical vantage point from which to study the development of symptomatology and psychopathology, particularly given the prevalence of emotional symptoms in various forms of psychopathology. Dimensions of emotionality that can be used to characterize dysregulation include access to the range of emotions, flexible modulation of intensity, duration, and transitions between emotions, acquisition and use of cultural display rules, and the ability to reflect on the complexity and value of one's own emotions in a self-supporting manner. Developmental psychopathology provides a framework within which to examine how emotions are regulatory, how their regulation changes over time, and under what conditions an adaptive emotion process can develop into a pattern of dysregulation that then becomes, or sustains, some symptoms of mental disorders. Such research requires samples that include children with and without risk or presence of particular mental health problems, paradigms that allow the examination of dimensions of emotionality in context and provide multiple assessments that include observations of children's reactions beyond what they themselves can report, and analyses that extend beyond simple global aggregates such as positive and negative emotion. We believe that it is particularly important to study children and their families in situations that challenge their emotional adaptation. The developmental tasks of emotional life evolve in exchanges between the child and the world of events and relationships. The emotional conditions of early childhood appear to be very important in optimizing or interfering with how the child's emotionality regulates his or her interpersonal and intrapsychic functioning and how the child learns to regulate emotion. The experiences that accrue around emotional events influence the stable aspects of the developing personality and become trait-like aspects of the person (Malatesta & Wilson, 1988). Dysregulation occurs when an emotional reaction loses breadth and flexibility. If a dysregulatory pattern becomes stabilized and part of the emotional repertoire, it is likely that this pattern is a symptom and supports other symptoms. When development and adaptation are compromised, the dysregulation has evolved into a form of psychopathology. The line between normative variations and clinical conditions is not clearly drawn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","[{'authorId': '34935701', 'name': 'P.

However, its effects on promoting human mental health are still under consideration. The objective of this study was to investigate the physiological and psychological relaxation effects of forest walking on adults. Sixty participants (50% males; 50% females) were trained to walk 15-minute predetermined courses in a bamboo forest and a city area (control). The length of the courses was the same to allow comparison of the effects of both environments. Blood pressure and EEG results were measured to assess the physiological responses and the semantic differential method (SDM) and STAI were used to study the psychological responses. Blood pressure was significantly decreased and variation in brain activity was observed in both environments. The results of the two questionnaires indicated that walking in the bamboo forest improves mood and reduces anxiety. Moreover, the mean meditation and attention scores were significantly increased after walking in a bamboo forest. The results of the physiological and psychological measurements indicate the relaxing effects of walking in a bamboo forest on adults.","[{'authorId': '49340121', 'name': 'Ahmad Hassan'}, {'authorId': '50083484', 'name': 'J.

We conducted a qualitative review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for social phobia. Method Articles were identified through searches of electronic databases and manual searches of reference lists. They were classified by psychological interventions evaluated. Data regarding treatment, participants and results were then extracted and tabulated. We identified which psychological interventions are empirically supported, using the scheme proposed by Chambless & Hollon (Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 1998, 66, 7–18). Results Thirty studies evaluating the efficacy of social skills training (SST), exposure therapy and/or cognitive treatments were identified. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), involving cognitive restructuring and exposure to feared and avoided social situations or behavioral experiments, was found to be an efficacious and specific treatment for social phobia. Exposure therapy was found to be an efficacious treatment since most of the evidence of its efficacy was from comparisons with no treatment. There were mixed findings regarding the relative efficacy of CBT and in vivo exposure. Some studies reported that the interventions were equivalent, while others found that patients treated with CBT had a better outcome. There was little evidence to support the use of SST.

As early as 1965, Sutherland envisioned that the ‘ultimate display’ would enable users to actively interact with the virtual space as if it were real, giving them “a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world” (Sutherland, 1965, p. 506). William Gibson appears to have shared this vision when coining the term ‘cyberspace’ in his 1984 novel Neuromancer, defining it as “a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts · · · ” (p. 51). While the image may have seemed farfetched at the time, the mounting popularity of home video game consoles, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs), and massive open online courses (MOOCs) all demonstrate that virtual reality (VR) is an increasingly integral component of our everyday lives. Despite some romanticized versions of VR, much of the previous literature focused on its dangers. Early studies voiced concerns about how individuals would no longer be able to receive true emotional and social support online (e.g., Kraut et al., 1998) and more recent research focused on Internet addiction (e.g., Lam et al., 2009) as well as the antisocial effects of playing violent games (e.g., Bartholow, Bushman, & Sestir, 2006). Overall, the results suggest that spending extensive amounts of time in VR can result in apathetic or even violent attitudes and behavior toward others. Indeed, early conversations between Jaron Lanier, one of the pioneers of the technology, and William Gibson, who consulted Lanier while writing his manifesto, focused on this tension. Lanier envisioned prosocial uses for the technology he championed, but Gibson felt compelled to write about the less wholesome applications, saying, “Jaron, I tried. But it’s coming out dark” (Lanier, 2013, p. 329). In terms of academic research, there is a group of scholars who focus on a more positive outlook; the unique affordances of virtual environments actually promote prosocial behavior when leveraged. Recent developments show that even brief virtual interventions can increase environmental awareness, reduce racial bias, and enhance general altruistic behavior. These interventions have been found to be especially powerful when the user feels fully immersed in the virtual world. With these findings in mind, the present chapter will outline the characteristics and strengths of virtual environments. It will then describe the malleable nature of prosocial behavior and explain how the","[{'authorId': '1391434585', 'name': 'K.

It is further postulated that eye-contact is linked to affiliative motivation, and that approach and avoidance forces produce an equilibrium level of physical proximity, eyecontact and other aspects of intimacy. If one of these is disturbed, compensatory changes may occur along the other dimensions. Experiments are reported which suggest that people move towards an equilibrium distance, and adopt a particular level of eye-contact. As predicted, there was less eyecontact and glances were shorter, the closer two subjects were placed together (where one member of each pair was a confederate who gazed continuously at the other).

The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Student Version, was used before and after the experience. The auditory hallucinations were provided as part of the “Hearing Voices That Are Distressing” curriculum created by the National Empowerment Center, which attempted to simulate the experience of hearing auditory hallucinations. While the students were listening to the auditory hallucinations, they underwent a psychiatric interview and simplified cognitive testing and were asked to socially interact in the community. We conducted a paired sample t-test of significance to identify pre- and postsimulated auditory hallucination changes in medical student empathy. Fifty students were randomly selected to serve as a comparison group.ResultsThe paired sample t-test revealed that after listening to the simulated auditory hallucinations and participating in the simplified neurocognitive testing, the students’ empathy score increased. Students in the comparison group had no significant difference in their empathy scores.ConclusionThese results suggest that empathy may increase when students are given a brief glimpse into the mind of a mentally ill patient by listening to simulated auditory hallucinations. Specific interventions to increase empathy for the mentally ill can lead to a better understanding of how empathy can improve patient care, enhance the doctor-patient relationship, and direct future educational strategies.","[{'authorId': '123836344', 'name': 'W.

METHODS: Bivariate and multivariable cross-sectional analyses were conducted on data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health on 61 779 children ages 6 to 17 years, including 5028 with ADHD. RESULTS: Parent-reported diagnosed prevalence of ADHD was 8.2%. Children with ADHD were more likely to have other mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions. Parents reported that 46% of children with ADHD had a learning disability versus 5% without ADHD, 27% vs 2% had a conduct disorder, 18% vs 2% anxiety, 14% vs 1% depression, and 12% vs 3% speech problems (all P < .05). Most children with ADHD had at least 1 comorbid disorder: 33% had 1, 16% had 2, and 18% had 3 or more. The risk for having 3 or more comorbidities was 3.8 times higher for poor versus affluent children (30% vs 8%). Children with ADHD had higher odds of activity restriction (odds ratio: 4.14 [95% confidence interval: 3.34–5.15]), school problems (odds ratio: 5.18 [95% confidence interval: 4.47–6.01]), grade repetition, and poor parent-child communication, whereas social competence scores were lower and parent aggravation higher. Functioning declined in a stepwise fashion with increasing numbers of comorbidities, and use of health and educational services and need for care coordination increased. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical management of ADHD must address multiple comorbid conditions and manage a range of adverse functional outcomes. Therapeutic approaches should be responsive to each child's neurodevelopmental profile, tailored to their unique social and family circumstances, and integrated with educational, mental health and social support services.","[{'authorId': '34895268', 'name': 'Kandyce Larson'}, {'authorId': '4819928', 'name': 'Shirley A.

It is proposed that intergroup anxiety is comprised of three interrelated components: an affective component, a cognitive component, and a physiological component. The potential causes of intergroup anxiety include personality traits (e.g., social dominance orientation, attributional complexity), attitudes and related cognitions (e.g., negative expectations, stereotypes), personal experience (e.g., negative contact), and situational factors (e.g., the presence of linguistic barriers, structured vs. unstructured interactions). The potential consequences include attitudes and other cognitions (e.g., stereotypes, negative expectations), affect (e.g., fear, anger), and behavior (e.g., avoidance, negative behaviors). Theory and research on the reduction of intergroup anxiety (e.g., intergroup contact, direct or indirect cross-group friendships) are also presented.

The twenty-one contributions focus on the implementation, application, and impact of computer-mediated communication in a global context. Previously limited to scientific research, global networks now have an impact on social, educational, and business communications. Individuals with a personal computer, a modem, and some simple software can join a new social community that is based on interest, not location. Global Networks, which was written largely with the assistance of the internet, provides an understanding of the issues, opportunities, and pitfalls of this new social connectivity.

2036510410fc126229e2fad3c62201237c9dfa5e,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a constant and unspecific anxiety that interferes with daily-life activities. Its high prevalence in general population and the severe limitations it causes, point out the necessity to find new efficient strategies to treat it. Together with the cognitive-behavioral treatments, relaxation represents a useful approach for the treatment of GAD, but it has the limitation that it is hard to be learned. The INTREPID project is aimed to implement a new instrument to treat anxiety-related disorders and to test its clinical efficacy in reducing anxiety-related symptoms. The innovation of this approach is the combination of virtual reality and biofeedback, so that the first one is directly modified by the output of the second one. In this way, the patient is made aware of his or her reactions through the modification of some features of the VR environment in real time. Using mental exercises the patient learns to control these physiological parameters and using the feedback provided by the virtual environment is able to gauge his or her success. The supplemental use of portable devices, such as PDA or smart-phones, allows the patient to perform at home, individually and autonomously, the same exercises experienced in therapist's office. The goal is to anchor the learned protocol in a real life context, so enhancing the patients' ability to deal with their symptoms. The expected result is a better and faster learning of relaxation techniques, and thus an increased effectiveness of the treatment if compared with traditional clinical protocols.","[{'authorId': '143789846', 'name': 'C.

We focus on two commonly used emotion regulation strategies: reappraisal (changing the way one thinks about a potentially emotion-eliciting event) and suppression (changing the way one responds behaviorally to an emotion-eliciting event). In the first section, we review experimental findings showing that reappraisal has a healthier profile of short-term affective, cognitive, and social consequences than suppression. In the second section, we review individual-difference findings, which show that using reappraisal to regulate emotions is associated with healthier patterns of affect, social functioning, and well-being than is using suppression. In the third section, we consider issues in the development of reappraisal and suppression and provide new evidence for a normative shift toward an increasingly healthy emotion regulation profile during adulthood (i.e., increases in the use of reappraisal and decreases in the use of suppression).","[{'authorId': '2254103', 'name': 'O.

Aim: The aim of this study was to develop a rehabilitation program based on vibroacoustic and virtual reality techniques and evaluate its effectiveness on the emotional profile of children with ASD. Method: The research employed a single-subject ABA design. The population included all children with ASD attending the Zehn ara Rehabilitation Clinic in Tehran in the second half of 2021, from which 5 participants were purposively selected. Initially, the combined program was implemented for 10 sessions of 30 minutes each on two randomly chosen participants from the sample, and after validating the program, three additional participants were included in the study. The Sensory Profile 2 questionnaire (2014) was used in this research. During the baseline phase, at the end of each intervention session, and during a one-month follow-up period, the questionnaires were completed. Data analysis involved visual analysis, percentage of improvement, and percentage of overlapping and non-overlapping data. Results: The results indicated that based on the obtained effect sizes, the intervention had a significant impact on emotional regulation in participants 1 to 5, with 90%, 80%, 80%, 100%, and 90% certainty, respectively. Furthermore, the percentage of improvement resulting from the interventions for participants 1 to 5 was 20.08%, 28.75%, 28.24%, 27.24%, and 21.02%, respectively. Conclusion: Based on the findings, the combined rehabilitation program was effective in improving the emotional profile of children with autism. Therefore; this approach can be recommended as an appropriate intervention for individuals with ASD.","[{'authorId': '2261428982', 'name': 'Narges Amini Shirazi'}, {'authorId': '2261429272', 'name': 'Saeed Rezayi'}, {'authorId': '2261429149', 'name': 'Maryam Asaseh'}, {'authorId': '2261419377', 'name': 'Mohammad Parsa Azizi'}]",0.0,{'name': 'Shenakht Journal of Psychology and Psychiatry'},0.0,Development of an integrated program of sensory rehabilitation based on vibroacoustic and virtual reality and its effectiveness on the emotional profile in children with autism spectrum disorder: A Case study,2023.0

Despite evidence of deficits in executive functions in individuals with ASD, little is known about executive dysfunctions as candidate cognitive endophenotypes for ASD. In this study, we investigated executive functions in youths with ASD, their unaffected siblings and typically developing controls (TDC). Methods We recruited 240 youths with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (aged 6–18 years), 147 unaffected siblings of ASD youths, and 240 TDC youths. TDC youths were recruited based on the age and sex distribution of the ASD youths. Participants were assessed using the verbal Digit Span test and four executive function tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, including Intra-dimensional/Extra-dimensional Shift (I/ED), Spatial Span (SSP), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), and Stocking of Cambridge (SoC). Results ASD youths, relative to TDC, performed significantly worse in executive function tasks assessing verbal working memory (forward and backward digit span), set-shifting (I/ED), visuospatial working memory (SSP, SWM), and planning/problem solving (SoC). Furthermore, unaffected siblings, relative to TDC, performed worse in forward and backward digit recalls and made more errors in SWM. These results were independent of the effects of age, sex, IQ, and symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Conclusions Our findings support impaired executive functions in youths with ASD. However, unaffected siblings were mostly unimpaired except in the areas of verbal and spatial working memory, which may be potential cognitive endophenotypes for ASD.","[{'authorId': '1677623939', 'name': 'Guan-Jye Seng'}, {'authorId': '145736162', 'name': 'W.

To address this issue, we developed the Technology-Supported Reflection Inventory (TSRI), which is a scale that evaluates how effectively a system supports reflection. We first created a list of possible scale items based on past work in defining reflection. The items were then reviewed by experts. Next, we performed exploratory factor analysis to reduce the scale to its final length of nine items.

The emotional representation is learned in an end-to-end fashion by applying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) directly to spectrograms extracted from speech utterances. Motivated by the success of GoogleNet, two groups of filters with different shapes are designed to capture both temporal and frequency domain context information from the input spectrogram. The learned features are concatenated and fed into the subsequent convolutional layers. To learn the final emotional representation, a novel attention pooling method is further proposed. 
 
Compared with the existing pooling methods, such as max-pooling and average-pooling, the proposed attention pooling can effectively incorporate class-agnostic bottom-up, and class-specific top-down, attention maps. We conduct extensive evaluations on benchmark IEMOCAP data to assess the effectiveness of the proposed representation.

Breathing rhythm is a particularly interesting physiological dimension since it is easy and unobtrusive to measure and gained data provide valuable insights regarding the correct execution of movements, especially when analyzed together with additional movement data in real-time. In this work, we focus on indoor rowing since it is a popular sport that's often done alone without extensive instructions. We compare a visual breathing indication with haptic guidance in order for athletes to maintain a correct, efficient, and healthy breathing-movement-synchronicity (BMS) while working out. Also, user experience and acceptance of the different modalities were measured. The results show a positive and statistically significant impact of purely verbal instructions and purely tactile feedback on BMS and no significant impact of visual feedback. Interestingly, the subjective ratings indicate a strong preference for the visual modality and even an aversion for the haptic feedback, although objectively the performance benefited most from using the latter.","[{'authorId': '51224271', 'name': 'R.

The multidimensional nature of this experience together with the continuous presence of one's biological body, render both theoretical and experimental approaches problematic. Nevertheless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to experience the same sensations towards a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment as toward the biological body, and if so, to what extent. The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future experimental studies are proposed to overcome those challenges, toward deepening the concept of SoE and enhancing it in virtual applications.","[{'authorId': '3038757', 'name': 'Konstantina Kilteni'}, {'authorId': '2913730', 'name': 'R.

The past two decades have seen dramatic progress in our ability to model brain signals recorded by electroencephalography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, etc., and to derive real-time estimates of user cognitive state, response, or intent for a variety of purposes: to restore communication by the severely disabled, to effect brain-actuated control and, more recently, to augment human–computer interaction. Continuing these advances, largely achieved through increases in computational power and methods, requires software tools to streamline the creation, testing, evaluation and deployment of new data analysis methods. Approach. Here we present BCILAB, an open-source MATLAB-based toolbox built to address the need for the development and testing of brain-computer interface (BCI) methods by providing an organized collection of over 100 pre-implemented methods and method variants, an easily extensible framework for the rapid prototyping of new methods, and a highly automated framework for systematic testing and evaluation of new implementations. Main results. To validate and illustrate the use of the framework, we present two sample analyses of publicly available data sets from recent BCI competitions and from a rapid serial visual presentation task. We demonstrate the straightforward use of BCILAB to obtain results compatible with the current BCI literature. Significance. The aim of the BCILAB toolbox is to provide the BCI community a powerful toolkit for methods research and evaluation, thereby helping to accelerate the pace of innovation in the field, while complementing the existing spectrum of tools for real-time BCI experimentation, deployment and use.","[{'authorId': '50393156', 'name': 'Christian Kothe'}, {'authorId': '2952058', 'name': 'S.

Pupillary changes during picture viewing covaried with skin conductance change, supporting the interpretation that sympathetic nervous system activity modulates these changes in the context of affective picture viewing.

The detection of emotions is done by correlating these physiological signals with the data of arousal and valence of this dataset, to classify the affective state of a person. In addition, an application for emotion recognition based on classic machine learning algorithms is proposed to extract the features of physiological signals in the domain of time, frequency, and non-linear. This application uses a convolutional neural network for the automatic feature extraction of the physiological signals, and through fully connected network layers, the emotion prediction is made.

Importantly, sustained attention undergoes significant development over the early childhood period. Yet, how sustained attention fluctuates over time on task has not been clearly outlined, particularly in young children. In this study, we provide a first test of whether the pupillary response can be used as an indicator of moment-to-moment sustained attention over time on task in young children. Children aged 5 to 7 years (N = 41) completed a psychomotor vigilance task, where they were asked to press a button as fast as possible at the onset of a target stimulus. We measured reaction times over the course of the task, pupil size prior to target onset (baseline pupil size), and pupil size in response to target onset (task-evoked pupil size). The results showed a stereotypical vigilance decrement in children’s response times: as time on task increased, reaction times increased. Critically, children’s task-evoked pupil size decreased over time on task, while no such change was present in baseline pupil size. These results suggest that young children’s waning sustained attention may be linked to a decrease in alertness while overall arousal is maintained. We discuss the importance of leveraging pupillometry to understand the mechanisms of sustained attention over individuals and development.","[{'authorId': '39500974', 'name': 'Viridiana L.

However, during the therapy, VR is a new and distinct realm, separate from the emotions and behaviors experienced by the patient in the real world: the behavior of the patient in VR has no direct effects on the real-life experience; the emotions and problems experienced by the patient in the real world are not directly addressed in the VR exposure. In this article, we suggest that the use of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, may improve the clinical outcome of PTSD. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and real worlds: (a) behavior in the physical world influences the experience in the virtual one; (b) behavior in the virtual world influences the experience in the real one. This is achieved through 3D shared virtual worlds; biosensors and activity sensors (from the real to the virtual world); and personal digital assistants and/or mobile phones (from the virtual world to the real one). We describe different technologies that are involved in the Interreality vision and its clinical rationale. To illustrate the concept of Interreality in practice, a clinical scenario is also presented and discussed: Rosa, a 55-year-old nurse, involved in a major car accident.","[{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

Viewing positive scenes through virtual reality (VR) has been shown to increase positive affect and holds great promise for addressing anhedonic symptoms. In this pilot study, six participants with clinically significant depression completed 13 sessions of exposure to positive scenes in a controlled VR environment. Significant decreases were found in self-reported anhedonia, depression, anxiety, and impairments in functioning from baseline to 1-month follow-up.

To answer this question, a meta-review was conducted to assess the meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews published in this field in the last twenty-two months. Twenty-five different articles demonstrated the clinical potential of this technology in both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental health disorders: VR compares favorably to existing treatments in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management, with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. But why is VR so effective? Here, the following answer is suggested: VR shares with the brain the same basic mechanism: embodied simulations. According to neuroscience, to regulate and control the body in the world effectively, the brain creates an embodied simulation of the body in the world used to represent and predict actions, concepts, and emotions. VR works in a similar way: the VR experience tries to predict the sensory consequences of an individual's movements, providing to him/her the same scene he/she will see in the real world. To achieve this, the VR system, like the brain, maintains a model (simulation) of the body and the space around it. If the presence in the body is the outcome of different embodied simulations, concepts are embodied simulations, and VR is an embodied technology, this suggests a new clinical approach discussed in this article: the possibility of altering the experience of the body and facilitating cognitive modeling/change by designing targeted virtual environments able to simulate both the external and the internal world/body.","[{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the results obtained with 12 sessions of cognitive-behavioral group therapy with obsessive-compulsive patients were maintained after two years, and whether the degree of symptom remission was associated with relapse.


METHOD
Forty-two patients were followed. The severity of symptoms was measured at the end of cognitive-behavioral group therapy and at 18 and 24 months of follow-up. The assessment scales used were the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Clinical Global Impression, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory.


RESULTS
The reduction in symptom severity observed at the end of treatment was maintained during the two-year follow-up period (F = 57.881; p < 0.001). At the end of the treatment, 9 (21.4%) patients presented full remission, 22 (52.4%) presented partial remission, and 11 (26.2%) had unchanged scores in the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. After two years, 13 patients (31.0%) presented full remission, 20 (47.6%) had partial remission, and 9 (21.4%) had unchanged Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores. The full remission of symptoms at the end of the treatment was a protective factor against relapse (chi2 = 4,962; df = 1; p = 0.026).

We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value of these models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image description and retrieval problems, and video narration challenges. In contrast to current models which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are “doubly deep” in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal “layers”. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined and/or optimized.","[{'authorId': '7408951', 'name': 'Jeff Donahue'}, {'authorId': '2234342', 'name': 'Lisa Anne Hendricks'}, {'authorId': '34849128', 'name': 'Marcus Rohrbach'}, {'authorId': '1811430', 'name': 'Subhashini Venugopalan'}, {'authorId': '1687120', 'name': 'S.

2424f49740ba9365db79a1ef20660865dd85073a,"Background: Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) commonly demonstrate prominent social communication deficits, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and chronic irritability. These challenges hinder academic progress and frequently persist despite educational, behavioral, and medical interventions. An assistive smartglasses technology may aid these individuals, especially if the technology is efficacious in ecologically-valid school settings. This study explored the feasibility and efficacy of Empowered Brain, a computerized smartglasses intervention designed as a socio-emotional behavioral aid for students with ASD. Methods: This two-part six-week study involved four school children with ASD from a public elementary school. The study incorporated an initial three-week feasibility stage followed by a three-week controlled longitudinal efficacy stage. Both stages involved the use of a twice-daily socio-emotional intervention with the smartglasses. Educators completed pre-intervention and post-intervention Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC) ratings at the start of the feasibility stage, and weekly during the efficacy stage. Primary outcome measures were improvements in the ABC subscales of irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal. Results: Students in both feasibility and efficacy stages demonstrated improvements (decreases) in irritability, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal compared to a baseline period and control periods, respectively. Participants in the controlled efficacy stage demonstrated decreased ABC subscale scores of 90% for irritability, 41.6% for hyperactivity, and 45.6% for social withdrawal. An intervention exposure-response improvement in irritability and hyperactivity was found during the efficacy stage. Educators rated the technology as superior or vastly superior compared to other assistive technologies. Conclusion: A substantial number of school children with ASD demonstrate chronic and impairing cognitive and behavioral challenges. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain, a smartglasses-based socio-emotional aid for autism, is both feasible and efficacious in improving symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, and hyperactivity in students with autism. The improvement is demonstrated as part of a longitudinal school-based intervention. Further studies involving larger samples and incorporation of randomized controlled trial methodology are underway to further elucidate the impact of this technology.","[{'authorId': '2858560', 'name': 'Arshya Vahabzadeh'}, {'authorId': '14929613', 'name': 'Neha U.

Data sources include the reports and analysis generated by the learning analytics tools in MT, a survey of students, final exam scores, and the instructor’s observation of classroom activities. Findings suggest that an intelligent and adaptive learning platform coupled with well-designed team-based activities can indeed increase students’ engagement in learning in a wide variety of activities and contexts, from personalized learning to team collaboration, and including classroom participation and asynchronous postings on a discussion forum. These findings are significant because Chinese universities tend to have large-size classes with few opportunities for interaction.

Participants were randomly assigned to experience a natural environment through 360-degree interactive virtual reality or an urban environment through 360-degree interactive virtual reality. Virtual reality experience of a natural environment compared to virtual reality experience of an urban environment resulted in higher levels of positive affect and a greater perception of restorativeness. Restorativeness was a mediating path between virtual reality experience of a natural or urban environment and positive affect. Trait connectedness to nature showed a trend toward interacting with experience of a natural or urban environment's impact on positive affect.

2462722da0ca4525a8901df1256db3ec704bcd0c,"Emotions are viewed as an important aspect of human interactions and conversations, and allow effective and logical decision making. Emotion recognition uses low-cost wearable electroencephalography (EEG) headsets to collect brainwave signals and interpret these signals to provide information on the mental state of a person, with the implementation of a virtual reality environment in different applications; the gap between human and computer interaction, as well as the understanding process, would shorten, providing an immediate response to an individual’s mental health. This study aims to use a virtual reality (VR) headset to induce four classes of emotions (happy, scared, calm, and bored), to collect brainwave samples using a low-cost wearable EEG headset, and to run popular classifiers to compare the most feasible ones that can be used for this particular setup. Firstly, we attempt to build an immersive VR database that is accessible to the public and that can potentially assist with emotion recognition studies using virtual reality stimuli. Secondly, we use a low-cost wearable EEG headset that is both compact and small, and can be attached to the scalp without any hindrance, allowing freedom of movement for participants to view their surroundings inside the immersive VR stimulus. Finally, we evaluate the emotion recognition system by using popular machine learning algorithms and compare them for both intra-subject and inter-subject classification. The results obtained here show that the prediction model for the four-class emotion classification performed well, including the more challenging inter-subject classification, with the support vector machine (SVM Class Weight kernel) obtaining 85.01% classification accuracy. This shows that using less electrode channels but with proper parameter tuning and selection features affects the performance of the classifications.","[{'authorId': '46227511', 'name': 'N. S.

In the prevention of burnout and compassion fatigue a positive approach with increase of ‘compassion satisfaction’ and ‘resilience’ makes sense. Hypnosis with its emphasis on mobilizing positive resources and positive psychology is helpful at different levels of intervention. (Self) hypnosis is integrated in strategies for self care, setting boundaries and increasing inner strength and resilience. In hypnosis attitude changes can be made with promotion of compassion satisfaction and job engagement. Resource development is also part of the hypnotic work.

In the current study, we compared a brief nature-based mindfulness VR experience to a resting control condition on anxious participants. Self-reported anxiety symptoms and resting-state EEG were recorded across intervals containing quiet rest or the VR intervention. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of anxiety and increased Alpha power. However, the VR intervention uniquely resulted in shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies, and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. These effects are consistent with a physiological reduction of anxiety.

At the same time, a growing number of scientific reports have been looking at the use of virtual reality (VR) to treat mental health problems. This study aimed at assessing the efficacy of virtual therapy in reducing levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in female CVD patients. Materials and Methods: The study included 43 women who were randomly divided into two groups: experimental group (N = 17), where eight-week cardiac rehabilitation was enhanced with VR-based therapeutic sessions, and control group (N = 26), where the VR therapy was replaced with Schultz’s autogenic training. Mental state parameters were measured using the Perception of Stress Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: In the experimental group, the sole parameter which failed to improve was HADS-Anxiety, which remained at the baseline level. In the control group, there was a deterioration in nearly all tested parameters except for HADS-Depression. Statistically significant differences in the efficacy of rehabilitation were recorded in relation to the level of stress in the sub-scales: emotional tension (p = 0.005), external stress (p = 0.012), intrapsychic stress (p = 0.023) and the generalized stress scale (p = 0.004).

In the later 1800s, toward the end of his career, Fechner performed experiments to empirically evaluate the beauty of rectangles, hypothesizing that the preferred shape would closely match that of the so-called 'golden rectangle'. His findings confirmed his suspicions, but in the intervening decades there has been significant evidence pointing away from that finding. Regardless of the results of this one study, Fechner ushered in the notion of using a metric to evaluate beauty in a psychophysical way. In this paper, we recreate the experiment using more naturalistic stimuli. We evaluate subjects' preferences against models that use various types of object complexity as metrics. Our findings that subjects prefer either very simple or very complex objects runs contrary to the hypothesized results, but are systematic none the less.

A number of studies indicated that many children with ASD prefer technology and this preference can be explored to develop systems that may alleviate several challenges of traditional treatment and intervention. As a result, recent advances in computer and robotic technology are ushering in innovative assistive technologies for ASD intervention. The current work presents design, development and a usability study of an adaptive multimodal virtual reality-based social interaction platform for children with ASD. It is hypothesized that endowing a technological system that can detect the processing pattern and mental state of the child using implicit cues from eye tracking and electrophysiological, including peripheral physiological and electroencephalography (EEG), signals and adapt its interaction accordingly is of great importance in assisting and individualizing traditional intervention approaches. The presented VR system is based on a virtual reality based social environment, a school cafeteria, where an individual with ASD interacts with virtual characters. An eye tracker, an EEG monitor and biosensors to measure peripheral electrophysiological signals are integrated with the VR task environment to obtain gaze, EEG signals and several peripheral physiological signals in real-time. In the current work, we show how eye gaze and task performance can be used in real-time to adapt intervention in VR. The other signals are collected for offline analysis. The results from a usability study with 12 subjects with ASD are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed concepts within the VR system.","[{'authorId': '1784297', 'name': 'Esubalew Bekele'}, {'authorId': '3285850', 'name': 'Joshua W.

VR produces a change with respect to the traditional relationship between client and therapist. The new configuration of this relationship is based on the awareness of being more skilled in the difficult operations of recovery of past experiences through the memory and of foreseeing future experiences through the imagination.

The authors reviewed the types and phases of validity of psychiatric diagnosis. In 1970, Robins and Guze proposed five phases to achieve valid classification of mental disorders: clinical description, laboratory study, exclusion of other disorders, follow-up study, and family study.


OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this paper are to review what has been learned since Robins and Guze's influential article as well as examine the impact of the new discoveries in neurosciences and neuroimaging on the practicing clinician.


METHOD
The authors reviewed the literature on the concept of validity in psychiatry with emphasis on the role of clinical training, the use of structured interviews and rating scales, and the importance of the new discoveries in neurosciences.


RESULTS
Robins and Guze's phases have been the cornerstone of construct validity in psychiatry at the level of researchers. In the absence of the gold standard of psychiatric diagnosis, Spitzer proposed the ""LEAD,"" which is an acronym for longitudinal evaluation, and is done by expert clinicians utilizing all the data available. The LEAD standard is construct validity at the level of experts; however, guidelines are lacking to improve the validity skills of the practicing clinicians.


CONCLUSIONS

Hence computer analysis of heart rate variability might provide a quantitative index of that interaction. The power spectral density (PSD) estimate of heart rate variability was obtained in normal controls and in uncomplicated hypertensives, both at rest and during a non-hypotensive sympathetic stimulus (tilting). In normal controls PSD shows three major peaks of frequencies P1 = 0.07, P2 = 0.12, P3 = 0.25 cycles/beat. P1, which is associated with sympathetic activity, represents only a minor portion of total variability at rest, while becoming predominant with tilting. P2 and P3 are associated with vagal activity, and represent the major part of variability at rest, while they are reduced by tilting. In hypertensive patients PSD is altered, as P1 is already predominant at rest and increases only slightly with tilting. Thus PSD of heart rate variability is capable of detecting an early alteration in sympatho-vagal balance of cardiac control present in uncomplicated hypertension.","[{'authorId': '143905971', 'name': 'M.

Guided attention to self can alleviate this disconnect as in focused-attention meditation, in which breathing often constitutes the primary object on which to focus attention. In this context, sustained breath awareness plays a crucial role in the emergence of the meditation experience. We designed an immersive virtual environment (iVE) with a generative soundtrack that supports sustained attention on breathing by employing the users' breathing in interaction. Both sounds and visuals are directly mapped to the user's breathing patterns, thus bringing the awareness researched. We conducted micro-phenomenology interviews to unfold the process in which breath awareness can be induced and sustained in this environment. The findings revealed the mechanisms by which audio and visual cues in VR can elicit and foster breath-awareness, and unfolded the nuances of this process through subjective experiences of the study participants. Finally, the results emphasize the important role that a sense of agency and control have in shaping the overall quality of the experience.

Multiple physiological signals such as respiration (RSP) and heart rate variability (HRV) were acquired in an experiment from 53 participants when six basic emotion states were induced. Two RSP parameters were acquired from a chest-band respiration sensor, and five HRV parameters were acquired from a finger-clip blood volume pulse (BVP) sensor. A newly designed deep-learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was adopted for detecting the identification accuracy of individual emotions. Additionally, the signal combination of the acquired parameters was proposed to obtain high classification accuracy. Furthermore, a dominant factor influencing the accuracy was found by comparing the relativeness of the parameters, providing a basis for supporting the results of emotion classification. The users of this proposed model will soon be able to improve the emotion recognition model further based on CNN using multimodal physiological signals and their sensors.","[{'authorId': '2121943997', 'name': 'Seung Jun Oh'}, {'authorId': '40585492', 'name': 'Jun-Young Lee'}, {'authorId': '34591701', 'name': 'Dong Keun Kim'}]",32.0,,61.0,The Design of CNN Architectures for Optimal Six Basic Emotion Classification Using Multiple Physiological Signals,2020.0

25bf89f962998a6f8d3bd0793163ab69a0fd4731,"Food craving refers to an intense desire to consume a specific food. In Western societies, these foods usually have high palatability and are energy dense, that is, they have high sugar and/or fat content. Food craving is a multidimensional experience as it includes cognitive (e.g., thinking about food), emotional (e.g., desire to eat or changes in mood), behavioral (e.g., seeking and consuming food), and physiological (e.g., salivation) aspects (Nederkoorn et al., 2000; Cepeda-Benito et al., 2000a). 
 
Subjective self-report appears to be the most viable method for the assessment of craving as other measurement modalities (e.g., peripheral autonomic responses) typically suffer from a lack of specificity (Shiffman, 2000). The most often used instruments are the Food Cravings Questionnaires (FCQs; Cepeda-Benito et al., 2000a,b). Momentary food craving can be measured with a 15-item state version (FCQ-S) while the frequency of food craving experiences can be measured with a 39-item trait version (FCQ-T), which contains nine subscales. However, factor structure could not be replicated in some studies and as the FCQ-T usually has very high internal consistency, researchers often report its total score only. Consequently, such a long measure may not be necessary in order to assess a general index of trait food craving. In the current research topic, Meule et al. (2014) present a reduced version of the German FCQ-T (FCQ-T-r), which consists of 15 items only. Results showed that correlates of this short version were similar to those that have been found for the long version, for example, that FCQ-T scores are able to predict food-cue induced craving (Meule et al., 2012a,b). Following up on this, Rodriguez-Martin and Molerio-Perez (2014) also could not replicate the nine-factorial structure of the Spanish FCQ-T (Cepeda-Benito et al., 2000b). They could demonstrate, however, that scores of the Spanish FCQ-T-r were highly correlated with scores of the long version as well as with the 24 excluded items. Moreover, it was shown that validity indices were similar for both versions, providing further support that the FCQ-T-r represents an adequate alternative for the assessment of trait food craving as measured by the FCQ-T. 
 
Animal models are an important part of research on eating behavior. While people can be asked if they experience a desire to eat a food, measuring food craving in animals is not straightforward. Following abstinence from sugar, rats will exhibit a larger binge than ever before, which may be interpreted as an experience of craving (Avena et al., 2005). A rather indirect measure of food craving may be sensory-specific satiety (SST; specifically, the lack thereof). It refers to a temporary decline in food liking and food wanting derived from consuming a certain food in comparison to other unconsumed foods (Havermans et al., 2009). Reichelt et al. (2014) present a study in which rats consumed a so-called cafeteria diet of palatable, high-calorie foods for 2 weeks. They found that these rats showed impaired SST following consumption of a high-calorie solution, which may suggest that exposure to obesogenic diets impacts upon neurocircuitry involved in motivated control of eating behavior. 
 
The ingestion of food is associated with a rewarding consequence and, thus, the incentive value of that particular food increases and its sensory attributes become signals for satisfaction (Havermans, 2013). Therefore, through Pavlovian conditioning, exposure to food-cues can likely trigger food craving. In experimental research, this can easily be examined by presenting pictorial food stimuli on a computer screen while psychophysiological data or subjective ratings are recorded. However, food image sets vary considerably across laboratories and image characteristics and food composition are often unspecified. Moreover, study results may be adversely affected by confounding variables such as perceptual characteristics of the stimuli. To remedy this, Blechert et al. (2014) developed a comprehensive database of food and non-food images along with detailed meta-data. This database will facilitate standardization and comparability across studies and will advance experimental research on food craving and eating behavior as it enables to match and control stimulus sets on a range of important variables. 
 
Exposure to tempting food-cues, however, does not trigger food craving or lead to food consumption in each and every situation. Grubliauskiene and Dewitte (2014), for example, show that boys actually ate fewer candies following an unobtrusive pre-exposure to candies as compared to when there was no pre-exposure. Unexpectedly, however, this effect could not be shown for girls. Moreover, as was firstly demonstrated by Morewedge et al. (2010), instead of inducing food craving (i.e., having a sensitizing effect), repeatedly imagining the consumption of a food leads people to habituate to it and consequently reduces consumption of that food. Missbach et al. (2014) were able to replicate this finding with different food items than were used in the original studies. Importantly, they found that this habituation effect was neutralized by self-regulatory depletion. That is, repeated imagination of food consumption only reduces subsequent food intake when self-regulatory resources are available. 
 
Research consistently demonstrates gender differences in food craving: women are more likely to experience food cravings than men (Weingarten and Elston, 1991). It is tempting to assume that these differences are related to hormonal differences between women and men, particularly as many women experience increases in food cravings perimenstrually and prenatally (Hormes, 2014). However, research on these experiences is scarce. Orloff and Hormes (2014) review the available literature on food cravings during pregnancy. They challenge the notion that perimenstrual or prenatal food craving is associated with hormonal changes, but suggest that cultural and psychosocial factors are more important determinants of food craving experiences during pregnancy and of excess gestational weight gain. 
 
Food craving can occur as a result of specific mood states (often negative mood) and is marked by anticipation of mood enhancing effects of food intake (Cepeda-Benito et al., 2000a). Food craving is also associated with external eating, that is, it is often triggered by cues in the environment. Pfattheicher and Sassenrath (2014) report that emotional eating is positively related to individual differences in prevention focus while external eating is positively related to individual differences in promotion focus. Hence, this study showed that trait-like self-regulatory orientations are differentially related to specific eating styles, which may inspire intervention approaches for the reduction of food craving. 
 
Potenza and Grilo (2014) briefly summarize contemporary research on food craving such as its neuronal underpinnings. They also highlight its relevance in obesity and binge eating disorder and suggest that research on and therapy of these disorders may benefit from providing an addiction framework. For instance, some approaches that effectively target drug cravings have also been shown to reduce food cravings. In a similar vein, Davis et al. (2014) investigated the effects of a methylphenidate challenge in individuals exhibiting addiction-like eating behavior. Individuals with “food addiction” reported more intense food craving than controls and were resistant to the food intake suppression that is typically induced by dopamine agonists. This supports that compulsive overeating is related to increased food craving and dopamine signaling-strength differences.","[{'authorId': '1402115959', 'name': 'Boris C Rodríguez-Martín'}, {'authorId': '6410012', 'name': 'Adrian Meule'}]",114.0,,28.0,"Food craving: new contributions on its assessment, moderators, and consequences",2015.0

Results revealed that those with OCD had significantly higher anxiety in the virtual environment than did healthy controls, and the decreased ratio of anxiety in participants with OCD was also higher than that of healthy controls. Moreover, the degree of anxiety of an individual with OCD was positively correlated with a his or her symptom score and immersive tendency score.

Next, we train a deep recurrent-convolutional network inspired by state-of-the-art video classification to learn robust representations from the sequence of images. The proposed approach is designed to preserve the spatial, spectral, and temporal structure of EEG which leads to finding features that are less sensitive to variations and distortions within each dimension.

This review synthesized literature concerning the effect of VR exercise on anxiety and depression among various populations. Methods: Ten electronic databases were searched for studies on this topic from January 2000 through October 2017. Studies were eligible if the article: (1) was peer-reviewed; (2) was published in English; and (3) used quantitative measures in assessing anxiety- and depression-related outcomes. Results: A total of five empirical studies met the eligibility criteria. These studies included two randomized clinical trials, one control trial, and two cross-sectional studies. Four studies reported significant improvements in anxiety- and depression-related measures following VR exercise, including reduced tiredness and tension, in addition to increased energy and enjoyment. Nonetheless, one study failed to support the effectiveness of VR exercise over traditional exercise alone on depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings favor VR exercise in alleviating anxiety and depression symptomology. However, existing evidence is insufficient to support the advantages of VR exercise as a standalone treatment over traditional therapy in the alleviation of anxiety and depression given the paucity of studies, small sample sizes, and lack of high-quality research designs.

Typically, these assessments employ paper-and-pencil psychometrics, hands-on analog/computer tests, and rating of behavior within the context of real-world functional environments. Virtual reality offers the option to produce and distribute identical “standard” simulation environments in which performance can be measured and rehabilitated. Within such digital scenarios, normative data can be accumulated for performance comparisons needed for assessment/diagnosis and for treatment/rehabilitation purposes. In this manner, reusable archetypic virtual environments constructed for one purpose can also be applied for applications addressing other clinical targets. This article will provide a review of such a retooling approach using a virtual classroom simulation that was originally developed as a controlled stimulus environment in which attention processes could be systematically assessed in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This system is now being applied to other clinical targets including the development of tests that address other cognitive functions, eye movement under distraction conditions, social anxiety disorder, and the creation of an earthquake safety training application for children with developmental and learning disabilities.","[{'authorId': '29861580', 'name': 'A.

By factor analysis, it was found that three factors were sufficient to represent 80 11 ""region-emotion"" variables. For each variable, there is no distinct difference among different region groups. The 12 emotion variables could be divided into four categories, namely, activity index, potency index, definition index, and temperature index. Factor scores were further calculated to study the determinants on each factor. The analysis showed that the three factors were mainly related to chroma, lightness, and hue, respectively. It was concluded that chroma and lightness were the most important factors on color emotion, whereas the influences of hue and cultural background were very limited.

This paper reports on a comparative analysis of 2 user experience evaluations methods with children. A within-subject design was adopted using 20 children aged between 7 and 8. The children played 2 different games on a tablet PCs and their experiences of each were captured using 2 evaluation methods which have been validated with children: the Fun Toolkit and This or That. The results showed that the Fun Toolkit and This or That method yielded similar results and were able to establish a preference for one game over the other. However, there were some inconsistencies between the results of individual tools within the Fun toolkit and some of the constructs being measured in the This or That method. Further research will try to identify any ordering effects within each method and redundancies within the questions.","[{'authorId': '143945613', 'name': 'G.

The feasibility of virtual reality within an inpatient psychiatric care setting was therefore explored. Research design and methods: Eight people with dementia and 16 caregivers were recruited in January and February 2018 from a UK hospital specialising in progressive neurological conditions. A mixed methods design measured affect and behaviour using the Observed Emotion Rating Scale, Overt Aggression Scale-Modified for Neurorehabilitation and St Andrew’s Sexual Behaviour Assessment. Thematic analysis was conducted following semi-structured interviews. Caregivers who worked at the hospital supported people with dementia throughout the process and were interviewed for their views on Head Mounted Display-Virtual Reality (HMD-VR) use with people with dementia. Results HMD-VR was tried and accepted by people with dementia. Participants viewed HMD-VR positively as a ‘change in environment’ and would use it again. People with dementia experienced more pleasure during and after HMD-VR compared to before exposure, as well as increased alertness after. Three core themes emerged: ‘Virtual Reality Experiences’, ‘Impact of Virtual Reality’ and ‘Experiences within the Virtual Environment’. Caregivers discussed preconceptions about virtual reality use and how these changed. Discussion and implications: This is the first study to explore the feasibility of HMD-VR with people with mild to moderately severe dementia in hospital and found that overall HMD-VR is viable. Findings evidence the clinical feasibility of HMD-VR implementation in this environment and inform future research.","[{'authorId': '67265164', 'name': 'Vienna Rose'}, {'authorId': '143974921', 'name': 'Inga Stewart'}, {'authorId': '2055589566', 'name': 'K.

27abaf0e13b9049468f17d1dde8769df81cc0c43,"Owing to advances in neuroimaging technology, the past couple of decades have witnessed a surge of research on brain mechanisms that underlie human cognition. Despite the immense development in cognitive neuroscience, the vast majority of neuroimaging experiments examine isolated agents carrying out artificial tasks in sensory and socially deprived environments. Thus, the understanding of the mechanisms of various domains in cognitive neuroscience, including social cognition and episodic memory, is sorely lacking. Here we focus on social and memory research as representatives of cognitive functions and propose that mainstream, lab-based experimental designs in these fields suffer from two fundamental limitations, pertaining to person-dependent and situation-dependent factors. The person-dependent factor addresses the issue of limiting the active role of the participants in lab-based paradigms that may interfere with their sense of agency and embodiment. The situation-dependent factor addresses the issue of the artificial decontextualized environment in most available paradigms. Building on recent findings showing that real-life as opposed to controlled experimental paradigms involve different mechanisms, we argue that adopting a real-life approach may radically change our understanding of brain and behavior. Therefore, we advocate in favor of a paradigm shift toward a nonreductionist approach, exploiting portable technology in semicontrolled environments, to explore behavior in real life.","[{'authorId': '1397560295', 'name': 'S.

Furthermore, the moderating effect of nutritional knowledge on the relationship between perceived stress and emotional eating and perceived stress and external eating of US Millennials was tested.Design/methodology/approachData was collected from 649 Millennials between the ages of 18 and 35 in the United States, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to test the study hypotheses.FindingsThis study extends the literature and provides further insights into the relationship between US Millennials' eating behavior and stress factors. Perceived stress positively influenced Millennials' emotional and external eating behavior, and nutritional knowledge significantly moderated the relationships between perceived stress and emotional eating and perceived stress and external eating.Research limitations/implicationsFirst, data was collected from Millennials living in the United States. Second, not all of the predictors, save one (perceived stress), were selected and hypothesized as predictors of Millennials' eating behavior. The paper provides the essential psychological elements of US Millennials' eating behavior.Originality/valueIf unbalanced eating and obesity are the result of negative psychological factors, the recommended diet models or physical exercise by themselves may be less effective at combating obesity and related health issues. This is because stress was found to be a highly significant reason for unbalanced eating, new and more practical stress coping strategies are needed to moderate unbalanced eating behavior.","[{'authorId': '95615531', 'name': 'B.

By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed.

2879771bbe4d48f674419c1fbe0b6e2eda67c4d2,"During life, many personal changes occur. These include changing house, school, work, and even friends and partners. However, the daily experience shows clearly that, in some situations, subjects are unable to change even if they want to. The recent advances in psychology and neuroscience are now providing a better view of personal change, the change affecting our assumptive world: (a) the focus of personal change is reducing the distance between self and reality (conflict); (b) this reduction is achieved through (1) an intense focus on the particular experience creating the conflict or (2) an internal or external reorganization of this experience; (c) personal change requires a progression through a series of different stages that however happen in discontinuous and non-linear ways; and (d) clinical psychology is often used to facilitate personal change when subjects are unable to move forward. Starting from these premises, the aim of this paper is to review the potential of virtuality for enhancing the processes of personal and clinical change. First, the paper focuses on the two leading virtual technologies – augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) – exploring their current uses in behavioral health and the outcomes of the 28 available systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Then the paper discusses the added value provided by VR and AR in transforming our external experience by focusing on the high level of personal efficacy and self-reflectiveness generated by their sense of presence and emotional engagement. Finally, it outlines the potential future use of virtuality for transforming our inner experience by structuring, altering, and/or replacing our bodily self-consciousness. The final outcome may be a new generation of transformative experiences that provide knowledge that is epistemically inaccessible to the individual until he or she has that experience, while at the same time transforming the individual’s worldview.","[{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

In the present study, eight students completed VRT individual treatment and post-testing, and six students in a Wait-List control group completed post-testing. Assessment measures included four self-report inventories, self-report of Subjective Units of Discomfort during exposure to VRT and physiological measurements of heart rate during speaking tasks. Four weekly individual exposure treatment sessions of approximately 15 min each were conducted by the author serving as therapist. Results on self-report and physiological measures appear to indicate that four virtual reality treatment sessions were effective in reducing public speaking anxiety in university students, corroborating earlier studies of VRT's effectiveness as a psychotherapeutic modality.

For this reason, obesity treatment requires a more integrated approach than the standard behavioral treatment based on dietary and physical activity only. To test the long-term efficacy of an enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) of obesity, including a virtual reality (VR) module aimed at both unlocking the negative memory of the body and to modify its behavioral and emotional correlates, 163 female morbidly obese inpatients (body mass index >40) were randomly assigned to three conditions: a standard behavioral inpatient program (SBP), SBP plus standard CBT, and SBP plus VR-enhanced CBT. Patients' weight, eating behavior, and body dissatisfaction were measured at the start and upon completion of the inpatient program. Weight was assessed also at 1 year follow-up. All measures improved significantly at discharge from the inpatient program, and no significant difference was found among the conditions. However, odds ratios showed that patients in the VR condition had a greater probability of maintaining or improving weight loss at 1 year follow-up than SBP patients had (48% vs. 11%, p = 0.004) and, to a lesser extent, than CBT patients had (48% vs. 29%, p = 0.08). Indeed, only the VR-enhanced CBT was effective in further improving weight loss at 1 year follow-up. On the contrary, participants who received only the inpatient program regained back, on average, most of the weight they had lost. Findings support the hypothesis that a VR module addressing the locked negative memory of the body may enhance the long-term efficacy of standard CBT.","[{'authorId': '3369360', 'name': 'G.

28dd55c0ec8aa5814c64005a33d8ebd9d8e1dea3,"The trend of distance learning education has increased year by year because of the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies. Distance learning system can be regarded as one of ubiquitous computing applications since the learners can study anywhere even in mobile environments. However, the instructor cannot know if the learners comprehend the lecture or not since each learner is physically isolated. Therefore, a framework which detects the learners’ concentration condition is required. If a distance learning system obtains the information that many learners are not concentrated on the class due to the incomprehensible lecture style, the instructor can perceive it through the system and change the presentation strategy. This is a context-aware technology which is widely used for ubiquitous computing services. In this paper, an efficient distance learning system, which accurately detects learners’ concentration condition during a class, is proposed. The proposed system uses multiple biological information which are learners’ eye movement metrics, i.e. fixation counts, fixation rate, fixation duration and average saccade length obtained by an eye tracking system.

Naturalistic and complex (e.g. movie) stimuli are increasingly used in empirical research but their analysis often relies on considerable human efforts to label or extract stimulus features. Here we present data-driven analysis strategies that help to obtain interpretable results from multisubject neuroimaging data when complex movie stimuli are used. These analyses a) enable localization and visualization of brain activity using standard statistical parametric maps in the subspace of brain activity shared between subjects and b) facilitate interpretation of intersubject correlations.

In a pre-registered laboratory experiment (N = 180), participants interacted with an ostensible partner (a student from the same university as them) on a series of real-stakes economic games after (a) taking the perspective of the partner in a virtual reality, “day-in-the-life” simulation, (b) taking the perspective of a different person in a “day-in-the-life” simulation, or (c) doing a neutral activity in a virtual environment. The VRPT experience successfully increased participants’ subsequent propensity to take the perspective of their partner (a facet of empathy), but only if the partner was the same person whose perspective participants assumed in the virtual reality simulation. Further, this effect of VRPT on perspective-taking was moderated by participants’ reported feeling of immersion in the virtual environment.

Standard-of-care for opioid use disorder (OUD) includes medication and counseling. However, there is an unmet need for complementary approaches to treat OUD patients coping with pain; furthermore, few studies have probed neurobiological features of pain or its management during OUD treatment. This preliminary study examines neurobiological and behavioral effects of a virtual reality-based meditative intervention in patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT).


DESIGN
Prospective, non-blinded, single-arm, 12-week intervention with standardized assessments.


SETTING
Academic research laboratory affiliated with an on-site MMT clinic.


METHODS
Fifteen (11 female) MMT patients completed a virtual reality, therapist-guided meditative intervention that included breathing and relaxation exercises; sessions were scheduled twice weekly. Assessments included functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of pain neuromatrix activation and connectivity (pre- and post-intervention), saliva cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12; and self-reported pain and affective symptoms before and after each intervention session.


RESULTS
After each intervention session (relative to pre-session), ratings of pain, opioid craving, anxiety and depression (but not anger) decreased. Saliva cortisol (but not CRP) levels decreased from pre- to post-session. From pre- to post-intervention fMRI assessments, pain task-related left postcentral gyrus (PCG) activation decreased. At baseline, PCG showed positive connectivity with other regions of the pain neuromatrix, but this pattern changed post-intervention.


CONCLUSIONS
These preliminary findings demonstrate feasibility, therapeutic promise, and brain basis of a meditative intervention for OUD patients undergoing MMT.","[{'authorId': '114547972', 'name': 'M.

In VSP, users are immersed in an experience of another person to aid in understanding the person's perspective. Users are immersed by 1) providing input to user senses from logs of the target person's senses, 2) instructing users to act and interact like the target, and 3) reminding users that they are playing the role of the target. These guidelines are applied to a scenario where taking the perspective of others is crucial - the medical interview. A pilot study (n = 16) using this scenario indicates VSP elicits reflection on the perspectives of others and changes behavior in future, similar social interactions. By encouraging reflection and change, VSP advances the state-of-the-art in training social interactions with virtual experiences.","[{'authorId': '3056335', 'name': 'A.

Design A 12 week single blind parallel group randomised controlled trial. Setting Academic medical centre. Participants 94 self referred adult outpatients with a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder and a modified Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (BDD-YBOCS) score of ≥20. Concurrent psychotropic drug treatment was permitted if the dose had been stable for at least two months before enrolment and remained unchanged during the trial. Interventions Participants received either BDD-NET (n=47) or supportive therapy (n=47) delivered via the internet for 12 weeks. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the BDD-YBOCS score after treatment and follow-up (three and six months from baseline) as evaluated by a masked assessor. Responder status was defined as a ≥30% reduction in symptoms on the scale. Secondary outcomes were measures of depression (MADRS-S), global functioning (GAF), clinical global improvement (CGI-I), and quality of life (EQ5D). The six month follow-up time and all outcomes other than BDD-YBOCS and MADRS-S at 3 months were not pre-specified in the registration at clinicaltrials.gov because of an administrative error but were included in the original trial protocol approved by the regional ethics committee before the start of the trial. Results BDD-NET was superior to supportive therapy and was associated with significant improvements in severity of symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD-YBOCS group difference −7.1 points, 95% confidence interval −9.8 to −4.4), depression (MADRS-S group difference −4.5 points, −7.5 to −1.4), and other secondary measures. At follow-up, 56% of those receiving BDD-NET were classed as responders, compared with 13% receiving supportive therapy. The number needed to treat was 2.34 (1.71 to 4.35). Self reported satisfaction was high. Conclusions CBT can be delivered safely via the internet to patients with body dysmorphic disorder. BDD-NET has the potential to increase access to evidence based psychiatric care for this mental disorder, in line with NICE priority recommendations. It could be particularly useful in a stepped care approach, in which general practitioner or other mental health professionals can offer treatment to people with mild to moderate symptoms at low risk of suicide.

This model stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions, which posit that a discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion. We propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect.

All subjects had given their informed consent. After a clinical diagnosis in an andrologic center, 50 presumably psychological ED (average age 43.7 years), 60 mixed ED (53.9 years) and 50 primary PE (39 years) who suffered these problems over 6 months were undergoing a cycle of 12 sessions, over a 25-week period, of psychotherapy, integrating an audio CD and helmet with miniature television screens that projected specially designed CD-ROM program on the ontogenetic development of male sexual identity. The clinical follow up was done after 6 and 12 months after the cycle. After one year, the overall partial (two times out of three) and complete positive response rate for psychological ED was 75%, for mixed ED was 47% and for PE was 54%. We considered drop-out cases as only before the 7th session of the treatment cycle, the drop-outs after session 7 and the patients that did not show up for follow-up are counted as negative results. Two patients reported nausea and one, vertigo during the first 15-min virtual reality experience. Considering the particular way that full-immersion virtual reality involves the subject who experiences it, we hypothesized that this methodological approach could speed up the therapeutic process. The evidence that positive results persist over time allows us to hypothesize that certain changes in cerebral function can be possible and that these changes are correlated to favorable sexual performance in the male.","[{'authorId': '3313882', 'name': 'G.

Success was gauged according to whether treatment resulted in a 30 percent or greater improvement in the PTSD symptom severity as assessed by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) after 10 weeks of treatment. Seven of 10 participants improved by 30 percent or greater while in VR-GET, whereas only 1 of the 9 returning participants in TAU showed similar improvement. This is a clinically and statistically significant result (χ(2) = 6.74, p < 0.01, relative risk 3.2). Participants in VR-GET improved an average of 35 points on the CAPS, whereas those in TAU averaged a 9-point improvement (p < 0.05).

Comorbidity in ED has been associated with higher rates of severity, functional impairment, and chronicity. However, no attempts have been made in the literature to systematically review whether these studies include assessments to evaluate the treatment response in comorbid diagnoses, in addition to the principal diagnosis. Moreover, transdiagnostic treatments have been developed for a range of ED, but to date no study has analyzed the real distribution of diagnoses in these studies. The current study aimed to analyze: a) whether treatment response in comorbidity is evaluated in transdiagnostic treatments for ED; b) what diagnoses are targeted in transdiagnostic treatments for ED; and c) the real distribution of the diagnoses at baseline in these studies. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Fifty-two randomized controlled trials were identified, with a total of 7007 adult participants. The results showed that, although most of the studies reported data on comorbidity at baseline, only 40% of them examined the effects of the intervention on the comorbid disorders. The most commonly targeted diagnoses in transdiagnostic protocols were panic/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression. Other disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety/depression not otherwise specified, were marginally included in these studies. Regarding the distribution of diagnoses at baseline, generalized anxiety, panic/agoraphobia, social anxiety, and depression were the most frequently observed, whereas depression not otherwise specified was the least represented. The results highlight the importance of assessing comorbidity in addition to the principal diagnoses in transdiagnostic treatments, in order to draw conclusions about the true potential of these interventions to improve comorbid symptoms.

Additionally, baseline patient characteristics were used to detect subgroups of patients who showed a differential response to certain treatment modalities. Primary measures were distance covered, anxiety during the behavioral avoidance test (BAT), and overall fear of small animals. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to explore the overall treatment effect across the exposure modalities. A cluster analysis and an analysis of moderation were conducted to explore differential response to treatments. The main study finding was that the three treatment conditions were similarly efficacious in the treatment of small animal phobia for all study outcomes. Only for distance covered, our results revealed a tendency for iVET to be more effective than VRET and ARET in participants with worse performance on the BAT before treatment. The present study findings provide further evidence for the comparable efficacy of the three forms of exposure. Our results also suggest that, overall, treatments are likely to be similarly effective, regardless of the individual baseline characteristics (i.e., fear, anxiety, and age), whereas pretreatment scores on distance covered in the avoidance test might be used to personalize treatments (iVET may be preferable when participants perform worse at pretreatment).","[{'authorId': '1401314317', 'name': 'C.

Seven representative forest resting environments found in field research in Beijing were used as independent variables and were shown to subjects by a virtual reality (VR) video. Stress level was used as the dependent variable, and blood pressure, heart rate, salivary amylase, and the Brief Profile of Mood States (BPOMS) were used as physiological and psychological indicators. A between-subjects design was used in the experiment. A total of 96 subjects were randomly assigned to each environment type, and only one type of forest resting environment was observed. Through the relevant sample t-test and one-way analysis of variance, the pre- and post-test data of the indicators were analyzed. This study found that all the seven different types of forest resting environments can produce stress relief effects to some extent. Different types of forest resting environments have different effects on relieving stress. The most natural environment does not have the most significant effect on stress relief. A water landscape has a positive effect on the relief of stress. The conclusions of this study are conducive to the better use of the forest environment for forest therapy services.","[{'authorId': '2108114861', 'name': 'Xiaobo Wang'}, {'authorId': '153212187', 'name': 'Yaxing Shi'}, {'authorId': '2155611160', 'name': 'Bo Zhang'}, {'authorId': '122981753', 'name': 'Yencheng Chiang'}]",73.0,,78.0,The Influence of Forest Resting Environments on Stress Using Virtual Reality,2019.0

Subjects were asked to categorize tape-recorded extracts as either funny, sad, interesting or boring and to rate them in order of intensity. The posture displayed when listening to the recordings were then analysed according to these ratings, the whole interview being recorded on videotape without the subject's knowledge. Results showed distinctive postures for all four categories, such as dropping the head for sadness and leaning the head on one hand for boredom, thus providing empirical support for the utility of this methodology as a way of obtaining observations of non-verbal cues under controlled conditions without inducing any artificial self-consciousness in the subjects.","[{'authorId': '35313795', 'name': 'P.

We then chart the development of emotion regulation and describe its role in various facets of normal functioning. Next, we consider what happens when emotion becomes dysregulated in a major depressive episode. We suggest that an emotion regulatory perspective integrates diverse theoretical views of depression and has implications for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of depression.

We explored the associations between sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioral, and educational outcomes of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).


METHOD
Twenty-eight children with ASD (with average-range IQ) were compared with 51 age- and gender-matched typically developing peers on sensory processing and educational outcomes.


RESULTS
For children with ASD, the Short Sensory Profile scores Underresponsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering explained 47% of the variance in academic performance, yet estimated intelligence was not a significant predictor of academic performance. Significant negative correlations were found between (1) auditory filtering and inattention to cognitive tasks, (2) tactile hypersensitivity and hyperactivity and inattention, and (3) movement sensitivity and oppositional behavior.


CONCLUSION
A pattern of auditory filtering difficulties, sensory underresponsiveness, and sensory seeking was associated with academic underachievement in the children with ASD. Children who have difficulty processing verbal instructions in noisy environments and who often focus on sensory-seeking behaviors appear more likely to underachieve academically.","[{'authorId': '1681766', 'name': 'Jill Ashburner'}, {'authorId': '50209176', 'name': 'J.

Student engagement, which is energized by motivation as explained by self-determination theory (SDT), is a prerequisite for learning. Therefore, this study investigated how the three perceived psychological needs in SDT affected student engagement in online learning using pre- and post-questionnaires completed by 1201 Grade 8 and 9 students within 6 weeks of partaking in online learning. The results suggested that digital support strategies better satisfied students’ needs, that all of the needs were predictors of the level of engagement, and that relatedness support was very important.","[{'authorId': '1703646', 'name': 'Thomas K.

2beaaa066b716606a00952073d109f4bd679ce0a,"The number of elderly is growing rapidly, including those that struggle with cognitive decline and, consequently, activities of daily living. Developing interventions that slow down cognitive decline would greatly benefit the autonomy of these elderly, as well as their caretakers. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive and interactive human-computer interface with real-time simulation that is suggested to be a promising tool to improve cognitive functioning. This literature review discusses the features of immersive VR, including its opportunities and limitations, that are of special relevance for improving cognition in elderly. First, the high flexibility of VR allows for personalized and safe training of potentially harmful situations and isolated aspects of tasks. Second, VR’s dynamic and real-time feedback on performance provides a labor-extensive tool for caretakers in elderly care. Third, the acquisition of high resolution data enables the exposure of subtle changes over time, relevant for detecting the nature and extent of cognitive changes in elderly, including those with dementia. Fourth, immersive VR has been related to cybersickness. Finally, VR is immersive and enables the perception and expression of emotions, motor behaviors, and multiple senses. Aged subjects are found to have sparing of emotional learning and show increased reliance on multisensory integration for learning. Moreover, they experience high levels of flow, motivation, and presence in VR setups. Despite the clear potential of immersive VR, the studies available are small scale and have not been replicated. The digital illiteracy of elderly and healthcare personnel form an additional barrier for implementation. Hence, while replication of outcomes and standardization of VR interventions is required before it can be used in standard care, VR may provide a particularly effective tool for training cognition in elderly.","[{'authorId': '1937522287', 'name': 'A.

2c1f2910ffe9ac37b2de7262864c10e3b9baa1be,"This paper reviews the literature and highlights the need for further research regarding the phenomenology, etiology, assessment, and treatment of co-morbid depression in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). Depression occurs in youths with ADHD at a significantly higher rate than in youths without ADHD. Youths with ADHD and depression together have a more severe course of psychopathology and a higher risk of long-term impairment and suicide than youths with either disorder alone. Assessment of such co-morbid depression is complicated by overlapping symptoms with ADHD and with other disorders that commonly occur with ADHD. Depressive disorders typically emerge several years after the onset of ADHD and may arise from environmental difficulties associated with chronic ADHD that interact with genetic risks as the child gets older. Despite a scarcity of well-designed treatment studies for youths with ADHD and co-morbid depression, there is increasing preliminary evidence for the role of stimulants, selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, and atomoxetine to target either or both disorders. There is also some indirect evidence for the benefit of combining pharmacological treatments with psychosocial interventions that specifically target relevant environmental factors and functional impairments.","[{'authorId': '4493382', 'name': 'W.

Specifically, we exploit theoretical and empirical concepts from psychology and art theory to extract image features that are specific to the domain of artworks with emotional expression. For testing and training, we use three data sets: the International Affective Picture System (IAPS); a set of artistic photography from a photo sharing site (to investigate whether the conscious use of colors and textures displayed by the artists improves the classification); and a set of peer rated abstract paintings to investigate the influence of the features and ratings on pictures without contextual content.

The system automatically estimates fear level based on multimodal sensory data and a self-reported emotion assessment. There are two modalities of expressing fear ratings: the 2-choice scale, where 0 represents relaxation and 1 stands for fear; and the 4-choice scale, with the following correspondence: 0—relaxation, 1—low fear, 2—medium fear and 3—high fear. A set of features was extracted from the sensory signals using various metrics that quantify brain (electroencephalogram—EEG) and physiological linear and non-linear dynamics (Heart Rate—HR and Galvanic Skin Response—GSR). The novelty consists in the automatic adaptation of exposure scenario according to the subject’s affective state. We acquired data from acrophobic subjects who had undergone an in vivo pre-therapy exposure session, followed by a Virtual Reality therapy and an in vivo evaluation procedure. Various machine and deep learning classifiers were implemented and tested, with and without feature selection, in both a user-dependent and user-independent fashion. The results showed a very high cross-validation accuracy on the training set and good test accuracies, ranging from 42.5% to 89.5%. The most important features of fear level classification were GSR, HR and the values of the EEG in the beta frequency range. For determining the next exposure scenario, a dominant role was played by the target fear level, a parameter computed by taking into account the patient’s estimated fear level.","[{'authorId': '143850275', 'name': 'O.

2c8344b987a38fdcc0547d541d03a9768f5ff914,"Forest recreation can be successfully conducted for the purpose of psychological relaxation, as has been proven in previous scientific studies. During the winter in many countries, when snow cover occurs frequently, forest recreation (walking, relaxation, photography, etc.) is common. Nevertheless, whether forest therapy conducted in a forest environment with a snow cover will also have a positive effect on psychological indicators remains unknown. Furthermore, male subjects frequently participate in forest therapy experiments, whereas females are rarely involved. Thus, in this study, the effectuality of forest recreation during winter and with snow cover was tested on 32 young females. For these reasons, the experiment involved 15 min periods of relaxation in a forest environment or in an urban street environment, in addition to a pre-test under indoor conditions (randomized controlled study). Four psychological questionnaires Profile of Mood States (POMS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Restorative Outcome Scale (ROS), Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS)) were administered to participants before and after interventions. Results showed that participants’ levels of negative mood, as measured by different aspects of the POMS questionnaire (tension/anxiety, anger/hostility, depression/dejection, confusion, and fatigue), decreased after exposure to the forest environment. In contrast, both tension/anxiety and anger/hostility increased in the urban street environment. The indicator of negative affect from the PANAS questionnaire also increased after exposure to the urban street environment, whereas the indicator of positive affect based on PANAS was higher in the forest environment than in the urban street environment. Restorativeness and subjective vitality exhibited higher values after exposure to the forest environment in comparison to those from the control and pre-test. The changes in these indicators demonstrate that forest recreation in the snow during winter can significantly increase psychological relaxation in females, as well as show that recreation can be successfully conducted under these winter conditions.","[{'authorId': '5808884', 'name': 'E.

Applications such as Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy interventions have accumulated considerable evidence of efficacy and some evidence of effectiveness. These programs have achieved similar outcomes to face-to-face therapy, while requiring much less clinician time. There is now burgeoning interest in integrating e-mental health resources with the broader mental health delivery system, particularly in primary care. The Australian government has supported the development and deployment of e-mental health resources, including websites that provide information, peer-to-peer support, automated self-help, and guided interventions. An ambitious national project has been commissioned to promote key resources to clinicians, to provide training in their use, and to evaluate the impact of promotion and training upon clinical practice. Previous initiatives have trained clinicians to use a single e-mental health program or a suite of related programs. In contrast, the current initiative will support community-based service providers to access a diverse array of resources developed and provided by many different groups. Objective The objective of this paper was to develop a conceptual framework to support the use of e-mental health resources in routine primary health care. In particular, models of clinical practice are required to guide the use of the resources by diverse service providers and to inform professional training, promotional, and evaluation activities. Methods Information about service providers’ use of e-mental health resources was synthesized from a nonsystematic overview of published literature and the authors’ experience of training primary care service providers. Results Five emerging clinical practice models are proposed: (1) promotion; (2) case management; (3) coaching; (4) symptom-focused treatment; and (5) comprehensive therapy. We also consider the service provider skills required for each model and the ways that e-mental health resources might be used by general practice doctors and nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, counselors, and peer workers Conclusions The models proposed in the current paper provide a conceptual framework for policy-makers, researchers and clinicians interested in integrating e-mental health resources into primary care. Research is needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the models in routine care and the best ways to support their implementation.","[{'authorId': '144896428', 'name': 'J.

SettingThe study was conducted in a burn care unit at a regional trauma center. PatientsSeven patients aged 9–32 years (mean age of 21.9 years; average of 23.7% total body surface area burned [range, 3–60%]) performed range-of-motion exercises of their injured extremity under an occupational therapist's direction on at least 3 separate days each. InterventionFor each physical therapy session, each patient spent equal amounts of time in virtual reality and in the control condition (no distraction). The mean duration of physical therapy in virtual reality was 3.5, 4.9, and 6.4 minutes for the first, second, and third session, respectively. Condition order was randomized and counterbalanced. Outcome MeasuresFor each of the three physical therapy sessions, five visual analog pain scores for each treatment condition served as the dependent variables. ResultsPain ratings were statistically lower when patients were in virtual reality, and the magnitude of pain reduction did not diminish with repeated use of virtual reality. The results of this study may be examined in more detail at www.vrpain.com. ConclusionsAlthough the small sample size limits generalizability, results provide converging preliminary evidence that virtual reality can function as a strong nonpharmacological pain reduction technique for burn patients during physical therapy.

Treatment was completed by participants (n=10) meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)‐IV criteria for social phobia, or panic disorder with agoraphobia in which public speaking was the predominantly feared stimulus. Treatment was conducted by a licensed psychologist in an outpatient clinic. Treatment consisted of eight individual therapy sessions, including four sessions of anxiety management training and four sessions of exposure therapy using a virtual audience, according to a standardized treatment manual. Participants completed standardized self‐report questionnaires assessing public‐speaking anxiety at pre‐treatment, post‐treatment, and 3‐month follow‐up. Participants were asked to give a speech to an actual audience at pre‐ and post‐treatment. Results showed decreases on all self‐report measures of public‐speaking anxiety from pre‐ to post‐treatment, which were maintained at follow‐up (n=8; all P<.05). Participants were no more likely to complete a speech post‐treatment than at pre‐treatment. This study provides preliminary evidence that a cognitive‐behavioral treatment using virtual reality for exposure to public speaking may reduce public‐speaking anxiety and suggests that further research with a controlled design is needed.

Globally, access to evidence-based psychological treatment is limited. Innovative self-help methods using smartphone applications and low-cost virtual reality have the potential to significantly improve the accessibility and scalability of psychological treatments.


Objective
To examine the effectiveness of ZeroPhobia, a fully self-guided app-based virtual reality cognitive behavior therapy (VR CBT) using low-cost (cardboard) virtual reality goggles compared with a wait-list control group and to determine its user friendliness.


Design, Setting, and Participants
In a single-blind randomized clinical trial, participants were enrolled between March 24 and September 28, 2017, and randomly assigned (1:1) by an independent researcher to either VR CBT app or a wait-list control group. A total of 193 individuals aged 18 to 65 years from the Dutch general population with acrophobia symptoms and access to an Android smartphone participated. The 6 animated modules of the VR-CBT app and gamified virtual reality environments were delivered over a 3-week period in participants' natural environment. Assessments were completed at baseline, immediately after treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Analysis began April 6, 2018, and was intention to treat.


Intervention
Self-guided app-based VR CBT.


Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary outcome measure was the Acrophobia Questionnaire. The hypothesis was formulated prior to data collection.


Results
In total, 193 participants (129 women [66.84%]; mean [SD] age, 41.33 [13.64] years) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 96) or a wait-list control group (n = 97). An intent-to-treat analysis showed a significant reduction of acrophobia symptoms at posttest at 3 months for the VR-CBT app compared with the controls (b = -26.73 [95% CI, -32.12 to -21.34]; P < .001; d = 1.14 [95% CI, 0.84 to 1.44]). The number needed to treat was 1.7. Sensitivity and robustness analysis confirmed these findings. Pretreatment attrition was 22 of 96 (23%) because of smartphone incompatibility. Of the 74 participants who started using the VR-CBT app, 57 (77%) completed the intervention fully.


Conclusions and Relevance
A low-cost fully self-guided app-based virtual reality cognitive behavioral therapy with rudimentary virtual reality goggles can produce large acrophobia symptom reductions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that virtual reality acrophobia treatment can be done at home without the intervention of a therapist.

2d5449d8b29921d0d53b8dd03f35f777ef021e79,"Children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suffer from a variety of emotional and social difficulties including high levels of depression, anxiety, poor regulation, other executive malfunctions, and lack of satisfying social experiences (Bird et al., 1993; Greene et al., 2001; Gillberg et al., 2004; Barkley, 2006; Klimkeit et al., 2006; Daviss, 2008; Elia et al., 2008; McQuade and Hoza, 2008; Anastopoulos et al., 2011; Larson et al., 2011). Pharmaceutical treatment of ADHD may be effective for ameliorating the manifestations of ADHD but there may also be a need for supplementary psychotherapeutic interventions (Chronis et al., 2006). 
 
Engendering hope is an ancillary supportive therapy that can provide individuals with ADHD the positive coping skills and appropriate psychic framework for handling the challenges that they confront. Hope, in this context, is a psychological construct that relates to the ability of individuals to set themselves meaningful goals, to find channels to reach these goals, and to consistently work toward achieving these goals (Snyder et al., 1991). 
 
A potential tool for instilling hope in patients with ADHD is virtual reality (VR) (Riva, 2005). VR is an advanced form of human-computer interface that allows the user to interact with, and feel present within a computer generated environment. Similar to Descartes' deceiving god but with nobler intentions, researchers are utilizing models of immersive virtual therapy that enable individuals with physical/mental challenges such as chronic pain to set meaningful goals and visualize alternative realities where their pain or disability is minimized (Magora et al., 2006). For example, Hoffman et al. (2011) have presented VR systems that facilitate distraction thereby reducing perceived pain in individuals undergoing painful medical procedures such as non-pharmacologic analgesic for acute burn pain (Hoffman et al., 2011). In addition, we have recently introduced a combined VR-biofeedback system that allows individuals with chronic headache to learn to reduce their physiological arousal, following which, they can their view virtual image as headache free (Shiri et al., 2012a). Utilizing VR for generating hope in ADHD children whom have significant difficulties in creating and holding images is especially challenging as it based on forming a durable interface with computer-based VR programs. 
 
Recently, we have utilized a self-face recognition paradigm to enhance the verisimilitude of a VR-generated substituted reality (Shiri et al., 2012a, 2013). Self-face recognition programs have been successfully utilized for post-stroke disability and pain reduction. Self-face recognition creates a unique cerebral activity pattern which does not occur even when significant others, such as family members are recognized. Viewing a smile has the potential of activating brain structures that are related to reward and positive emotions. Positive emotions may enhance creative thinking and improve cognitive processes, necessary for effective coping with various challenges (Muehlberger et al., 2011). Although specific relationships between activation of reward structures and positive emotions need to be examined utilizing brain imaging techniques, a recent study suggested that static pictures of emotional facial expressions activate brain structures that are involved in the processing of emotional stimuli (Johnson et al., 2010). Similarly, a sequence of emotional facial expressions changes occur, different brain networks are involved. For example, it was found that the onset of happy and the offset of angry expressions induced significant activation in the left dorsal striatum (Johnson et al., 2010). These findings would suggest that the VR paradigm may be useful for children with ADHD as the interaction of salient brain activity created by self-face recognition together with the activation of reward brain centers produce a platform that is both cerebrally robust and emotionally positive for self-confidence and growth.","[{'authorId': '144920903', 'name': 'S.

2dd330aaaa2e74719a9ca4455c0686ed17437d12,"Background: Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are often underreported by patients and mainly triggered in the patients private domain, making it harder for clinicians to recognize OCD. Virtual reality (VR) can be used to assess OCD symptoms in the clinician's office. We developed a VR game in order to provoke subjective and physiological OCD symptoms. We hypothesize that (1) the VR game provokes more OCD symptoms in patients compared to healthy controls, (2) performing virtual compulsions leads to a reduction in emotional responses in OCD patients and that (3) the severity of VR game provoked symptoms correlates with severity of OCD symptoms. Methods: Participants played the VR game on a laptop while physiological measures were recorded simultaneously. We measured emotional responses, virtual compulsions and physiological arousal in response to our VR game in 26 OCD patients and 26 healthy controls. We determined correlations between emotional responses, virtual compulsions and OCD severity. Results: We found higher levels of VR-provoked anxiety (U = 179.5, p = 0.004) and virtual compulsions in OCD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.001). There was a significant reduction in emotional responses after performing virtual compulsions in the OCD patients. The emotional responses and virtual compulsions did not correlate significantly with Y-BOCS scores. A baseline difference between patients and healthy controls was found in heart rate variability (HRV), but no significant change in HRV, heartrate and skin conductance was found during the VR game Conclusions: Our study clearly shows our OCD VR game is capable of provoking more anxiety and virtual compulsions in patients with OCD compared to healthy controls. Providing a direct patient-rated measurement in the clinicians room, the VR game could help in assessing core OCD symptoms and recognizing OCD.

2e40d128a664ff112344dfbec24c345ea58ac439,"The construct of empathy may be located conceptually at several different points in the network of interpersonal cognition and emotion. We discuss one specific form of emotional empathy--other-focused feelings evoked by perceiving another person in need. First, evidence is reviewed suggesting that there are at least two distinct types of congruent emotional responses to perceiving another in need: feelings of personal distress (e.g., alarmed, upset, worried, disturbed, distressed, troubled, etc.) and feelings of empathy (e.g., sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, etc.). Next, evidence is reviewed suggesting that these two emotional responses have different motivational consequences. Personal distress seems to evoke egoistic motivation to reduce one's own aversive arousal, as a traditional Hullian tension-reduction model would propose. Empathy does not. The motivation evoked by empathy may instead be altruistic, for the ultimate goal seems to be reduction of the other's need, not reduction of one's own aversive arousal. Overall, the recent empirical evidence appears to support the more differentiated view of emotion and motivation proposed long ago by McDougall, not the unitary view proposed by Hull and his followers.","[{'authorId': '2243828035', 'name': 'C.

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR. Future studies could aim to test the efficacy of social support for people with difficulties in self-regulation, for example individuals with high social anxiety, with a view to developing training programs in VR.","[{'authorId': '2124332447', 'name': 'Lina Stallmann'}, {'authorId': '2054039824', 'name': 'Michel Tran'}, {'authorId': '3090887', 'name': 'D.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.","[{'authorId': '3308557', 'name': 'S.

A mobile imaging approach was needed to study cognitive processes that are inherently based on the use of human physical structure to obtain behavioral goals. This review gives examples of the tight coupling between human physical structure with cognitive processing and the role of supraspinal activity during control of human stance and locomotion. Existing brain imaging methods for actively behaving participants are described and new sensor technology allowing for mobile recordings of different behavioral states in humans is introduced. Finally, we review recent work demonstrating the feasibility of a MoBI system that was developed at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego, demonstrating the range of behavior that can be investigated with this method.","[{'authorId': '3128704', 'name': 'K.

This technology has the potential to provide mental stimulation, a connection to autobiographical memory through reminiscence, and enhanced quality of life (QoL) to people living with dementia (PLWD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this mini-review, we examine the available evidence from studies reporting on the potential benefits of virtual and augmented reality to provide enjoyable, leisurely activities that may promote QoL and psychological well-being and facilitate social interaction. In total, 10 studies of varying study designs and durations (5 min to 6 months) using virtual (n = 9) and augmented reality (n = 1) were examined in PLWD (n = 6) and MCI (n= 3), in addition to 1 study that included participants with both conditions. Overall, the virtual experiences were enjoyed by the participants, improved their mood and apathy, and were preferred when compared with nonvirtual experiences. However, small sample sizes and variations in study design limit the generalizability of the results. Nevertheless, the use of virtual and augmented reality technology for PLWD and MCI is a novel and emerging method which may provide cognitive stimulation and improve well-being. Future research should explore the potential application of this technology to promote social interaction in both the community and aged care settings. We suggest future studies in PLWD and MCI assess the effects of more sustained use of virtual and augmented reality technology on psychological outcomes including QoL, apathy, and depressive symptoms, with the incorporation of physiological biomarker outcomes.","[{'authorId': '1398945667', 'name': ""N.

One critical way in which these interpersonal bonds are formed and maintained is via empathy, our emotional reactivity toward others’ experiences. However, the extent to which individuals from different cultures vary in their dispositional empathy, and the correlates of these differences, are relatively unknown. Thus, the current study explored cultural variation in empathy, and how this variation is related to psychological characteristics and prosocial behavior across cultures. Evidence from an original sample of 104,365 adults across 63 countries reveals that higher empathy countries also have higher levels of collectivism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, self-esteem, emotionality, subjective well-being, and prosocial behavior. These findings reveal that empathy is situated within a broader nomological network of other psychological characteristics, emotional expression and experiences, and prosocial behavior across cultures. The current study expands our understanding about how psychological characteristics vary across cultures and how these characteristics can manifest in broader national indicators of prosocial behavior.","[{'authorId': '3186745', 'name': 'W.

Although many individuals use opioid drugs as part of legitimate pain management plans, a significant number misuse prescription or illicit opioids. With regular opioid use, individuals develop tolerance and physical dependence; both are predictable, physiologic responses to repeated opioid exposure. However, a substantial number of individuals who misuse opioids will develop opioid use disorder (OUD), a complex, primary, chronic, neurobiological disease rooted in genetic, environmental and psychosocial factors.

Immersive virtual environment technology (IVET) enables novel explorations of health behavior modeling.

The reinforcement group performed significantly more exercise in a voluntary phase than those in other conditions. Study 2 separated reward (weight loss) from punishment (weight gain) and also explored model identification by contrasting the effects of a VRS with a VRO (virtual representation of an other); participants exercised significantly more when they viewed the VRS, regardless of whether reward or punishment was shown. In Study 3, participants were exposed to either a VRS running on a treadmill, a VRO running, or a VRS loitering, and we examined effects 24 hours after the experiment.

Animal and human studies on neural pathways underlying social buffering typically examined physiological reactions or regional brain activations. However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings. Results of the current study provide evidence for a distinct neural process model of aversive emotion regulation in humans by social buffering.","[{'authorId': '7775987', 'name': 'Satja Mulej Bratec'}, {'authorId': '2067212278', 'name': 'Teresa Bertram'}, {'authorId': '1751526633', 'name': 'G.

The study aimed to explore how the emotional reactions of participants changed according to the confederate’s status signals as well as signals that they belong to the same or a different ethnic group. Participants’ alertness, calmness, and engagement were monitored using electroencephalogram (EEG) during the original virtual reality (VR) video sessions. Participants’ distress and empathy when exposed to helping interactions were self-assessed after the VR video sessions. The results pointed out that, irrespective of whether they helped the confederate or were helped by him/her, white participants showed higher levels of alertness when exposed to helping interactions involving a white beggar or a black businessman, and their emotional calmness and engagement were higher when interacting with a black beggar or a white businessman. The results for self-assessed distress and empathy followed the same tendency, indicating how physiological and self-assessed measures can both contribute to a better understanding of the emotional processes in virtual intergroup helping situations.

Methods A single-case research design with an ideographic approach was selected given the novelty of this intervention. A blended single case experimental design was used combining the Multiple-baseline design across individuals with a reversal design to examine the effects of VR nature scenes on agitation. Visual analysis was used to determine changes in mean, level, and latency of the behaviors. Results For both participants, a significant decrease in their respective agitation behaviors was observed during intervention phases. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence of the utility of VR as a brief and effective intervention to decrease agitation in individuals with dementia. Clinical Implications These initial, promising results may help caregivers improve the quality of life for dementia patients.

The primary goals of this study are to analyze the possible use of virtual reality (VR) as an affective medium and research the relationship between immersion and emotion. To investigate these objectives, we compared two viewing conditions (HMD vs. No-HMD) and applied two types of emotional content (horror and empathy) to examine whether the level of immersion could influence emotional responses. The results showed that viewers who watched the horror movie using HMD felt more scared than those in the No-HMD condition. However, there were no significant emotional differences between the HMD and No-HMD conditions in the movie groups exposed to empathy. Regarding these results, we may assume that the effect of an immersive viewing experience on emotional responses in VR is deeply related to the degree of arousal and strong perceptual cues. The horror movie used in this study included intense visual and audio stimuli found in the typical horror film format. In contrast, viewers experienced less stimulating perceptual input when they are watching the empathetic movie. In conclusion, VR undoubtedly elicits a more immersive experience and greater emotional responses to the horror film. This study has confirmed the efficacy of VR as an emotional amplifier and successfully demonstrated the important association between immersion and emotion in VR.","[{'authorId': '3279749', 'name': 'Aelee Kim'}, {'authorId': '51246922', 'name': 'Minha Chang'}, {'authorId': '2111166025', 'name': 'Yeseul Choi'}, {'authorId': '51236000', 'name': 'Sohyeon Jeon'}, {'authorId': '2115699233', 'name': 'Kyoungmin Lee'}]",23.0,,7.0,The Effect of Immersion on Emotional Responses to Film Viewing in a Virtual Environment,2018.0

The authors' goal was to examine the efficacy of computer-generated (virtual reality) graded exposure in the treatment of acrophobia (fear of heights).


METHOD
Twenty college students with acrophobia were randomly assigned to virtual reality graded exposure treatment (N = 12) or to a waiting-list comparison group (N = 8). Seventeen students completed the study. Sessions were conducted individually over 8 weeks. Outcome was assessed by using measures of anxiety, avoidance, attitudes, and distress associated with exposure to heights before and after treatment.


RESULTS
Significant differences between the students who completed the virtual reality treatment (N = 10) and those on the waiting list (N = 7) were found on all measures. The treatment group was significantly improved after 8 weeks, but the comparison group was unchanged.


CONCLUSIONS
The authors conclude that treatment with virtual reality graded exposure was successful in reducing fear of heights.","[{'authorId': '1831766', 'name': 'B.

The research was collected and reviewed in terms of the different types of Virtual Reality systems (equipment and levels of immersion) and feasibility of the technology within different stages of demen- tia as well as the methodological limitations. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the healthcare databases advanced search (Medline, PsychINFO, and EMBASE) and snowballing methods. The participants had a dementia diagnosis and the feasibility of Virtual Reality in terms of its acceptability and practicality was discussed. Only five articles met the eligibility criteria. Four included semi-immersive Virtual Reality with participants in the early stages of dementia. One included fully- immersive Virtual Reality where dementia stage ranged from ‘mild’ to ‘severe’. Based on available demographic information, study participants resided in residential care homes, alone in the community or with their spouse. The existing literature sug- gests that both semi and fully-immersive Virtual Reality technology use can be feasible amongst individuals living within the ear- lier stages of dementia outside of a hospital environment, with it being viewed as a welcomed distraction that increased alert- ness and pleasure. However, Virtual Reality was also found to increase fear and anxiety in one study, raising important ethical implications around the safety of the user. The current evidence-base leaves a predominant gap in Virtual Reality technology system use for people within the moderate to later stages of dementia and those living in a hospital environment.","[{'authorId': '67265164', 'name': 'Vienna Rose'}, {'authorId': '143974921', 'name': 'Inga Stewart'}, {'authorId': '2055589566', 'name': 'K.

ASD has a high prevalence in children, affecting 1 in 160 subjects. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an effective tool for intervention in the health field. Different recent papers have reviewed the VR-based treatments in ASD, but they have an important limitation because they only use clinical databases and do not include important technical indexes such as the Web of Science index or the Scimago Journal & Country Rank. To our knowledge, this is the first contribution that has carried out an evidence-based systematic review including both clinical and technical databases about the effectiveness of VR-based intervention in ASD. The initial search identified a total of 450 records. After the exclusion of the papers that are not studies, duplicated articles, and the screening of the abstract and full text, 31 articles met the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes) criteria and were selected for analysis. The studies examined suggest moderate evidence about the effectiveness of VR-based treatments in ASD. VR can add many advantages to the treatment of ASD symptomatology, but it is necessary to develop consistent validations in future studies to state that VR can effectively complement the traditional treatments.","[{'authorId': '1403483742', 'name': 'Patricia Mesa-Gresa'}, {'authorId': '51298290', 'name': 'H.

The neurophysiology of subjective EA, among other mind-brain-body phenomena, can best be tested when subjects are stimulated in a natural fashion. Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables naturalistic experimental stimulation and thus promises to increase the ecological validity of research findings i.e., how well they generalize to real-life settings. In this study, 45 participants experienced virtual rollercoaster rides while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was then trained on the alpha-frequency (8-12 Hz) component of the EEG signal (input) and the retrospectively acquired continuous reports of subjective EA (target). With the LSTM-based model, subjective EA could be predicted significantly above chance level.

To accomplish this, a detailed 410-item questionnaire of psychosocial function and economic cost was sent to every fourth member of the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation. Of the 2,670 members who received the survey, 701 (26.9%) returned it. Outcome measures included symptomatology, course of illness, impact of illness on psychosocial and other functioning, effects of diagnosis and treatment, and economic consequences. The demographics of this group were similar to those in smaller treatment-seeking clinical samples, but not necessarily to OCD sufferers within the US population as a whole. More than half of the patients reported moderate to severe interference in family relationships, socializing, and ability to study or work, secondary to OCD symptoms. A 10.2-year gap was observed between the onset of symptoms and the first attempt to seek professional help, and a 17.2-year gap was observed between the onset of symptoms and receipt of effective treatment. Specific treatments, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors and behavior therapy showed greater symptom improvement, and significantly reduced the total annual fees incurred by OCD patients when compared with nonspecific treatments. Our study results indicate that OCD has a profound effect on psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Large direct costs for OCD, and even larger indirect costs due to lost wages and underemployment were found. Greater awareness of OCD among practitioners may result in earlier diagnosis and more appropriate and cost-effective treatments.","[{'authorId': '97463623', 'name': 'E.

Antonovsky, 1987), sense of coherence (SOC), self-efficacy, and hope (in terms of hope theory; C. R. Snyder, 2002) are considered as protective factors in the demanding academic system. Study goals were to examine the outcomes of a focused workshop for 43 students, targeting the promotion of hope, sense of coherence, and self-efficacy for enhancing students’ academic adjustment as expressed through their grades. Results revealed an effect over the 3 measurement time-points (before the workshop, immediately after it, and after 1 month), as well as the interactions of time and hope levels. Although their mean grades were not statistically different before the intervention, students who achieved higher levels of hope following the workshop got higher grades in the semester following the intervention. SOC and self-efficacy scores were significantly related both to hope levels after 1 month and to mean grades. The implications of this study for promoting a hopeful orientation in educational systems are discussed, and future interventional research is suggested.","[{'authorId': '6633139', 'name': 'Oranit B.

In the first study, the behavior of dispositionally high and low publicly self-conscious women was examined in an interpersonal situation involving rejection by a group. It was hypothesized that persons high in self-consciou sness, being more aware of how they are perceived by others, would be more sensitive and react more negatively to the rejection than those low in self-consciou sness. The predictions were confirmed. In Experiment 2, female subjects were presented with favorable or unfavorable feedback in the context of an interview, and self-attention was experimentally manipulated by exposing half the subjects to their images in a mirror. Self-awareness increased the negative response to the negative evaluation and tended to increase the positivity of the positive evaluation. The implications of selfawareness theory for the social self and social interaction are discussed. Everyday observations as well as theoretical approaches to social behavior suggest that in the presence of others, one is apt to become self-conscious, that is, aware of the self as a social object that can be observed and evaluated by others.

The basic idea of the proposed EEG emotion recognition method is to use a graph to model the multichannel EEG features and then perform EEG emotion classification based on this model. Different from the traditional graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) methods, the proposed DGCNN method can dynamically learn the intrinsic relationship between different electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, represented by an adjacency matrix, via training a neural network so as to benefit for more discriminative EEG feature extraction. Then, the learned adjacency matrix is used to learn more discriminative features for improving the EEG emotion recognition. We conduct extensive experiments on the SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) and DREAMER dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better recognition performance than the state-of-the-art methods, in which the average recognition accuracy of 90.4 percent is achieved for subject dependent experiment while 79.95 percent for subject independent cross-validation one on the SEED database, and the average accuracies of 86.23, 84.54 and 85.02 percent are respectively obtained for valence, arousal and dominance classifications on the DREAMER database.","[{'authorId': '143770005', 'name': 'Tengfei Song'}, {'authorId': '40608983', 'name': 'Wenming Zheng'}, {'authorId': '144840482', 'name': 'Peng Song'}, {'authorId': '144801562', 'name': 'Zhen Cui'}]",554.0,,58.0,EEG Emotion Recognition Using Dynamical Graph Convolutional Neural Networks,2020.0

However, the current research on learning concentration recognition lacks the integration of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral features, and the integration of interaction and vision data for recognition requires further exploration. The way data are collected in a head-mounted display differs from that in a traditional classroom or online learning. Therefore, it is vital to explore a recognition method for learning concentration based on multi-modal features in VR environments. This study proposes a multi-modal feature integration-based learning concentration recognition method in VR environments. It combines interaction and vision data, including measurements of interactive tests, text, clickstream, pupil facial expressions, and eye gaze data, to measure learners’ concentration in VR environments in terms of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral representation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, which integrates interaction and vision data to comprehensively represent the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of learning concentration, outperforms single-dimensional and single-type recognition results in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it was found that learners with higher concentration levels achieve better learning outcomes, and learners’ perceived sense of immersion is an important factor influencing their concentration.","[{'authorId': '2225680673', 'name': 'Renhe Hu'}, {'authorId': '2225677390', 'name': 'Zihan Hui'}, {'authorId': '2110489870', 'name': 'Yifan Li'}, {'authorId': '2090331915', 'name': 'Jueqi Guan'}]",1.0,{'name': 'Sustainability'},46.0,Research on Learning Concentration Recognition with Multi-Modal Features in Virtual Reality Environments,2023.0

In this paper we explore approaches for automatic recognition of engagement from students' facial expressions. We studied whether human observers can reliably judge engagement from the face; analyzed the signals observers use to make these judgments; and automated the process using machine learning. We found that human observers reliably agree when discriminating low versus high degrees of engagement (Cohen's κ = 0.96). When fine discrimination is required (four distinct levels) the reliability decreases, but is still quite high ( κ = 0.56). Furthermore, we found that engagement labels of 10-second video clips can be reliably predicted from the average labels of their constituent frames (Pearson r=0.85), suggesting that static expressions contain the bulk of the information used by observers. We used machine learning to develop automatic engagement detectors and found that for binary classification (e.g., high engagement versus low engagement), automated engagement detectors perform with comparable accuracy to humans. Finally, we show that both human and automatic engagement judgments correlate with task performance.

One possibility is that the mechanisms are based on innate perceptual abilities (e.g., Helmholtz, 1885/1954). Another possibility is that the ability to associate various aspects of music with emotion is learned through exposure to one9s musical culture (e.g., Serafine, 1988). The current research examines the affective responses to major and minor ascending and descending melodies by 5-year-olds, 8-yearolds, and college students. Affective responses to modality did not appear until age eight and affective responses to contour appeared only in the college students. These results are consistent with previous developmental perception experiments on contour and modality (Imberty, 1969; Krumhansl & Keil, 1982; Morrongiello & Roes, 1990) and extend the understanding of the relation of perception, cognition, and culture in determining musical affect.","[{'authorId': '115387980', 'name': 'G.

340c15b85b20be7ac6b7e859c68ace9a21ee902c,"Virtual reality technology provides a strong sense of immersion and interactivity. It is widely used in the fields of anxiety relief, fear therapy, and depression regulation. However, objectively evaluating the emotional intervention effect of virtual reality technology is a difficult problem. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the use of EEG signals to identify individual emotional states in virtual reality scenarios and to improve the computational efficiency and recognition accuracy of emotional valence. To induce the target emotional state of the participants, we established a relatively standard emotion-induced virtual reality video library. The EEG data of the participants were collected synchronously as they watched the virtual reality video. The results show that the emotion recognition performance of multiple features (energy spectrum, differential entropy, differential asymmetry, and rational asymmetry) is better than that of a single feature. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) performed better than the deep belief network (DBN). RBFNN achieves the highest average classification accuracy of 91.1%. By combining the feature selection (F-test) method with the RBFNN, an ideal classification performance can be maintained with computational efficiency improvements. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the features extracted from the theta band outperform features extracted from other bands in emotional valence decoding. These results may contribute to the application of EEG-based affective computing technology in the field of psychological rehabilitation and assessment.","[{'authorId': '35193292', 'name': 'Guanxiong Pei'}, {'authorId': '117639306', 'name': 'Cunhang Fan'}, {'authorId': '2149199629', 'name': 'Taihao Li'}, {'authorId': '2152331555', 'name': 'Jia Jin'}, {'authorId': '2220599079', 'name': 'Rui Wang'}]",0.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2023 7th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing'},30.0,EEG-based Emotion Recognition in Immersive Virtual Reality: Meeting the Requirement of Accuracy and Computational Efficiency,2023.0

Although exertion is the direct goal of many embodied activities (e.g., exergames), and is used indirectly to discourage certain user interactions (as with affordances), exertion has not been used to support direct expressive interaction with an embodied system. Situating exertion in both psychological and physiological literature, this paper suggests guidelines for employing exertion as more than just an incidental component of proprioception in embodied interaction designs. Specifically, the linkages between exertion, affect, and recall are reviewed and analyzed for their potential to support embodied learning activities, and literature concerning human perceptions of effort is reviewed to help designers understand how to incorporate effort more directly and intentionally in embodied interaction designs. Also presented is an illustration of how these guidelines affected the design of an educational embodied interaction experience for an informal learning setting.","[{'authorId': '13403584', 'name': 'L.

Recently introduced dry electrodes with rigid metal pins overcome most of these problems; however, their rigidity causes discomfort and pain. This paper presents dry electrodes offering high user comfort, since they are fabricated from EPDM rubber containing various additives for optimum conductivity, flexibility and ease of fabrication. The electrode impedance is measured on phantoms and human skin. After optimization of the polymer composition, the skin-electrode impedance is only ∼10 times larger than that of gel electrodes. Therefore, these electrodes are directly capable of recording strong biopotential signals such as ECG while for low-amplitude signals such as EEG, the electrodes need to be coupled with an active circuit. EEG recordings using active polymer electrodes connected to a clinical EEG system show very promising results: alpha waves can be clearly observed when subjects close their eyes, and correlation and coherence analyses reveal high similarity between dry and gel electrode signals. Moreover, all subjects reported that our polymer electrodes did not cause discomfort. Hence, the polymer-based dry electrodes are promising alternatives to either rigid dry electrodes or conventional gel electrodes.","[{'authorId': '2046713248', 'name': 'Yun-Hsuan Chen'}, {'authorId': '36454338', 'name': 'M.

However, the conventional methods ignore the spatial characteristics of EEG signals, which also contain salient information related to emotion states. In this paper, a deep learning framework based on a multiband feature matrix (MFM) and a capsule network (CapsNet) is proposed. In the framework, the frequency domain, spatial characteristics, and frequency band characteristics of the multi-channel EEG signals are combined to construct the MFM. Then, the CapsNet model is introduced to recognize emotion states according to the input MFM. Experiments conducted on the dataset for emotion analysis using EEG, physiological, and video signals (DEAP) indicate that the proposed method outperforms most of the common models. The experimental results demonstrate that the three characteristics contained in the MFM were complementary and the capsule network was more suitable for mining and utilizing the three correlation characteristics.","[{'authorId': '3106676', 'name': 'Hao Chao'}, {'authorId': '2152287093', 'name': 'Liang Dong'}, {'authorId': '2119905954', 'name': 'Yongli Liu'}, {'authorId': '2903676', 'name': 'Bao-Yun Lu'}]",183.0,,45.0,Emotion Recognition from Multiband EEG Signals Using CapsNet,2019.0

Converging neuroimaging research suggests altered emotion neurocircuitry in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotion activation studies in these individuals have shown hyperactivation in emotion-related regions, including the amygdala and insula, and hypoactivation in emotion-regulation regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, few studies have examined patterns of connectivity at rest in individuals with PTSD, a potentially powerful method for illuminating brain network structure.


METHODS
Using the amygdala as a seed region, we measured resting-state brain connectivity using 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging in returning male veterans with PTSD and combat controls without PTSD.


RESULTS
Fifteen veterans with PTSD and 14 combat controls enrolled in our study. Compared with controls, veterans with PTSD showed greater positive connectivity between the amygdala and insula, reduced positive connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus, and reduced anticorrelation between the amygdala and dorsal ACC and rostral ACC.


LIMITATIONS
Only male veterans with combat exposure were tested, thus our findings cannot be generalized to women or to individuals with non-combat related PTSD.


CONCLUSION
These results demonstrate that studies of functional connectivity during resting state can discern aberrant patterns of coupling within emotion circuits and suggest a possible brain basis for emotion-processing and emotion-regulation deficits in individuals with PTSD.","[{'authorId': '2489750', 'name': 'Rebecca K.

We suggest that distinct profiles of self-regulated learning behaviors exist across learners. In turn, these profiles appear to be associated with significantly different academic outcomes. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether profiles for self-regulated learning skills and strategies exist among learners. To achieve this purpose, we conducted two studies using two different samples. We administered the Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire (OLSQ), a 24-item scale with a 5-point Likert-type response format, to students enrolled in online degree programs at a large, public university located in the Southwestern United States. The OSLQ consists of six subscale constructs, including environment structuring, goal setting, time management, help seeking, task strategies, and self-evaluation. Latent class analyses were performed with participant subscale scores from the OSLQ. 
 
Our results indicate the presence of five, distinct profiles of self-regulated learning replicated across both study samples: super self-regulators, competent self-regulators, forethought-endorsing self-regulators, performance/reflection self-regulators, and non- or minimal self-regulators. Results also indicate that individuals differ significantly in their academic achievement according to their profile membership; for example, minimal and disorganized profiles of self-regulated learning are both associated with similar, poorer academic outcomes (e.g., lower GPAs).

Height phobia generally has a childhood onset and is diagnosed somewhat more frequently in females than in males. This disorder may result in a restricted lifestyle or interference with certain occupations, depending on the severity. There have been relatively few publications that focused on controlled research on the therapy for treating acrophobia. Behavioral therapy has included exposing the subject to anxiety-producing stimuli. These stimuli are generated through a variety of modalities including imaginary (subject generates stimulus via imagination) and in vivo (subject experiences the real world).2 In addition to current in vivo and imaginary modalities, virtual environments (VEs) can also generate stimuli that will be utilized in desensitization therapy. As in in vivo, systematic desensitization provides stimuli for the patient who cannot imagine well. VE based on stereoscopic head-mounted displays with head tracking will produce visual and auditory stimuli. Unlike the in vivo technique, VE allows therapist-assisted systematic desensitization (SD) within the confines of a clinician’s office, thus avoiding public embarrassment and violation of the patient’s confidentiality. VE adds the advantage of greater control over graded exposure stimulus parameters, and the ability to isolate which virtual stimulus parameters are essential in generating a phobic response, as well as greater efficiency and economy in delivering the equivalent of in vivo exposure within the therapist’s office.3 Several studies for treating patients with acrophobia using virtual reality therapy (VRT) have been published and results were relatively good.4,5 The authors have been treating patients with various phobias during the last 2 years and we found rapid improvement of phobic symptoms among patients who received VRT.","[{'authorId': '2217923411', 'name': 'Young Hee Choi'}, {'authorId': '2468936', 'name': 'D.

Fundamental principles of perception and functional brain organization have been established by research utilizing well-controlled but simplified paradigms with basic stimuli. The last 30 years ushered a revolution in computational power, brain mapping, and signal processing techniques. Drawing on those theoretical and methodological advances, over the years, research has departed more and more from traditional, rigorous, and well-understood paradigms to directly investigate cognitive functions and their underlying brain mechanisms in real-world environments. These investigations typically address the role of one or, more recently, multiple attributes of real-world environments. Fundamental assumptions about perception, attention, or brain functional organization have been challenged—by studies adapting the traditional paradigms to emulate, for example, the multisensory nature or varying relevance of stimulation or dynamically changing task demands. Here, we present the state of the field within the emerging heterogeneous domain of real-world neuroscience. To be precise, the aim of this Special Focus is to bring together a variety of the emerging “real-world neuroscientific” approaches.

However, VRET has yet to see large-scale implementation in clinical settings or as a consumer product, and past research suggests that while therapists may acknowledge the many advantages of VRET, they view the technology as technically inaccessible and expensive. We reasoned that after the 2016 release of several consumer virtual reality (VR) platforms and associated public acquaintance with VR, therapists’ concerns about VRET may have evolved. The present study surveyed attitudes toward and familiarity with VR and VRET among practicing cognitive behavior therapists (n = 185) attending a conference. Results showed that therapists had an overall positive attitude toward VRET (pros rated higher than cons) and viewed VR as applicable to conditions other than anxiety. Unlike in earlier research, high financial costs and technical difficulties were no longer top-rated negative aspects. Average negative attitude was a larger negative predictor of self-rated likelihood of future use than positive attitude was a positive predictor and partially mediated the positive association between VRET knowledge and likelihood of future use, suggesting that promotional efforts should focus on addressing concerns. We conclude that therapist’s attitudes toward VRET appear to have evolved in recent years, and no longer appear to constitute a major barrier to implementing the next generation of VR technology in regular clinical practice.","[{'authorId': '2628520', 'name': 'P.

The concept itself requires a wider view of normativity than the narrow positivist one of law as command. It is certainly protean, ranging over many fundamental questions about the changing nature of the public sphere of politics and the state, and its interactions with the ‘private’ sphere of economic activity and social relations, as well as the mediation of these interactions, especially through law. This survey aims to outline and evaluate some of the main contours of the field as it has developed in this recent period, focusing on the regulation of economic activity. Regulation is seen as having emerged with the withdrawal by governments from direct provision of many economic and social services, to be replaced by corporatist bureaucracies and quasi-public agencies managing the complex public–private interactions of financialized capitalism. The arguments for ‘smart’ regulation have, in an era fixated on neo-liberalism, generally legitimized delegation of responsibility to big business. Its advocates, having been drawn into policy fields, have perhaps too often lost their critical edge, and allowed it to become instrumentalized, reflecting the technicist character of its practice.","[{'authorId': '35720444', 'name': 'S.

We used a daily diary methodology with multilevel modelling data analyses (n = 187) to examine the influence of three emotion regulation strategies (mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression) on the experience of daily negative and positive affect. Our results suggested that daily mindfulness was associated with lower negative and higher positive affect whereas the converse pattern was found for daily emotion suppression; cognitive reappraisal was related to daily positive, but not negative affect. When daily mindfulness, suppression and reappraisal were included in the same models, these strategies predicted unique variance in emotional well-being. Random slope analyses revealed substantial variability in the utility of these strategies. Indeed the presumably “adaptive” cognitive reappraisal strategy seemed to confer no benefit to the regulation of negative affect in approximately half the sample. Additional analyses revealed that age moderates the effect of cognitive reappraisal on daily negative affect: Higher use of reappraisal was associated with more negative affect for adolescents (aged 17 to 19) but became associated with less negative affect with increasing age. We interpret these results in line with a contextual view of emotion regulation where no strategy is inherently “good” or “bad”.","[{'authorId': '143712173', 'name': 'R.

The present study of self-report data (N = 150) on 11 affect scales showed that response format and acquiescence response style significantly shifted correlations between hypothesized opposites away from showing bipolarity. When these biases were taken into account, pleasure was found to be the bipolar opposite of displeasure and arousal of sleepiness. In turn, pleasure-displeasure and degree of arousal formed a twodimensional bipolar space that accounted for almost all of the reliable variance in Thayer's four factors of activation plus a measure of depression. Dominance and submissiveness factors were also included in the study, but invalidity of the scales used precluded any conclusions regarding their bipolarity.","[{'authorId': '46367714', 'name': 'J.

This paper puts forward a series of theoretical underpinnings and design considerations for embodying emotional and aesthetic aspects of virtual (reality) learning environments (VLEs) in support of ubiquitous teaching, studying and learning. The authors assert that a VLE should be considered an interactive and sensation-producing affordances and instruments, as well as a mediator of communication and learning. Furthermore, a VLE should be valued as a tool for emotional and socio-structural mediation, as well as for the psycho-social regulation and control over the communication situation that the environment makes possible by allowing users to regulate psycho-social distances. 
Researchers in studying and learning have too often neglected emotional and aesthetic factors, especially in the context of network-based learning environments. These factors are examined here in terms of seven levels of observation forming a continuum from the individual subconscious/conscious interpersonal level to the social, cultural, cross- and transcultural levels. The continuum is mapped onto learning architectures, offering a greater understanding of their value as starting points and design considerations for VLEs in regulating learning. The most critical issue is to take into account the users — the human individual(s) — and the social nature(s) of using the technologies involved.

The study is a mixed method study that draws on questionnaire data (n = 31) and focus group interviews (n = 10) of boarding school students participating in the pilot study. Descriptive statistics were used to examine quantitative data, and qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Quantitative findings indicated that gameplay experiences of the VR simulation were positive, and all User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) items were answered positively. The focus group interviews showed that adolescents found the simulation to be realistic. Feedback indicated that the group pressure experienced in the simulation was regarded to be less than in real life. Adolescents had varying approaches to playing the VR simulation, they thought the quality of the simulation was good, and only a few users experienced technical difficulties. These initial study findings indicate that VR FestLab is a promising tool for the prevention of alcohol use among adolescents.","[{'authorId': '147076305', 'name': 'J.

Typically experienced in virtual worlds, mediated presence is generated by different technological, cognitive, and emotional factors. The aim of this study was to test how to optimise the virtual experience by manipulating some of these factors. Specifically, we tested if an immersive technology and/or a meaningful narrative context influence the users' sense of presence, providing a more compelling experience than a non-immersive and non-contextualized virtual space. Eighty-four students, randomly divided into four groups, were asked to find a blood container inside a virtual hospital in an immersive or non-immersive condition and with or without an emotionally related narrative. Two presence questionnaires and heart-rate variations were used to measure the effects of the four conditions on the users' sense of presence. Results showed a significant effect of narrative, F(8, 73) = 30.346, p < 0.001, and level of immersion, F (8, 73) = 10.913, p < 0.001, and a significant interaction between narrative and immersion, F(8, 73) = 2.062, p = 0.05, both on the presence questionnaires and on the heart-rate variations. Moreover, considering the factors immersion (I) and narrative (N) together, we found that the I-N condition generated the highest level of presence. We argue that both immersion and narrative are important in creating an effective virtual reality experience because they contribute differently to increasing the sense of presence. Immersion increases the place illusion, while the narrative contributes to generating an emotional response and strengthening the subjects' sense of inner presence.","[{'authorId': '39777674', 'name': 'A.

The framework was developed by adopting a constant comparison method to analyse the literature, and to search for and identify current and emerging themes. The framework identifies indicators for five key elements of online engagement, and the authors propose that the framework provides a guide for researchers and academics when exploring online engagement from a conceptual, practical and research basis.

Instead of pre-defining features, the time-domain signal is input to a population of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in order to perform a stochastic search for the best structure. The results showed that the average performance of the new algorithm outperformed other published methods using the Berlin BCI IV (2008) competition dataset and was comparable to the best results in the Berlin BCI II (2002–3) competition dataset.

37fc9bfc2b2059bc25ca2e5f638b7aa7186d29da,"Surprisingly little is known about the way people use space. Social scientists in the field of human ecology have been concerned primarily with the distribution of such things as social classes, economic institutions, and mental illness. An almost unexplored area is microecology or the way that people in pairs or small groups arrange themselves. In the studies of Hediger (5), Howard (6), and Von Uexkull (15), ""space"" has had two different meanings. The more familiar of these refers to space in the geographic sense, i.e., space as area. It is most commonly discussed with reference to the animal's territory or home. However, some writers have applied the concept of territory to human behavior. W. F. Whyte (16) and Thrasher (14) have studied the territories of adolescent gangs. W. H. Whyte (17) also has studied the groupings of people within a housing development. Probably the most intensive investigation thus far has been that of Barker and Wright (2) in the Midwest. Yet this still remains relatively unexplored territory for social scientists. The second way in which the term ""space"" is used can be called ""personal space of the organism."" Although it has its roots in the work of zoologists and ethologists, it is an entirely different concept from that of territory. Personal distance is the distance that the organism customarily places between itself and other organisms. This distance may vary from species to species and individual to individual. Hediger speaks of this as ""flight distance"" and has measured this for hundreds of animals. This concept would seem to have relevance for the study of human behavior, although it has never been studied empirically so far as we know. It seems obvious that people feel uncomfortable when they talk to others who either stand too close or too far away. The concept itself has been used several times in the literature. David Katz (8) used the term ""personal space"" and compared it to the shell of a snail. Von Uexkull used the graphic analogy of people ""surrounded by soap-bubble worlds."" Stern (13) developed the concept of personal world. He noted that the physical world was without a center, but the","[{'authorId': '153534954', 'name': 'R.

Then they rated the stimuli using four scales measuring the pleasantness, arousal, approachability, and dominance qualities of the 12 stimuli. The results showed that continuous forward-backward rotating stimuli were rated as significantly more unpleasant, arousing, avoidable, and dominating than other types of stimulations (e.g., discontinuous forward rotation). The reaction times to these stimuli were significantly faster than reaction times to discontinuous forward and backward rotating stimuli.

The total sample consisted of 536 children aged between 3 and 11 years old who lived in Spain. A total of 103 teachers completed the questionnaire. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted, which showed five main factors: (1) initiation, organization, execution, and supervision of the action; (2) inhibitory control; (3) sensory processing; (4) emotional self-regulation and play; and (5) self-competence. Some of these factors were similar to those found in the EPYFEI for parents in the home context. The reliability of the analysis was high, both for the whole questionnaire and for the factors it is composed of. The results provide evidence of the potential usefulness of the EPYFEI-Escolar in school contexts for determining academic needs and difficulties of children; moreover, this tool can also be used to plan intervention programs in the school environment according to the needs of each child and school.","[{'authorId': '1432615893', 'name': 'D.

Method: A novel motion capture virtual reality system integrating online self-face viewing and mirror visual feedback has been developed for stroke rehabilitation.The system allows the replacement of the impaired arm by a virtual arm. Upon making small movements of the paretic arm, patients view themselves virtually performing healthy full-range movements. A sample of 6 patients in the acute poststroke phase received the virtual reality treatment concomitantly with conservative rehabilitation treatment. Feasibility was assessed during 10 sessions for each participant. Results: All participants succeeded in operating the system, demonstrating its feasibility in terms of adherence and improvement in task performance. Patients’ performance within the virtual environment and a set of clinical-functional measures recorded before the virtual reality treatment, at 1 week, and after 3 months indicated neurological status and general functioning improvement. Conclusions: These preliminary results indicate that this newly developed virtual reality system is safe and feasible. Future randomized controlled studies are required to assess whether this system has beneficial effects in terms of enhancing upper limb function and quality of life in poststroke patients.","[{'authorId': '144920903', 'name': 'S.

However, so far no study using neuroimaging has investigated whether hypnosis can influence reward processing and decision-making. Here, we assessed whether posthypnotic suggestions can diminish the attractiveness of unhealthy food and whether this is more effective than diminishing attractiveness by one's own effort via autosuggestion. In total, 16 participants were hypnotized and 16 others were instructed to associate a color cue (blue or green) with disgust regarding specific snacks (sweet or salty). Afterwards, participants bid for snack items shown on an either blue or green background during functional magnetic resonance imaging measurement. Both hypnosis and autosuggestion successfully devalued snacks. This was indicated by participants' decision-making, their self-report and by decreased blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region known to represent value. Different vmPFC subregions coded for cue and snack type. The cue had significantly stronger effects on vmPFC after hypnosis than after autosuggestion, indicating that hypnosis was more effective in genuinely reducing value. Supporting previous findings, the precuneus was involved in the hypnotic effects by encoding whether a snack was sweet or salty during hypnotic cue presentation. Our results demonstrate that posthypnotic suggestions can influence valuation and decision-making.","[{'authorId': '2120198', 'name': 'V. U. Ludwig'}, {'authorId': '2115708', 'name': 'C.

Meeting the complex needs of patients with chronic common mental health disorders (CMHDs) may be the greatest challenge facing organized medical practice. On the basis of a well-established and proven theoretical foundation for controlled respiration as a behavioral intervention for CMHDs, as well as preliminary evidence that gamification can improve health outcomes through increasing patient engagement, this randomized controlled pilot study evaluated the feasibility and clinical efficacy of a mobile health game called ""Flowy"" ( www.flowygame.com ) that digitally delivered breathing retraining exercises for anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptom management.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We designed an unblinded, Web-based, parallel-group randomized controlled trial focusing on feasibility, clinical efficacy, and design proof of concept. In the intervention condition (n = 31), participants received free access to ""Flowy"" for 4 weeks. In the control condition (n = 32), participants were placed on a waitlist for 4 weeks before being offered free access to ""Flowy."" Online measurements using psychological self-report questionnaires were made at 2 and 4 weeks post-baseline.


RESULTS
At trial conclusion, participants found ""Flowy"" acceptable as an anxiety management intervention. ""Flowy"" engaged participants sufficiently to endorse proactive gameplay. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed a reduction in anxiety, panic, and self-report hyperventilation scores in both trial arms, with the intervention arm experiencing greater quality of life. Participants perceived ""Flowy"" as a fun and useful intervention, proactively used ""Flowy"" as part of their care, and would recommend ""Flowy"" to family and friends.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that a digital delivery of breathing retraining exercises through a mobile health game can manage anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptoms associated with CMHDs.","[{'authorId': '144843195', 'name': 'Quynh Pham'}, {'authorId': '35312241', 'name': 'Y.

Following MOX, wines were analyzed for chemical attributes pertaining to phenolic composition and assessed by a trained sensory panel. An electronic tongue (ET) was also used to assess the wines. Variations in chemical attributes were found to be mostly influenced by vintage, followed by oak chip maceration accounting for 48% and 16% of variation within the data set, respectively. MOX treatment accounted for 11% of variability within the physiochemical data set, with attributes pertaining to anthocyanin polymerization and levels of sulfur dioxide in the finished wine being most significantly influenced. A generalized Procrustes rotation and alignment of the chemical, electronic tongue, and sensory data sets followed by PLS1 regressions showed good prediction of the sensory characters oak, pencil shavings, stewed plum, vegetal, and spice over the range of sensory scores from the ET data; bitterness and astringency could also be predicted from the physicochemical data with good precision.","[{'authorId': '4473702', 'name': 'L.

In particular, the extent to which autonomic nervous system activity signifies distinct affective states remains controversial. Most prior research on this topic has used univariate statistical approaches in attempts to classify emotions from psychophysiological data. In the present study, electrodermal, cardiac, respiratory, and gastric activity, as well as self-report measures were taken from healthy subjects during the experience of fear, anger, sadness, surprise, contentment, and amusement in response to film and music clips. Information pertaining to affective states present in these response patterns was analyzed using multivariate pattern classification techniques. Overall accuracy for classifying distinct affective states was 58.0% for autonomic measures and 88.2% for self-report measures, both of which were significantly above chance. Further, examining the error distribution of classifiers revealed that the dimensions of valence and arousal selectively contributed to decoding emotional states from self-report, whereas a categorical configuration of affective space was evident in both self-report and autonomic measures. Taken together, these findings extend recent multivariate approaches to study emotion and indicate that pattern classification tools may improve upon univariate approaches to reveal the underlying structure of emotional experience and physiological expression.","[{'authorId': '40613582', 'name': 'P.

The architecture supports seven commercial physiological sensing technologies and can be deployed in immersive and non-immersive VR systems. To demonstrate the concept, we developed the “The Emotional Labyrinth,” a non-linear scenario in which navigation in a procedurally generated three-dimensional maze is entirely decided by the user, and whose features are dynamically adapted according to a set of emotional states. During navigation, affective states are dynamically represented through pictures, music, and animated visual metaphors chosen to represent and induce affective states. The underlying hypothesis is that exposing users to multimodal representations of their affective states can create a feedback loop that supports emotional self-awareness and fosters more effective emotional regulation strategies. We carried out a first study to, first, assess the effectiveness of the selected metaphors in inducing target emotions, and second, identify relevant psycho-physiological markers of the emotional experience generated by the labyrinth. Results show that the Emotional Labyrinth is overall a pleasant experience in which the proposed procedural content generation can induce distinctive psycho-physiological patterns, generally coherent with the meaning of the metaphors used in the labyrinth design. Furthermore, collected psycho-physiological responses such as electrocardiography, respiration, electrodermal activity, and electromyography are used to generate computational models of users’ reported experience. These models enable the future implementation of the closed loop mechanism to adapt the Labyrinth procedurally to the users’ affective state.","[{'authorId': '2557808', 'name': 'S.

In addition, the brain areas associated with hypnosis and ADHD overlap in many respects. However, the use of hypnosis in ADHD patients has still received only minor attention in research. The main purpose of the present work was to investigate whether hypnosis and hypnotic suggestions influence the performance of adult ADHD (n = 27) and control participants (n = 31) in the continuous performance test (CPT). The hypnotic susceptibility of the participants was measured by the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility (HGSHS:A) and the attentional task was a three minute long auditory version of the CPT. The CPT task was administered four times: before hypnosis (CPT1), after a hypnotic induction (CPT2), after suggestions about speed and accuracy (CPT3), and after the termination of hypnosis (CPT4). The susceptibility of the groups measured by HGSHS:A did not differ. There was a statistically significant decrease in reaction times in both ADHD and control groups between CPT2 and CPT3. The differences between CPT1 and CPT2, even though non-significant, were different in the two groups: in the ADHD group reaction times decreased whereas in the control group they increased. Both groups made very few errors in the short CPT. This study indicates that hypnotic suggestions have an effect on reaction times in the sustained attention task both in adult ADHD patients and control subjects.

The sample consisted of 31 adults suffering from snake phobia. The study featured a randomized within-between design with two conditions and three counterbalanced immersions: (a) a baseline control immersion (BASELINE), (b) an immersion in a threatening and anxiety-inducing environment (ANX), and (c) an immersion in a nonthreatening environment that should not induce anxiety (NOANX). In the NOANX environment, participants were immersed for 5 min in a virtual Egyptian desert. They were told that the environment was safe and contained no snakes. The ANX immersion was identical, except that participants were led to believe that a multitude of hidden and dangerous snakes were lurking in the environment. A period of distraction (reading a text on relaxation) separated the ANX and NOANX immersions. Experimenters recorded presence and anxiety in the middle of and after each VR immersion. These brief measures of presence supported our hypothesis and were significantly higher in the anxious immersion than in the baseline or the nonanxious immersion. This finding was not corroborated by the presence questionnaire, where scores varied significantly in the opposite direction. The results from the brief one-item measures of presence support the significant contribution of emotions felt during the immersion on the subjective feeling of presence.

Using these data sets, a dual-modal signal convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm is then designed based on decision fusion to detect and classify the addiction degree. In the second part, the MI-BCI+VR rehabilitation system is designed, optimizing the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm used in MI, and realizing MI-EEG intention recognition. Eight VR rehabilitation scenes are devised, achieving the communication between MI-BCI and VR scene models. Ten subjects are selected to test the rehabilitation system offline and online, and the test accuracy verifies the feasibility of the system. In future, it is suggested to develop personalized rehabilitation programs and treatment cycles based on the addiction degree.","[{'authorId': '1382504377', 'name': 'Xuelin Gu'}, {'authorId': '3122394', 'name': 'Banghua Yang'}, {'authorId': '2112312876', 'name': 'Shouwei Gao'}, {'authorId': '2112666560', 'name': 'Honghao Gao'}, {'authorId': '8012213', 'name': 'Linfeng Yan'}, {'authorId': '2118920311', 'name': 'Ding Xu'}, {'authorId': '2144329544', 'name': 'Wen Wang'}]",2.0,"{'name': 'China Communications', 'pages': '62-72', 'volume': '19'}",0.0,BCI+VR rehabilitation design of closed-loop motor imagery based on the degree of drug addiction,2022.0

In doing so, VR can potentially both give people positive emotional experiences contributing to their overall well-being and give researchers a way to study these profound emotional experiences in a more controlled environment. Through a design refinement process, we explored the potential influence of the ""set and setting''--one's mindset and the physical and social environment--when transitioning people into and out of VR designed to support profound emotional experiences. We present our findings from a design refinement session and a case study exploring how set and setting may support the profound emotional experience of awe. We discuss common themes in user experience and trends of awe-related behavioural and introspective measures. Our results contribute to the discourse around the role of the design of set and setting in overall user experience.","[{'authorId': '11189596', 'name': 'Alexandra Kitson'}, {'authorId': '2693433', 'name': 'Ekaterina R.

This new field combines the objectives of Positive Psychology with enhancements of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) by focusing on three key variables--emotional quality, engagement/actualization, and connectedness--that are able to transform our personal experience in a tool for building new and enduring personal resources. In fact, Positive Technologies include those designed to manipulate the quality of experience through its structuring, augmentation and/or replacement, with the goal of increasing wellness, and generating strengths and resilience in individuals, organizations, and society. This work describes existing Positive Technologies, classified according to their objectives: hedonic (mood-altering devices, which use ICTs to induce positive and pleasant experiences); eudaimonic (systems designed to support individuals in reaching engaging and self-actualizing experiences); and social/interpersonal (technologies that seek to improve the connectedness between individuals, groups, and organizations). Finally, possible directions of future developments are suggested.","[{'authorId': '145945543', 'name': 'C. Botella'}, {'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

Recent years have witnessed growing attention towards the concept and measurement of well-being, both within academic disciplines, intergovernmental organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as in many governments across Europe, including the Nordic countries. Economic indicators have commonly been regarded as proxies of societal progress of nations, but indicators of well-being have increasingly been applied in order to complement or replace these measures. Methods: Well-being indicators of the WHO “Health 2020” framework are critically examined with particular attention given to the subjective aspects of well-being. Literature discussing the rationale for subjective indicators is reviewed. As a background, central theoretical and measurement perspectives on well-being are outlined, including hedonic, eudaimonic and objective list approaches. Results: The WHO refers to well-being in definitions of health and mental health, but has primarily reported on disease. The “Health 2020” framework marked a shift in this concern. One of the main targets of “Health 2020” concerns well-being, involving six core indicators. Only one indicator refers to well-being as subjective experience. Literature supports more extensive use of subjective indicators in combination with objective measures. Conclusions: Although consensus on definitions and instruments is lacking, subjective and objective measures of national well-being may jointly contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of societal progress, as well as a broader conception of health. Further research is required, particularly with regard to eudaimonic indicators.","[{'authorId': '23860194', 'name': 'Mari Hagtvedt Vik'}, {'authorId': '7382125', 'name': 'E.

For a student to be a successful online learner, they need to engage socially and collaboratively through their behaviours, emotions and cognition. This paper discusses an accounting module of a fully online degree where engagement was purposely integrated using an engagement framework. An action research design was followed to determine the degree of engagement within the module and to improve on it. The findings indicated that incorporating five forms of engagement into the module was positively received by students and resulted in more students successfully completing the module. Student reflections showed that the module was cognitively engaging, that personal preference will guide social engagement and that working collaboratively will always be a challenge. Where, due to COVID-19, entire programmes need to convert to online learning, the findings of this study, could be implemented to ensure the continued engagement of students.","[{'authorId': '117298557', 'name': 'M.

Formal sensory tastings are limited by the use of booths that lack ecological validity and engagement. Virtual reality (VR) can overcome this limitation by simulating different environmental contexts. Perception, sensory acceptability, and emotional responses of a Cabernet Sauvignon wine under traditional sensory booths, contextual environments, and VR simulations were evaluated and compared. Participants (N = 53) performed evaluations under five conditions: (1) traditional booths, (2) bright-restaurant (real environment with bright lights), (3) dark-restaurant (real environment with dimly lit candles), (4) bright-VR (VR restaurant with bright lights), and (5) dark-VR (VR restaurant with dimly lit candles). Participants rated the acceptability of aroma, sweetness, acidity, astringency, mouthfeel, aftertaste, and overall liking (9-point hedonic scale), and intensities of sweetness, acidity, and astringency (15-point unstructured line-scale). Results showed that context (booths, real, or VR) affected the perception of the wine’s floral aroma (dark-VR = 8.6 vs. booths = 7.5). Liking of the sensory attributes did not change under different environmental conditions. Emotional responses under bright-VR were associated with “free”, “glad”, and “enthusiastic”; however, under traditional booths, they were related to “polite” and “secure”. “Nostalgic” and “daring” were associated with dark-VR. VR can be used to understand contextual effects on consumer perceptions.","[{'authorId': '14624639', 'name': 'D.

Accumulating empirical evidence is providing support for this anecdotal wisdom. We use the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 1998; 2001) as a framework to demonstrate that positive emotions contribute to psychological and physical well-being via more effective coping. We argue that the health benefits advanced by positive emotions may be instantiated in certain traits that are characterized by the experience of positive emotion. Towards this end, we examine individual differences in psychological resilience (the ability to bounce back from negative events by using positive emotions to cope) and positive emotional granularity (the tendency to represent experiences of positive emotion with precision and specificity). Individual differences in these traits are examined in two studies, one using psychophysiological evidence, the second using evidence from experience sampling, to demonstrate that positive emotions play a crucial role in enhancing coping resources in the face of negative events. Implications for research on coping and health are discussed.","[{'authorId': '3526571', 'name': 'M. Tugade'}, {'authorId': '1892780', 'name': 'B. Fredrickson'}, {'authorId': '1731779', 'name': 'L.

With a surge of studies in affective neuroscience in recent decades, scientists are poised to answer this question. In this target article, we present a meta-analytic summary of the neuroimaging literature on human emotion. We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.","[{'authorId': '2593387', 'name': 'Kristen A.

We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE.

Through psychological testing and EMG (Electromyography) and EEG (Electroencephalography) data feedback, we further explored the differences in the sense of presence in VR restorative scenes and their effect on individual emotional and cognitive recovery. The results showed that (1) both the restorative environment images and the VR scenes had a healing effect (the reduction in negative emotions and the recovery of positive emotions and cognition), with no difference in the subjective feeling of recovery among the different scenes, but the recovery score of the VR urban environment was higher than that of the natural environment (differing from the results in real environments); (2) a high sense of presence can be experienced in different VR scenes, and interactive activities in VR scenes can provide a great presence experience; (3) the recovery effects of VR restorative environment on emotion and self-efficacy are realized through the presence of VR scenes; (4) a VR restorative environment is helpful for the emotional improvement and cognitive recovery of individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. VR urban scenes also have good recovery effects. In terms of cognitive recovery, self-efficacy improved significantly. In addition, from the perspective of EEG indicators, the VR restorative scene experience activated the prefrontal lobe, which is conducive to cognitive recovery in individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. In terms of emotional improvement, negative emotions were significantly reduced in the different VR scene groups. In conclusion, we further explored ways to help individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression, in order to promote the development and application of mental health.","[{'authorId': '2129466553', 'name': 'Hongqidi Li'}, {'authorId': '2114049012', 'name': 'Wenyi Dong'}, {'authorId': '2141347865', 'name': 'Zhimeng Wang'}, {'authorId': '2118768236', 'name': 'Nuo-Fu Chen'}, {'authorId': '2128520793', 'name': 'Jianping Wu'}, {'authorId': '2152583855', 'name': 'Guangxin Wang'}, {'authorId': '2087012850', 'name': 'Ting Jiang'}]",24.0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health', 'volume': '18'}",135.0,Effect of a Virtual Reality-Based Restorative Environment on the Emotional and Cognitive Recovery of Individuals with Mild-to-Moderate Anxiety and Depression,2021.0

The present research investigated the FOCI in a sample of 113 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The results indicated that the FOCI Severity Scale is internally consistent (alpha = .89) and highly correlated with the total score from the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; Goodman et al., 1989 a). The correlations of the FOCI Severity Scale with measures of depression and global severity of psychopathology were similar to those obtained with the Y-BOCS Total Severity Score. The FOCI Symptom Checklist had adequate reliability (K-R 20 = .83) and moderate correlations (rs < .45) with the FOCI Severity Scale, the Y-BOCS scales, and measures of depression and severity of psychopathology. These findings imply concurrent validity for the FOCI Severity Scale. A strength of the FOCI is that it offers a quick evaluation of both presence and severity of OCD symptoms.

3d467fffb1e0e951eb5c888611bf88e4d4b89a56,"OBJECTIVE
Emotional distress has been posited as a key underlying mechanism in the development and maintenance of substance use disorder (SUD), and patients seeking SUD treatment are often experiencing high levels of negative emotion and/or low levels of positive emotion. But the extent to which SUD interventions impact emotional outcomes among general SUD populations is yet unquantified. The current meta-analysis aims to fill this gap.


METHOD
A total of 11,754 records were screened for randomized, controlled trials examining the effect of behavioral SUD interventions on emotion outcomes. Our search yielded a total of 138 effect sizes calculated based on data from 5,146 individuals enrolled in 30 independent clinical trials. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled effect sizes, and metaregression analyses examined study-level moderators (e.g., intervention type).


RESULTS
Findings indicated a small but significant effect of SUD interventions on emotion outcomes, d = 0.157, 95% CI [0.052, 0.262] (k = 30). The effect size for negative emotion was nominally bigger, d = 0.162, 95% CI [0.056, 0.269] (k = 30), whereas the effect for positive emotion did not reach statistical significance, d = 0.062, 95% CI [-0.089, 0.213] (k = 7). Studies featuring SUD interventions designed to specifically target emotions (i.e., affect-regulation, mindfulness-based treatments) produced larger reductions in negative emotion compared with studies featuring interventions that did not contain specific emotion modules (e.g., contingency management).


CONCLUSIONS
Findings suggest that SUD interventions-especially mindfulness-based and affect-regulation treatments-indeed significantly reduce negative emotion, although relatively small effect sizes indicate potential room for improvement. Conclusions regarding positive emotion should be considered preliminary because of the limited numbers of samples assessing these outcomes.

Digital games may have the potential to help people practice breathing exercises in an engaging way, however designing breathing exercise games is not well understood. To contribute to such an understanding, we created Life Tree as the culmination of three prototypal breathing games. Life Tree is a virtual reality (VR) game in which a player controls the growth of a tree by practicing pursed-lip breathing. We selected VR head-mounted display technology because it allows players to focus and limit external distractions, which is beneficial for breathing exercises. 32 participants played Life Tree and analysis of the collected data identified four key themes: 1) Designing Breathing Feedback; 2) Increasing Self-Awareness of Breathing and Body; 3) Facilitating Focused Immersion; and, 4) Engagement with Breathing Hardware. We used these themes to articulate a set of breathing exercise game design strategies that future game designers may consider to develop engaging breathing exercise games.","[{'authorId': '14210919', 'name': 'Rakesh Patibanda'}, {'authorId': '144769043', 'name': 'F.

However, the effects on emotional arousal by using these two visual modes have not been comprehensively investigated, and the underlying neural mechanisms are not yet clear. This paper presents a cognitive psychological experiment that was conducted to analyze how these two visual modes impact emotional arousal. Forty volunteers were recruited and were randomly assigned to two groups. They were asked to watch a series of positive, neutral and negative short VR videos in 2D and 3D. Multichannel electroencephalograms (EEG) and skin conductance responses (SCR) were recorded simultaneously during their participation. The results indicated that emotional stimulation was more intense in the 3D environment due to the improved perception of the environment; greater emotional arousal was generated; and higher beta (21–30 Hz) EEG power was identified in 3D than in 2D. We also found that both hemispheres were involved in stereo vision processing and that brain lateralization existed in the processing.","[{'authorId': '2052643558', 'name': 'Feng Tian'}, {'authorId': '1671258483', 'name': 'Minlei Hua'}, {'authorId': '2107986696', 'name': 'Wenrui Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2155505654', 'name': 'Yingjie Li'}, {'authorId': '47008779', 'name': 'Xiaoli Yang'}]",26.0,"{'name': 'PLoS ONE', 'volume': '16'}",36.0,Emotional arousal in 2D versus 3D virtual reality environments,2021.0
3dd3a043c3ce8866238242a8eda6f2ec3d215775,"Recent developments in neuroimaging research support the increased use of naturalistic stimulus material such as film, avatars, or androids. These stimuli allow for a better understanding of how the brain processes information in complex situations while maintaining experimental control. While avatars and androids are well suited to study human cognition, they should not be equated to human stimuli. For example, the uncanny valley hypothesis theorizes that artificial agents with high human-likeness may evoke feelings of eeriness in the human observer. Here we review if, when, and how the perception of human-like avatars and androids differs from the perception of humans and consider how this influences their utilization as stimulus material in social and affective neuroimaging studies. First, we discuss how the appearance of virtual characters affects perception. When stimuli are morphed across categories from non-human to human, the most ambiguous stimuli, rather than the most human-like stimuli, show prolonged classification times and increased eeriness. Human-like to human stimuli show a positive linear relationship with familiarity. Secondly, we show that expressions of emotions in human-like avatars can be perceived similarly to human emotions, with corresponding behavioral, physiological and neuronal activations, with exception of physical dissimilarities. Subsequently, we consider if and when one perceives differences in action representation by artificial agents versus humans. Motor resonance and predictive coding models may account for empirical findings, such as an interference effect on action for observed human-like, natural moving characters. However, the expansion of these models to explain more complex behavior, such as empathy, still needs to be investigated in more detail. Finally, we broaden our outlook to social interaction, where virtual reality stimuli can be utilized to imitate complex social situations.","[{'authorId': '153006524', 'name': 'A. W. D.

Objective To determine whether CBT for BDD (CBT-BDD) is superior to supportive psychotherapy in reducing BDD symptom severity and associated BDD-related insight, depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and quality of life, and whether these effects are durable. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized clinical trial conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital recruited adults with BDD between October 24, 2011, and July 7, 2016. Participants (n = 120) were randomized to the CBT-BDD arm (n = 61) or the supportive psychotherapy arm (n = 59). Weekly treatments were administered at either hospital for 24 weeks, followed by 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Measures were administered by blinded independent raters. Intention-to-treat statistical analyses were performed from February 9, 2017, to September 22, 2018. Interventions Cognitive behavioral therapy for BDD, a modular skills–based treatment, addresses the unique symptoms of the disorder. Supportive psychotherapy is a nondirective therapy that emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and self-esteem; supportive psychotherapy was enhanced with BDD-specific psychoeducation and treatment rationale. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was BDD symptom severity measured by the change in score on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Modified for BDD from baseline to end of treatment. Secondary outcomes were the associated symptoms and these were assessed using the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale, Beck Depression Inventory–Second Edition, Sheehan Disability Scale, and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form. Results Of the 120 participants, 92 (76.7%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 34.0 (13.1) years. The difference in effectiveness between CBT-BDD and supportive psychotherapy was site specific: at 1 site, no difference was detected (estimated mean [SE] slopes, –18.6 [1.9] vs –16.7 [1.9]; P = .48; d growth-modeling analysis change, –0.25), whereas at the other site, CBT-BDD led to greater reductions in BDD symptom severity, compared with supportive psychotherapy (estimated mean [SE] slopes, –18.6 [2.2] vs –7.6 [2.0]; P < .001; d growth-modeling analysis change, –1.36). No posttreatment symptom changes were observed throughout the 6 -months of follow-up (all slope P ≥ .10). Conclusions and Relevance Body dysmorphic disorder severity and associated symptoms appeared to improve with both CBT-BDD and supportive psychotherapy, although CBT-BDD was associated with more consistent improvement in symptom severity and quality of life.

Exposure therapy is so far considered to be the most effective treatment, and research suggests that it is mainly based on a habituation process. Based on learning theories, it appears that a passive systemic exposure to traumatic stimuli should not be the best option for the treatment of PTSD. We hypothesis that an active learning of safer and healthier coping strategies combined with systematic exposure should be more effective in reducing the psychological distress associated with PTSD. In this paper, we describe the theoretical foundations of this approach that focuses on the action and activity of the patient in his or her exposure environment. In this approach, we take advantage of Virtual Reality technologies and learning mechanics of serious games to allow the patient to learn new safe associations while promoting the empowerment. We named this action-centered exposure therapy (ACET). This approach exploits behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism learning theories. With the different benefits of virtual reality technologies, this approach would easily integrate with in-virtuo exposure therapy and would allow us to exploit as much as possible the enormous potential of these technologies.

3f6e573a6c1128a0b0495ff6ebb9ca6d82b4929d,"The aim of this chapter is to present an outline of a theory of intergroup conflict and some preliminary data relating to the theory. First, however, this ap proach to intergroup behavior and intergroup conflict must be set in context, in relation to other approaches to the same problems. Much of the work on the social psychology of intergroup relations has focused on patterns of indi vidual prejudice and discrimination and on the motiva tional sequences of interpersonal interaction. Out standing examples of these approaches can be found, respectively, in the theory of authoritarian personality (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, & Sanford, 1950) and in the various versions and modifications of the theory of frustration, aggression, and displace ment (such as Berkowitz, 1962, 1969, 1974). The common denominator of most of this work has been the stress on the intraindividual or interpersonal psychological processes leading to prejudiced at titudes or discriminatory behavior. The complex interweaving of individual or interpersonal behavior with the contextual social processes of intergroup conflict and their psychological effects has not been in the focus of the social psychologists' preoccu pations. (For a more detailed discussion, see Tajfel 1972a, 1975.) The alternative to these approaches is rep resented in the work of Muzafer Sherif and his as sociates (see Chapter 1), and has been referred to by D. T. Campbell (1965) as the ""realistic group conflict theory "" (R. C. T.). Its point of departure for the expla nation of intergroup behavior is in what Sherif (1966) has called the functional relations between social groups. Its central hypothesis—""real conflict of group interests causes intergroup conflict"" (Camp bell, 1965, p. 287)—is deceptively simple, intuitively convincing, and has received strong empirical support (including Sherif & Sherif, 1953; Avigdor, 1953; Harvey, 1956; Sherif, Harvey, White, Hood, & Sherif, 1961; Blake & Mouton, 1961a, 1962c; Bass & Dunteman, 1963; D. W. Johnson, 1967; Diab, 1970). R.C.T. was pioneered in social psychology by the Sherifs, who provided both an etiology of inter group hostility and a theory of competition as realistic and instrumental in character, motivated by rewards which, in principle, are extrinsic to the intergroup situation (see Deutsch, 1949b; Julian, 1968). Op posed group interests in obtaining scarce resources promote competition, and positively interdependent (superordinate) goals facilitate cooperation. Conflict ing interests develop through competition into overt social conflict. It appears, too, that intergroup com petition enhances intragroup morale, cohesiveness, and cooperation (see Vinacke, 1964; Fiedler, 1967; Kalin & Marlowe, 1968). Thus, the real conflicts of group interests not only create antagonistic intergroup relations but also heighten identification with, and positive attachment to, the in-group. This identification with the in-group, however, has been given relatively little prominence in the","[{'authorId': '16691034', 'name': 'H. Tajfel'}, {'authorId': '144385080', 'name': 'J.

Virtual reality (VR) may potentially be effectively utilized in anger management, and this study aimed to verify the applicability of the VR-based anger control training program. The data obtained by having 60 young male participants divided into 2 groups, the high aggression group and the low aggression group, based on their Aggression Questionnaire scores to execute this program were analyzed. The program consisted of ""Anger Exposure Training"" for provoking anger and facilitating anger control and ""Mindfulness Training"" for providing the meditation experience for controlling anger. The anger scores and comfort scores obtained from these tasks, respectively, were analyzed for differences between the groups and between the experimental conditions. The anger regulation and comfort enhancement rates were analyzed for correlations with psychological variables. In Anger Exposure Training, the anger scores in angry expression were reduced in managed expression of anger in both groups. In Mindfulness Training, meditation increased comfort score as well in both groups, and the comfort enhancement rates were negatively correlated with the levels of self-differentiation and open communication with mother only in the high aggression group. These results indicate that the VR environments can provide an effective means of trainings for managing anger. Therefore, further research on the effectiveness of the VR-based anger control training program is worthy conducting in individuals who express excessive aggression.","[{'authorId': '2164085116', 'name': 'Hye-Jeong Jo'}, {'authorId': '2118646407', 'name': 'Y.

The Serious-Games-TAM was used to confirm that serious games, based on the proposed framework, would both be accepted by the learner and be useful for learning. Validation involved the collection and analysis of data from learners using a specially developed serious game that introduced international students to public transport in Southampton. After completing the game, participants completed a short questionnaire and the data was analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM).

In Study 1 we descriptively examined which strategies teachers use to regulate their emotions in response to student misbehaviour and found that teachers use a variety of strategies to regulate their emotions. In Study 2, using an Experience Sampling Method, we examined how teachers’ trait-level emotion regulation impacts their in-the-moment affective experiences and modulation strategies in the context of classroom misbehaviours. Results indicate that teachers who typically reappraise have the least negative affective experiences in the context of student misbehaviour and are less likely to suppress their in-the-moment negative emotions. This study adds to our understanding of how teachers could regulate their negative emotions when dealing with student misbehaviour in an adaptive way. Findings signify the importance of examining the efficacy of other regulation strategies.","[{'authorId': '2451539', 'name': 'Mei-Lin Chang'}, {'authorId': '3381839', 'name': 'J.

This paper presents an empirical study of how video production decisions affect student engagement in online educational videos. To our knowledge, ours is the largest-scale study of video engagement to date, using data from 6.9 million video watching sessions across four courses on the edX MOOC platform. We measure engagement by how long students are watching each video, and whether they attempt to answer post-video assessment problems. Our main findings are that shorter videos are much more engaging, that informal talking-head videos are more engaging, that Khan-style tablet drawings are more engaging, that even high-quality pre-recorded classroom lectures might not make for engaging online videos, and that students engage differently with lecture and tutorial videos. Based upon these quantitative findings and qualitative insights from interviews with edX staff, we developed a set of recommendations to help instructors and video producers take better advantage of the online video format. Finally, to enable researchers to reproduce and build upon our findings, we have made our anonymized video watching data set and analysis scripts public.

Virtual reality (VR) treatment is a promising intervention option for SAD. Objective The purpose of this study was to create a participatory and interactive VR intervention for SAD. Treatment progress, including the severity of symptoms and the cognitive and emotional aspects of SAD, was analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Methods In total, 32 individuals with SAD and 34 healthy control participants were enrolled in the study through advertisements for online bulletin boards at universities. A VR intervention was designed consisting of three stages (introduction, core, and finishing) and three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) that could be selected by the participants. The core stage was the exposure intervention in which participants engaged in social situations. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed through Beck Anxiety inventory (BAI), State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Internalized Shame Scale (ISS), Post-Event Rumination Scale (PERS), Social Phobia Scale (SPS), Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), Brief-Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE), and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Results In the SAD group, scores on the BAI (F=4.616, P=.009), STAI-Trait (F=4.670, P=.004), ISS (F=6.924, P=.001), PERS-negative (F=1.008, P<.001), SPS (F=8.456, P<.001), BFNE (F=6.117, P=.004), KSAD (F=13.259, P<.001), and LSAS (F=4.103, P=.009) significantly improved over the treatment process. Compared with the healthy control group before treatment, the SAD group showed significantly higher scores on all scales (P<.001), and these significant differences persisted even after treatment (P<.001). In the comparison between the VR treatment responder and nonresponder subgroups, there was no significant difference across the course of the VR session. Conclusions These findings indicated that a participatory and interactive VR intervention had a significant effect on alleviation of the clinical symptoms of SAD, confirming the usefulness of VR for the treatment of SAD. VR treatment is expected to be one of various beneficial therapeutic approaches in the future.

It is witnessed by the abnormal electrical activities in the brain which causes recurring seizures, therefore the patient suffers from loss of consciousness. Due to the random nature of the seizures, the patients may not be aware of it and so it increases the risk of physical injury. Due to the disturbed brain activity, epileptic seizures are caused which implies that the brain's normal activity is suddenly interrupted and changed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is used widely for capturing the recordings and impulses in the brain. These signals are highly useful for checking the abnormalities not just related to epilepsy but any neurological disorder. The recordings of the EEG signals are quite long in nature and so processing it is very difficult and consumes a lot of time.

41a42b8ef7addbc6ec7829c3016ea738046e7ba6,"Introduction Many patients with psychosis experience everyday social situations as anxiety-provoking. The fears can arise, for example, from paranoia, hallucinations, social anxiety or negative-self beliefs. The fears lead patients to withdraw from activities, and this isolation leads to a cycle of worsening physical and mental health. Breaking this cycle requires highly active treatment directly in the troubling situations so that patients learn that they can safely and confidently enter them. However patients with psychosis seldom receive such life-changing interventions. To solve this problem we have developed an automated psychological treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR). It allows patients to experience computer simulations of the situations that they find anxiety-provoking. A virtual coach guides patients, using cognitive techniques, in how to overcome their fears. Patients are willing to enter VR simulations of anxiety-provoking situations because they know the simulations are not real, but the learning made transfers to the real world. Methods and analysis 432 patients with psychosis and anxious avoidance of social situations will be recruited from National Health Service (NHS) secondary care services. In the gameChange trial, they will be randomised (1:1) to the six-session VR cognitive treatment added to treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 6 (post-treatment) and 26 weeks by a researcher blind to allocation. The primary outcome is avoidance and distress in real-life situations, using a behavioural assessment task, at 6 weeks. The secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, activity levels and quality of life. All main analyses will be intention-to-treat. Moderation and mediation will be tested. An economic evaluation will be conducted. Ethics and dissemination The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS South Central - Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0075). A key output will be a high-quality automated VR treatment for patients to overcome anxious avoidance of social situations.

41e2ea15dd154ec91113d87ae5cbb3f9ecaae170,"In the educational field, the role of the support component of the teacher-student relationship is well known, while the role of the teacher-student relationship on teacher burnout is a more current field of investigation. Several studies on the sources of burnout have recently focused on job satisfaction and teacher-student satisfaction. However, the role of teacher-parent satisfaction is still little explored in this field. Moreover, in the Italian school context, students’ seniority and educational level require further investigation, as the average age of teachers is particularly high compared to their European colleagues. The present study aims to examine in a sample of 882 Italian teachers the presence of burnout and differences in teacher-student and teacher-parent satisfaction between primary (students aged 6–10years) and lower secondary (students aged 11–13years) teachers. A further objective is to test whether teacher-student and teacher-parent satisfaction and seniority can be significant predictors of burnout. Teachers completed the Job Satisfaction Scale (MESI) and the MBI-Educators Survey and the data were then processed using MANOVA and multiple linear regression analysis. The results revealed that 8.2% of the teachers suffered from burnout and lower secondary teachers showed the highest levels of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and reduced personal accomplishment. Predictors of emotional exhaustion were job dissatisfaction and seniority, and predictors of depersonalisation were job dissatisfaction and teacher-student dissatisfaction. Finally, predictors of personal accomplishment were also teacher-parent satisfaction and teacher-student satisfaction. The implications of these findings for practice and research are discussed in this article.","[{'authorId': '6067077', 'name': 'M. Pedditzi'}, {'authorId': '1491580875', 'name': 'M.

Consequently, there is a clear need for objective and standardized tools. Virtual reality (VR) can be used to achieve controlled symptom provocation, which allows direct assessment for the clinician. We developed a video VR game to provoke and assess obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms in a standardized and controlled environment. The first objective was to evaluate if the VR game is capable of provoking symptoms in OCD patients as opposed to healthy controls. The second objective was to evaluate the tolerability of the VR game in OCD patients. The VR game was created using a first-person perspective and confronted patients with 15 OCD-specific items, while simultaneously measuring OCD symptoms, including the number of compulsions, anxiety, tension, uncertainty, and urge to control. In this pilot study, eight patients and eight healthy controls performed the VR game. OCD patients performed significantly more compulsions (U = 5, p = 0.003) during the VR game. The anxiety, tension, uncertainty, and urge to control in response to the specific items were also higher for OCD patients, although significance was not yet reached because of the small sample. There were no substantial adverse effects. The results of this pilot study indicate that the VR game is capable of provoking a variety of OCD symptoms in OCD patients, as opposed to healthy controls, and is a potential valuable tool to objectify and standardize an OCD diagnosis.","[{'authorId': '29828934', 'name': 'M.

With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology's ability to create new realities. VR may merit the level of attention given to neuroimaging.","[{'authorId': '2136711807', 'name': 'Daniel Freeman'}, {'authorId': '29021285', 'name': 'S. Reeve'}, {'authorId': '48325879', 'name': 'A.

A number of recognition methods have been applied in recent years to recognize human emotion. The motivation for this study is therefore to discover a combination of emotion features and recognition method that will produce the best result in building an efficient emotion recognizer in an affective system. We introduced a shifted tanh normalization scheme to realize the inverse Fisher transformation applied to the DEAP physiological dataset and consequently performed series of experiments using the Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Networks (RBFANN). In our experiments, we have compared the performances of digital image based feature extraction techniques such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and the Histogram of Images (HIM). These feature extraction techniques were utilized to extract discriminatory features from the multimodal DEAP dataset of physiological signals. Experimental results obtained indicate that the best recognition accuracy was achieved with the EEG modality data using the HIM features extraction technique and classification done along the dominance emotion dimension. The result is very remarkable when compared with existing results in the literature including deep learning studies that have utilized the DEAP corpus and also applicable to diverse fields of engineering studies.","[{'authorId': '18352254', 'name': 'A.

In Nevermind, players' heart rate is continuously read into the game which in turn adapts to the player's momentary levels of negative affective arousal. Greater negative arousal causes the game and its horror-themed settings to become more disturbing. As a result, Nevermind challenges players to improve their emotion regulation skills by encouraging them to healthily down-regulate their negative affective states in the face of stressful situations. Second, Nevermind implements valuable design practices, practices which we share here. Finally, we describe a recent study conducted on 47 players.

In the current experiment, we examined whether immersion in a virtual computer-generated nature setting could produce restorative effects. Twenty-two participants were equally divided between two conditions, while controlling for gender. In each condition, participants performed a stress-induction task, and were then immersed in virtual reality (VR) for 10 minutes. The control condition featured a slide show in VR, and the nature experimental condition featured an active exploration of a virtual forest. Participants in the nature condition were found to exhibit increased positive affect and decreased stress after immersion in VR when compared to those in the control condition. The results suggest that immersion in virtual nature settings has similar beneficial effects as exposure to surrogate nature. These results also suggest that VR can be used as a tool to study and understand restorative effects.","[{'authorId': '2701001', 'name': 'Deltcho Valtchanov'}, {'authorId': '38754616', 'name': 'Kevin R.

Two cognitive processes lead to this model: the representation of bodily actions as possible actions in the VE, and the suppression of incompatible sensory input. It is hypothesized that the conscious sense of presence reflects these two components as spatial presence and involvement. This prediction was confirmed in two studies (N = 246 and N = 296) assessing self-reports of presence and immersion experiences. Additionally, judgments of realness were observed as a third presence component. A second-order factor analysis showed a distinction between presence, immersion, and interaction factors.

This process, also called somatosensory resonance, is an essential ability for social cognition and is stronger when observing ingroup than outgroup members. Here we investigated, first, whether implicit racial bias constrains somatosensory resonance, and second, whether increasing the ingroup/outgroup perceived physical similarity results in an increase in the somatosensory resonance for outgroup members. We used the Visual Remapping of Touch effect as an index of individuals' ability in resonating with the others, and the Implicit Association Test to measure racial bias. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to detect near-threshold tactile stimuli delivered to their own face while viewing either an ingroup or an outgroup face receiving a similar stimulation. Our results showed that individuals' tactile accuracy when viewing an outgroup face being touched was negatively correlated to their implicit racial bias. In Experiment 2, participants received the interpersonal multisensory stimulation (IMS) while observing an outgroup member. IMS has been found to increase the perceived physical similarity between the observer's and the observed body. We tested whether such increase in ingroup/outgroup perceived physical similarity increased the remapping ability for outgroup members. We found that after sharing IMS experience with an outgroup member, tactile accuracy when viewing touch on outgroup faces increased. Interestingly, participants with stronger implicit bias against the outgroup showed larger positive change in the remapping. We conclude that shared multisensory experiences might represent one key way to improve our ability to resonate with others by overcoming the boundaries between ingroup and outgroup categories.","[{'authorId': '15322628', 'name': 'Chiara Fini'}, {'authorId': '2444959', 'name': 'Flavia Cardini'}, {'authorId': '1398935536', 'name': 'A.

However, existing methods for constructing scenes of debris flow disasters have some deficiencies. First, the construction process does not consider public knowledge, which makes it difficult for the constructed scenes to meet the requirements of the public. Second, the scene representation emphasizes visual effects but lacks augmented visualization, leading to scarcity of semantic information and inefficient public perception. In this paper, the optimal selection of scene objects, semantic augmentation through the combination of various visual variables and dynamic augmented representation are discussed in detail.

The current study examines the effectiveness of a VR-assisted treatment protocol for public speaking anxiety with demonstrated efficacy, this time in routine care, using affordable VR hardware. Participants (n = 23) were recruited via a private clinic and treated by one of four psychologists with only minimal VR-training. Using a single-subject design and dual-slope modeling (adjusting the treatment-onset slope for treatment effects), we found a significant, large decrease in self-rated public speaking anxiety following the primary three-hour session, similar in magnitude to the previous efficacy trial. Multilevel modeling of in-session process measures suggests that the protocol works as intended, by decreasing catastrophic belief expectancy and distress, and increasing perceived performance quality. Adherence to the online transition program that followed—encouraging in-vivo exposure—was relatively poor, yet symptoms decrease continued. No change was observed over the three-month follow-up period. We conclude that VR exposure therapy can be effective under routine care conditions and is an attractive approach for future, large-scale implementation and effectiveness trials.","[{'authorId': '2628520', 'name': 'P.

A comparative effectiveness study was conducted to determine if virtual reality technology itself improved outcomes, or if similar results could be achieved with a control exposure therapy (CET) condition. Service members with combat-related PTSD were randomly selected to receive nine weeks of VRET or CET. Assessors, but not therapists, were blinded. PTSD symptom improvement was assessed one week and 3 months after the conclusion of treatment using the clinician-administered PTSD scale (CAPS). A small crossover component was included. Results demonstrated that PTSD symptoms improved with both treatments, but there were no statistically significant differences between groups. Dropout rates were higher in VRET. Of those who received VRET, 13/42 (31%) showed >30% improvement on the CAPS, versus 16/43 (37%) who received CET. Three months after treatment, >30% improvement was seen in 10/33 (30%) of VRET participants and 12/33 (36%) in CET. Participants who crossed over (n = 11) showed no statistically significant improvements in a second round of treatment, regardless of condition.

It is also relevant, as some authors claim, that physical exercise may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to improve cognition and memory after strokes. Thus, the integration of physical and cognitive therapies could offer potential benefits. In addition, in general these therapies are usually considered boring, so it is important to include some features that improve the motivation of patients. As a result, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation systems and serious games for health are more and more present. In order to achieve a continuous, efficient and sustainable rehabilitation of patients, they will have to be carried out as part of the rehabilitation in their own home. However, current home systems lack the therapist’s presence, and this leads to two major challenges for such systems. First, they need sensors and actuators that compensate for the absence of the therapist’s eyes and hands. Second, the system needs to capture and apply the therapist’s expertise. With this aim, and based on our previous proposals, we propose an ambient intelligence environment for cognitive rehabilitation at home, combining physical and cognitive activities, by implementing a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that gathers, as far as possible, the knowledge of a rehabilitation expert. Moreover, smart sensors and actuators will attempt to make up for the absence of the therapist. Furthermore, the proposed system will feature a remote monitoring tool, so that the therapist can supervise the patients’ exercises. Finally, an evaluation will be presented where experts in the rehabilitation field showed their satisfaction with the proposed system.","[{'authorId': '145935810', 'name': 'Miguel Oliver'}, {'authorId': '2429102', 'name': 'Miguel A.

Although emotion dysregulation is not a defining feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), there is a growing consensus that emotional problems play a prominent role in this disorder.


METHODS
The present study examined a wide range of emotion regulation (ER) strategies in 32 individuals with ASD compared to 31 group-matched typically developing (TD) participants in three emotional domains (anger, anxiety, and amusement). Parents of individuals with ASD and TD individuals were interviewed about their child's emotional experience and the use and efficacy of 10 ER strategies. In addition, participants filled out daily diaries on experience and regulation in the same emotional domains.


RESULTS
Compared to TD individuals, parents reported that individuals with ASD experienced more anger and anxiety and less amusement, made less frequent use of a variety of adaptive ER strategies (e.g. problem solving, cognitive reappraisal), and made more frequent use of maladaptive strategies (e.g. repetitive behavior). Moreover, individuals with ASD were less effective at utilizing adaptive ER strategies. Self-reports showed differences in experience of amusement and in ER strategies for anger and anxiety, but not in experience of anger and anxiety.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence that individuals with ASD less frequently use adaptive - but more frequently use maladaptive - ER strategies. Implications for ASD treatments that focus on increasing the use of adaptive strategies are discussed.","[{'authorId': '38707445', 'name': 'Andrea C. Samson'}, {'authorId': '33448033', 'name': 'W.

The schools workpackage carried out a systematic review of reviews of work on mental health in schools from which it identified evidence-based interventions and programmes and extracted the general principles from evidence-based work. A systematic search of the literature uncovered 52 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of mental health in schools. The interventions identified by the reviews had a wide range of beneficial effects on children, families and communities and on a range of mental health, social, emotional and educational outcomes. The effect sizes associated with most interventions were generally small to moderate in statistical terms, but large in terms of real-world impacts. The effects associated with interventions were variable and their effectiveness could not always be relied on. The characteristics of more effective interventions included: teaching skills, focusing on positive mental health; balancing universal and targeted approaches; starting early with the youngest children and continuing with older ones; operating for a lengthy period of time and embedding work within a multi-modal/whole-school approach which included such features as changes to the curriculum including teaching skills and linking with academic learning, improving school ethos, teacher education, liaison with parents, parenting education, community involvement and coordinated work with outside agencies. Interventions were only effective if they were completely and accurately implemented: this applied particularly to whole-school interventions which could be ineffective if not implemented with clarity, intensity and fidelity. The implications for policy and practice around mental health in schools are discussed, including the suggestion of some rebalancing of priorities and emphases.","[{'authorId': '6133530', 'name': 'K.

450106c6c960424b365249f2a301ce0abe24e346,"Scoping reviews can be conducted to meet various objectives. They may examine the extent (that is, size), range (variety), and nature (characteristics) of the evidence on a topic or question; determine the value of undertaking a systematic review; summarize findings from a body of knowledge that is heterogeneous in methods or discipline; or identify gaps in the literature to aid the planning and commissioning of future research (1, 2). A recent scoping review by members of our team suggested that although the number of scoping reviews in the literature is increasing steadily, methodological and reporting quality needs to improve in order to facilitate complete and transparent reporting (1). Results from a survey on scoping review terminology, definitions, and methods showed a lack of consensus on how to conduct and report scoping reviews (3). The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) published a guidance document for the conduct of scoping reviews (4) (updated in 2017 [5]) based on earlier work by Arksey and O'Malley (6) and Levac and colleagues (7). However, a reporting guideline for scoping reviews currently does not exist. Reporting guidelines outline a minimum set of items to include in research reports and have been shown to increase methodological transparency and uptake of research findings (8, 9). Although a reporting guideline exists for systematic reviewsthe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement (10)scoping reviews serve a different purpose (11). Systematic reviews are useful for answering clearly defined questions (for example, Does this intervention improve specified outcomes when compared with a given comparator in this population?), whereas scoping reviews are useful for answering much broader questions (such as What is the nature of the evidence for this intervention? or What is known about this concept?). Given the difference in objectives, and therefore in the methodological approach (such as presence vs. absence of a risk-of-bias assessment or meta-analysis), scoping reviews should have different essential reporting items from systematic reviews. Consequently, some PRISMA items may not be appropriate, whereas other important considerations may be missing (1214). It was decided that a PRISMA extension for scoping reviews was needed to provide reporting guidance for this specific type of knowledge synthesis. This extension is also intended to apply to evidence maps (15, 16), which share similarities with scoping reviews and involve a systematic search of a body of literature to identify knowledge gaps, with a visual representation of results (such as a figure or graph). Methods The PRISMA-ScR (PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews) was developed according to published guidance by the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network for the development of reporting guidelines (9). The St. Michael's Hospital Research Ethics Board granted research ethics approval for this study on 15 August 2016. Protocol, Advisory Board, and Expert Panel Our protocol was drafted by the research team and revised as necessary by the advisory board before being listed as a reporting guideline on the EQUATOR (17) and PRISMA (18) Web sites. The research team included 2 leads (A.C.T. and S.E.S.) and 2 research coordinators (E.L. and W.Z.), none of whom participated in the scoring exercises, and a 4-member advisory board (K.K.O., H.C., D.L., and D.M.) with extensive experience doing scoping reviews or developing reporting guidelines. We aimed to form an expert panel of approximately 30 members that would be representative of different geography and stakeholder types and research experiences, including persons with experience in the conduct, dissemination, or uptake of scoping reviews. Survey Development and Round 1 of Delphi The initial step in developing the Delphi survey via Qualtrics (an online survey platform) (19) involved identifying potential modifications to the original 27-item PRISMA checklist. The modifications were based on a research program carried out by members of the advisory board to better understand scoping review practices (1, 3, 20) and included a broader research question and literature search strategy, optional risk-of-bias assessment and consultation exercise (whereby relevant stakeholders contribute to the work, as described by Arksey and O'Malley [6]), and a qualitative analysis. For round 1 of scoring, we prepared a draft of the PRISMA-ScR (Supplement) and asked expert panel members to rate their agreement with each of the proposed reporting items using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = entirely disagree, 2 = mostly disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 = neutral, 5 = somewhat agree, 6 = mostly agree, and 7 = entirely agree). Each survey item included an optional text box where respondents could provide comments. The research team calibrated the survey for content and clarity before administering it and sent biweekly reminders to optimize participation. Supplement. PRISMA-ScR Round 1 Survey (With Information Sheet) Survey Analysis To be conservative, a threshold for 85% agreement was established a priori for each of the reporting items to indicate consensus among the expert panel. This rule required that at least 85% of the panel mostly or entirely agreed (values of 6 or 7 on the Likert scale) with the inclusion of the item in the PRISMA-ScR. If agreement was less than 85%, it was considered to be discrepant. This standard was used for all 3 rounds of scoring to inform the final checklist. For ease and consistency with how the survey questions were worded, we did not include a provision for agreement on exclusion (that is, 85% of answers corresponding to values of 1 or 2 on the Likert scale). All comments were summarized to help explain the scorings and identify any issues. For the analysis, the results were stratified by group (in-person meeting vs. online, hereafter e-Delphi) because discrepant items could differ between groups. In-Person Group (Round 2 of Delphi) The Chatham House rule (21) was established at the beginning of the meeting, whereby participants were free to use information that is shared but were not permitted to reveal the identity or affiliation of the speaker. Expert panel members were given their individual results; the overall group distribution, median, and interquartile range; a summary of the JBI methodological guidance (4); and preliminary feedback from the e-Delphi group. These data were used to generate and inform the discussion about each discrepant item from round 1. Two researchers (A.C.T. and S.E.S.) facilitated the discussion using a modified nominal group technique (22) to reach consensus. Panel members were subsequently asked to rescore the discrepant items using sli.do (23), a live audience-response system in a format that resembled the round 1 survey. For items that failed to meet the threshold for consensus, working groups were assembled. The meeting was audio-recorded and transcribed using TranscribeMe (24), and 3 note-takers independently documented the main discussion points. The transcript was annotated to complement a master summary of the discussion points, which was compiled using the 3 note-takers' files. E-Delphi Group (Round 2 of Delphi) Those who could not attend the in-person meeting participated via an online discussion exercise using Conceptboard (25), a visual collaboration platform that allows users to provide feedback on whiteboards in real time. The discrepant items from round 1 were presented as a single whiteboard, and questions (for example, After reviewing your survey results with respect to this item, please share why you rated this item the way you did) were assigned to participants as tasks to facilitate the discussion. E-Delphi panel members received the same materials as in-person participants and were encouraged to respond to others' comments and interact through a chat feature. The second round of scoring was done in Qualtrics using a similar format as in round 1. A summary of the Conceptboard discussion, as well as the annotated meeting transcript and master summary document, were shared so that participants could learn about the perspectives of the in-person group before rescoring. Working Groups and Round 3 of Delphi To enable panel-wide dialogue and refine the checklist items before the final round of scoring, working groups were created and collaborated by teleconference and e-mail. Their task was to discuss the discrepant items in terms of the key issues and considerations (relating to both concepts and wording) that had been raised in earlier stages across both groups. To harmonize the data from the 2 groups, a third round of scoring exercise was administered using Qualtrics (19). In this step, suggested modifications (in terms of both concepts and wording) from all previous stages were incorporated into the items that had failed to reach consensus in the first 2 rounds across both groups, and the full panel scored this updated list. Interactive Workshop (Testing) A workshop led by the lead investigator (A.C.T.) and facilitated by members of the advisory board and expert panel (S.E.S., C.M.G., C.G., T.H., M.T.M., and M.D.J.P.) was held as part of the Global Evidence Summit in Cape Town, South Africa, in September 2017. Participants (researchers, scientists, policymakers, managers, and students) tested the checklist by applying the PRISMA-ScR to a scoping review on a health-related topic (26).

Although this topic has not been the subject of investigation in science, it exemplifies the fundamental question of why we have an ongoing experience of being located inside our bodies. Here we report a perceptual illusion of body-swapping that addresses directly this issue. Manipulation of the visual perspective, in combination with the receipt of correlated multisensory information from the body was sufficient to trigger the illusion that another person's body or an artificial body was one's own. This effect was so strong that people could experience being in another person's body when facing their own body and shaking hands with it. Our results are of fundamental importance because they identify the perceptual processes that produce the feeling of ownership of one's body.","[{'authorId': '2085722', 'name': 'Valeria I.

45722b98d6324eae66a9e50ed453f17f96a16697,"Abstract Background Endoscopy programs are increasingly integrating simulation training. We conducted a systematic review to determine whether virtual reality (VR) simulation training can supplement and/or replace conventional patient-based endoscopy training for health professional trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. Methods We searched medical, educational, and computer literature databases in July 2017 for trials that compared VR simulation training with no training, conventional training, another form of simulation training, or an alternative method of VR training. We screened, abstracted data, and performed quantitative analysis and quality assessment through Cochrane methodology. Results We included 18 trials with 3817 endoscopic procedures. VR training provided no advantage over no training or conventional training based on the primary outcome of composite score of competency. VR training was advantageous over no training based on independent procedure completion (relative risk [RR] = 1.62, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.15 – 2.26, moderate-quality evidence), overall rating of performance (mean difference [MD] 0.45, 95 %CI 0.15 – 0.75, very low-quality evidence), and mucosal visualization (MD 0.60, 95 %CI 0.20 – 1.00, very low-quality evidence). Compared with conventional training, VR training resulted in fewer independent procedure completions (RR = 0.45, 95 %CI 0.27 – 0.74, low-quality evidence). We found no differences between VR training and no training or conventional training for other outcomes. Based on qualitative analysis, we found no significant differences between VR training and other forms of simulation training. VR curricula based in educational theory provided benefit with respect to composite score of competency, compared with unstructured curricula. Conclusions VR simulation training is advantageous over no training and can supplement conventional endoscopy training. There is insufficient evidence that simulation training provides benefit over conventional training.","[{'authorId': '2151235866', 'name': 'R.

In addition to these key hubs, there is another locality with great potential for the resources that are capable of creating a new tourism space associated with the typical natural landscape and unique ethnic cultural values: Dak Nong Province. With the advantages of available resources and the geographical location with accessibility to Ho Chi Minh City and the vicinity of the Central Highlands and South Central regions, Dak Nong is eligible to develop into a new tourism destination, creating a counterbalance, stimulating production and diversifying tourism services for the Central Highlands in general and Vietnam in particular. Based on the results of field research in July 2018 and January 2019, the paper proposes directions for designing Dak Nong’s overall tourism products in the perspectives of regional linkage. The viewpoint of the paper is that building tourism products is essential for tourism development and must be oriented towards establishing regional links. Designing Dak Nong’s tourism products in the perspectives of regional linkage needs to be based on the competitive advantages of each locality’s advantages. Unlike economic regional links in which the state plays an important role, the key role in these tourism value chains must be played by tourism enterprises; the State plays a leading role in creating an environment for these chains to work.

However, the single signal is difficult to obtain completely and accurately description for emotion. Multiple physiological signals fusing models, building the uniform classification model by means of consistent and complementary information from different emotions to improve recognition performance. Original fusing models usually choose the particular classification method to recognition, which is ignoring different distribution of multiple signals. Aiming above problems, in this work, we propose an emotion classification model through multiple modal physiological signals for different emotions. Features are extracted from EEG, EMG, EOG signals for characterizing emotional state on valence and arousal levels. For characterization, four bands filtering theta, beta, alpha, gamma for signal preprocessing are adopted and three Hjorth parameters are computing as features. To improve classification performance, an ensemble classifier is built. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark DEAP datasets. For the two-class task, the best result on arousal is 94.42\%, the best result on valence is 94.02\%, respectively. For the four-class task, the highest average classification accuracy is 90.74, and it shows good stability.

4620d86229ff0207cacbb7f15a1bb18914f66543,"Objectives. Schizophrenia has a debilitating impact on a patient's cognitive functioning and everyday activities. As a part of the treatment, schizophrenia patients attend sessions of cognitive remediation to restore impaired cognitive abilities. To combine cognitive and real life training, this study presents a virtual task to use in cognitive rehabilitation and assessment. Virtual Supermarket Shopping Task (VSST) simulates a shopping activity, in which participants have to memorize and collect items from a virtual supermarket. The aim of this study is to establish its validity for use in clinical practice. 
Sample and setting. Twenty patients suffering from chronic schizophrenia and twenty healthy controls were tested. Each participant completed the task and a battery of standard neuropsychological tests. 
Statistical analyses. Groups’ results were compared by Student’s t-tests. Validity of VSST was examined using correlations with standard neuropsychological measures. Several VSST metrics, such as trial difficulty, distances and times, and the effect the extraneous variables have on VSST measures were investigated using analyses of variance and mixed effect models. 
Results. The analyses demonstrate that patients perform worse in VSST than healthy controls and their performance corresponds to their mnemonic abilities measured by standard neuropsychological tests. VSST performance relates to the level of executive functioning only in patients. There was no effect of gaming experience on VSST performance. While potential gender effect has to be addressed in future studies, age seems to play a role in the additional VSST measures (trial time and distance). 
Study limitations. Subjects were tested only once and therefore long term benefits of using VSST in rehabilitation could not be investigated. Only schizophrenia patients were included in the sample, which reduces generalizability of results to other psychiatric and neurologic conditions.","[{'authorId': '30765310', 'name': 'A.

Materials and methods Self- and parent-rated data from 25 children with PID were available. As controls, data from 50 children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 89 healthy children were included. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory was used for HRQOL assessments. Anxiety symptoms were identified using the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders questionnaire, while depressive symptoms were identified using the Mood and Feeling Questionnaire. Results Children with PID had significantly lower Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory total scores compared to children with JIA and healthy children as child-rated (P=0.02) and parent-rated (P<0.001). Specifically, they had significantly lowered emotional functioning compared to children with JIA, and social functioning compared to both children with JIA and healthy children. School functioning was significantly lower among children with PID (parent-rated only). By parent-rated responses, six (24%) out of 25 children with PID had significant anxiety symptoms, while five (20%) children had significant depressive symptoms, which was statistically higher than among children with JIA and healthy controls (P=0.05). Conclusion HRQOL could be significantly compromised in children with PID, particularly across such psychosocial domains as emotional, social, and school. These children were also found to be at an increased risk for suffering significant anxiety and depressive symptoms.","[{'authorId': '5339559', 'name': 'Nina B Kuburović'}, {'authorId': '5252560', 'name': 'S.

Social robots can offer tremendous possibilities for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interventions. To date, most studies with this population have used short, isolated encounters in controlled laboratory settings. Our study focused on a 1-month, home-based intervention for increasing social communication skills of 12 children with ASD between 6 and 12 years old using an autonomous social robot. The children engaged in a triadic interaction with a caregiver and the robot for 30 min every day to complete activities on emotional storytelling, perspective-taking, and sequencing. The robot encouraged engagement, adapted the difficulty of the activities to the child’s past performance, and modeled positive social skills. The system maintained engagement over the 1-month deployment, and children showed improvement on joint attention skills with adults when not in the presence of the robot. These results were also consistent with caregiver questionnaires. Caregivers reported less prompting over time and overall increased communication.","[{'authorId': '1792053', 'name': 'B.

However, recent empirical results with over-parameterized neural networks are marked by a striking absence of the classic U-shaped test error curve: test error keeps decreasing in wider networks. This suggests that there might not be a bias-variance tradeoff in neural networks with respect to network width, unlike was originally claimed by, e.g., Geman et al. (1992). Motivated by the shaky evidence used to support this claim in neural networks, we measure bias and variance in the modern setting. We find that both bias and variance can decrease as the number of parameters grows. To better understand this, we introduce a new decomposition of the variance to disentangle the effects of optimization and data sampling. We also provide theoretical analysis in a simplified setting that is consistent with our empirical findings.","[{'authorId': '84392845', 'name': 'Brady Neal'}, {'authorId': '51519654', 'name': 'Sarthak Mittal'}, {'authorId': '14398916', 'name': 'A.

While electroencephalography (EEG) provides a portable, low cost measure of brain dynamics, it has been somewhat underrepresented in the emerging field of model-based inference. We seek to address this gap in this article by highlighting the utility of linking EEG and behavior, with an emphasis on approaches for EEG analysis that move beyond focusing on peaks or “components” derived from averaging EEG responses across trials and subjects (generating the event-related potential, ERP). First, we review methods for deriving features from EEG in order to enhance the signal within single-trials. These methods include filtering based on user-defined features (i.e., frequency decomposition, time-frequency decomposition), filtering based on data-driven properties (i.e., blind source separation, BSS), and generating more abstract representations of data (e.g., using deep learning). We then review cognitive models which extract latent variables from experimental tasks, including the drift diffusion model (DDM) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Next, we discuss ways to access associations among these measures, including statistical models, data-driven joint models and cognitive joint modeling using hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). We think that these methodological tools are likely to contribute to theoretical advancements, and will help inform our understandings of brain dynamics that contribute to moment-to-moment cognitive function.","[{'authorId': '1812008', 'name': 'David A.

The present study examined whether the valence of perceived emotions would differentially influence EEG power spectra and heart rate (HR). Pleasant and unpleasant emotions were induced by consonant and dissonant music. Unpleasant (compared to pleasant) music evoked a significant decrease of HR, replicating the pattern of HR responses previously described for the processing of emotional pictures, sounds, and films. In the EEG, pleasant (contrasted to unpleasant) music was associated with an increase of frontal midline (Fm) theta power. This effect is taken to reflect emotional processing in close interaction with attentional functions. These findings show that Fm theta is modulated by emotion more strongly than previously believed.","[{'authorId': '2270411', 'name': 'D. Sammler'}, {'authorId': '1857579', 'name': 'M.

These automatic or implicit evaluations are often considered to be based on qualitatively distinct mental processes compared with more controlled or explicit evaluations. Important evidence for this claim comes from studies showing that implicit evaluations do not change as the result of counterattitudinal information, in contrast to their explicit counterparts. We examined the impact of counterattitudinal information on implicit evaluations in two experiments (N = 60, N = 72) that included an innovative manipulation: hypnotic suggestions to participants that they would strongly process upcoming counterattitudinal information. Both experiments indicated that hypnotic suggestions facilitated effects of counterattitudinal information on implicit evaluations. These findings extend recent evidence for rapid revision of implicit evaluations on the basis of counterattitudinal information and support the controversial idea that belief-based processes underlie not only explicit but also implicit evaluations.","[{'authorId': '39982416', 'name': 'Pieter Van Dessel'}, {'authorId': '3602422', 'name': 'J. de Houwer'}]",6.0,,43.0,Hypnotic Suggestions Can Induce Rapid Change in Implicit Attitudes,2019.0

These challenges point to the need for pre-service teachers to experience aspects of challenging pupil behaviour in less pressurised environments, and where they can have the opportunities to make mistakes without fear of negative repercussions on their academic progression. The use of virtual simulations is increasingly seen as an opportunity to provide pre-service teachers with unique opportunities to experience examples of classroom life in a controlled and structured manner. With these benefits in mind, this paper explores the growing use of virtual simulations in pre-service teacher education and, in particular, their use in developing pre-service teachers’ behaviour and classroom management skills. It highlights issues that teacher educators need to be cognisant of in using them with student teachers, particularly the extent to which they cement existing stereotypes about pupil behaviour and the extent to which they subsequently limit rather than enhance opportunities for critical reflection.","[{'authorId': '2975223', 'name': 'O.

We used functional neuroimaging to test two hypotheses: (i) that the amygdala and some of its functionally connected structures mediate specific neural responses to fearful expressions; (ii) that the early visual processing of emotional faces can be influenced by amygdalar activity. Normal subjects were scanned using PET while they performed a gender discrimination task involving static grey-scale images of faces expressing varying degrees of fear or happiness. In support of the first hypothesis, enhanced activity in the left amygdala, left pulvinar, left anterior insula and bilateral anterior cingulate gyri was observed during the processing of fearful faces. Evidence consistent with the second hypothesis was obtained by a demonstration that amygdalar responses predict expression-specific neural activity in extrastriate cortex.","[{'authorId': '48257157', 'name': 'J.

Using Pick-A-Mood requires little effort on the part of respondents, making it suitable for design research applications in which people often have little time or motivation to report their moods. Contrary to what is often assumed, mood and emotion are distinct phenomena with different measurable manifestations.

This study takes different types of rural landscapes as the research object to explore their impact on stress levels, which are shown by photos. As an independent variable, the rural landscape is divided into three levels: Type 1 (natural landscape), type 2 (productive landscape), and type 3 (artificial landscape). Seventy-three subjects were randomly assigned to each type of rural landscape. Salivary cortisol, blood pressure, heart rate, and a subjective rating state scale (brief profile of mood states, BPOMS) were used as indicators of stress. At the same time, the influence of preference and familiarity on the stress relieving effect was also discussed. A paired t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used as the main statistical methods. In the results of t-test for pre-posttest, significant difference was observed in high blood pressure, heart rate, and total mood disturbance (TMD) of type 1 and type 2, and the high and low blood pressure of type 3; ANOVA analysis revealed that for the difference of pre-posttest, significant difference was observed in the TMD value among the three types; except for type 3, blood pressure, heart rate, and BPOMS values were significantly affected by preference and familiarity. The conclusions include the following: The three types of rural landscapes have a positive effect on relieving stress; the productive landscape has the best effect on relieving stress; and users’ landscape preferences and familiarity with the environment can affect the effect of stress relief in rural landscapes.","[{'authorId': '2108114861', 'name': 'Xiaobo Wang'}, {'authorId': '122549585', 'name': 'H.

Virtual reality (VR) distraction offers promise for needle-related pain and distress given its highly immersive and interactive virtual environment. This study assessed the usability (ease of use and understanding, acceptability) of a custom VR intervention for children with cancer undergoing implantable venous access device (IVAD) needle insertion. Method: Three iterative cycles of mixed-method usability testing with semistructured interviews were undertaken to refine the VR. Results: Participants included 17 children and adolescents (8-18 years old) with cancer who used the VR intervention prior to or during IVAD access. Most participants reported the VR as easy to use (82%) and understand (94%), and would like to use it during subsequent needle procedures (94%). Based on usability testing, refinements were made to VR hardware, software, and clinical implementation. Refinements focused on increasing responsiveness, interaction, and immersion of the VR program, reducing head movement for VR interaction, and enabling participant alerts to steps of the procedure by clinical staff. No adverse events of nausea or dizziness were reported. Conclusions: The VR intervention was deemed acceptable and safe.

The present review examines this model in terms of whether different types of emotion-evocative stimuli are associated with discrete and invariant patterns of responding in each response system, how such responses are structured, and if such responses converge across different response systems. Across response systems, the bulk of the available evidence favours the idea that measures of emotional responding reflect dimensions rather than discrete states. In addition, experiential, physiological, and behavioural response systems are associated with unique sources of variance, which in turn limits the magnitude of convergence across measures. Accordingly, the authors suggest that there is no “gold standard” measure of emotional responding. Rather, experiential, physiological, and behavioural measures are all relevant to understanding emotion and cannot be assumed to be interchangeable.","[{'authorId': '2172628', 'name': 'I.

Thus, understanding a learner's affect throughout the learning process is crucial for understanding motivation. In conventional education/learning research, learner motivation can be known through postevent self-reported questionnaires. With the advance of affective computing technology, researchers are able to objectively identify and measure a learner's affective status during the entire learning process in a real-time manner, and then they are able to understand the interrelationship between emotion, motivation and learning performance. There are over 100 papers in the ScienceDirect database with the keywords 'affective computing in education' or 'affective computing in learning,' which reveals that this emerging technology has been applied to education/learning. This study intends to categorize and summarize those measurements so as to realize their applicability, feasibility and trends. Finally, some challenges and suggestions are then raised for helping educational researchers when applying affective computing technology.

4a191bb8c04538cae794379502ce552a0b7adf15,"Introduction Everyone experiences stress at one time or another – from major events such as the death of a loved one, to more minor stressors such as financial difficulties. Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S.

Experiences of awe are found to prompt feelings of interconnectedness and an improvement to perceived well-being. To address the challenging prospect of designing for a specific emotional experience in a wellness application, we combined artistic and scientific practices through a research-based design process in order to identify awe-inspiring traits, generate a typology of awe, identify emotion validation techniques, and undertake iterative prototyping of the installation directly with participants. The resulting installation integrates a pre-VR mixed-reality experience to prime immersants for openness to the experience, followed by an immersive VR environment, and it uses a novel, custom interface for intuitive hands-free navigation. Our methods involve phenomenological interviews and physiological sensors to evaluate the evoked emotional experiences, which then inform design decisions to improve the system. Additionally, we integrate bio-responsive elements into the environment to further personalize the experience. Results suggest that AWE can elicit the target emotional experience of awe, prompt a transformative experience, and improve well-being in some participants.","[{'authorId': '39359322', 'name': 'Denise T.

4af31c2819d3f2c7f01942f053750ad1a87253db,"An ensemble consists of a set of individually trained classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when classifying novel instances. Previous research has shown that an ensemble is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging (Breiman, 1996c) and Boosting (Freund & Schapire, 1996; Schapire, 1990) are two relatively new but popular methods for producing ensembles. In this paper we evaluate these methods on 23 data sets using both neural networks and decision trees as our classification algorithm. Our results clearly indicate a number of conclusions. First, while Bagging is almost always more accurate than a single classifier, it is sometimes much less accurate than Boosting. On the other hand, Boosting can create ensembles that are less accurate than a single classifier - especially when using neural networks. Analysis indicates that the performance of the Boosting methods is dependent on the characteristics of the data set being examined. In fact, further results show that Boosting ensembles may overfit noisy data sets, thus decreasing its performance. Finally, consistent with previous studies, our work suggests that most of the gain in an ensemble's performance comes in the first few classifiers combined; however, relatively large gains can be seen up to 25 classifiers when Boosting decision trees.","[{'authorId': '1709927', 'name': 'R.

Our second goal was to investigate whether these relations varied by reactive or proactive aggression. Children (272 second-grade boys and girls) participated in a procedure in which they lost a game and prize to a confederate who cheated. Skin conductance reactivity, heart rate reactivity, selfreports of anger, angry facial expressions, and angry nonverbal behaviors were measured for each turn of the game. We used multi-level regressions to calculate the relations among the 10 pairs of the five anger variables over the course of the game. Six of the 10 pairs of anger variables were positively related. These findings suggest that measuring children’s anger using any one approach may not capture the full complexity of children’s overall experience and expression of anger. Furthermore, three of the 10 relations were stronger at higher levels of reactive aggression, although none varied by proactive aggression. These findings suggest that reactive aggression is related to greater cohesiveness in the experience and expression of anger than is proactive aggression.","[{'authorId': '144083723', 'name': 'Julie A.

From celebrities to faraway relatives, from favorite writers to thinkers to people we meet on-line, we form a host of subtle, invisible, but very real social connections with distant others. In Connecting, Mary Chayko investigates how physically separated people manage to create a sense of connectedness-a meeting of the minds-and feel undeniably, if unexpectedly, bonded. Through dozens of personal accounts, the book considers the social fallout of connecting with absent others-the benefits and hazards-on our societies, communities, relationships, and individual selves. The result is a comprehensive yet intimate look at social bonding as it is rarely recorded: an examination of the bonds and communities we form across great distances, and even across time, in the age of the Internet.

4c472c321837d62ed53a1db45ada5615742c960d,"Background Apathy is a common symptom in neurological disorders, including dementia, and is associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline, reduced quality of life, and high caregiver burden. There is a lack of effective pharmacological treatments for apathy, and nonpharmacological interventions are a preferred first-line approach to treatment. Virtual reality (VR) using head-mounted displays (HMDs) is being successfully used in exposure- and distraction-based therapies; however, there is limited research on using HMDs for symptoms of neurological disorders. Objective This feasibility study aimed to assess whether VR using HMDs could be used to deliver tailored reminiscence therapy and examine the willingness to participate, response rates to measures, time taken to create tailored content, and technical problems. In addition, this study aimed to explore the immediate effects between verbal fluency and apathy after exposure to VR. Methods A mixed methods study was conducted in a sample of older adults residing in aged care, and 17 participants were recruited. Apathy was measured using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and verbal fluency was used as a proxy measure of improvements in apathy and debriefing interviews to assess feedback from participants. Side effects that can occur from using HMDs were also measured. Results We recruited participants from a high socioeconomic status setting with a high education level, and the participation rate was 85% (17/20); most responses to measures were positive. Access to a wide range of freely available content and the absence of technical difficulties made the delivery of a VR reminiscence intervention highly feasible. Participants had improved semantic scores (t14=−3.27; P=.006) but not phonemic fluency scores (t14=0.55; P=.59) immediately after the intervention. Those with higher levels of apathy demonstrated the greatest cognitive improvements after a VR reminiscence experience, which was indicated by a strong positive relationship between the AES and semantic verbal fluency change scores postminus pre-VR (r=0.719; 95% CI 0.327 to 0.900; P=.003). All participants enjoyed the experience despite 35% (6/17) of participants experiencing temporary side effects. Conclusions This study provides initial evidence that it is feasible to use VR with HMDs for therapy to treat symptoms of apathy in older adults in residential aged care. However, there is a need to closely monitor the side effects of HMD use in older adults. Further research is needed using an active control group to compare the use of VR with traditional forms of reminiscence therapy.","[{'authorId': '120572560', 'name': 'Dimitrios Saredakis'}, {'authorId': '50124112', 'name': 'H.

A key symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is hyperreactivity to trauma-relevant stimuli. Though physiological arousal is reliably elevated in PTSD, the question remains whether this arousal responds to treatment. Virtual reality (VR) has been posited to increase emotional engagement during prolonged exposure therapy (PE) for PTSD by augmenting imaginal exposures with trauma-relevant sensory information. However, the comparative effects of VR exposure therapy (VRE) have received limited empirical inquiry.

Ninety active-duty soldiers with combat-related PTSD participating in a randomized-controlled trial to receive PE, VRE, or a waitlist-control (WL) condition had their physiological reactivity, indexed by galvanic skin response (GSR), to their trauma memories assessed at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment.


RESULTS
Although both VRE and PE conditions showed reduced GSR reactivity to trauma memories from pre- to posttreatment, only the VRE group differed significantly from WL. Across the sample, reductions in GSR were significantly correlated with reductions in self-reported PTSD and anxiety symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
This was the first study comparing effects of VRE and PE on psychophysiological variables. Given previous research finding limited differences between VRE and PE in PTSD symptom reduction, these findings lend support to the rationale for including VR in exposure therapy protocols while raising important questions about the potential benefits of VRE.

We conducted a sequential mixed-methods study based on Moore’s interaction framework for distance education. We administered a questionnaire to 313 students engaging in emergency online learning in low-resource settings to examine their perceptions of different engagement strategies. Our results showed that student–content engagement strategies, e.g., screen sharing, summaries, and class recordings, are perceived as the most effective, closely followed by student–teacher strategies, e.g., Q and A sessions and reminders. Student–student strategies, e.g., group chat and collaborative work, are perceived as the least effective. The perceived effectiveness of engagement strategies varies based on the students’ gender and technology access. To support instructors, instructional designers, and researchers, we propose a 10-level guide for engaging students during emergency online classes in low-resource settings.","[{'authorId': '1404360821', 'name': 'Victoria Abou-Khalil'}, {'authorId': '39672392', 'name': 'S.

4cd13c498103ab05fd3644811e54ae0ff7f397d0,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of unwanted and repetitive thoughts triggering significant anxiety, as well as the presence of ritual behaviours or mental acts carried out in response to obsessions to reduce the associated distress. In the contamination subtype, individuals are scared of germs and bacteria, are excessively concerned with cleaning, fear contamination and the spread of disease, and may have a very strong aversion to bodily secretions. A few studies on virtual reality have been conducted with people suffering from OCD, but they all focus on the subtype characterized by checking rituals. The goal of this study is to confirm the potential of a “contaminated” virtual environment in inducing anxiety in 12 adults suffering from contamination-subtype OCD compared to 20 adults without OCD (N = 32) using a within-between protocol. Subjective (questionnaire) and objective (heart rate) measurements were compiled. Participants were immersed in a control virtual environment (empty and clean room) and a “contaminated” virtual environment (filthy public restroom) designed for the treatment of OCD. Immersions were conducted in a 6-wall CAVE-like system. As hypothesized, the results of repeated-measures ANCOVAs revealed the significant impact of immersion in a filthy public restroom for participants suffering from OCD on both measures. Presence was correlated with anxiety in OCD participants and no difference in presence was observed between groups. Unwanted negative side effects induced by immersions in virtual reality were higher in the OCD group. The clinical implications of the results and directions for further studies are discussed.","[{'authorId': '31501133', 'name': 'M. Laforest'}, {'authorId': '144981172', 'name': 'S.

4d2cc4fd297464a1e1420a5d060cecce65e54e19,"Abstract Background Milton Erickson was the first to introduce hypnosis as a form of therapy during the post-war period. Numerous studies have evaluated the effects of hypnosis on memory, focusing principally on post-hypnotic amnesia, post-hypnotic hypermnesia, faux memories and learning growth. The aim of the present study was to determine if hypnosis can influence visual-spatial memory by increasing its performance and learning; to do this, we chose to utilise the Corsi Test (backward and forward). Methods Three hundred second-year students enrolled in the psychology faculty at the University of Catania were informed of the research and its modalities, and an e-mail was sent to inquire if they wanted to participate in the experiment. Seventy female students took part in the research; 10 were excluded because they presented a high risk of being influenced under hypnosis. The 60 subjects in the research sample were randomly divided into two groups: the Experimental Group and Control Group. The protocol prescribed administration of the Corsi Test at Time 0 (start) followed by a resting phase of 30 min. The hypnotic state was subsequently introduced, and the Corsi Test was administered again. Results The results of the Corsi Test for the Experimental Group showed statistically significant results (p<0.0004 and p<0.0001), while the results obtained in the Control Group did not show any significance. Conclusions These results led us to believe that hypnosis has the capacity to induce a nervous plasticity that supports learning of visual-spatial memory.","[{'authorId': '1450305608', 'name': 'Coco Marinella'}, {'authorId': '1450304784', 'name': 'Ramaci Tiziana'}, {'authorId': '2097282335', 'name': 'Viola Giuseppe'}, {'authorId': '1450305127', 'name': 'Guglielmino Antonino'}, {'authorId': '152563739', 'name': 'G.

The ADFL-d and ADFL-n aim to extract the expressive component and neutral component, respectively. The ADFL-r extracts the residual expression by calculating the difference between feature maps of ADFL-d and ADFL-n, and uses the residual expression feature for expression classification.

Sensory realism is subsumed within this broader perspective, as one of the means that contributes to the experience of presence. The effectiveness of the illusion of presence created by a virtual world can be partially assessed by studying visitors to virtual worlds' subjective experience ofhow much they feel like they are there and what makes them feel that way.

Design: Qualitative study with semistructured interviews. Setting: The stroke unit of an inner city teaching hospital. Participants: 22 patients with stroke who were undergoing rehabilitation; 14 with high motivation for rehabilitation and eight with low motivation. Results: All patients thought rehabilitation was important for recovery. High motivation patients were more likely to view rehabilitation as the most important means of recovery and to accord themselves an active role in rehabilitation. These patients were also more likely to understand rehabilitation and in particular to understand the specialist role of the nursing staff. Many patients reported independence at home as a personal goal, though few low motivation patients related this goal to success in rehabilitation. Information from professionals about rehabilitation, favourable comparisons with other stroke patients, and the desire to leave hospital had a positive effect on motivation. Conversely, overprotection from family members and professionals, lack of information or the receipt of “mixed messages” from professionals, and unfavourable comparisons with other patients had a negative effect. Conclusions: There are some differences in beliefs between stroke patients identified as having low or high motivation for rehabilitation. These beliefs seem to be influenced by the environment in which the patient is rehabilitated. Professionals and carers should be made aware of the ways in which their behaviour can positively and negatively affect motivation.","[{'authorId': '50254098', 'name': 'N.

4dd40e7edd1cc05650843d8c92249a8722cf0a8e,"Abstract Virtual Reality (VR) technology offers new opportunities for the development of innovative clinical research, assessment, and intervention tools. VR-based testing, training, teaching, and treatment approaches that would be difficult, if not impossible to deliver using traditional methods are now being developed that take advantage of the assets that are available with VR technology. As research evidence continues to indicate clinical efficacy, VR applications are being increasingly regarded as providing innovative options for targeting the cognitive, psychological, motor, and functional impairments that result from various clinical health conditions. VR allows for the precise presentation and control of stimuli within dynamic multisensory 3-D computer generated simulations as well as providing advanced methods for capturing and quantifying behavioral responses. These characteristics support the rationale for the use of VR applications in clinical assessment, intervention, and training. This article begins with a brief review of the history and rationale for the use of VR with clinical populations. We then detail one use-case for the clinical application of VR—the exposure therapy treatment of anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. While significant work is cited in other areas of Clinical VR (e.g., pain management, cognitive/physical assessment/rehabilitation, eating disorders, social skills/clinical training, etc.), a full overview of such a broad literature is beyond the scope of this article. Thus, we have opted to provide more in-depth analysis of one specific clinical area that clearly illustrates how VR has been successfully applied and is supported by an encouraging and evolving scientific literature.","[{'authorId': '29861580', 'name': 'A.

This study investigated the impact of mobile device use on student engagement and student success in online courses. The theory of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) was a foundation for understanding and measuring engagement behaviors of online students. The Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire (OSLQ) was the basis of the survey instrument. Participants were categorized into three groups of mobile device use (low, moderate, high). These three groups were used for comparison in each of the research questions. The research questions ask what impacts mobile learning has on student engagement, as measured with SRL; what impact mobile learning has on the SRL constructs of environment structuring, task management, and time management; and what associations mobile learning might have with student success and persistence. The ANOVA showed that mobile learning had a moderate impact on engagement for students in the high group. Students in each group engaged in environment structuring behaviors more than task strategies or time management behaviors. Students in the moderate and high groups engaged in task strategies more than the low group. Students in the high group engaged in time management behaviors more than the other groups.  The Crosstab analysis did not show an association between levels of mobile learning and course grade or persistence.

4ef9dc95408bcfa58847fe165666838c4aebb4d4,"Extreme-groups designs (EGDs) are common in psychopathology research, often using diagnostic category as an independent variable. Continuous-variable analysis strategies drawing from a general linear model framework can be applied to such designs. The growing emphasis on dimensional examinations of psychological constructs, encouraged by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria framework, encourages continuous-variable analytic strategies. However, the interpretative implications of applying these strategies to various types of populations and sample score distributions, including those used in EGDs, are not always recognized. Appropriateness and utility of EGDs depend in part on whether the goal is to determine whether a relationship exists between 2 variables or to determine its strength. Whereas the literature investigating EGDs has emphasized symmetrical thresholds for defining extreme groups (e.g., bottom 10% vs. top 10%), psychopathologists often employ asymmetric thresholds (e.g., above a diagnostic threshold vs. a broader range of scores in a healthy comparison group).

4f0e082b5d78c64a1e6898cd33ef04b9be4b5b3c,"Virtual reality (VR) has been proposed as a methodological tool to study the basic science of psychology and other fields. One key advantage of VR is that sharing of virtual content can lead to more robust replication and representative sampling. A database of standardized content will help fulfill this vision. There are two objectives to this study. First, we seek to establish and allow public access to a database of immersive VR video clips that can act as a potential resource for studies on emotion induction using virtual reality. Second, given the large sample size of participants needed to get reliable valence and arousal ratings for our video, we were able to explore the possible links between the head movements of the observer and the emotions he or she feels while viewing immersive VR. To accomplish our goals, we sourced for and tested 73 immersive VR clips which participants rated on valence and arousal dimensions using self-assessment manikins. We also tracked participants' rotational head movements as they watched the clips, allowing us to correlate head movements and affect. Based on past research, we predicted relationships between the standard deviation of head yaw and valence and arousal ratings. Results showed that the stimuli varied reasonably well along the dimensions of valence and arousal, with a slight underrepresentation of clips that are of negative valence and highly arousing. The standard deviation of yaw positively correlated with valence, while a significant positive relationship was found between head pitch and arousal. The immersive VR clips tested are available online as supplemental material.","[{'authorId': '7480323', 'name': 'Benjamin J. Li'}, {'authorId': '1737161', 'name': 'J.

The present study examined this hypothesis by testing whether frontal EEG activity during mood inductions versus a resting baseline predicted emotion regulation. EEG was recorded while participants (N = 66, 40 females) received a fearful, sad, or neutral mood induction. Emotion regulation was measured following the mood inductions as self-reported change in negative mood and as attention interference in a task with mood-congruent emotional distracters. Greater frontal EEG activity during the mood inductions versus baseline was associated with more effective emotion regulation: less post-induction sadness and anxiety and reduced mood-congruent attention interference effects. Effects did not differ between the left and right hemispheres. Results support the hypothesis that frontal EEG activity reflects both emotional context and emotion-regulatory capabilities.","[{'authorId': '37203914', 'name': 'Tracy A.

4fafc0c99a327cd0d5fc63e1c1613e3b72b2e3b7,"This article summarizes the contributions of hypnosis to our understanding of cognition. These contributions have been especially salient in the study of memory, and include source amnesia and the distinction between episodic and semantic memory; the occurrence of semantic priming in implicit (unconscious) memory; and paramnesia (false memory). Posthypnotic amnesia shows that explicit and implicit memory can be dissociated even under optimal encoding conditions. The hypnotic alterations of perception may expand the scope of central executive control over “low-level” sensory and perceptual processes, and offer a new perspective on perceptual couplings. Implicit (unconscious) perception in hypnosis is not subject to the same analytic limitations encountered in masked priming. In the study of “high-level” thought processes, hypnosis has played an important role in understanding the formation of delusional beliefs, and of intuitions in problem-solving. Studies of hypnosis suggest that automatic processes can be “de-automatized,” as in the reversal of Stroop interference by suggestions for hypnotic agnosia. In social cognition, Orne’s analysis of demand characteristics laid the foundations for the cognitive revolution in social psychology, by underscoring the status of subjects—and people outside the laboratory—as active, sentient, problem-solving agents. The search for correlates of hypnotizability led to the incorporation of openness to experience as a major cognitive dimension in the structure of personality. One topic for future research is the relationship between hypnotizability in children and their development of a theory of mind. Studies of hypnosis in children may shed new light on the development of the imagination.","[{'authorId': '4233912', 'name': 'J. Kihlstrom'}]",16.0,,142.0,Hypnosis and Cognition,2014.0

We here propose that information is gated by inhibiting task-irrelevant regions, thus routing information to task-relevant regions. The functional inhibition is reflected in oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8–13 Hz). From a physiological perspective the alpha activity provides pulsed inhibition reducing the processing capabilities of a given area. Active processing in the engaged areas is reflected by neuronal synchronization in the gamma band (30–100 Hz) accompanied by an alpha band decrease. According to this framework the brain could be studied as a network by investigating cross-frequency interactions between gamma and alpha activity. Specifically the framework predicts that optimal task performance will correlate with alpha activity in task-irrelevant areas. In this review we will discuss the empirical support for this framework. Given that alpha activity is by far the strongest signal recorded by EEG and MEG, we propose that a major part of the electrophysiological activity detected from the working brain reflects gating by inhibition.","[{'authorId': '1820484', 'name': 'O.

Accessing nature can in some circumstances, however, be difficult, especially for individuals with mobility constraints. Therefore, a growing body of work is investigating the ways to replace the in vivo experience with forms of “virtual” contact, in order to provide these individuals with at least some benefits of the natural environment. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of previous use of virtual reality (VR) nature in health and care settings and contemplate the potential use of this technology in future. Our central question is whether engaging with virtual nature can contribute to enhanced physical and emotional well-being in housebound or mobility-constrained individuals. We conclude that while contact with real-world nature is preferred, VR use can be an alternative in cases when in vivo contact with nature is not possible. There are many possibilities for the use of VR technology in psychiatric and medical care; however, the risks, benefits, and cost efficiency of these attempts should be carefully assessed and the outcomes should be measured in a scientifically valid manner. The current review has nonetheless demonstrated that VR nature could play a role in each of the proposed mediating mechanisms linking natural environments and health.","[{'authorId': '2118715390', 'name': 'M.

The current study presents initial psychometric data for a new scale designed to measure SP. Methods: Seventy-six adult OCD subjects were probed twice. Patients were assessed with an open clinical interview (considered as the “gold standard”) and with the following standardized instruments: Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Axis I Disorders, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Yale Global Tic Severity Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory. Results: SP were present in 51 OCD patients (67.1%). Tics were present in 16 (21.1%) of the overall sample. The presence of SP was significantly higher in early-onset OCD patients. There were no significant differences in the presence of SP according to comorbidity with tics or gender. The comparison between the results from the open clinical interviews and the University of São Paulo Sensory Phenomena Scale (USP-SPS) showed an excellent concordance between them, with no significant differences between interviewers. The inter-rater reliability between the expert raters for the USP-SPS was high, with K=.92. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the SP severity scores given by the two raters was .89. Conclusion: Preliminary results suggest that the USP-SPS is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing the presence and severity of SP in OCD subjects.","[{'authorId': '2175035', 'name': 'M.

One promising on-chip network design approach shown in recent studies is to add express channels to traditional mesh network as shortcuts to bypass intermediate routers, thereby reducing packet latency. This approach not only changes the packet latency models, but also greatly affects network traffic behaviors, both of which have not been fully exploited in existing mapping algorithms. In this article, we explore the opportunities in optimizing application mapping for flattened butterfly, a popular express channel-based on-chip network. Specifically, we identify the unique characteristics of flattened butterfly, analyze the opportunities and new challenges, and propose an efficient heuristic mapping algorithm. The proposed algorithm Contention-Aware Latency Minimal (CALM) is able to reduce unnecessary turns that would otherwise impose additional router pipeline latency to packets, as well as adjust forwarding traffic to reduce network contention latency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve, on average, 3.4X reduction in the number of turns, 24.8% reduction in contention latency, and 14.12% reduction in the overall packet latency.","[{'authorId': '46261050', 'name': 'Di Zhu'}, {'authorId': '7335314', 'name': 'Siyu Yue'}, {'authorId': '69467609', 'name': 'M.

Anxiety leads to substantial long-term problems and may underlie disruptive behaviors in the classroom as a result of the individual’s inability to tolerate anxiety-provoking situations. Thus, interventions in special needs schools that help adolescents cope with anxiety and, in turn, diminish disruptive classroom behaviors are needed. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a virtual reality biofeedback game, DEEP, on daily levels of state-anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a clinical sample. In addition, the study also aimed to examine the duration of the calm or relaxed state after playing DEEP. Methods A total of 8 adolescents attending a special secondary school for students with behavioral and psychiatric problems participated in a single-case experimental ABAB study. Over a 4-week period, participants completed 6 DEEP sessions. In addition, momentary assessments (ie, 3 times a day) of self-reported state-anxiety and teacher-reported classroom behavior were collected throughout all A and B phases. Results From analyzing the individual profiles, it was found that 6 participants showed reductions in anxiety, and 5 participants showed reductions in disruptive classroom behaviors after the introduction of DEEP. On a group level, results showed a small but significant reduction of anxiety (d=–0.29) and a small, nonsignificant reduction of disruptive classroom behavior (d=−0.16) on days when participants played DEEP. Moreover, it was found that the calm or relaxed state of participants after playing DEEP lasted for about 2 hours on average. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of the game, DEEP, as an intervention for anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a special school setting. Future research is needed to fully optimize and personalize DEEP as an intervention for the heterogeneous special school population.","[{'authorId': '1589467497', 'name': 'Rineke Bossenbroek'}, {'authorId': '5712457', 'name': 'A.

These systems interact not only in cooperative but also sometimes competitive ways in optimizing performance. Previous studies showed that manipulations reducing the engagement of frontal lobe-mediated explicit attentional processes could lead to improved performance in striatum-related procedural learning. In our study, hypnosis was used as a tool to reduce the competition between these 2 systems. We compared learning in hypnosis and in the alert state and found that hypnosis boosted striatum-dependent sequence learning. Since frontal lobe-dependent processes are primarily affected by hypnosis, this finding could be attributed to the disruption of the explicit attentional processes.

These general themes were addressed: 1) the relevance of learned helplessness as a basic process involved in the development of depression; 2) the limitations of our current taxonomy of psychological disorders; 3) the need to work towards a psychobiological process-based taxonomy; and 4) the clinical implications of implementing such a process-based taxonomy.","[{'authorId': '145260013', 'name': 'M.

512f65c9d21f129cca2ea7a9aa8b1e04f0c6238c,"Teachers of students with emotional/ behavioral disorders (EBD) work with the most difficult-to-teach and the most difficult-to-manage pupils. Students with EBD frequently engage in behavioral deviancies that include aggression, hyperactivity, lack of self-control, inattention, and disrespect for authority. In addition, behavioral excesses often detract from learning opportunities and preclude positive peer relationships. Instruction for most of these students must target social skills remediation along with increasing academic proficiency and self-esteem. Cognitive behavior modification (CBM) represents a viable approach to remediating behavioral deficits and excesses by providing individuals with the necessary tools to control their own behavior. As its name implies, CBM involves using the principles of inner speech to modify underlying cognitions that affect overt behavior (Mahoney, 1974; Meichenbaum, 1977). For example, problem-solving strategies incorporate a ""how""-to-think framework for students to use when modifying behavior rather than explicit ""what""to-think instruction from a teacher. In addition, CBM techniques, due to inherent components, allow students to generalize their learned behavior more so than teacher-operated systems that rely on external reward and punishment procedures (Harris & Pressley, 1991). The following investigation by Etscheidt (1991) is a good example of the effectiveness of interventions using CBM techniques. Etscheidt wanted to know if a specific CBM strategy could decrease the aggressive behaviors in students with EBD as compared to students who did not receive the instruction. Additionally, Etscheidt wanted to determine if the addition of a positive consequence (e.g., listening to music at the end of class) would further enhance the effectiveness of the CBM intervention. Etscheidt's program components were adapted from the Lochman, Nelson, and Sims (1981) Anger Coping Program, which provides students with a way to change aggressive responses into appropriate alternatives by modifying their thinking processes regarding the circumstances surrounding certain situations. The instruction also assists the students in developing, evaluating, and selecting appropriate alternative responses. Etscheidt's goals included increasing self-awareness; identifying a student's reaction to peer influences; providing avenues to identify problem situations; and using problem-solving techniques to identify, evaluate, and select alternative solutions for a specific social situation. In Etscheidt's program, students used the following sequential strategy when approaching a problem situation:","[{'authorId': '143907317', 'name': 'T.

We develop an EEG dataset acquired from 15 subjects. Each subject performs the experiments twice at the interval of a few days. DBNs are trained with differential entropy features extracted from multichannel EEG data. We examine the weights of the trained DBNs and investigate the critical frequency bands and channels. Four different profiles of 4, 6, 9, and 12 channels are selected. The recognition accuracies of these four profiles are relatively stable with the best accuracy of 86.65%, which is even better than that of the original 62 channels. The critical frequency bands and channels determined by using the weights of trained DBNs are consistent with the existing observations. In addition, our experiment results show that neural signatures associated with different emotions do exist and they share commonality across sessions and individuals. We compare the performance of deep models with shallow models.

In this paper, we propose a modular framework for human facial emotions’ recognition. The framework consists of two machine learning algorithms (for detection and classification) that could be trained offline for real-time applications. Initially, we detect faces in the images by exploring the AdaBoost cascade classifiers. We then extract neighborhood difference features (NDF), which represent the features of a face based on localized appearance information. The NDF models different patterns based on the relationships between neighboring regions themselves instead of considering only intensity information. The study is focused on the seven most important facial expressions that are extensively used in day-to-day life. However, due to the modular design of the framework, it can be extended to classify N number of facial expressions. For facial expression classification, we train a random forest classifier with a latent emotional state that takes care of the mis-/false detection. Additionally, the proposed method is independent of gender and facial skin color for emotion recognition. Moreover, due to the intrinsic design of NDF, the proposed method is illumination and orientation invariant. We evaluate our method on different benchmark datasets and compare it with five reference methods. In terms of accuracy, the proposed method gives 13% and 24% better results than the reference methods on the static facial expressions in the wild (SFEW) and real-world affective faces (RAF) datasets, respectively.","[{'authorId': '2907925', 'name': 'Abdulrahman Alreshidi'}, {'authorId': '14200860', 'name': 'M.

Correlational and path analyses revealed that teacher involvement was central to children's experiences in the classroom and that teacher provision of both autonomy support and optimal structure predicted children's motivation across the school year. Reciprocal effects of student motivation on teacher behavior were also found. Students who showed higher initial behavioral engagement received subsequently more of all 3 teacher behaviors. These findings suggest that students who are behaviorally disengaged receive teacher responses that should further undermine their motivation. The importance of the student-teacher relationship, especially interpersonal involvement, in optimizing student motivation is highlighted. What are the factors that motivate children to learn? Educators and parents value motivation in school for its own sake as well as for its long-term contribution to children's learning and self-esteem. Highly motivated children are easy to identify: They are enthusiastic, interested, involved, and curious; they try hard and persist; and they actively cope with challenges and setbacks. These are the children who should stay in school longer, learn more, feel better about themselves, and continue their education after high school. Recent research has borne this out (Ames & Ames, 1984, 1985; Pintrich, 1991; Stipek, 1988). Although motivated students are easy to recognize, they are difficult to find. Research shows that across the preschool to high school years, children's intrinsic motivation decreases and they feel increasingly alienated from learning (Harter, 1981).

Lack of student-student and student-teacher interactions is the primary reason causing student engagement to suffer. Recently, the widespread use of social networking sites such as Facebook has prompted researchers and educators to explore the use of this online platform to promote student engagement. Drawing on the development-in-sociocultural context perspective of student engagement, the current study contributes to this line of research by examining the indirect effect of perceived pedagogical affordance of Facebook on students’ cognitive engagement with knowledge sharing behaviour as a mediator and knowledge sharing self-efficacy as a moderator. Results of the moderated mediation analysis of the Rasch-calibrated self-report data from 399 higher education students revealed that the indirect effect of perceived pedagogical affordance of Facebook on cognitive engagement through knowledge sharing behaviour was significant among students who had moderate to strong confidence in knowledge sharing, but not significant among those with low confidence.

EEG signals have historically been considered to be too noise prone to allow recording of brain dynamics during human locomotion. Here we applied a channel-based artifact template regression procedure and a subsequent spatial filtering approach to remove gait-related movement artifact from EEG signals recorded during walking and running. We first used stride time warping to remove gait artifact from high-density EEG recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task performed while walking and running. Next, we applied infomax independent component analysis (ICA) to parse the channel-based noise reduced EEG signals into maximally independent components (ICs) and then performed component-based template regression. Applying channel-based or channel-based plus component-based artifact rejection significantly reduced EEG spectral power in the 1.5- to 8.5-Hz frequency range during walking and running. In walking conditions, gait-related artifact was insubstantial: event-related potentials (ERPs), which were nearly identical to visual oddball discrimination events while standing, were visible before and after applying noise reduction. In the running condition, gait-related artifact severely compromised the EEG signals: stable average ERP time-courses of IC processes were only detectable after artifact removal. These findings show that high-density EEG can be used to study brain dynamics during whole body movements and that mechanical artifact from rhythmic gait events may be minimized using a template regression procedure.","[{'authorId': '2629539', 'name': 'Joseph T.

This is the first randomized trial comparing virtual reality exposure therapy to in vivo exposure for social anxiety disorder.


METHOD
Participants with a principal diagnosis of social anxiety disorder who identified public speaking as their primary fear (N = 97) were recruited from the community, resulting in an ethnically diverse sample (M age = 39 years) of mostly women (62%). Participants were randomly assigned to and completed 8 sessions of manualized virtual reality exposure therapy, exposure group therapy, or wait list. Standardized self-report measures were collected at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up, and process measures were collected during treatment. A standardized speech task was delivered at pre- and posttreatment, and diagnostic status was reassessed at 3-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Analysis of covariance showed that, relative to wait list, people completing either active treatment significantly improved on all but one measure (length of speech for exposure group therapy and self-reported fear of negative evaluation for virtual reality exposure therapy). At 12-month follow-up, people showed significant improvement from pretreatment on all measures. There were no differences between the active treatments on any process or outcome measure at any time, nor differences on achieving partial or full remission.


CONCLUSION
Virtual reality exposure therapy is effective for treating social fears, and improvement is maintained for 1 year. Virtual reality exposure therapy is equally effective as exposure group therapy; further research with a larger sample is needed, however, to better control and statistically test differences between the treatments.","[{'authorId': '3554258', 'name': 'P.

Research has shown that the considerable cross-sectional covariation of DSM-IV emotional disorders is accounted for by common higher order dimensions such as neuroticism/behavioral inhibition (N/BI) and low positive affect/behavioral activation. Longitudinal studies indicate that the temporal covariation of these disorders can be explained by changes in N/BI and, in some cases, initial levels of N/BI are predictive of the temporal course of emotional disorders. The marked phenotypal overlap of the DSM-IV anxiety and mood disorders is a frequent source of diagnostic unreliability (e.g., temporal overlap in the shared features of generalized anxiety disorder and mood disorders, situation specificity of panic attacks in panic disorder and specific phobia). Although extant dimensional proposals may address some drawbacks associated with the DSM nosology (e.g., inadequate assessment of individual differences in disorder severity), these proposals do not reconcile key problems in current classification, such as modest reliability and high comorbidity. This article considers an alternative approach that emphasizes empirically supported common dimensions of emotional disorders over disorder-specific criteria sets. Selection and assessment of these dimensions are discussed along with how these methods could be implemented to promote more reliable and valid diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. For instance, the advantages of this system are discussed in context of transdiagnostic treatment protocols that are efficaciously applied to a variety of disorders by targeting their shared features.","[{'authorId': '145767336', 'name': 'T.

Given the context-dependent nature of these evaluations and the rise in studies set in naturalistic and ecologically valid consumption settings, it is crucial that we examine the impact of contextual variables on our current consumer emotion measurement methods.Design/methodology/approachThree important factors that influence meal-evoked emotion – meal time, location and social setting – were explored via online survey of 866 English-speaking adults from all over the world. Respondents were asked to recall three meals they had consumed in the past week and report on their subjective liking and emotional associations. Subjective liking was measured with a labelled affective magnitude scale and emotion was measured using EsSense25.FindingsDinner meals, meals eaten at the home of a family member or friend, and meals eaten with one's spouse or partner were rated highest in subjective liking. Meals eaten at work or alone were associated with the lowest intensities of positive emotion.Originality/valueThe majority of investigations into meal context and emotion have measured consumers' emotional associations in the moment and in the laboratory. The present study characterises the influence of contextual variables on the emotional associations of past eating experiences in naturalistic settings.","[{'authorId': '4740390', 'name': 'E.

A study with a mixed methods design was conducted with nine older adults diagnosed with dementia. Interventions consisted of four sessions, in which the participants’ engagement, psychological and behavioral symptoms, and simulation sickness symptoms were evaluated. Neuropsychiatric symptomatology and quality of life were measured pre- and post-intervention. Caregivers were interviewed regarding the effect of the approach. In most cases, participants appeared to enjoy the sessions, actively explored the 360° environment, and shared memories associated with the depicted locations, often spontaneously. There were no cases of significant increases in simulator sickness and psychological and behavioral symptoms during sessions, with only some instances of minor eyestrain, fullness of head, anxiety, irritability, and agitation being detected. Although there were no significant changes in the measured outcomes after intervention, the caregivers assessed the experience as potentially beneficial for most participants. In this study, promoting reminiscences with VR headsets was found to be a safe and engaging experience for people with dementia. However, future studies are required to better understand the added value of immersion, using VR, in reminiscence therapy.","[{'authorId': '2052855188', 'name': 'Tiago Coelho'}, {'authorId': '123745067', 'name': 'Cátia Marques'}, {'authorId': '2064320649', 'name': 'D.

Mobile health (mHealth) technology has the potential to intervene at various points in the emotion regulation process of adolescent mothers to provide them support for more adaptive emotional and behavioral regulation in the course of their daily life. Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the acceptability, feasibility, use patterns, and mechanisms by which a mobile technology used as an adjunct to in-person, provider-delivered sessions fostered adolescent mothers’ adaptive emotion regulation strategies under real-life conditions. Methods: Participants (N=49) were enrolled in the intervention condition of a larger pilot study of homeless adolescent mothers living in group-based shelters. The mHealth technology. Calm Mom, consisted of a mobile app and a wrist-worn sensorband for the ambulatory measurement and alerting of increased electrodermal activity (EDA), a physiological measurement of stress. We examined logs of mobile app activity and conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with a subsample (N=10) of participants. Qualitative data analysis was guided by the theoretical frames of the intervention and a technology acceptance model and included an analysis of emerging themes and concepts. Results: Overall, participants indicated that one or more of the elements of Calm Mom supported their ability to effectively regulate their emotions in the course of their daily life in ways that were consonant with the intervention’s theoretical model. For many adolescent mothers, the app became an integral tool for managing stress. Due to technical challenges, fewer participants received sensorband alerts; however, those who received alerts reported high levels of acceptability as the technology helped them to identify their emotions and supported them in engaging in more adaptive behaviors during real-life stressful situations with their children, peers, and family members. Conclusions: Calm Mom is a promising technology for providing theoretically driven behavioral intervention strategies during real-life stressful moments among a highly vulnerable population. Future research efforts will involve addressing technology challenges and refining tailoring algorithms for implementation in larger-scale studies.","[{'authorId': '38794722', 'name': 'N.

The opponent process and implicit memory theories served as the study’s main theoretical frameworks. An experiment was conducted in which we developed the team identification implicit association test (Team ID IAT) as a measure of iTeam ID and manipulated spectators’ emotions based on their retrospective spectating experiences. We conclude from the findings that anger, fear, and sadness paradoxically enhanced flow experiences and subsequent consumption behaviors for spectators with stronger iTeam ID, whereas happiness was universally appealing regardless of the level of iTeam ID. A recommendation is to strategically create experiences that elicit both positive and negative emotions in spectators to encourage flow.","[{'authorId': '103655777', 'name': 'Yonghwan Chang'}, {'authorId': '4424901', 'name': 'D.

Simple regression/correlation is often applied to non-independent observations or aggregated data; this may produce biased, specious results due to violation of independence and/or differing patterns between-participants versus within-participants. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations. Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common regression slope, the association shared among individuals. To make rmcorr accessible, we provide background information for its assumptions and equations, visualization, power, and tradeoffs with rmcorr compared to multilevel modeling. We introduce the R package (rmcorr) and demonstrate its use for inferential statistics and visualization with two example datasets. The examples are used to illustrate research questions at different levels of analysis, intra-individual, and inter-individual. Rmcorr is well-suited for research questions regarding the common linear association in paired repeated measures data. All results are fully reproducible.","[{'authorId': '2046924', 'name': 'J.

This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize the human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of sequential floating forward search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.","[{'authorId': '1719389', 'name': 'Rosalind W.

The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, categorization, spatial cognition, memory, moral reasoning and self‐concepts. This review (1) indicates caution in addressing questions of human nature based on this thin slice of humanity, and (2) suggests that understanding human psychology will require tapping broader subject pools.

Third-year professional pharmacy students independently completed seven stations requiring skills such as communication, following directions, reading comprehension, and cognition while listening to an audio recording simulating what one experiencing auditory hallucinations may hear. Following the simulation, students participated in a faculty-led debriefing and completed a written reflection. Assessment. The Kiersma-Chen Empathy Scale was completed by each student before and after the simulation to measure changes in empathy. The written reflections were read and qualitatively analyzed. Empathy scores increased significantly after the simulation. Qualitative analysis showed students most frequently reported feeling distracted and frustrated. All student participants recommended the simulation be offered to other student pharmacists, and 99% felt the simulation would impact their future careers. Conclusions. With approximately 10 million adult Americans suffering from serious mental illness, it is important for pharmacy educators to prepare students to provide adequate patient care to this population.

Low-intensity, automated virtual reality (VR) interventions (not requiring a therapist) is a scalable and promising solution now that VR is an accessible and mature, consumer technology. Yet unlike with phobias, there have been few attempts at translating evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapeutic (CBT) techniques for depression into the VR modality. In this paper, we discuss how specific CBT techniques can be made into VR experiences, including psychoeducation, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and social skills training. We also discuss how VR-unique experiences, such as alternative embodiment and virtual pet interactions, can be made therapeutic. Creating a pre-clinical and clinical evidence base for these types of novel interventions should be considered a research priority, and high-quality development on par with other consumer VR applications will be essential to the success of any consumer-targeted intervention.

We explored brain-signal based workload predictors that differ with respect to the level of label information required for training, including entirely unsupervised approaches. Approach. Subjects executed a task on a touch screen that required continuous effort of visual and motor processing with alternating difficulty. We first employed classical approaches for workload state classification that operate on the sensor space of EEG and compared those to the performance of three state-of-the-art spatial filtering methods: common spatial patterns (CSPs) analysis, which requires binary label information; source power co-modulation (SPoC) analysis, which uses the subjects’ error rate as a target function; and canonical SPoC (cSPoC) analysis, which solely makes use of cross-frequency power correlations induced by different states of workload and thus represents an unsupervised approach. Finally, we investigated the effects of fusing brain signals and peripheral physiological measures (PPMs) and examined the added value for improving classification performance. Main results. Mean classification accuracies of 94%, 92% and 82% were achieved with CSP, SPoC, cSPoC, respectively. These methods outperformed the approaches that did not use spatial filtering and they extracted physiologically plausible components. The performance of the unsupervised cSPoC is significantly increased by augmenting it with PPM features. Significance. Our analyses ensured that the signal sources used for classification were of cortical origin and not contaminated with artifacts. Our findings show that workload states can be successfully differentiated from brain signals, even when less and less information from the experimental paradigm is used, thus paving the way for real-world applications in which label information may be noisy or entirely unavailable.","[{'authorId': '1399277993', 'name': 'M.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology and emerging digital behavioral pain therapy with analgesic efficacy for acute pain. We found no scientific literature on skills-based VR behavioral programs for chronic pain populations. Objective The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a self-administered VR program that included content and skills informed by evidence-based behavioral treatment for chronic pain. The secondary aim is to determine the preliminary efficacy of the VR program in terms of average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep, and its impact on pain-related cognition and self-efficacy. The tertiary aim was to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and compare the VR treatment with an audio-only treatment. This comparison isolated the immersive effects of the VR program, thereby informing potential mechanisms of effect. Methods We conducted an RCT involving a web-based convenience sample of adults (N=97) aged 18-75 years with self-reported chronic nonmalignant low back pain or fibromyalgia, with an average pain intensity >4 over the past month and chronic pain duration >6 months. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 unblinded treatments: (1) VR: a 21-day, skills-based VR program for chronic pain; and (2) audio: an audio-only version of the 21-day VR program. The analytic data set included participants who completed at least 1 of 8 surveys administered during the intervention period: VR (n=39) and audio (n=35). Results The VR and audio groups launched a total of 1067 and 1048 sessions, respectively. The majority of VR participants (n=19/25, 76%) reported no nausea or motion sickness. High satisfaction ratings were reported for VR (n=24/29, 83%) and audio (n=26/33, 72%). For VR efficacy, symptom improvement over time was found for each pain variable (all P<.001), with results strengthening after 2 weeks. Importantly, significant time×group effects were found in favor of the VR group for average pain intensity (P=.04), pain-related inference with activity (P=.005), sleep (P<.001), mood (P<.001), and stress (P=.003). For pain catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy, we found a significant declining trend for both treatment groups. Conclusions High engagement and satisfaction combined with low levels of adverse effects support the feasibility and acceptability of at-home skills-based VR for chronic pain. A significant reduction in pain outcomes over the course of the 21-day treatment both within the VR group and compared with an audio-only version suggests that VR has the potential to provide enhanced treatment and greater improvement across a range of pain outcomes.

Within-session process outcomes (subjective units of distress and belief ratings on individual behavioral experiments), as well as patient feedback, generated the hypothesis that this type of virtual environment can potentially add value to CBT by helping patients understand the role of avoidance and safety behaviors in the maintenance of social anxiety and paranoia and by boosting their confidence to carry out ""real-life"" behavioral experiments.","[{'authorId': '2322850', 'name': 'L.

A systematic review was completed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines with the aim of exploring associations between emotions and eating behaviour in a population affected by obesity and binge eating disorder (BED). A comprehensive literature search of four electronic databases (2004–2014) yielded 15 studies for inclusion. Included studies performed poorly on data quality analysis with respect to controlling for confounding variables, and sample size. Included papers largely focused on negative emotions as antecedents of BE; depression was consistently associated with a BED‐obese classification and BE. Negative mood, sadness, tension and instability of emotions were found to be antecedents of BE in an adult BED‐obese sample. However, findings were mixed regarding the role of stress, anger and positive emotions within the BED‐obese population. Recommendations are presented for the identification of BED, and ecologically valid experimental designs that further understanding of the complex and varied emotions that associate with BE.

In this scoping review, we summarize peer-reviewed articles published up to Jan-21, 2021, on the use of VR to promote wellbeing in PwD. Eighteen manuscripts (reporting on 19 studies) met the inclusion criteria, with a majority published in the past 2 years. Two reviewers independently coded the articles regarding A) intended clinical outcomes and effectiveness of the interventions, B) study sample (characteristics of the participants), C) intervention administration (by whom, what setting), D) experimental methods (design/instruments), and E) technical properties of the VR-systems (hardware/devices and software/content). Emotional outcomes were by far the most common objectives of the interventions, reported in seventeen (89.5%) of the included articles. Outcomes addressing social engagement and personhood in PwD have not been thoroughly explored using VR. Based on the positive impact of VR, future opportunities lie in identifying special features and customization of the hardware/software to afford the most benefit to different sub-groups of the target population. Overall, this review found that VR represents a promising tool for promoting wellbeing in PwD, with positive or neutral impact reported on emotional, social, and functional aspects of wellbeing.","[{'authorId': '19811117', 'name': 'Lora Appel'}, {'authorId': '2125426634', 'name': 'S.

Randomized into two groups-HMD versus mobile phone VR-participants navigated pain distraction virtual environments while undergoing surgery. Vital signs and subjective pain measurements via a visual analog scale were taken before, during, and after the surgery. Results indicate that the HMD group reported greater pain reduction than the Mobile group. Overall, this study points to the efficacy of nonpharmacological pain attenuation practices. Although both systems reduced pain during surgery, the clinically validated VR environments seen in the HMD group were more effective. This study does show that inexpensive solutions can work in surgical settings.

Many actions in the real world require that people act without prior planning, and these actions are executed quite successfully. In this paper, we study the common action of two people passing through an aperture together in both the real world (Experiment 1) and in a distributed, collaborative IVE (Experiment 2). The aperture's width is varied from too narrow to be passable to so wide as to be easily passable by both participants together simultaneously. We do this in the real world for all possible gender-based pairings. In virtual reality, however, there is potential for the gender of the participant and the gender of the self-avatar to be different. We also investigate the joint action for all possible gender-based pairings in the distributed IVE. Results indicated that, in the real world, social dynamics between gendered pairings emerged; male-male pairings refused to concede to one another until absolutely necessary while other pairings did not. Male-female pairings were most likely to provide ample space to one another during passage. These behaviors seemed not to appear in the IVE, and avatar gender across all pairings generated no significant behavioral differences. In addition, participants tended to require wider gaps to allow for passage in the IVE. These findings establish base knowledge of social dynamics and affordance behaviors within multi-user IVEs.","[{'authorId': '1693375988', 'name': 'Lauren E.

In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far.

It is timely to reconsider the nosology of this disorder, assessing whether changes to diagnostic criteria as well as subtypes and specifiers may improve diagnostic validity and clinical utility. Methods: The existing criteria were evaluated. Key issues were identified. Electronic databases of PubMed, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO were searched for relevant studies. Results: This review presents a number of options and preliminary recommendations to be considered for DSM‐V. These include: (1) clarifying and simplifying the definition of obsessions and compulsions (criterion A); (2) possibly deleting the requirement that people recognize that their obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable (criterion B); (3) rethinking the clinical significance criterion (criterion C) and, in the interim, possibly adjusting what is considered “time‐consuming” for OCD; (4) listing additional disorders to help with the differential diagnosis (criterion D); (5) rethinking the medical exclusion criterion (criterion E) and clarifying what is meant by a “general medical condition”; (6) revising the specifiers (i.e., clarifying that OCD can involve a range of insight, in addition to “poor insight,” and adding “tic‐related OCD”); and (7) highlighting in the DSM‐V text important clinical features of OCD that are not currently mentioned in the criteria (e.g., the major symptom dimensions). Conclusions: A number of changes to the existing diagnostic criteria for OCD are proposed. These proposed criteria may change as the DSM‐V process progresses.

This article examines how the immersive presentation of 360-video nonfiction contents impacts both empathy toward the characters and enjoyment of the experience and the interplay between these two psychological outcomes. Participants watched a series of 360-video stories presented either on a virtual reality headset or a screen, and measures of spatial presence, empathy (in terms of perspective taking and empathic concern), and enjoyment were collected. Mediation analyses and structural equation models showed a direct positive effect of spatial presence on perspective taking and empathic concern, and an indirect negative effect of immersive presentation on empathic concern through enjoyment. These findings indicate that enjoyment of pleasurable aspects of the experience may hinder the affective dimension of empathy toward the characters, and point out to the need to carefully consider the targeted reactions from the audience, since different intended psychological outcomes may not be fully compatible.","[{'authorId': '1402953956', 'name': 'Miguel Barreda-Ángeles'}, {'authorId': '1413521737', 'name': 'Sara Aleix-Guillaume'}, {'authorId': '1405320710', 'name': 'Alexandre Pereda-Baños'}]",22.0,,43.0,"An ""Empathy Machine"" or a ""Just-for-the-Fun-of-It"" Machine?

57dd28efb069d1b65acc5d884ca81df0cda32c50,"Zajonc and I differ greatly in our conceptualization of emotion and its relations with cognition, as well as in our evaluation of the evidence. My reply is in two parts. First, I discuss the boundaries of emotion as a phenomenon and whether sensory preferences can be regarded as emotions; second, I make an analysis of the evidence Zajonc regards as supporting his claims for the independence of cognition and emotion and the primacy of emotion. My aims are to sharpen the philosophical and empirical issues that underlie our disagreement and to emphasize the indeterminancy of the issue of cognitive versus emotional primacy. This latter issue is less important than the task of exploring the cognitive contents or meanings that shape each kind of emotional reaction. Finally, I offer a brief programmatic statement about what cognitivists can do to advance our understanding of emotion over the life course. The latest riposte by Zajonc (1984) has, in my view, not helped to clarify our understanding of the relationship between cognition and emotion. Zajonc takes my reasoning (Lazarus, 1982) to task in two major ways. First he complains that my position cannot be falsified because I defined emotion as requiring cognitive appraisal, then that I have ignored the evidence that emotion can occur without cognitive activity, which he cites. I believe he is wrong about my epistemological position and wrong that the evidence supports the primacy of emotion or its independence from cognition. The body of this reply consists of a discussion of the definitional issue and why I think the empirical case he makes is specious. My objective is to sharpen the issue and sustain my position and that of like-minded cognitivists. The Definitional Issue Definitions do not arise out of the blue; they are an integral part of a theory that helps delimit the phenomena of interest and organize observations. In my view, emotion reflects a constantly changing personenvironment relationship. When central life agendas (e.g., biological survival, personal and social values and goals) are engaged, this relationship becomes a source of emotion. Therefore, an emotional experience cannot be understood solely in terms of what happens inside the person or in the brain, but grows out of ongoing transactions with the environment that are evaluated. Cognitive activity is a necessary precondition of emotion because to experience an emotion, people must comprehend—whether in the form of a primitive evaluative perception or a highly differentiated symbolic process—that their well-being is implicated in a transaction, for better or worse. A creature that is oblivious to the significance of what is happening for its well-being does not react with an emotion. This same point has been stated cogently in various ways by numerous multidisciplinary scholars who responded recently to an article on a general psychobiological theory of emotions by Panksepp (1982) appearing in The Behavioral and Brain Sciences. The conception that the meaning or significance of a transaction is crucial to emotion forces us to restrict its definition to some psychophysiological phenomena and to reject others as outside its purview. The searching question is what an emotion is or is not. Zajonc evades this question. Thus, he takes me to task for doing what any good theorist should do with definitions, but he does not do himself—namely, specify the phenomena of interest. Emotion, for example, is not just physiological arousal, though such arousal is one of the traditional defining attributes. Arousal can be produced by exercising vigorously or entering a hot or cold room. Doing this will produce an emotion only if we appraise the encounter (e.g., the physical and social conditions and the bodily state it produces) as having a bearing on our well-being, as when, for example, it presents some physical danger or brings blissful relief from discomfort. Startle is a reaction that has long but erroneously been included under the rubric of emotion. Ekman (in press) presents new experimental evidence that startle might better be regarded as a reflex, like the knee jerk, because it does not behave as do other reactions we call emotions. He examined facial and bodily responses under four conditions: when subjects did not know at what moment a blank pistol would be fired; when they did know the moment; when they tried to inhibit the startle reaction; and when they attempted to simulate a genuine startle. Ekman contrasted emotions with startle. He found that the startle was easy to elicit and was consistently the initial response to a gunshot; in contrast, there is no single elicitor that will always call forth the same emotion in adults. Moreover, the startle response could not 124 February 1984 • American Psychologist Copyright 1984 by the American Psychological Association, Inc. Vol. 39, No. 2, 124-129 be totally inhibited; in contrast, emotions can. Nor could the startle be simulated correctly by any subject. On the basis of these findings, the startle response seems fixed and rigid in comparison to emotions, and once elicited it seems to run its course. Thus, from the perspective of a relational and cognitive conceptualization of emotion, I think we should exclude startle from the rubric of emotion, as I advocated in my earlier discussion in this journal (Lazarus, 1982). Historically, there has been much concern about diverse phenomena for which emotion terms are employed, such as moods, sentiments, emotion traits, and actual emotional reactions (cf. Ortony & Clore, 1981). Moods usually refer to sustained general states, such as sadness and contentment, that may or may not be considered emotions depending on theoretical and definitional conventions. Sentiments refer to characteristic ways a person evaluates an object (person, idea, thing); they operate as dispositions to react emotionally to that object but are not in themselves emotions. Another questionable category of emotion consists of personality traits, such as cheerful, which could in some instances describe an actual emotion, as in ""I feel cheerful,"" but could in other instances describe a trait, not an actual emotional response, as in ""I am a cheerful person."" Some emotion terms are heavily detached, lukewarm, or cold, such as interested, whereas others, such as enraged, are hot. As Ortony and Clore pointed out, it makes a considerable difference how such terms are used by subjects in emotion research. In the 1940s and 1950s, a period characterized by the scientific outlook sometimes called logical positivism, the dominant view in psychology was that emotions could not be defined and studied as such but represented intervening variables (cf. Brown & Farber, 1951; Lazarus, 1968; Lazarus, Kanner, & Folkman, 1980). Although similar attitudes still exist, the more restrictive treatment of emotions in the past has given way to a view that allows much greater latitude in their study; this view depends heavily on what subjects report, but can be supplemented by simultaneous assessments of behavioral and physiological response variables. Emotions are commonly conceptualized and studied as an organic mix of action impulses and bodily expressions, diverse positive or dysphoric (subjective) cognitive-affective states, and physiological disturbances. Although there are arguments about whether these physiological disturbances are diffuse or patterned, an emotion is not I acknowledge with appreciation several valued colleagues who carefully read, criticized, and made suggestions on an earlier draft of this article. They include Paul Ekman, Susan Folkman, Barbara Mellers, and Philip Tetlock; Carol Carr warrants special mention for her skilled editorial assistance. Regrettably, acute limitations in our resources dictate that reprints will not be available. definable solely by behavior, subjective reports, or physiological changes; its identification requires all three components, since each one can be generated by conditions that do not necessarily elicit emotion, as in the example of arousal by exercise given above. An emotion researcher must worry about which response states or processes can be called emotions and which cannot; meeting one or even two of the three response criteria is not enough. With respect to the debate between Zajonc and me, a critical question is, On what basis should preferences (e.g., for taste, smell, or photographs of faces) be regarded as emotions? We must ask a similar question about aesthetic reactions to a pretty picture, a pleasing sunset, a stirring piece of music, or a fine piece of literature. Some years ago, while examining emotion and feeling in psychology and art, Arnheim (1958) pointed out that emotion in artistic experience is not merely a passive receipt or apprehension of information, but requires active, involved participation. As with sensory preferences, what may pass for an emotional (aesthetic) response may be nothing more than a pro forma statement that implies emotion but does not necessarily reflect it, as when one casually says, ""That's a pretty picture"" in a manner more indicative of labeling than emotion. Although preferences can involve emotions, even strong ones, they often seem to fall at the ambiguous borderline between emotion and nonemotion. On the one hand, statements of preference can be ""cold cognitions"" expressing merely a social requirement to make a choice, or on the other hand, they can be expressions of genuine emotional involvement. In the research Zajonc cites, we do not know whether in expressing a preference (e.g., ""I like him more"") subjects are experiencing an emotion, as indicated by multileveled response criteria, or merely expressing an intellectual choice. If the latter, then preferences must be excluded from the category of emotions; if the former, they fall under the rubric of emotion. Zajonc fails to come to grips with this problem, and he makes no mention of the alternative st","[{'authorId': '5628684', 'name': 'R. Lazarus'}]",1207.0,,31.0,On the Primacy of Cognition.,1984.0

Virtual reality (VR) therapy may be an effective tool in treating urges and cravings in substance use disorder (SUD). Given the high co-occurrence of difficulties with mood, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation with SUD, this review sought to examine the extant literature on the efficacy of VR for SUD in improving these secondary treatment outcomes.


METHODS
A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in PubMed, PsychInfo, and Embase. Studies were included if they utilized immersive VR, were conducted with individuals with substance use disorder/dependence/misuse, and included measures of mood, anxiety, depression, emotional dysregulation, or retention in treatment.


RESULTS
Seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Five studies were conducted on patients using nicotine and utilized a cue-exposure intervention. VR was effective at reducing substance use and cravings in the majority of studies. Results on the efficacy of VR for improving mood, anxiety, and emotional regulation were mixed. Work examining retention in treatment was limited.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
VR for SUD has the potential to improve mood and anxiety symptoms as well as retention in treatment for patients with SUD, particularly if the therapy targets these psychological symptoms. Future studies examining components of VR for SUD in individuals with drug use disorders, as well as examinations of targeted interventions for associated mood, emotional dysregulation, and retention in treatment, are necessary.


SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE
This is the first systematic review of the impact of VR on mood, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation for individuals with substance use.","[{'authorId': '2122862379', 'name': 'Daria Taubin'}, {'authorId': '2165678903', 'name': 'Amy F.

To determine whether empathy can be taught, researchers have evaluated empathy training programs. After excluding 1 outlier study that showed a very large effect with few participants, the meta-analysis included 18 randomized controlled trials of empathy training with a total of 1,018 participants. The findings suggest that empathy training programs are effective overall, with a medium effect (g = 0.63), adjusted to 0.51 after trim-and-fill evaluation for estimated publication bias. Moderator analyses indicated that 4 factors were statistically significantly associated with higher effect sizes: (a) training health professionals and university students rather than other types of individuals, (b) compensating trainees for their participation, (c) using empathy measures that focus exclusively on assessing understanding the emotions of others, feeling those emotions, or commenting accurately on the emotions, and (d) using objective measures rather than self-report measures. Number of hours of training and time between preintervention assessment and postintervention assessment were not statistically significantly associated with effect size, with 6 months the longest time period for assessment.

Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.
 MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.
 RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score ≥10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.
 CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.","[{'authorId': '3737608', 'name': 'K. Kroenke'}, {'authorId': '2069763', 'name': 'R.

We conducted an experiment trial with 25 participants to compare the three modalities against a standard treatment (deep breathing) and a control condition (the game without biofeedback). Our results indicate that breathing-based game biofeedback is more effective in inducing relaxation during treatment than the other four groups. Participants in this group also showed greater retention of the relaxation skills (without biofeedback) during a subsequent stressor.","[{'authorId': '3925007', 'name': 'A.

Rev. 9, 399-431 (1929)]. However, recent studies [Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 1343-1346 (1993); Fractals in Biology and Medicine (Birkhauser-Verlag, Basel, 1994), pp. 55-65] reveal that under normal conditions, beat-to-beat fluctuations in heart rate display the kind of long-range correlations typically exhibited by dynamical systems far from equilibrium [Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 381-384 (1987)]. In contrast, heart rate time series from patients with severe congestive heart failure show a breakdown of this long-range correlation behavior. We describe a new method--detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)--for quantifying this correlation property in non-stationary physiological time series. Application of this technique shows evidence for a crossover phenomenon associated with a change in short and long-range scaling exponents. This method may be of use in distinguishing healthy from pathologic data sets based on differences in these scaling properties.","[{'authorId': '143856496', 'name': 'Chung-Kang Peng'}, {'authorId': '40191926', 'name': 'S.

5972fd3bd240ca9444ed78ec67da53d5837c2331,"The author suggests that a multifaceted approach is optimal in the assessment of children who meet criteria for AD/HD. The diagnosis of AD/HD is often discounted by psychoanalysts because it is purely descriptive and behavioral, but it can be understood in psychoanalytic terms as a disturbance in ego functioning, namely in the synthetic, integrative function. The impact of this disturbance on development and its reverberation with dynamics, both intra-psychic and familial, create complex and highly individualized clinical presentations that evolve as development proceeds. Psychoanalytically informed evaluation and treatment recommendations are optimal, because enlightened psychoanalysts can integrate the multiple contributions to the clinical picture and craft an appropriate and balanced approach to help the child and the family toward progressive development. Such an approach may include medication, parent counseling, remediation, and psychoanalytic psychotherapy or psychoanalysis. There is an incongruity … between the analyst's therapeutic thinking, which is metapsychological, i.e., directed toward the dynamic, economic, genetic, and structural aspects of psychic functioning, and his thinking as a diagnostician, which proceeds on the basis of concepts and categories which are descriptive. The difference between these viewpoints is so fundamental that it has caused many analysts to withdraw their interest altogether from diagnostic assessment as from an area which is neither essential nor very significant for their field of work, and has caused some others to regard all their patients' abnormalities as mere variations of the many vagaries and complexities of human behavior…. If symptoms are viewed merely as manifest phenomena, dealing with them remains arid so far as analytic interest is concerned. If the clinician is alerted to see opening up behind these the whole range of possible derivations, causations, and developmental affiliations, the field becomes fascinating, and scrutinizing a child's symptomatology becomes a truly analytic task. Besides, so far as work with children is concerned, diagnostic assessment is more than a mere intellectual exercise for the clinician. It is, in fact, the only true guide to the choice of therapeutic method.","[{'authorId': '49778919', 'name': 'K.

A two-compartment diffusion model was found to adequately describe a standard SCR shape based on the process of sweat diffusion. Nonnegative deconvolution is used to decompose SC data into discrete compact responses and at the same time assess deviations from the standard SCR shape, which could be ascribed to the additional process of pore opening.

Each picture was contained in a separate virtual room that the participants traveled through along a preset path. The estimation employed EMOTIV EPOC+ 14-channel EEG headset and a custom-developed application. The software wirelessly received EEG signals from alpha, beta low, beta high, gamma and theta bands, time-stamped them and dynamically stored in a relational database for subsequent analysis. Our preliminary results show that statistically significant correlations between valence and arousal ratings of pictures and EEG bands are present but highly personalized. Simultaneous correct placement of VR and EEG headsets is demanding and precise localization of electrodes is difficult. In fact, if emotion estimation is not strictly necessary we recommend using devices with fewer electrodes. Nevertheless, we found the EEG to be effective. By acknowledging its limitations, and using the headset in the correct context, experiments involving emotions may be significantly amended.","[{'authorId': '2069610083', 'name': 'M.

5a518c21ad9efb79318c7eb0530d8baa7f64dd44,"Behavioral therapy techniques for treating phobias often includes graded exposure of the patient to anxiety-producing stimuli (Systematic Desensitization). However, in utilizing systematic desensitization, research reviews demonstrate that many patients appear to have difficulty imaging the prescribed anxiety-evoking scene. They also express strong aversion to experiencing real situations. This chapter describes the Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT), a new therapeutical approach that can be used to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in the traditional treatment of phobias. VRT, like current imaginal and in vivo modalities, can generate stimuli that could be utilized in desensitization therapy. Like systematic desensitization therapy, VRT can provide stimuli for patients who have difficulty in imagining scenes and/or are too phobic to experience real situations. Unlike in vivo systematic desensitization, VRT can be performed within the privacy of a room, thus avoiding public embarrassment and violation of patient confidentiality. VRT can generate stimuli of much greater magnitude than standard in vivo techniques. Since VRT is under patient control, it appears safer than in vivo desensitization and at the same time more realistic than imaginal desensitization. Finally, VRT adds the advantage of greater efficiency and economy in delivering the equivalent of in vivo systematic desensitization within the therapist's office. The chapter also describes how to use virtual reality in the treatment of specific phobias: fear of flying, fear of heights, fear of being in certain situations (such as a dark barn, an enclosed bridge over a river, and in the presence of an animal [a black cat] in a dark room), and fear of public speaking.","[{'authorId': '3176814', 'name': 'M.

The model shows how behavioral inhibition is related to and necessary for the proficient performance of four executive functions that subserve self-regulation: nonverbal working memory; the internalization of speech; the self-regulation of affect, motivation, and arousal; and reconstitution. These functions permit the construction, execution, and control of behavior by internally represented information, which removes behavior from control by the immediate context and brings it under the control of time. ADHD disrupts this process and returns control of behavior to the temporal now. A blindness to past, future, and time more generally, as well as an inability to direct behavior toward the future and to sustain it are among many of the deficits predicted by this model for persons with ADHD.","[{'authorId': '5082316', 'name': 'R.

Thus we used fMRI to determine which brain areas subserve processing of high‐valence expressions and if distinct brain areas are activated when facial expressions are processed explicitly or implicitly. Nine healthy volunteers were scanned (1.5T GE Signa with ANMR, TE/TR 40/3,000 ms) during two similar experiments in which blocks of mixed happy and angry facial expressions (“on” condition) were alternated with blocks of neutral faces (control “off” condition). Experiment 1 examined explicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial expression. Experiment 2 examined implicit processing of expressions by requiring subjects to attend to, and judge, facial gender, which was counterbalanced in both experimental conditions. Processing of facial expressions significantly increased regional blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) activity in fusiform and middle temporal gyri, hippocampus, amygdalohippocampal junction, and pulvinar nucleus. Explicit processing evoked significantly more activity in temporal lobe cortex than implicit processing, whereas implicit processing evoked significantly greater activity in amygdala region. Mixed high‐valence facial expressions are processed within temporal lobe visual cortex, thalamus, and amygdalohippocampal complex. Also, neural substrates for explicit and implicit processing of facial expressions are dissociable: explicit processing activates temporal lobe cortex, whereas implicit processing activates amygdala region.

At the underlying representational or cognitive level, these operations are processed in an egocentric reference frame, where locations are represented centered around another person's (3PP) or one's own perspective (1PP). To study 3PP and 1PP, both operating in egocentric frames, a virtual scene with an avatar and red balls in a room was presented from different camera viewpoints to normal volunteers (n = 11) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. The task for the subjects was to count the objects as seen either from the avatar's perspective (3PP) or one's own perspective (1PP). The scene was presented either from a ground view (GV) or an aerial view (AV) to investigate the effect of view on perspective taking. The factors perspective (3PP vs. 1PP) and view (GV vs. AV) were arranged in a two-factorial way. Reaction times were increased and percent correctness scores were decreased in 3PP as opposed to 1PP. To detect the neural mechanisms associated with perspective taking, functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed. Data were analyzed using SPM'99 in each subject and non-parametric statistics on the group level. Activations common to 3PP and 1PP (relative to baseline) were observed in a network of occipital, parietal, and prefrontal areas. Deactivations common to 3PP and 1PP (relative to baseline) were observed predominantly in mesial (i.e., parasagittal) cortical and lateral superior temporal areas bilaterally. Differential increases of neural activity were found in mesial superior parietal and right premotor cortex during 3PP (relative to 1PP), whereas differential increases during 1PP (relative to 3PP) were found in mesial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal cortex bilaterally. The data suggest that in addition to joint neural mechanisms, for example, due to visuospatial processing and decision making, 3PP and 1PP rely on differential neural processes. Mesial cortical areas are involved in decisional processes when the spatial task is solved from one's own viewpoint, whereas egocentric operations from another person's perspective differentially draw upon cortical areas known to be involved in spatial cognition.","[{'authorId': '2051580', 'name': 'K.

Even though it is commonly accepted that speech emotion perceived by the listener is close to the intended emotion conveyed by the speaker, research has indicated that there still remains a mismatch between them. In addition, the individuals with different personalities generally have different emotion expressions. Based on the investigation, in this study, a support vector machine (SVM)-based emotion model is first developed to detect perceived emotion from daily conversational speech. Then, a denoising autoencoder (DAE) is used to construct an emotion conversion model to characterize the relationship between the perceived emotion and the expressed emotion of the subject for a specific personality. Finally, a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based mood model is constructed to model the temporal fluctuation of speech emotions for mood detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a detection accuracy of 64.5%, improving by 5.0% compared to the HMM-based method.","[{'authorId': '2443424', 'name': 'Kun-Yi Huang'}, {'authorId': '1681512', 'name': 'Chung-Hsien Wu'}, {'authorId': '153132697', 'name': 'Ming-Hsiang Su'}, {'authorId': '18118766', 'name': 'Hsiang-Chi Fu'}]",13.0,,17.0,Mood detection from daily conversational speech using denoising autoencoder and LSTM,2017.0

However, the existing methods cannot rely on the common smart bracelets or watches for emotion monitoring in daily life. To address this issue, our study proposes a method for emotional recognition using heart rate data from a wearable smart bracelet. A ‘neutral + target’ pair emotion stimulation experimental paradigm was presented, and a dataset of heart rate from 25 subjects was established, where neutral plus target emotion (neutral, happy, and sad) stimulation video pairs from China’s standard Emotional Video Stimuli materials (CEVS) were applied to the recruited subjects. Normalized features from the data of target emotions normalized by the baseline data of neutral mood were adopted. Emotion recognition experiment results approved the effectiveness of ‘neutral + target’ video pair simulation experimental paradigm, the baseline setting using neutral mood data, and the normalized features, as well as the classifiers of Adaboost and GBDT on this dataset. This method will promote the development of wearable consumer electronic devices for monitoring human emotional moods.","[{'authorId': '144308894', 'name': 'Lin Shu'}, {'authorId': '2107621785', 'name': 'Y.

We previously reported that a 20-session brain-computer interface (BCI) attention training programme improved ADHD symptoms. Here, we investigated a new more intensive BCI-based attention training game system on 20 unmedicated ADHD children (16 males, 4 females) with significant inattentive symptoms (combined and inattentive ADHD subtypes). This new system monitored attention through a head band with dry EEG sensors, which was used to drive a feed forward game. The system was calibrated for each user by measuring the EEG parameters during a Stroop task. Treatment consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 sessions followed by 3 once-monthly booster training sessions. Following intervention, both parent-rated inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms on the ADHD Rating Scale showed significant improvement. At week 8, the mean improvement was −4.6 (5.9) and −4.7 (5.6) respectively for inattentive symptoms and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms (both p<0.01). Cohen’s d effect size for inattentive symptoms was large at 0.78 at week 8 and 0.84 at week 24 (post-boosters). Further analysis showed that the change in the EEG based BCI ADHD severity measure correlated with the change ADHD Rating Scale scores.

Substantial ANS variation within a category is presumed to be epiphenomenal. The theory of constructed emotion hypothesizes that an emotion category is a population of context-specific, highly variable instances that need not share an ANS fingerprint. Instead, ANS variation within a category is a meaningful part of the nature of emotion. We present a meta-analysis of 202 studies measuring ANS reactivity during lab-based inductions of emotion in nonclinical samples of adults, using a random effects, multilevel meta-analysis and multivariate pattern classification analysis to test our hypotheses. We found increases in mean effect size for 59.4% of ANS variables across emotion categories, but the pattern of effect sizes did not clearly distinguish 1 emotion category from another. We also observed significant variation within emotion categories; heterogeneity accounted for a moderate to substantial percentage (i.e., I2 ≥ 30%) of variability in 54% of these effect sizes. Experimental moderators epiphenomenal to emotion, such as induction type (e.g., films vs. imagery), did not explain a large portion of the variability. Correction for publication bias reduced estimated effect sizes even further, increasing heterogeneity of effect sizes for certain emotion categories. These findings, when considered in the broader empirical literature, are more consistent with population thinking and other principles from evolutionary biology found within the theory of constructed emotion, and offer insights for developing new hypotheses to understand the nature of emotion.","[{'authorId': '13645373', 'name': 'Erika H Siegel'}, {'authorId': '50255870', 'name': 'M.

The large majority of these trials reported substantial reductions of social anxiety symptoms through ICBT programs. Within effect sizes were mostly large and comparisons to waitlist and more active control groups were positive. Treatment gains were stable from 3 months to 5 years after treatment termination. In conclusion, ICBT is effective in the reduction of social anxiety symptoms. At the same time, not all participants benefit from these treatments to a sufficient degree.

Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that inherent negatively valent contexts modulate cortical face processing as assessed with ERP components. However, it is not well understood whether learned (rather than inherent) and three-dimensional aversive contexts similarly modulate the neural processing of faces. Using full immersive virtual reality (VR) and mobile EEG techniques, 25 participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm, in which one virtual room was paired with an aversive noise burst (threat context) and another with a nonaversive noise burst (safe context). Subsequently, avatars with neutral or angry facial expressions were presented in the threat and safe contexts while EEG was recorded. Analysis of the late positive potential (LPP), which presumably indicates motivational salience, revealed a significant interaction of context (threat vs. safe) and face type (neutral vs. angry). Neutral faces evoked increased LPP amplitudes in threat versus safe contexts, while angry faces evoked increased early LPP amplitudes regardless of context. In addition to indicating that threat-conditioned contexts alter the processing of ambiguous faces, the present study demonstrates the successful integration of EEG and VR with particular relevance for affective neuroscience research.","[{'authorId': '107752659', 'name': 'C.

We describe in detail the cognitive and metacognitive processes involved in each layer, while particular emphasis is placed on the relation between the control processes as well as the special role of attention. According to our model, each layer of metacognition describes a higher-order control system which operates under the rule of a series of attention processes at an ever more refined, abstract, united and holistic level. The same applies to the cognitive processes and abilities such as attention, memory, perception, pattern recognition. At each higher level, they display more advanced attributes and functions responding to the necessity of creating more abstract mental representations and upper class motivations, thoughts and emotions.  In addition, we recommend a number of strategies that support the metacognitive development at each level of the hierarchy.

Although ambient scent effects have also been observed in restaurant settings, little is known about the scent-related influences of restaurant wait staff on patron perception and behavior. This study aimed to determine whether olfactory cues from restaurant wait staff can affect patrons’ dining experiences and interpersonal behavior with respect to menu choice, flavor perception, overall liking of meal items, meal satisfaction, consumption amount, and tip amount for wait staff. A total of 213 adults with no olfactory impairments were asked to select and consume one of four chicken meat menu items: baked, broiled, fried, and smoked chicken, in a mock restaurant setting, under one of the three most likely scents of wait staff: congruent (smoky barbecue scent), fragrance (perfume scent), and no scent (control) applied to fabric aprons of wait staff. The results showed that menu choice and flavor perception of chicken meat items did not differ in the presence of the three scent conditions. The effects of wait staff scents on overall liking of chicken meat items, meal satisfaction, and tip amount for wait staff were found to differ as a function of patron gender. Female patrons gave higher ratings of overall liking and meal satisfaction under the fragrance scent condition than under the no scent condition, while male patrons showed no effect with respect to overall liking and an opposite result in the meal satisfaction. Female patrons gave larger tips to wait staff under the congruent scent condition than under the no scent condition, while male patrons exhibited no effect. Patrons also were found to consume chicken meat items the least under the congruent scent condition. In conclusion, this study provides new empirical evidence that wait staff scents at restaurants can affect patrons’ dining experiences and interpersonal behavior and that the effects of such scents vary as a function of patron gender.","[{'authorId': '1435211279', 'name': 'Asmita Singh'}, {'authorId': '122907546', 'name': 'Thadeus L.

The authors developed and evaluated the reliability and validity of the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale, a clinician-administered seven-item scale designed to assess delusions across a wide range of psychiatric disorders.


METHOD
The authors developed the scale after reviewing the literature on the assessment of delusions. Four raters administered the scale to 20 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 20 patients with body dysmorphic disorder, and 10 patients with mood disorder with psychotic features. Audiotaped interviews of scale administration conducted by one rater were independently scored by the other raters to evaluate interrater reliability. The scale was administered to 27 patients twice to determine test-retest reliability. Other insight instruments as well as scales that assess symptom severity were administered to assess convergent and discriminant validity. Sensitivity to change was assessed in a multicenter treatment study of sertraline for OCD.


RESULTS
Interrater and test-retest reliability for the total score and individual item scores was excellent, with a high degree of internal consistency. One factor was obtained that accounted for 56% of the variance. Scores on the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale were not correlated with symptom severity but were correlated with other measures of insight. The scale was sensitive to change in insight in OCD but was not identical to improvement in severity.


CONCLUSIONS
The Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing delusionality in a number of psychiatric disorders. This scale may help clarify whether delusional and nondelusional variants of disorders constitute the same disorder as well as whether delusionality affects treatment outcome and prognosis.","[{'authorId': '4719800', 'name': 'J.

5ebfaabb55939ec8d24fa6097c1c3ff2a7589655,"In many situations, actively engaging in metacognition may improve cognitive achievement and subjective well-being. However, the potential disadvantages of metacognitive engagement are only rarely communicated in metacognition research. In this paper, I outline three ways in which metacognition may reduce cognitive achievement and psychological well-being. First, metacognition may sometimes actively interfere with task performance. Second, the costs of engaging in metacognitive strategies may under certain circumstances outweigh its benefits. Third, metacognitive judgments or feelings involving a negative self-evaluation may detract from psychological well-being. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate findings from different research traditions in order to illustrate the three suggested ways in which metacognition may be unhelpful. An implication of this overview is that although metacognition is most often beneficial to cognitive achievement and subjective well-being, one should bear in mind that it may also have the opposite effect. It is important for researchers and practitioners to take this potential downside of metacognition into account. Practitioners might find it useful to consider the following three questions that relate to my aforementioned claims: Is the nature of the task such that metacognition could interfere with performance? Is the cognitive demand required by the metacognitive strategy disproportionally large compared to its potential usefulness to cognitive achievement? Does metacognition lead to an unhelpful comparison of oneself to others? The same considerations should be kept in mind when researchers and practitioners communicate the potential implications of research findings in metacognition research to audiences within and beyond the research community.","[{'authorId': '50518186', 'name': 'Elisabeth Norman'}]",9.0,,41.0,Why Metacognition Is Not Always Helpful,2020.0
5ec0bbc02882aa9eb51e03768cf60e5d4f6536e2,"The current project is a preliminary attempt at assessing the potential of a three-dimensional virtual reality Stroop task (VRST) for investigation of supervisory attentional processing. The VRST was compared with paper-and-pencil and computer automated (two-dimensional) versions of the Stroop. Psychophysiological measures were also used to assess varying levels of user arousal. The three versions of the Stroop task were conducted with a sample of 50 healthy university students, between the ages of 18 and 28 years, which included equivalent distributions of men and women from ethnically diverse populations. No significant differences were found for age, gender, or education. Results indicated that the typical Stroop effect pattern found in the Delis–Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) and Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) occurs in the VRST; the complexity condition of the VRST offers potential for assessment of exogenous and endogenous attentional processing; the two single-item presentation formats of the Stroop are comparable; there is a psychophysiological difference in arousal between low- and high-threat zones; and while there is a learning effect present in the VRST across conditions, it is limited by the arousal conditions in the high-threat zones. Additionally, no negative side effects were associated with use of the virtual environment. We conclude that the VRST has the potential to offer a novel approach to assessment of supervisory attentional processing within an ecologically relevant environment.","[{'authorId': '145842705', 'name': 'T.

The information about the subject's intention is issued by his brain and exists in his electroencephalogram (EEG), recorded from the scalp. Artefacts are noises introduced to the EEG signal by not central nervous system (CNS) sources of electric fields inside and outside human's body. The artefacts impede the analysis of the signal and should be handled properly. The most common and characteristic kind of artefacts are the electrooculographic (EOG) ones, especially subjects eye-blinking artefacts. In this paper an analysis of the power spectrum of eye-blinking artefacts is described with a connection of using the EEG for brain-computer interface (BCI), working with α- and μ-rhythms (range 8-13 Hz) brain potentials.

Specifically, two metrics are tested in response to task difficulty: (1) the change in pupil diameter with respect to inter- or intra-trial baseline, and (2) the rate and magnitude of microsaccades. Participants performed easy and difficult mental arithmetic tasks while fixating a central target. Inter-trial change in pupil diameter and microsaccade magnitude appear to adequately discriminate task difficulty, and hence cognitive load, if the implied causality can be assumed. This paper’s contribution corroborates previous work concerning microsaccade magnitude and extends this work by directly comparing microsaccade metrics to pupillometric measures.

5eebf0df1e0f7f8131464c1c39e1fad6a1fad195,"Human electrophysiological (EEG) studies have demonstrated the involvement of alpha band (8- to 14-Hz) oscillations in the anticipatory biasing of attention. In the context of visual spatial attention within bilateral stimulus arrays, alpha has exhibited greater amplitude over parietooccipital cortex contralateral to the hemifield required to be ignored, relative to that measured when the same hemifield is to be attended. Whether this differential effect arises solely from alpha desynchronization (decreases) over the ""attending"" hemisphere, from synchronization (increases) over the ""ignoring"" hemisphere, or both, has not been fully resolved. This is because of the confounding effect of externally evoked desynchronization that occurs involuntarily in response to visual cues. Here, bilateral flickering stimuli were presented simultaneously and continuously over entire trial blocks, such that externally evoked alpha desynchronization is equated in precue baseline and postcue intervals. Equivalent random letter sequences were superimposed on the left and right flicker stimuli. Subjects were required to count the presentations of the target letter ""X"" at the cued hemifield over an 8-s period and ignore the sequence in the opposite hemifield. The data showed significant increases in alpha power over the ignoring hemisphere relative to the precue baseline, observable for both cue directions. A strong attentional bias necessitated by the subjective difficulty in gating the distracting letter sequence is reflected in a large effect size of 2.1 (eta2 = 0.82), measured from the attention x hemisphere interaction. This strongly suggests that alpha synchronization reflects an active attentional suppression mechanism, rather than a passive one reflecting ""idling"" circuits.","[{'authorId': '2941100', 'name': 'S.

Additionally, this would eliminate the bias of subjective tests and would avoid bothering the viewers with questions to collect opinions and feedback. The performed analysis relies on two different experiments: i) a crowdsourcing test, where the videos are subject to impairments caused by long initial delays and re-buffering events; ii) a laboratory test, where the videos are affected by blurring effects. The facial Action Units (AU) that represent the contractions of specific facial muscles together with the position of the eyes’ pupils are extracted to identify the correlation between perceived quality and facial expressions. An SVM with a quadratic kernel and a k-NN classifier have been tested to predict the QoE from these features. These have also been combined with measured application-level parameters to improve the quality prediction. From the performed experiments, it results that the best performance is obtained with the k-NN classifier by combining all the described features and after training it with both the datasets, with a prediction accuracy as high as 93.9% outperforming the state of the art achievements.","[{'authorId': '40806849', 'name': 'Simone Porcu'}, {'authorId': '2665649', 'name': 'Alessandro Floris'}, {'authorId': '1390123460', 'name': 'Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons'}, {'authorId': '1720529', 'name': 'L.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in detecting emotional and behavioural problems among children with chronic illness (CI).


METHODS
Parents and teachers of a population of primary school children in Norway (n = 9430) completed a questionnaire including the SDQ, and a question about chronic illness. A total of 74% (n = 7007) of the parents participated. A sub-sample (n = 1040) was given a psychiatric diagnostic evaluation according to the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA).


RESULTS
According to parent reports, 537 (8%) children had a CI. The SDQ revealed an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems in children with CI as compared with non-CI peers, both among boys (OR = 2.10 CI 95% 1.56-2.83) and girls (OR = 2.11 CI 95% 1.49-2.99). Children with CI also showed an increased risk of psychiatric disorder as assessed by the DAWBA (OR = 1.70 CI 95% 1.04-2.85). Both the sensitivity and specificity of the SDQ in predicting a psychiatric diagnosis were high, even when only information from parents was included.


CONCLUSION
Children with CI in the general population are at increased risk of behavioural and emotional problems and psychiatric disorders. Given its high sensitivity and specificity the SDQ might work well as a screening instrument for behaviour/emotional problems and psychiatric disorder in children with CI.","[{'authorId': '4081393', 'name': 'M.

As they seek professional development (PD) to cultivate these skills in educators and their students, they may look to coaching, grounded in EI theory, as a feasible and effective PD option. This article describes findings from a case study conducted with 12 internal coaches in one school Federation in Kent, England from 2008 to 2010. This study explored the benefits and challenges of implementing a coaching programme delivered by educators for educators responsible for teaching EI skills to students. Twelve educators participated in a yearlong coach certification and delivery process grounded in EI theory and skills. Data collection included pre- and post- interviews and online reports from each of six coaching sessions. Findings revealed benefits for both coaches-in-training and clients, including: deeper commitment to teaching EI skills, increases in self-awareness and self-management, and improved relationships with others. While coaches and clients reported positive behavioural changes, lack of support at the leadership level was found to negatively impact successful implementation of the programme.","[{'authorId': '118342770', 'name': 'Janet Patti'}, {'authorId': '114582336', 'name': 'Allison A.

This study began with a simple but vital question: What factors influenced the success of online learning during the COVID‐19 pandemic with a focus on online learning self‐efficacy?The purpose of this study was to examine the structural relationship among self‐efficacy (SE) in time management, SE in technology use, SE in an online learning environment, and learning engagement.The participants of the study were 1205 undergraduates who were enrolled in a residential undergraduate program in South Korea in spring semester, 2020. The online survey was administered to collect data for this research and the survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling.SE in technology use had a significant but negative influence on learning engagement and had a positive impact on SE in an online learning environment. SE in time management had a significant positive impact on SE in an online learning environment and learning engagement. SE in an online learning environment also significantly influenced learning engagement.SE in technology use itself did not enhance learning engagement. In addition, indirect effects of SE in technology use and SE in time management on learning engagement through SE in an online learning environment were confirmed in this study. This indicates the influential role of SE in an online learning environment on learning engagement of online learners.

Computer- and Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments (cCBT) may be an attractive treatment alternative to regular face-to-face treatment.This meta-analysis aims to evaluate whether cCBT is effective for treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in youth. Methods and Findings We conducted systematic searches in bibliographical databases (Pubmed, Cochrane controlled trial register, PsychInfo) up to December 4, 2013. Only randomized controlled trials in which a computer-, Internet- or mobile-based cognitive behavioral intervention targeting either depression, anxiety or both in children or adolescents up to the age of 25 were compared to a control condition were selected. We employed a random-effects pooling model in overall effect analyses and a mixed effect model for sub-group analyses. Searches resulted in identifying 13 randomized trials, including 796 children and adolescents that met inclusion criteria. Seven studies were directed at treating anxiety, four studies at depression, and two were of a transdiagnostic nature, targeting both anxiety and depression. The overall mean effect size (Hedges’ g) of cCBT on symptoms of anxiety or depression at post-test was g=0.72 (95% CI:0.55-0.90, numbers needed to be treated (NNT)=2.56). Heterogeneity was low (I²=20.14%, 95% CI: 0-58%). The superiority of cCBT over controls was evident for interventions targeting anxiety (g=0.68; 95% CI: 0.45-0.92; p < .001; NNT=2.70) and for interventions targeting depression (g=0.76; 95% CI: 0.41-0.12; p < .001; NNT=2.44) as well as for transdiagnostic interventions (g=0.94; 95% CI: 0.23-2.66; p < .001; NNT=2.60). Conclusions Results provide evidence for the efficacy of cCBT in the treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth. Hence, such interventions may be a promising treatment alternative when evidence based face-to-face treatment is not feasible. Future studies should examine long-term effects of treatments and should focus on obtaining patient-level data from existing studies, to perform an individual patient data meta-analysis.","[{'authorId': '48683376', 'name': 'D.

Twenty-eight male participants, aged 14-18, with social problems, took part in this study. They were separated into three groups: a control group, a VR group, and a non-VR group. The VR and non-VR groups underwent eight sessions of neurofeedback training over 2 weeks, while the control group just waited during the same period. The VR group used a head-mounted display (HMD) and a head tracker, which let them look around the virtual world. Conversely, the non-VR group used only a computer monitor with a fixed viewpoint. All participants performed a continuous performance task (CPT) before and after the complete training session. The results showed that both the VR and non-VR groups achieved better scores in the CPT after the training session, while the control group showed no significant difference. Compared with the other groups, the VR group presented a tendency to get better results, suggesting that immersive VR is applicable to neurofeedback for the rehabilitation of inattention and impulsiveness.","[{'authorId': '2370451', 'name': 'B.

In addition, although anatomy remains one of the fundamental areas of medical education, universities have decreased the hours allocated to teaching gross anatomy in favor of applied clinical work. The release of virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices allows learning to occur through hands‐on immersive experiences. The aim of this research was to assess whether learning structural anatomy utilizing VR or AR is as effective as tablet‐based (TB) applications, and whether these modes allowed enhanced student learning, engagement and performance. Participants (n = 59) were randomly allocated to one of the three learning modes: VR, AR, or TB and completed a lesson on skull anatomy, after which they completed an anatomical knowledge assessment. Student perceptions of each learning mode and any adverse effects experienced were recorded. No significant differences were found between mean assessment scores in VR, AR, or TB. During the lessons however, VR participants were more likely to exhibit adverse effects such as headaches (25% in VR P < 0.05), dizziness (40% in VR, P < 0.001), or blurred vision (35% in VR, P < 0.01). Both VR and AR are as valuable for teaching anatomy as tablet devices, but also promote intrinsic benefits such as increased learner immersion and engagement. These outcomes show great promise for the effective use of virtual and augmented reality as means to supplement lesson content in anatomical education.

The total sample was comprised of 508 participants from Grades 7 to 12, 241 males (47.4%) and 267 females (52.6%), each of whom completed the questionnaires on two separate occasions. Three [intrapersonal (α = .83, CR = .86, and McDonald Omega = .86), stress management (α = .83, CR = .86, and McDonald Omega = .85) and adaptability (α = .82, CR = .85, and McDonald Omega = .85)] of the four scales had acceptable internal consistency. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were used with FACTOR and EQS version 6.1 software to examine validity evidence based on internal structure drawn from the scores on the EQ-i: YV-S, supporting the multidimensionality of the questionnaire. Three models were tested; the best fit to the data was the hierarchical model (S-Bχ2 / df = 2.11, CFI = .93 and RMSEA = .047), which hypothesized that the four specific factors (interpersonal, intrapersonal, stress management, and adaptability) were explained with a second-order factor, Emotional-Social-Intelligence (ESI). Finally, significant positive correlations were found between general self-concept and EQ-i: YV-S [interpersonal (r = .153, p < .001), intrapersonal (r = .235, p < .001), stress management (r = .145, p < .001), adaptability (r = .311, p < .001) and ESI (r = .360, p < .001)]; ESI showed significant direct power prediction of the general self-concept (.52) as demonstrated through structural equation modeling.","[{'authorId': '4588689', 'name': 'I.

60c1196ca5b343206ee0ec66c4b6eb48e07f392d,"Many eating‐related psychological constructs have been proposed to explain obesity and overeating. However, these constructs, including food addiction, disinhibition, hedonic hunger, emotional eating, binge eating and the like all have similar definitions, emphasizing loss of control over intake. As questionnaires measuring the constructs correlate strongly (r > 0.5) with each other, we propose that these constructs should be reconsidered to be part of a single broad phenotype: uncontrolled eating. Such an approach enables reviewing and meta‐analysing evidence obtained with each individual questionnaire. Here, we describe robust associations between uncontrolled eating, body mass index (BMI), food intake, personality traits and brain systems. Reviewing cross‐sectional and longitudinal data, we show that uncontrolled eating is phenotypically and genetically intertwined with BMI and food intake. We also review evidence on how three psychological constructs are linked with uncontrolled eating: lower cognitive control, higher negative affect and a curvilinear association with reward sensitivity. Uncontrolled eating mediates all three constructs’ associations with BMI and food intake. Finally, we review and meta‐analyse brain systems possibly subserving uncontrolled eating: namely, (i) the dopamine mesolimbic circuit associated with reward sensitivity, (ii) frontal cognitive networks sustaining dietary self‐control and (iii) the hypothalamus‐pituitary‐adrenal axis, amygdala and hippocampus supporting stress reactivity. While there are limits to the explanatory and predictive power of the uncontrolled eating phenotype, we conclude that treating different eating‐related constructs as a single concept, uncontrolled eating, enables drawing robust conclusions on the relationship between food intake and BMI, psychological variables and brain structure and function.","[{'authorId': '3815453', 'name': 'U.

613eb8f9a416d05b916f4bf9d9f48b80e6e4fd1f,"Significance Claims about how reported emotional experiences are geometrically organized within a semantic space have shaped the study of emotion. Using statistical methods to analyze reports of emotional states elicited by 2,185 emotionally evocative short videos with richly varying situational content, we uncovered 27 varieties of reported emotional experience. Reported experience is better captured by categories such as “amusement” than by ratings of widely measured affective dimensions such as valence and arousal. Although categories are found to organize dimensional appraisals in a coherent and powerful fashion, many categories are linked by smooth gradients, contrary to discrete theories. Our results comprise an approximation of a geometric structure of reported emotional experience. Emotions are centered in subjective experiences that people represent, in part, with hundreds, if not thousands, of semantic terms. Claims about the distribution of reported emotional states and the boundaries between emotion categories—that is, the geometric organization of the semantic space of emotion—have sparked intense debate. Here we introduce a conceptual framework to analyze reported emotional states elicited by 2,185 short videos, examining the richest array of reported emotional experiences studied to date and the extent to which reported experiences of emotion are structured by discrete and dimensional geometries. Across self-report methods, we find that the videos reliably elicit 27 distinct varieties of reported emotional experience. Further analyses revealed that categorical labels such as amusement better capture reports of subjective experience than commonly measured affective dimensions (e.g., valence and arousal). Although reported emotional experiences are represented within a semantic space best captured by categorical labels, the boundaries between categories of emotion are fuzzy rather than discrete. By analyzing the distribution of reported emotional states we uncover gradients of emotion—from anxiety to fear to horror to disgust, calmness to aesthetic appreciation to awe, and others—that correspond to smooth variation in affective dimensions such as valence and dominance. Reported emotional states occupy a complex, high-dimensional categorical space. In addition, our library of videos and an interactive map of the emotional states they elicit (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/emogifs/map.html) are made available to advance the science of emotion.","[{'authorId': '49531494', 'name': 'Alan S.

Unfortunately, rehabilitation efforts for this impairment have hitherto yielded small or no effects. Here we show in a randomized actively controlled trial that working memory performance can be effectively restored by suggesting to hypnotized patients that they have regained their pre-injury level of working memory functioning. Following four 1-h sessions, 27 patients had a medium-sized improvement relative to 22 active controls (Bayes factors of 342 and 37.5 on the two aggregate outcome measures) and a very large improvement relative to 19 passive controls (Bayes factor = 1.7 × 1013). This was a long-term effect as revealed by no deterioration following a 6.7 week no-contact period (Bayes factors = 7.1 and 1.3 in favour of no change). To control for participant-specific effects, the active control group was crossed over to the working memory suggestion and showed superior improvement. By the end of the study, both groups reached a performance level at or above the healthy population mean with standardized mean differences between 1.55 and 2.03 relative to the passive control group. We conclude that, if framed correctly, hypnotic suggestion can effectively improve working memory following acquired brain injury. The speed and consistency with which this improvement occurred, indicate that there may be a residual capacity for normal information processing in the injured brain.","[{'authorId': '1403006552', 'name': 'J.

Traditionally, interactions between humans and machines like computers do not exhibit any emotional exchanges. If we could build any system that is intelligent enough to interact with humans that involves emotions, that is, it can detect user emotions and change its behaviour accordingly, then using machines could be more effective and friendly. Many approaches have been taken to detect user emotions. Affective computing is the field that detects user emotion in a particular moment. Our approach in this paper is to detect user emotions by analysing the keyboard typing patterns of the user and the type of texts (words, sentences) typed by them. This combined analysis gives us a promising result showing a substantial number of emotional states detected from user input. Several machine learning algorithms were used to analyse keystroke timing attributes and text pattern. We have chosen keystroke because it is the cheapest and most available medium to interact with computers. We have considered seven emotional classes for classifying the emotional states. For text pattern analysis, we have used vector space model with Jaccard similarity method to classify free-text input.

6211dc610a4dafb5739befd6bbdd646f625f4d8d,"During the past three decades, researchers interested in emotions and cognition have attempted to understand the relationship that affect and emotions have with cognitive outcomes such as judgement and decision-making. Recent research has revealed the importance of examining more discrete emotions, showing that same-valence emotions (e.g., anger and fear) differentially impact judgement and decision-making outcomes. Narrative reviews of the literature (Lerner & Tiedens, 2006; Pham, 2007) have identified some under-researched topics, but provide a limited synthesis of findings. The purpose of this study was to review the research examining the influence of discrete emotions on judgement and decision-making outcomes and provide an assessment of the observed effects using a meta-analytic approach.

Sensory information is delivered through a head-mounted display and specialized interface devices. These devices track head movements so that the movements and images change in a natural way with head motion, allowing for a sense of immersion. VR, which allows for controlled delivery of sensory stimulation via the therapist, is a convenient and cost-effective treatment. This review focuses on the available literature regarding the effectiveness of incorporating VR within the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, with particular attention to exposure-based intervention for anxiety disorders. A systematic literature search was conducted in order to identify studies implementing VR-based treatment for anxiety or other psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the history of the development of VR-based technology and its use within psychiatric treatment, the empirical evidence for VR-based treatment, and the benefits for using VR for psychiatric research and treatment. It also presents recommendations for how to incorporate VR into psychiatric care and discusses future directions for VR-based treatment and clinical research.","[{'authorId': '1402540811', 'name': 'J.

632afe17608c32e8318ba8c1a2e42b617671012d,"Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth Background: In the last ten years, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has seen a rise in research on how features of interactive technologies can be designed to enhance emotion regulation training [1]–a response in part due to the increase of mental health issues. Youth are a vulnerable population at risk for mental health issues with long wait times to get help [2]. Emotion regulation, the ability to modulate the intensity and duration of emotional states, has been explored as a trans-diagnostic intervention to improve mental health [3]. Youth aged 12-15 use less adaptive or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., suppression) that can contribute to depression or anxiety disorders. Thus, training adaptive emotion regulation skills is crucial for this age group [4]. One of the most effective emotion regulation strategies for youth is cognitive reappraisal–changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact [5]. However, learning is difficult because it requires: (1) generation of meaningful emotionally laden social situations; (2) real-time feedback of internal psychological and physiological states; and (3) practice modifying the interpretation of multiple situations [6]. Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated 3D environment that allows the user to experience a simulated world through stereoscopic 360 visuals, stereo audio, and 3D interaction with tracking sensors. The affordances of VR have been shown to strongly affect human emotional responses and interpretations of social situations when used in other intervention contexts [7]. As such, VR may provide unique opportunities for cognitive reappraisal skills development through three mechanisms: Mechanism #1: virtual environment–a simulated world that evokes the visceral experience of a realistic emotional response; Mechanism #2: interaction & feedback–possibilities to control and modify emotionally evocative aspects of the virtual environment; Mechanism #3: taking multiple perspectives–the ability to put the user in another’s shoes. As an example, you put on a VR headset and find yourself walking down the halls on the first day of high school; there are lots of new faces and you hope to make a good first impression (Mech #1). You hear the sound of your heart beating and your breathing getting heavier and uneven, and other kids laughing–are they laughing at you (Mech #2)? Luckily, you have a super power that allows you to embody other peoples’ perspectives (Mech #3). You take the VR controller, point it at the older kid who was laughing, and teleport into their virtual body (Mech #2). Suddenly, you can see yourself from their perspective and hear their thoughts–“look at all these new kids. I remember my first day I tripped down the stairs and broke a tooth. So embarrassing!” (Mech #3). You teleport back to your body and hear your heart rate drop to indicate that you have regulated the anxiety response (Mech #2). They weren’t laughing at you, but empathizing with your experience. Seeing and understanding this new perspective is cognitively reappraising the event. In this scenario, VR offers youth a way to practice cognitive reappraisal in a safe, meaningful, and emotionally laden environment with real-time feedback; thus meeting the reappraisal requirements (1-3) listed above, which are normally difficult to meet. Objectives & Research Questions: There is a rise in VR’s accessibility and popularity among youth (e.g., Oculus Quest 2 VR headset does not require a computer, costs $400 CAD, and has sold over 5 million units). My expertise in technology development of VR systems and content, design for mental health, and field evaluation skills make me well positioned to take this unique opportunity to investigate the overarching research question: can the above three VR mechanisms (Mechanisms #1-3) address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development in youth aged 12-15? Methodology: I will conduct research that investigates the following research questions that derive from my objectives above: (1) Requirements: What are the minimum technical and design requirements for a VR platform to help youth learn and practice emotion regulation? (2) Usability: What are the system and interface usability factors that youth suggest for the VR prototypes? (3) Feasibility: What is the feasibility of using VR’s three mechanisms to address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development during a six-week deployment with youth in their homes? (4) Efficacy: What are the subjective indicators of effects on cognitive reappraisal skills development (whether positive or negative) reported by youth? I will answer these research questions in three phases.","[{'authorId': '11189596', 'name': 'Alexandra Kitson'}]",0.0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2212.00002'}",9.0,Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth,2022.0

However, the history of VR technology is longer than it may seem: the concept of VR was formulated in the 1960s and the first commercial VR tools appeared in the late 1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of researchers explored the processes, effects, and applications of this technology producing 1000s of scientific papers. What is the outcome of this significant research work? This paper wants to provide an answer to this question by exploring, using advanced scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the field. We collected all the existent articles about VR in the Web of Science Core Collection scientific database, and the resultant dataset contained 21,667 records for VR and 9,944 for augmented reality (AR). The bibliographic record contained various fields, such as author, title, abstract, country, and all the references (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster analysis of the literature showed a composite panorama characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed, whether until 5 years ago, the main publication media on VR concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently journals constitute the main medium of communication. Similarly, if at first computer science was the leading research field, nowadays clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of countries involved in VR research. The present work discusses the evolution and changes over the time of the use of VR in the main areas of application with an emphasis on the future expected VR’s capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the disruptive contribution that VR/AR/MRITF will be able to get in scientific fields, as well in human communication and interaction, as already happened with the advent of mobile phones by increasing the use and the development of scientific applications (e.g., in clinical areas) and by modifying the social communication and interaction among people.","[{'authorId': '1743009', 'name': 'P.

63e41e37edfb092ae223bb17aa0b94eb34cbaabc,"All organisms must be capable of differentiating hostile from hospitable stimuli to survive. Typically, this evaluative discrimination is conceptualized as being bipolar (hostile-hospitable). This conceptualization is certainly evident in the area of attitudes, where the ubiquitous bipolar attitude measure, by gauging the net affective predisposition toward a stimulus, treats positive and negative evaluative processes as equivalent, reciprocally activated, and interchangeable. Contrary to conceptualizations of this evaluative process as bipolar, recent evidence suggests that distinguishable motivational systems underlie assessments of the positive and negative significance of a stimulus. Thus, a stimulus may vary in terms of the strength of positive evaluative activation and the strength of negative evaluative activation it evokes. Low activation of positive and negative evaluative processes by a stimulus reflects attitude neutrality or indifference, whereas high activation of positive and negative evaluative processes reflects attitude ambivalence. As such, attitudes can be represented more completely within a bivariate space than along a bipolar continuum. Evidence is reviewed showing that the positive and negative evaluative processes underlying many attitudes are distinguishable (stochastically and functionally independent), are characterized by distinct activation functions (positivity offset and negativity bias principles), are related differentially to attitude ambivalence (corollary of ambivalence asymmetries), have distinguishable antecedents (heteroscedacity principle), and tend to gravitate from a bivariate toward a bipolar structure when the underlying beliefs are the target of deliberation or a guide for behavior (principle of motivational certainty). The implications for societal phenomena such as political elections and democratic structures are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2285765', 'name': 'J. Cacioppo'}, {'authorId': '34953711', 'name': 'W.

Variations in caregivers' emotional reactivity to unpleasant child-feedback may be partially explained by their dispositional empathy levels. Furthermore, empathic response to the child's unpleasant feedback likely helps mothers to regulate their own stress. We investigated the relationship between maternal dispositional empathy, stress reactivity, and neural correlates of child feedback to caregiving decisions. In Part 1 of the study, 33 female participants were recruited to undergo a lab-based mild stressor, the Social Evaluation Test (SET), and then in Part 2 of the study, a subset of the participants, 14 mothers, performed a Parenting Decision Making Task (PDMT) in an fMRI setting. Four dimensions of dispositional empathy based on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index were measured in all participants—Personal Distress, Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, and Fantasy. Overall, we found that the Personal Distress and Perspective Taking were associated with greater and lesser cortisol reactivity, respectively. The four types of empathy were distinctly associated with the negative (vs. positive) child feedback activation in the brain. Personal Distress was associated with amygdala and hypothalamus activation, Empathic Concern with the left ventral striatum, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and supplemental motor area (SMA) activation, and Fantasy with the septal area, right SMA and VLPFC activation.

6461cf3d904e0629d400d7ac85fd27a553e0d161,"Virtual reality plays an increasingly important role in research and therapy of pathological fear. However, the mechanisms how virtual environments elicit and modify fear responses are not yet fully understood. Presence, a psychological construct referring to the ‘sense of being there’ in a virtual environment, is widely assumed to crucially influence the strength of the elicited fear responses, however, causality is still under debate. The present study is the first that experimentally manipulated both variables to unravel the causal link between presence and fear responses. Height-fearful participants (N = 49) were immersed into a virtual height situation and a neutral control situation (fear manipulation) with either high versus low sensory realism (presence manipulation). Ratings of presence and verbal and physiological (skin conductance, heart rate) fear responses were recorded. Results revealed an effect of the fear manipulation on presence, i.e., higher presence ratings in the height situation compared to the neutral control situation, but no effect of the presence manipulation on fear responses. However, the presence ratings during the first exposure to the high quality neutral environment were predictive of later fear responses in the height situation. Our findings support the hypothesis that experiencing emotional responses in a virtual environment leads to a stronger feeling of being there, i.e., increase presence. In contrast, the effects of presence on fear seem to be more complex: on the one hand, increased presence due to the quality of the virtual environment did not influence fear; on the other hand, presence variability that likely stemmed from differences in user characteristics did predict later fear responses. These findings underscore the importance of user characteristics in the emergence of presence.","[{'authorId': '47235568', 'name': 'D.

659db48efa1dfe7f585159164d2b7cbb9229285f,"OBJECTIVE
Virtual reality therapy (VRT) uses multimodal stimulation that includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of VRT in treating subjects with alcohol dependence (AD) by evaluating changes in brain metabolism.


METHOD
The VRT protocol consisted of three steps: relaxation, presentation of a high-risk situation, and presentation of an aversive situation. Twelve alcohol-dependent subjects underwent 10 sessions of VRT. The alcohol-dependent subjects were assessed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images before and after VRT, whereas the control group underwent imaging according to the same protocol only at baseline.


RESULTS
Compared with the healthy control group, AD subjects showed higher metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus and right temporal lobe (BA20) at baseline (P(FDR < .05) = .026). In addition, the metabolism in the left anterior cingulate was lower in subjects with AD (P(uncorr) = .001). After VRT, alcohol-dependent subjects showed decreased brain metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus (P(FDR < .05) = .026) and right temporal lobe (BA38, P(FDR < .05) = .032) relative to that at baseline.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest a neurobiological imbalance, notably, a high sensitivity to stimuli, in the limbic system in subjects with AD. Furthermore, we determined that metabolism decreased in the basal ganglia after VRT, which may explain the limbic-regulated responses of reward and regulation. Therefore, we tentatively recommend VRT to treat AD through its regulating effect on limbic circuits.","[{'authorId': '48432801', 'name': 'J. H.

Given the emergence of new VR technology, and the growing body of research surrounding VR and pain management, an updated systematic review is warranted. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of VR in reducing acute and chronic pain in adults. Data Sources: A search was conducted in three databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Trip) using standardized search terms. Study Selection: Twenty experimental and quasi-experimental trials published between January 2007 and December 2018 were included based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pain intensity was the primary outcome. Data Extraction: We extracted data and appraised the quality of articles using either the PEDro or Modified Downs and Black risk of bias tools. Data Synthesis: The majority of studies supported the use of VR to reduce acute pain both during the procedure and immediately after. Numerous studies found VR reduced chronic pain during VR exposure but there is insufficient evidence to support lasting analgesia. There was considerable variability in patient population, pain condition and dosage of VR exposure. Limitations: Due to heterogeneity, we were unable to perform meta-analyses for all study populations and pain conditions. Conclusions: VR is an effective treatment for reducing acute pain. There is some research that suggests VR can reduce chronic pain during the intervention; however, more evidence is needed to conclude that VR is effective for lasting reductions in chronic pain.","[{'authorId': '90726160', 'name': 'Brian Mallari'}, {'authorId': '150096116', 'name': 'Emily K Spaeth'}, {'authorId': '144198683', 'name': 'Henry Goh'}, {'authorId': '153162247', 'name': 'Benjamin S.

65dbdff7f83ebe6514381ed9e87a6cf45640a939,"Global increases in urbanization have brought dramatic economic, environmental and social changes. However, less is understood about how these may influence disease-related brain mechanisms underlying epidemiological observations that urban birth and childhoods may increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, including increased social stress and depression. In a genetically homogeneous Han Chinese adult population with divergent urban and rural birth and childhoods, we examined the structural and functional MRI neural correlates of childhood urbanicity, focusing on behavioral traits responding to social status threats, and polygenic risk for depression. Subjects with divergent rural and urban childhoods were similar in adult socioeconomic status and were genetically homogeneous. Urban childhoods, however, were associated with higher trait anxiety-depression. On structural MRI, urban childhoods were associated with relatively reduced medial prefrontal gray matter volumes. Functional medial prefrontal engagement under social status threat during working memory correlated with trait anxiety-depression in subjects with urban childhoods, to a significantly greater extent than in their rural counterparts, implicating an exaggerated physiological response to the threat context. Stress-associated medial prefrontal engagement also interacted with polygenic risk for depression, significantly predicting a differential response in individuals with urban but not rural childhoods. Developmental urbanicity thus differentially influenced medial prefrontal structure and function, at least in part through mechanisms associated with the neural processing of social status threat, trait anxiety, and genetic risk for depression, which may be factors in the association of urbanicity with adult psychopathology. Significance Statement Urban living has been associated with social inequalities and stress. However, less is understood about the neural underpinnings by which these stressors affect disease risk, and in particular, genetic risk for depression. Leveraging urbanization in China, we studied adults with diverse urban and rural upbringings, who were genetically homogeneous and with similar current socioeconomic status, to isolate the effects of childhood urbanicity. At medial prefrontal cortex, a region critical for processing emotional stressors and social status, genetic risk for depression resulted in more deleterious function under stress in individuals with urban, but not rural childhoods. This implicates medial prefrontal cortex’s critical role in brain development, integrating genetic mechanisms of stress and depression with the childhood environment.","[{'authorId': '2115476019', 'name': 'Xiao Zhang'}, {'authorId': '152996959', 'name': 'Hao Yan'}, {'authorId': '1399984493', 'name': 'Hao Yu'}, {'authorId': '2145734322', 'name': 'Xin Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2222543863', 'name': 'Shefali Shah'}, {'authorId': '2114027097', 'name': 'Zheng Dong'}, {'authorId': '2149521634', 'name': 'Guang Yang'}, {'authorId': '47956852', 'name': 'Xiaoxi Zhang'}, {'authorId': '113029534', 'name': 'T.

This chapter describes the role of service employees’ motives for emotion regulation in interactions with customers. To date, there has been little research and theoretical work on motives for emotion regulation in service work. The reason for this may lie in the fact that there is an implicit general assumption that employees regulate their emotions in customer interactions because of display rules given by the organization. We argue that service employees have more motives for emotion regulation than adhering to display rules. We propose that three fundamental motive categories which are relevant for general emotion regulation are also relevant in the service work context. Moreover, we argue that the different motive categories are important antecedents for the further emotion regulation process. We propose that depending on the motive category different emotion regulation strategies are used as well as moderating effects of the motives with an impact on the consequences of emotion regulation such as well-being. The chapter concludes by pointing to practical implications.","[{'authorId': '117360870', 'name': 'Laura von Gilsa'}, {'authorId': '2548540', 'name': 'D.

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a highly prevalent condition, characterised by excessive worry or anxiety about everyday events and problems. The effectiveness and effectiveness of psychological therapies as a group has not yet been evaluated in the treatment of GAD.


OBJECTIVES
To examine the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies, categorised as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy and supportive therapy, compared with treatment as usual/waiting list (TAU/WL) and compared with one another, for patients with GAD.


SEARCH STRATEGY
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Controlled Trials Register and conducted supplementary searches of MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, LILACS and controlledtrials.com in February 2006. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials conducted in non-inpatient settings, involving adults aged 18-75 years with a primary diagnosis of GAD, assigned to a psychological therapy condition compared with TAU/WL or another psychological therapy.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Data on patients, interventions and outcomes were extracted by two review authors independently, and the methodological quality of each study was assessed. The primary outcome was anxiety reduction, based on a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using relative risk (RR), and on a continuous measure of symptom reduction, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals.


MAIN RESULTS
Twenty five studies (1305 participants) were included in the review, of which 22 studies (1060 participants) contributed data to meta-analyses. Based on thirteen studies, psychological therapies, all using a CBT approach, were more effective than TAU/WL in achieving clinical response at post-treatment (RR 0.63, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.73), and also in reducing anxiety, worry and depression symptoms. No studies conducted longer-term assessments of CBT against TAU/WL. Six studies compared CBT against supportive therapy (non-directive therapy and attention-placebo conditions). No significant difference in clinical response was indicated between CBT and supportive therapy at post-treatment (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.70 to 1.06), however significant heterogeneity was indicated, which was partly explained by the number of therapy sessions.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Psychological therapy based on CBT principles is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms for short-term treatment of GAD. The body of evidence comparing CBT with other psychological therapies is small and heterogeneous, which precludes drawing conclusions about which psychological therapy is more effective. Further studies examining non-CBT models are required to inform health care policy on the most appropriate forms of psychological therapy in treating GAD.","[{'authorId': '7716937', 'name': 'V.

This research demonstrates that activating performance goals, whether in cognitive or physical domains, leads to an increase in consumption of high-calorie foods at the expense of good nutrition. This effect derives from beliefs that the function of food is to provide energy for the body (“food as fuel”) coupled with poor nutrition literacy, leading consumers to overgeneralize the instrumental role of calories for performance. Indeed, nutrition experts choose very different foods (lower in calorie, higher in nutritional value) than lay consumers in response to performance goals. Also, performance goals no longer increase calorie intake when emphasizing the hedonic function of food (“food for pleasure”). Hence, while consumer research often interprets the overconsumption of pleasurable and unhealthy highcalorie foods as a consequence of hedonic goals and self-control failures, our research suggests that this overconsumption may also be explained by a maladaptive motivation to manage energy intake.","[{'authorId': '7397628', 'name': 'Y.

Four distinctive game situations that evoked four types of spectators’ emotional states – happiness, sadness, anger, and fear – were identified. Virtual reality technology was utilized to replicate sport spectators’ emotional experiences. The results of the laboratory experiments revealed that states of vigor generally corresponded to the winner-loser effect, wherein victories (or losses) are associated with positive (or negative) emotions. Notably, the close victories condition exerted emotional ambivalence, resulting in mixed outcomes on vigor. Moreover, anger evoked through close losses had a positive impact on vigor. This study advances current understandings of sport fans’ emotional ambivalence and negative affect valuation tendencies. The findings provide significant implications for strategies through which marketers, stakeholders, and health managers can facilitate consumer well-being via sport spectatorship.

A systematic search, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, was therefore carried out to explore the state of the art in emotion regulation interventions for wellbeing using virtual reality. The literature on this topic was queried, 414 papers were screened, and 11 studies were included, covering adults and older adults. Our findings offer an overview of the current use of VR technologies for the enhancement of emotion regulation (ER) and wellbeing. The results are promising and suggest that VR-based emotion regulation training can facilitate the promotion of wellbeing. An overview of VR-based training interventions is crucial for better understanding how to use these tools in the clinical settings. This review offers a critical debate on the structure of such intervention protocols.

Evidence suggests that only a minority of community-dwelling older people are ""severely"" lonely or isolated, however a number of factors need to be considered to fully understand the extent and significance of the problem. Community-based studies have identified a variety of risk factors for loneliness/isolation including widowhood, no (surviving) children, living alone, deteriorating health, and life events (eg, loss and bereavement). Having a confidant has been identified as a protective factor for loneliness. However, evidence is often unclear or inconclusive, especially within residential settings.

The client attends to alternating bilateral visual, auditory or sensory stimulation while confronted with emotionally disturbing material. It is thought that the bilateral stimulation as a specific element of EMDR facilitates accessing and processing of negative material while presumably creating new associative links. We hypothesized that the putatively facilitated access should be reflected in increased activation of the amygdala upon bilateral EMDR stimulation even in healthy subjects. Methods We investigated 22 healthy female university students (mean 23.5 years) with fMRI. Subjects were scanned while confronted with blocks of disgusting and neutral picture stimuli. One third of the blocks was presented without any additional stimulation, one third with bilateral simultaneous auditory stimulation, and one third with bilateral alternating auditory stimulation as used in EMDR. Results Contrasting disgusting vs. neutral picture stimuli confirmed the expected robust effect of amygdala activation for all auditory stimulation conditions. The interaction analysis with the type of auditory stimulation revealed a specific increase in activation of the right amygdala for the bilateral alternating auditory stimulation. Activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed the opposite effect with decreased activation. Conclusions We demonstrate first time evidence for a putative neurobiological basis of the bilateral alternating stimulation as used in the EMDR method. The increase in limbic processing along with decreased frontal activation is in line with theoretical models of how bilateral alternating stimulation could help with therapeutic reintegration of information, and present findings may pave the way for future research on EMDR in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder.","[{'authorId': '5028854', 'name': 'Deborah Herkt'}, {'authorId': '5447616', 'name': 'V.

6804b9cf13f5f377a7b068ecfd99721f45d367f9,"Metacognition constitutes the dominant competence of the 21st century. De-spite the indisputable scientific interest, there are various unanswered questions concerning the identity of metacognition, its fundamental mechanisms and its limits. In this study, a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach is attempted by collecting and utilizing data from sciences such as cognitive psychology and neuropsychology, and philosophy. The research has led us to the 8 pillars that underpin metacognition. These pillars follow the model of the hierarchical or-ganization of knowledge. According to this approach, cognitive and metacogni-tive skills evolve progressively depending on the effort an individual exerts. It is worth noting that some cognitive functions such as attention and working memory seem to surpass the rest, since they operate simultaneously as cognitive and metacognitive abilities, affecting the functioning of the pillars, other cogni-tive functions, and in particular the higher mental abilities. Among the conclu-sions of greatest importance we can cite that the metacognition pillars are, like reality itself, a field of multiple readings. They contribute to the proper func-tioning of the cognitive and psychophysiological mechanism, the melioration of intelligence in all fields (physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual), the emergence of consciousness and self-knowledge. In practical terms, the pillars of metacognition are the most valuable tool of self-learning, self-development, self-treatment and self-knowledge. Metacognition, also, constitutes a key factor in effective leadership, in medical and health professions. Lastly, the pillars of metacognition should be the cornerstone of general, special, vocational and ac-ademic education so as to promote holistic learning.","[{'authorId': '1724307', 'name': 'A.

A factor analysis of the items answered with respect to food deprivation yielded four factors which were labelled hunger, impulsive eating, sensory eating and hedonic eating. ANCOVAs showed main effects of emotions upon each factor. Single comparisons showed that: (1) subjects reported to experience higher levels of hunger during anger and joy than during fear and sadness; (2) impulsive eating and sensory eating were rated higher during anger than during the other emotions; and (3) hedonic eating was rated higher during joy than during the other emotions. Results did not indicate any differential influences upon eating between fear and sadness. Women reported to experience higher tendencies of impulsive eating and sensory eating than men during anger and sadness.

Incubation had been used in ancient Egypt and Greece for some three millennia with the same indications of modern hypnosis and was well-known by both Hippocrates and Parmenides. Then, it was dismantled by Christian hagiographic propaganda in 4-5th century AC and buried to the oblivion. Again, the birth of the new sciences in 17th century was the result of a compromise with Church, forcing them to limit their field of interest in the Cartesian res extensa only, leading to consciousness and mind-body relationship being neglected for political-religious will, rather than scientific grounds, and to Hippocrates’ teaching being betrayed. As a result, the history of hypnosis was marked by its outstanding results paralleled by misunderstanding and prejudicial refusal, a fact endowed with deep epistemological implications.","[{'authorId': '4183916', 'name': 'E.

Understanding the way we react to the interaction with virtual agents and the impact of emotions on social dynamics in the virtual world is fundamental. Therefore, in this study we investigated the implicit effect of emotional information by adopting a perceptual discrimination task. Specifically, we devised a task that explicitly required perceptual discrimination of a target while involving distance regulation in the presence of happy, neutral, or angry virtual agents. In two Immersive Virtual Reality experiments, participants were instructed to discriminate a target on the virtual agents’ t-shirts, and they had to provide the response by stopping the virtual agents (or themselves) at the distance where they could identify the target. Thus, facial expressions were completely irrelevant to the perceptual task. The results showed that the perceptual discrimination implied a longer response time when t-shirts were worn by angry rather than happy or neutral virtual agents. This suggests that angry faces interfered with the explicit perceptual task people had to perform. From a theoretical standpoint, this anger-superiority effect could reflect an ancestral fear/avoidance mechanism that prompts automatic defensive reactions and bypasses other cognitive processes.","[{'authorId': '47238167', 'name': 'M.

Consistent with our hypotheses, serious games were found to be more effective in terms of learning (d= 0.29, p .05) than conventional instruction methods.

A large body of research has shown that alterations in ER are related to psychological disorders across different diagnostic categories. Because of the apparent ubiquity of ER difficulties in psychopathology, several authors have proposed that ER should be regarded as a transdiagnostic process. This article critically examines evidence regarding alterations in the use of cognitive ER strategies as a transdiagnostic process. Cognitive ER strategies are examined as 1 example of several possible ER-related processes that could be involved in psychopathology. There is consistent evidence showing that a reduced use of cognitive reappraisal and an increased use of negative rumination are present across a number of disorders, whereas increased levels of positive rumination appear to be confined to bipolar disorder. However, there is only preliminary evidence from prospective and/or experimental studies on the causal nature of altered ER strategy use in the development or maintenance of psychopathology. The article concludes by discussing future directions, including methodological and design issues, as well as implications for assessment and treatment when studying alterations in ER from a transdiagnostic perspective.

Despite these positive effects, humanity is becoming increasingly more distanced from nature due to societal changes, such as increased urbanization and the reduced accessibility of natural environments. Technology is also partly to blame, as research suggests that people replace nature contact with increased screen time. In this cross-section between nature and technology, we find technological nature which is progressing towards a point where we may be capable of simulating exposure to real nature. Concerns have been raised regarding this technology, as it is feared it will replace real nature. However, research suggests that virtual nature may have a more positive impact on society than a mere replacement of real nature, and this review propose several areas where virtual nature may be a beneficial addition to actual nature (Enable), help people reconnect with the real natural world (Reconnect) and “boost” human-nature interactions (Augment). Based on the current research and theoretical framework, this review proposes guidelines for future research within these areas, with the aim of advancing the field by producing high quality research.","[{'authorId': '14006733', 'name': 'S.

The use of VR tools can also mitigate some of the drawbacks currently associated with providing medical training in a traditional clinical environment such as scheduling conflicts and the need for specialized equipment (e.g., high-fidelity manikins). This paper presents the details of the framework and the development methodology associated with a VR-based training simulator for advanced cardiac life support, a time critical, team-based medical scenario. In addition, we also report the key findings of a usability study conducted to assess the efficacy of various features of this VR simulator through a postuse questionnaire administered to various care providers. The usability questionnaires were completed by two groups that used two different versions of the VR simulator. One version consisted of the VR trainer with it all its features and a minified version with certain immersive features disabled. We found an increase in usability scores from the minified group to the full VR group.","[{'authorId': '1812863', 'name': 'Akshay Vankipuram'}, {'authorId': '2136041', 'name': 'P.

The primary focus of this study is to identify the correlation between fluctuating level of attention and its implications on the cardiac rhythm recorded in the ECG. Furthermore, Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are also analyzed and classified for use as a benchmark for comparison with ECG analysis. Several advanced signal processing techniques have been implemented and investigated to derive multiple clandestine and informative features from both these physiological signals. Decomposition and feature extraction are done using Stockwell-transform for the ECG signal, while Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for EEG. These features are then applied to various machine-learning algorithms to produce classification models that are capable of differentiating between the cases of a person being attentive and a person not being attentive. The presented results show that detection and classification of cognitive attention using ECG are fairly comparable to EEG.","[{'authorId': '47562668', 'name': 'Ashwin Belle'}, {'authorId': '1727548', 'name': 'R.

Investigating the neural underpinnings of adaptive emotion regulation and the extent to which such processes are compromised in MDD may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of depression. We report results from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrating left-lateralized activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when downregulating negative affect in nondepressed individuals, whereas depressed individuals showed bilateral PFC activation. Furthermore, during an effortful affective reappraisal task, nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC). No such relationship was found for depressed individuals, who instead show a positive association between VMPFC and amygdala. Pupil dilation data suggest that those depressed patients who expend more effort to reappraise negative stimuli are characterized by accentuated activation in the amygdala, insula, and thalamus, whereas nondepressed individuals exhibit the opposite pattern. These findings indicate that a key feature underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative stimuli.","[{'authorId': '30361732', 'name': 'T.

A seemingly infinite range of methods and strategies has evolved to exploit the potential of technology. The problem has not been a scarcity of research. Literally thousands of studies related to computers and learning have been published during the past three decades. The problem has been one of making sense of the enormous, and growing, body of available research. This dilemma is compounded by the continuous metamorphosis of technologies—hardware, software and design—and the relatively short shelf-life of what is considered “state of the art.” Present-day technologies often bear little resemblance to the computers of even a decade ago; new hardware and design technologies continue to emerge. During the past 40 years alone, computers have evolved from cumbersome, expensive room-size machines with typewriter displays to inexpensive hand-held devices of substantially greater power, flexibility, and ease of use. Applications have shifted from primitive tutorials to tools for individual inquiry, from typed text to high-fidelity visual images and immersive three-dimension CAVEs (computer-aided virtual environments), and from systems that present information to systems in which individuals construct knowledge. Indeed, the construct of “emerging” technology seems apropos in a field of such rapid and continuous change. The purpose of this chapter is to present one way of making sense of the vast body of educational technology research by organizing and categorizing research related to technology in education along a number of facets. As part of this organization, we examine how differences in the values and assumptions underlying teaching and learning research, theory, and practice have influenced disciplined inquiry related to emerging technologies.","[{'authorId': '144178890', 'name': 'C.

Immersive Virtual Environments (IVE) have emerged as a potentially valuable supplement to environmental and behavioral research, and might also provide new approaches to green exercise promotion. However, it is unknown to what extent green exercise in IVE can provide psychophysiological responses similar to those experienced in real natural environments. In this study, 26 healthy adults underwent three experimental conditions: nature walk, sitting-IVE, and treadmill-IVE. The nature walk took place on a paved trail along a large river. In the IVE conditions, the participants wore a head-mounted display with headphones reproducing a 360° video and audio of the nature walk, either sitting on a chair or walking on a manually driven treadmill. Measurements included environmental perceptions (presence and perceived environmental restorativeness – PER), physical engagement (walking speed, heart rate, and perceived exertion), and affective responses (enjoyment and affect). Additionally, qualitative information was collected through open-ended questions. The participants rated the IVEs with satisfactory levels of ‘being there’ and ‘sense of reality,’ but also reported discomforts such as ‘flatness,’ ‘movement lag’ and ‘cyber sickness.’ With equivalent heart rate and walking speed, participants reported higher perceived exertion in the IVEs than in the nature walk. The nature walk was associated with high enjoyment and enhanced affect. However, despite equivalent ratings of PER in the nature walk and in the IVEs, the latter were perceived as less enjoyable and gave rise to a poorer affect. Presence and PER did not differ between the two IVEs, although in the treadmill-IVE the negative affective responses had slightly smaller magnitude than in the sitting-IVE. In both the IVEs, the negative affective responses were mainly associated with cyber sickness, whereas PER was positively associated with enjoyment. From the qualitative analysis, it emerged that poor postural control and lack of a holistic sensory experience can also hinder immersion in the IVE. The results indicate that IVE technology might in future be a useful instrument in green exercise research and promotion, but only if image quality and cyber sickness can be addressed.","[{'authorId': '5383499', 'name': 'G.

A total of 40 individuals who had experienced at least two months of strict social distancing measures followed COVID Feel Good between June and July 2020 for one week. Primary outcome measures were depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, perceived stress levels, and hopelessness. Secondary outcomes were the experienced social connectedness and the level of fear experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Additionally, we also performed a clinical change analysis on primary outcome measures. As concerning primary outcome measures, participants exhibited improvements from baseline to post-intervention for depression levels, stress levels, general distress, and perceived stress (all p < 0.05) but not for the perceived hopelessness (p = 0.110). Results for the secondary outcomes indicated an increase in social connectedness from T0 to T1 (p = 0.033) but not a significant reduction in the perceived fear of coronavirus (p = 0.412). Among these study variables, these significant improvements were maintained from post-intervention to the 2-week follow-up (p > 0.05). Results indicated that the intervention was associated with good clinical outcomes, low-to-no risks for the treatment, and no adverse effects or risks. Globally, evidence suggests a beneficial effect of the proposed protocol and its current availability in 12 different languages makes COVID Feel Good a free choice for helping individuals worldwide to cope with the psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 crisis, although large scale trials are needed to evaluate its efficacy.","[{'authorId': '2084524476', 'name': 'G.

Many teachers receive limited pre-service training in classroom management, creating a need for effective in-service professional development (PD). This literature review summarizes the results of 74 empirical studies examining the effects of PD on teachers’ classroom management behaviours. It identifies the characteristics of the existing literature base, the most frequent components of effective PD, and teacher and student outcomes related to PD. The results support a prior review that also suggested effective PD (i.e., desired changes in teacher and student behaviour) is predominantly studied at the elementary school level and, in addition to generic in-service trainings, most frequently includes didactic (direct) instruction, coaching, and performance feedback. These results have important implications for developing effective PD opportunities in the area of classroom management for in-service educators.","[{'authorId': '153569594', 'name': 'S.

The effect of a distorted body image, such as the telescoping effect in amputee patients, on pain perception, is unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether distorting an embodied virtual arm in virtual reality (simulating the telescoping effect in amputees) modulated pain perception and anticipatory responses to pain in healthy participants. Twenty-seven right-handed participants were immersed in virtual reality and the virtual arm was shown with three different levels of distortion with a virtual threatening stimulus either approaching or contacting the virtual hand. We evaluated pain/discomfort ratings, ownership, and skin conductance responses (SCRs) after each condition. Viewing a distorted virtual arm enhances the SCR to a threatening event with respect to viewing a normal control arm, but when viewing a reddened-distorted virtual arm, SCR was comparatively reduced in response to the threat. There was a positive relationship between the level of ownership over the distorted and reddened-distorted virtual arms with the level of pain/discomfort, but not in the normal control arm. Contact with the threatening stimulus significantly enhances SCR and pain/discomfort, while reduced SCR and pain/discomfort were seen in the simulated-contact condition. These results provide further evidence of a bi-directional link between body image and pain perception.","[{'authorId': '1413274580', 'name': 'Marta Matamala-Gomez'}, {'authorId': '2449799', 'name': 'B.

Accordingly, our review aimed to determine the challenges associated with the application of VR in the field of medical education and treatment. We searched Science Direct, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases for relevant papers using a defined search query. We restricted the search to articles in English or Persian language published by the end of 2018. The main challenges of developing and using VR with educational and therapeutic objectives are categorized as general and specific. General challenges include reduced face-to-face communications, education, cost challenges, users’ attitudes, and specific challenges such as designing, safety considerations, VR side effects, evaluation, and validation of VR applications. Challenges related to VR will have different effects, thus identifying each of them helps to determine the solutions for each challenge. Also, it is suggested to develop and update laws, standards, and protocols, which play an important role in increasing the effective application of VR at the national level.","[{'authorId': '12695046', 'name': 'T.

6ac5feb3b1ab888fbc22b0dadc8ad53aa6a4b4cd,"We attempted to evaluate the clinical efficiency of a novel three-dimensional interactive augmented reality system (3D-ARS) for balance and mobility rehabilitation. This system enables participant training with a realistic 3D interactive balance exercise and assessing movement parameters and joint angles by using a kinetic sensor system. We performed a randomized controlled trial in a general hospital. Thirty-six participants (age, 56-76 years) who could independently walk and stand on one leg were recruited. The participants were randomly assigned to either group. The control group (n = 18) underwent a conventional physical fitness program such as lower-extremity strengthening and balance training thrice per week for 1 month. The experimental group (n = 18) experienced 3D-ARS training thrice per week (1 session = 30 minutes) for 4 weeks. Training comprised a balloon game for hip exercise, cave game for knee exercise, and rhythm game for one-leg balance exercise. Lower-extremity clinical scale scores, fall index, and automatic balance score were measured by using Tetrax® posturography before, during, and after training. Significant group (3D-ARS vs. control) × time (before and after exercise) interaction effect was observed for Berg balance scale (BBS) scores (p = 0.04) and timed-up-and-go (TUG; p < 0.001). Overall improvements occurred in stability index, weight distribution index, fall risk index, and Fourier transformations index of posturography for both groups. However, score changes were significantly greater in the 3D-ARS group. Significant group × time interaction effect was observed for the fall risk index. This demonstrates that the 3D-ARS system can improve balance in the elderly more effectively.","[{'authorId': '143720898', 'name': 'J.

6ad4cb2894a0b780934d3ce7117b16f2bdd5e168,"Background Recent research identifies unhealthful weight-control behaviors (fasting, vomiting, or laxative abuse) induced by a negative experience of the body, as the common antecedents of both obesity and eating disorders. In particular, according to the allocentric lock hypothesis, individuals with obesity may be locked to an allocentric (observer view) negative memory of the body that is no longer updated by contrasting egocentric representations driven by perception. In other words, these patients may be locked to an allocentric negative representation of their body that their sensory inputs are no longer able to update even after a demanding diet and a significant weight loss. Objective To test the brief and long-term clinical efficacy of an enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy including a virtual reality protocol aimed at unlocking the negative memory of the body (ECT) in morbidly obese patients with binge eating disorders (BED) compared with standard cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and an inpatient multimodal treatment (IP) on weight loss, weight loss maintenance, BED remission, and body satisfaction improvement, including psychonutritional groups, a low-calorie diet (1200 kcal/day), and physical training. Methods 90 obese (BMI>40) female patients with BED upon referral to an obesity rehabilitation center were randomly assigned to conditions (31 to ECT, 30 to CBT, and 29 to IP). Before treatment completion, 24 patients discharged themselves from hospital (4 in ECT, 10 in CBT, and 10 in IP). The remaining 66 inpatients received either 15 sessions of ECT, 15 sessions of CBT, or no additional treatment over a 5-week usual care inpatient regimen (IP). ECT and CBT treatments were administered by 3 licensed psychotherapists, and patients were blinded to conditions. At start, upon completion of the inpatient treatment, and at 1-year follow-up, patients' weight, number of binge eating episodes during the previous month, and body satisfaction were assessed by self-report questionnaires and compared across conditions. 22 patients who received all sessions did not provide follow-up data (9 in ECT, 6 in CBT, and 7 in IP). Results Only ECT was effective at improving weight loss at 1-year follow-up. Conversely, control participants regained on average most of the weight they had lost during the inpatient program. Binge eating episodes decreased to zero during the inpatient program but were reported again in all the three groups at 1-year follow-up. However, a substantial regain was observed only in the group who received the inpatient program alone, while both ECT and CBT were successful in maintaining a low rate of monthly binge eating episodes. Conclusions Despite study limitations, findings support the hypothesis that the integration of a VR-based treatment, aimed at both unlocking the negative memory of the body and at modifying its behavioral and emotional correlates, may improve the long-term outcome of a treatment for obese BED patients. As expected, the VR-based treatment, in comparison with the standard CBT approach, was able to better prevent weight regain but not to better manage binge eating episodes.

An attentive student will naturally be more open to obtaining knowledge than a bored or frustrated student. In recent years, tools such as skin temperature measurements and body posture calculations have been developed for the purpose of determining a student's affect, or emotional state of mind. However, measuring eye-gaze data is particularly noteworthy in that it can collect measurements non-intrusively, while also being relatively simple to set up and use. This paper details how data obtained from an eye-tracker can indeed be used to predict a student's attention as a measure of affect over the course of a class. From this research, an accuracy of 77% was achieved using the Extreme Gradient Boosting technique of machine learning. The outcome indicates that eye-gaze can be indeed used as a basis for constructing a predictive model.","[{'authorId': '90437712', 'name': 'Narayanan Veliyath'}, {'authorId': '50430940', 'name': 'Pradipta De'}, {'authorId': '2069302724', 'name': 'Andrew A.

The results showed that 1) relative to anticipating neutral images, participations’ anxiety experience and skin conductance level were higher when anticipating negative and unknown images; 2) participants who had a unconscious emotion control goal primed achieved the same decrease in skin conductance as those explicitly instructed to reappraise, compared to a control group; 3) heart rate was not affected by experiment condition and anticipation type.

We study recently developed nonparametric methods for estimating the number of missing studies that might exist in a meta‐analysis and the effect that these studies might have had on its outcome. These are simple rank‐based data augmentation techniques, which formalize the use of funnel plots. We show that they provide effective and relatively powerful tests for evaluating the existence of such publication bias. After adjusting for missing studies, we find that the point estimate of the overall effect size is approximately correct and coverage of the effect size confidence intervals is substantially improved, in many cases recovering the nominal confidence levels entirely.

This can be particularly apt for more at‐risk young people who may not engage readily with other approaches. Published evaluation of such interventions is however sparse. This paper aims to describe an evaluation of the DRUMBEAT program which uses drumming as a way to engage at‐risk youth, whilst simultaneously incorporating themes relating to mental wellbeing and healthy relationships., – An evaluation was undertaken in 19 schools participating in the ten‐week DRUMBEAT program. Pre, interim and post‐program surveys were administered to participating students (n=180). School‐based data on student behaviour and teacher feedback was also collected., – Positive changes were observed on several measures, including a 10 per cent increase in self‐esteem scores by program completion. School data showed a decrease in reported behaviour incidents for 29 per cent of participants. Overall, the evaluation indicated that the DRUMBEAT program provides a creative medium for working with at‐risk young people and helps develop self‐esteem and social relationship skills., – There is a paucity of published evaluations of interventions of this kind. Also novel is the delivery of the program in a school‐based rather than clinical therapy setting.

Specifically, the authors exposed 16 current smokers who had failed to sustain any previous quit attempt for more than 24 hr (immediate relapsers) and 16 smokers with at least 1 sustained quit attempt of 3 months or longer (delayed relapsers) to psychological (mental arithmetic) and physical (carbon dioxide inhalation-breath holding) stressors. Relative to delayed relapsers, immediate relapsers were characterized by higher baseline levels of affective vulnerability, by greater levels of dysphoria and urge to smoke after 12 hr of nicotine deprivation, and by less task persistence on the stressors, suggesting that these may be risk factors for early lapse in the context of quitting smoking.","[{'authorId': '152443841', 'name': 'Richard A.

The present study aimed to compare the cognitive variables (working memory and processing speed) and the attentional profiles of a sample of students with and without ADHD, using scales from the WISC-IV, and the virtual reality-based attentional test known as ‘Aula Nesplora’; and determine the extent to which the aforementioned variables may predict student group membership. A total of 88 students took part in this study (66 males and 22 females), aged from 6 to 16 years (M = 10.20; SD = 2.79). The sample was divided into two groups: an ADHD group (n = 50) and a Control group (n = 38). Students in the ADHD group obtained lower scores in working memory and in processing speed, as well as demonstrating poorer performance in Aula Nesplora than did their peers. Working memory, and the number of omissions, were both shown to be reliable predictors of group membership. This study revealed the importance of obtaining data from attentional variables differentiated by modality when considering cognitive variables, in order to better characterize the difficulties experienced by individuals diagnosed with ADHD.","[{'authorId': '5758544', 'name': 'D.

6e65dbadd8d6bf4592c7cb6e85dfe937bc12922b,"Evidence has amassed from both animal intracranial recordings and human electrophysiology that neural oscillatory mechanisms play a critical role in a number of cognitive functions such as learning, memory, feature binding and sensory gating. The wide availability of high-density electrical and magnetic recordings (64–256 channels) over the past two decades has allowed for renewed efforts in the characterization and localization of these rhythms. A variety of cognitive effects that are associated with specific brain oscillations have been reported, which range in spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics depending on the context. Our laboratory has focused on investigating the role of alpha-band oscillatory activity (8–14 Hz) as a potential attentional suppression mechanism, and this particular oscillatory attention mechanism will be the focus of the current review. We discuss findings in the context of intersensory selective attention as well as intrasensory spatial and feature-based attention in the visual, auditory, and tactile domains. The weight of evidence suggests that alpha-band oscillations can be actively invoked within cortical regions across multiple sensory systems, particularly when these regions are involved in processing irrelevant or distracting information. That is, a central role for alpha seems to be as an attentional suppression mechanism when objects or features need to be specifically ignored or selected against.","[{'authorId': '3229047', 'name': 'John J.

It has been suggested that a greater biological salience of approaching auditory sources may account for these effects. In addition, these effects may hold only for those sources critical for our survival. In the present study, we bring support to these hypotheses by quantifying the emotional responses to different sounds with changing intensity patterns. In 2 experiments, participants were exposed to artificial and natural sounds simulating approaching or receding sources. The auditory-induced emotional effect was reflected in the performance of participants in an emotion-related behavioral task, their self-reported emotional experience, and their physiology (electrodermal activity and facial electromyography). The results of this study suggest that approaching unpleasant sound sources evoke more intense emotional responses in listeners than receding ones, whereas such an effect of perceived sound motion does not exist for pleasant or neutral sound sources. The emotional significance attributed to the sound source itself, the loudness of the sound, and loudness change duration seem to be relevant factors in this disparity.","[{'authorId': '1398935536', 'name': 'A.

People high or low in emotional empathy were exposed to pictures of happy and angry faces while their facial electromyography from the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscle regions was detected. High empathy participants rapidly reacted with larger zygomatic muscle activity to happy as compared with angry faces as early as after 500 ms after stimulus onset, and with larger corrugator muscle activity to angry than to happy faces after 500 ms. Accordingly, this group also reacted with a corresponding experience of emotion. The low empathy participants, in contrast, did not differentiate between the happy and angry stimuli with either facial muscles or in their self experience of emotion. The findings are related to the facial feedback hypothesis and the results are interpreted as support for the hypothesis that rapid and automatically evoked facial mimicry may be one important mechanism for emotional and empathic contagion to occur.","[{'authorId': '4583182', 'name': 'U.

In this two-phase study, we aimed to recruit a general population sample to investigate the association between trait paranoia and cognitive, emotional, and behavioral components of social performance. In phase 1, a general population online survey (N = 609) investigated how trait paranoia related to fear of negative evaluation (FNE), interpersonal sensitivity, social avoidance and distress (SAD), mood, and demographic characteristics. In phase 2, we piloted a new VR social situation paradigm (a party in a bar) with a subsample of participants who scored high or low in trait paranoia. Eighty-nine participants entered the VR party in a bar scenario to evaluate the acceptability of the task and the relationship between paranoid ideation and social performance. As hypothesized, in phase 1, trait paranoia was associated with FNE, SAD, interpersonal sensitivity, mood, and demographics (all small-to-medium effects); in phase 2, participants found the VR environment acceptable and immersive; exposure to the VR environment elicited a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral components of social performance; and high trait paranoia participants reported higher state paranoia and greater negative components of social performance (all medium effects). The study tests a novel sample recruited predominantly online and validates the virtual environment for psychological assessment and treatment. This result suggests that the new VR scenario could be used as a psychological assessment and treatment tool for people who experience paranoia in social situations.","[{'authorId': '46714321', 'name': 'S.

Nonetheless, it is not clear whether EP‐ and ER‐related areas are regionally and/or connectively disturbed in MDD. In addition, it is yet to be known how EP‐ and ER‐related areas are interactively linked to regulatory behavior, and whether this interaction is disrupted in MDD. In our study, regional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and whole‐brain functional connectivity (FC) of meta‐analytic‐driven EP‐ and ER‐related areas were compared between 32 healthy controls (HC) and 20 MDD patients. Then, we aimed to investigate whether the EP‐related areas can predict the ER‐related areas and regulatory behavior in both groups. Finally, the brain–behavior correlations between the EP‐ and ER‐related areas and depression severity were assessed. We found that: (a) affective areas are regionally and/or connectively disturbed in MDD; (b) EP‐ER interaction seems to be disrupted in MDD; overburden of emotional reactivity in amygdala may inversely affect cognitive control processes in prefrontal cortices, which leads to diminished regulatory actions. (c) Depression severity is correlated with FC of affective areas.

Based on this finding, approaches to support the therapy of body perception disturbances in eating or body weight disorders by mixed reality (MR) systems gain in importance. However, the methodological heterogeneity of previous research has made it difficult to assess the suitability of different MR systems for therapeutic use in these areas. The effects of MR system properties and related psychometric factors on body-related perceptions have so far remained unclear. We developed an interactive virtual mirror embodiment application to investigate the differences between an augmented reality see-through head-mounted-display (HMD) and a virtual reality HMD on the before-mentioned factors. Additionally, we considered the influence of the participant’s body-mass-index (BMI) and the BMI difference between participants and their avatars on the estimations. The 54 normal-weight female participants significantly underestimated the weight of their photorealistic, generic avatar in both conditions. Body weight estimations were significantly predicted by the participants’ BMI and the BMI difference. We also observed partially significant differences in presence and tendencies for differences in virtual body ownership between the systems. Our results offer new insights into the relationships of body weight perception in different MR environments and provide new perspectives for the development of therapeutic applications.

The general purpose of the study was investigated through the following specific objectives: (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions; and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions. Correlations between Virtual Multiple Errands Test variables and some traditional executive functions measures provide preliminary support for the ecological and construct validity of the VMET; further performance obtained at the Virtual Multiple Errands Test provided a distinction between the clinical and healthy population, and between the two age control groups.

As a means of self-care of mental health that can be implemented by busy professionals during their workdays and daily lives, the Digital-SAT method has been developed to implement the stress-care process of the SAT method, a psychological counseling technique for resolving psychological stress problems, in a self-guided manner using digital media. To realize the Digital-SAT method, two issues need to be addressed: first, to obtain the same emotional stress reduction effect as the SAT method and, second, to ensure the continuous implementation of the Digital-SAT method. Previous studies have shown that applications (apps) using virtual reality are effective in solving the former issue, and an app using a chatbot can be effective in solving the latter. In this research, an intervention study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of combined use of the two apps to encourage continuous use, resulting in increased emotional stress reduction, with the aim of making it feasible in actual work environments. An intervention of four weeks of app use was conducted with 70 nurses working in two hospitals where measures for mental health due to emotional labour and overwork were required. The emotional stress reduction effects of the intervention were evaluated using psychological scales and blood pressure levels, and it was confirmed that combined use of apps was more effective than using them separately to practice the Digital-SAT method in an actual work environment.","[{'authorId': '1996424491', 'name': 'A.

722832b718a3e2a7d4efabc97f5c45c83725a629,"The use of virtual reality (VR) technology to induce emotional responses has recently become more common in psychological studies. The majority of these studies have been restricted to seated VR experiences where the participant remains in a sedentary position. The purpose of the current thesis is to utilise room-scale VR to increase presence, agency and potency of virtual environments (VE) designed to induce embodied emotional responses. The Evaluative Space Model (ESM) [Cacciopio et. al 2012] was used as the theoretical basis for this programme of research, which was particularly concerned with avoidance responses to negative stimuli, perception of threat and negativity bias. A number of unique VEs were created using Unreal Engine 4 designed to create an illusion of height and the potential for a virtual fall as a source of threat. These VEs were supplemented by additional tracking sensors and an integrated approach to data collection wherein behavioural interactions and movements within the VE were synchronised with ambulatory methods from psychophysiology, e.g. facial electromyography (fEMG), skin conductance level (SCL). The first study (N=20) utilised a VE that requires participants to walk on a wooden plank between the rooftops of two buildings, two versions of the VE were created: sedentary version operated via gamepad controller and a room scale version with natural sensorimotor mappings. The study revealed greater psychophysiological reactivity for the room-scale version of the environment. The second study (N=34) introduced an elaborated room-scale VE where participants must traverse a grid of translucent ice blocks suspended at height in order to reach an end-goal within a physical space of 9m2. This grid contained three types of ice block: solid (low-threat), crack (mid-threat) or fall (high threat). The number of crack and fall blocks were increased over three levels of the VE in order to manipulate threat. The foot movements of participants were tracked as the primary mode of interaction with the VE. The study revealed: (i) higher incidence of risk-averse behaviours as threat increased, (ii) this pattern of behaviour was enhanced for participants with higher levels of trait neuroticism, and (iii) greater reactivity from the corrugator muscle in the period following a two-feet movement. The third study (N=20) represented an extension of study two where a significantly larger version of the ice block VE was created in a physical space of 27m2. In this experiment, the level of threat (i.e. number of crack and fall blocks) was increased, sustained and decreased in order to study adaptation to reduced threat level. In addition, a ‘ground level’ version of the VE was utilised as a control to study the effect of virtual height in isolation. The results of this study revealed: (i) participants adjusted behaviour to increased threat and decreased threat, but only in the presence of virtual height, and (ii) increased activation of zygomaticus during interactions with crack blocks, which suggests this muscle may be associated with a ‘grimace’ response in this context. The final experimental chapter represents a re-analyses of the data from studies 2 and 3 designed to explore individual differences as predictors of risk averse behaviour in response to the threat. These analyses identified trait neuroticism and age as traits that significantly influenced the magnitude of the negativity gradient in response to threat. The implications of the research for studying emotional experiences in VR are discussed.","[{'authorId': '40281931', 'name': 'C.

However, we found research seldom addressed the development of the use or failure to use learning-theory foundations and categorized these learning theories into relative types and synthesized their development. We investigate this issue from the perspective of learning theories invoked to underpin educational computer game design and use based on the four types of learning theories: behaviourism, cognitivism, humanism and constructivism. Because the investigation needs to examine and analyse the results from a large number of independent previous studies, this study applied the meta-analysis method to present a more comprehensive description and discussion of the influence and implications of the findings. This study shows the distribution of development trends for the use of learning theory as a theoretical foundation, as opposed to those that fail to use learning theory in game-based learning, along with the distribution of types and principles of learning theories that used a learning-theory foundation. These new findings can supplement the results of previous studies with regard to the issue of learning-theory foundations in game-based learning.

The perception of our own body and more particularly our sense of body ownership is taken for granted. Nevertheless, experimental findings from body ownership illusions (BOIs), show that under specific multisensory conditions, we can experience artificial body parts or fake bodies as our own body parts or body, respectively. The aim of the present paper is to discuss how and why BOIs are induced. We review several experimental findings concerning the spatial, temporal, and semantic principles of crossmodal stimuli that have been applied to induce BOIs. On the basis of these principles, we discuss theoretical approaches concerning the underlying mechanism of BOIs. We propose a conceptualization based on Bayesian causal inference for addressing how our nervous system could infer whether an object belongs to our own body, using multisensory, sensorimotor, and semantic information, and we discuss how this can account for several experimental findings. Finally, we point to neural network models as an implementational framework within which the computational problem behind BOIs could be addressed in the future.","[{'authorId': '3038757', 'name': 'Konstantina Kilteni'}, {'authorId': '47330407', 'name': 'A.

728e1adf786a3639fef94977ef1258fd42cb9b3f,"In recent decades, a growing body of literature has focused on emotion regulation (ER), which refers to the ability to implement strategies in order to modulate emotional responses and reach desirable goals. To date, impaired ER (i.e., emotion dysregulation) has been identified as a transdiagnostic factor across a wide range of psychopathological conditions, which shows the importance of improving patients' ability to regulate negative and positive emotions in clinical practice. In addition to the increasing evidence showing its efficacy in the treatment of several clinical conditions, virtual reality (VR) has recently emerged as a potentially powerful tool for enhancing ER, thus breaking new ground in the development of cutting-edge transdiagnostic interventions. In the present narrative review, we will provide an overview of the existing evidence about VR-based interventions in the field of ER, emphasizing the promising findings and the barriers that still have to be addressed. To this aim, the available VR-based literature will be analysed in relation to four categories of ER strategies: Situational strategies, attentional strategies, cognitive strategies and response modulation strategies. Furthermore, new emerging fields of research targeting innovative aspects of ER will be highlighted, including the use of VR to promote positive emotions and interpersonal ER skills. Besides, its cost-effectiveness will be discussed, taking into account the costs for both developers (e.g., clinicians and researchers) and end-users. Finally, future directions in this promising field of research will be outlined.","[{'authorId': '34680177', 'name': 'D. Colombo'}, {'authorId': '1422376799', 'name': 'A.

The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of newly developed MBCT program as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of patients with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. Methods: Forty‐six patients with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder were assigned to either MBCT or an anxiety disorder education (ADE) program for a period of 8 weeks. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM‐A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM‐D), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Symptom Checklist‐90‐Revised (SCL‐90‐R) were used to assess the patients at 0 week and after the two programs had been running for 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Results: The MBCT group demonstrated significantly more improvement than the ADE group according to all anxiety (HAM‐A, p<0.01; BAI, p<0.01; anxiety subscale of SCL‐90‐R, p=0.01) and depression (HAM‐D, p<0.01; BDI, p<0.01; depression subscale of SCL‐90‐R, p<0.01) scale scores. The obsessive‐compulsive and phobic subscales of the SCL‐90‐R also showed significantly more improvement in the MBCT group. However, no significant improvement was observed in the MBCT group versus the ADE group in terms of the somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, paranoid ideation, or psychoticism subscale scores of the SCL‐90‐R. Conclusions: MBCT may be effective at relieving anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.

This study aimed to explore how online learning self-efficacy (OLSE), learner–content interaction (LCI), learner–instructor interaction (LII), and learner–learner interaction (LLI) can predict student satisfaction and perceived learning. A total of 167 students participated in this study. Regression results revealed that the overall model with all four predictor variables (OLSE, LCI, LII, and LLI) was significantly predictive of satisfaction and perceived learning. The study found that LCI was the strongest and most significant predictor of student satisfaction, while OLSE was the strongest and most significant predictor of perceived learning. However, LLI was not predictive of student satisfaction and perceived learning. This study suggests that instructors employ strategies that enhance students’ OLSE, LCI, and LII. Research is needed to understand how LLI fosters student learning and satisfaction.","[{'authorId': '27073434', 'name': 'Emtinan Alqurashi'}]",348.0,,41.0,Predicting student satisfaction and perceived learning within online learning environments,2018.0

Emotion regulation (ER) supports multiple individual functions and promotes mental health and wellbeing. Among the tools that may be used to help people in managing their affective states, videogames are reaching attention and are showing positive effects. Yet, little is known about their effectiveness.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to assess the amount and quality of studies investigating the effects and modalities of the use of videogames for ER.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A systematic literature search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Subsequently, according to expert advice other few studies have been added.


RESULTS
Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; they can be categorized into three groups, namely (1) cross-sectional and qualitative studies, (2) experimental studies investigating the effects of videogame experience on ER and (3) ER intervention with serious games.


DISCUSSION
Discussion of the reviewed studies highlights that frequent gaming with commercial games offers more opportunities for ER improvement (related to gameplay and enjoyment of fictional properties) than limited-time experiences, such as those supported by bespoke serious games. This research area is still in its infancy and findings need to be interpreted with caution; furthermore, future reviews are encouraged to include clinical populations.


CONCLUSION
Videogames offer several opportunities for ER and a challenge for educational and psychological interventions.","[{'authorId': '103238720', 'name': 'D. Villani'}, {'authorId': '2164209', 'name': 'C.

With the advances in technology, Internet addiction and Internet gaming disorders are increasingly prevalent. To date, these disorders are still being treated using conventional psychotherapy methods such as cognitive behavioural therapy. However, there is an increasing number of research combining various other therapies alongside with cognitive behavioural therapy, as an attempt possibly to reduce the drop-out rates and to make such interventions more relevant to the targeted group of addicts, who are mostly adolescents. To date, there has been a prior study done in Korea that has demonstrated the comparable efficacy of virtual reality therapy with that of cognitive behavioural therapy.

744b9dc66c6142f553f1d8eb6cd8aae966a8daf7,"Background: Impairment in social communication is the primary deficit in school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There are efficacious interventions to address social communication deficits, yet their delivery is hampered by the lack of human and time resources. Emerging assistive technologies, such as smartglasses, may be able to help augment the social communication interventions currently provided by human educators and therapists. While emerging research suggests assistive socio-emotional coaching smartglasses can be effective and usable in research settings, they have yet to be studied amidst the complex social, physical, and time-constrained environment of the school classroom. This structured case study reports on the feasibility and efficacy of 16 intervention sessions of the Empowered Brain Face2Face module, a smartglasses-based social communication intervention. Methods: A 13-year-old fully-verbal adolescent male student with a diagnosis of ASD received a total of 16 smartglasses-aided intervention sessions over a two-week period. Interventions occurred twice-daily during school days and were facilitated by school professionals in a middle school in Massachusetts, USA. Outcomes were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2), a commonly used validated measure of social communication in children with ASD, by the participant’s parent, paraprofessional, and two teachers. Difficulties in usability during the study were recorded through observation notes. Results: The participant completed the three-week study (one pre-intervention week (baseline) and two intervention weeks) without any observations of adverse effects or usability concerns. The parent and three educators completed the SRS-2 for the baseline and intervention weeks, and results demonstrated significant improvement in social communication after the intervention relative to baseline. The parent, special education teacher, and general education teacher noted marked reductions in SRS-2 total T score, with improvement in SRS-2 social communication, social motivation, social cognition, and restricted interests and repetitive behavior subscales. Conclusion: Smartglasses are a novel assistive technology that can help facilitate social communication and behavioral coaching for students with ASD. The use of the Face2Face module by educators over a two-week period was associated with improvements in social communication. This study supports the use of this novel technology to deliver assistive social communication and behavioral coaching in schools.","[{'authorId': '31549042', 'name': 'Ned T.

Method The Reading the Mind in the Eyes task, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and a computerized pictorial (angry and neutral faces) Stroop task were administered to 190 women [50 with AN, 50 with BN and 90 healthy controls (HCs)]. Results Those with an ED showed attentional biases to faces in general (medium effect), but specifically to angry faces over neutral faces (large effect) compared to HCs. The ED group also reported significantly higher emotion regulation difficulties (large effect) than HCs. There was a small difference between the ED and HC groups for the emotion recognition task (small-medium effect), particularly in the restricting AN (RAN) group.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of wearable computing as a research field and provides a systematic review of recent work specifically on wrist-worn wearables. The focus of this research is on wrist-worn wearable studies because there is a lack of systematic literature reviews related to this area. This study reviewed journal and conference articles from 2015 and 2017 with some studies from 2014 and 2018, resulting in a selection of 54 studies that met the selection criteria.

Depression, anxiety, and apathy are commonly observed neuropsychiatric features in MCI, which have been linked to cognitive and functional decline in daily activities, as well as disease progression. Accordingly, the study’s objective is to review the prevalence, neuropsychological characteristics, and conversion rates to dementia between MCI patients with and without depression, anxiety, and apathy. Methods: A PubMed search and critical review were performed relating to studies of MCI, depression, anxiety, and apathy. Results: MCI patients have a high prevalence of depression/anxiety/apathy; furthermore, patients with MCI and concomitant depression/anxiety/apathy have more pronounced cognitive deficits and progress more often to dementia than MCI patients without depression/anxiety/apathy. Conclusions and Implications: Depression, anxiety, and apathy are common in MCI and represent possible risk factors for cognitive decline and progression to dementia. Further studies are needed to better understand the role and neurobiology of depression, anxiety, and apathy in MCI.","[{'authorId': '123715267', 'name': 'Lina Ma'}]",131.0,,119.0,"Depression, Anxiety, and Apathy in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Current Perspectives",2020.0

Traditional research designs, such as the randomized controlled trial (RCT), are limited in their capacity to match the pace of development and evolving nature of e-mental health. There are a number of unique challenges associated with research into the development and use of technologically based interventions. This article discusses these challenges and examines emerging strategies that may enable clinicians to be more confident when integrating e-mental health in their practices. We argue that greater use of small sample size designs, greater collaboration and research in applied settings, as well as more focused empirical investigation during program development stages are needed. We use a research example of a Smartphone application aimed at the treatment of anxiety disorders to illustrate the procedure, value, and clinical applications of each of the emerging research designs.","[{'authorId': '2145461', 'name': 'Bonnie A.

Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences.","[{'authorId': '50196275', 'name': 'Dhaval Parmar'}, {'authorId': '2281825', 'name': 'Lorraine Lin'}, {'authorId': '2065977557', 'name': 'Nikeetha Dsouza'}, {'authorId': '144892110', 'name': 'S.

765838e2fcdd26b3b3725547ecfa0093f8765129,"In most Interactive Storytelling systems, user interaction is based on natural language communication with virtual agents, either through isolated utterances or through dialogue. Natural language communication is also an essential element of interactive narratives in which the user is supposed to impersonate one of the story's characters. Whilst techniques for narrative generation and agent behaviour have made significant progress in recent years, natural language processing remains a bottleneck hampering the scalability of Interactive Storytelling systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel interaction technique based solely on emotional speech recognition. It allows the user to take part in dialogue with virtual actors without any constraints on style or expressivity, by mapping the recognised emotional categories to narrative situations and virtual characters feelings. Our Interactive Storytelling system uses an emotional planner to drive characters' behaviours. The main feature of this approach is that characters' feelings are part of the planning domain and are at the heart of narrative representations. The emotional speech recogniser analyses the speech signal to produce a variety of features which can be used to define ad-hoc categories on which to train the system. The content of our interactive narrative is an adaptation of one chapter of the XIXth century classic novel, Madame Bovary, which is well suited to a formalisation in terms of characters' feelings. At various stages of the narrative, the user can address the main character or respond to her, impersonating her lover. The emotional category extracted from the user utterance can be analysed in terms of the current narrative context, which includes characters' beliefs, feelings and expectations, to produce a specific influence on the target character, which will become visible through a change in its behaviour, achieving a high level of realism for the interaction. A limited number of emotional categories is sufficient to drive the narrative across multiple courses of actions, since it comprises over thirty narrative functions. We report results from a fully implemented prototype, both in terms of proof of concept and of usability through a preliminary user study.","[{'authorId': '1696638', 'name': 'M.

In this article an extensive review on the most relevant scientific literature is presented, with a developmental range from childhood to youthhood. An analysis on the developmental characteristics of the main executive functions is offered. The review indicates that the hypothesis stated by Victoria Anderson a decade ago, is accurate: the executive func- tions develops in a sequential form, with a curvilinear behavior: an intense progression during childhood, with slowness by early adolescence. Effects of additional factors like school level, parenting, and cultural context are al- so analyzed.","[{'authorId': '1404694002', 'name': 'Julio C.

Background. Computer interactive environments are becoming the main platforms for the professional and personal self-realization of a modern person, the social activity of youth is shifting to the Internet space, models and forms of interpersonal interaction and communication are changing, new psychological constructs are formed that reflect virtual world and provide interaction with it. Psychological virtual reality acts as an intermediary between a person as a personality and a computer interactive environment as a form of cyberspace representation in modern human life, and the psychological constructs generated in it determine the formation of new socio-psychological behavior patterns. Methodology: systemic and subjective approaches, comparative analysis method. Conclusions. The creation of computer interactive environments has opened a new stage in the formation of a new interactive human experience as a system of information technology and socio-psychological competencies. There is a need for a systematic study of the conceptual-categorical apparatus that is used to describe computer interactive environments. Psychological virtual reality is a component of computer interactive environment, performing number of important functions of optimizing human interaction with computer environment. The analysis of the ""man—computer environment"" system gives reason to distinguish between nine basic psychotypes of social subjects which are participants of virtual reality. The typology developed in the article can be recommended for use as a methodological basis in the development of socio-psychological diagnostic tools, in the practice of socio-psychological counseling and social work.","[{'authorId': '147344198', 'name': 'L.

Since the values of metrics depend not only on the models, but also on the data, it may turn out that different models are the best on different test sets. For this reason, the traditional approach to comparing the values of metrics on a test set is often not enough. Sometimes a statistical comparison of the results obtained on the basis of cross-validation is used, but in this case it is impossible to guarantee the independence of the obtained measurements, which does not allow the use of the Student's t-test. There are criteria that do not require independent measurements, but they have less power. For additive metrics, a technique is proposed in this paper, when a test sample is divided into N parts, on each of which the values of the metrics are calculated. Since the value on each part is obtained as the sum of independent random variables, according to the central limit theorem, the obtained metrics values on each of the N parts are realizations of the normally distributed random variable. To estimate the required sample size, it is proposed to use normality tests and build quantile– quantile plots. You can then use a modification of the Student's t-test to conduct a statistical test comparing the mean values of the metrics. A simplified approach is also considered, in which confidence intervals are built for the base model. A model whose metric values do not fall into this interval works differently from the base model. This approach reduces the amount of computations needed, however, an experimental analysis of the binary cross-entropy metric for CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction models showed that it is more rough than the first one.","[{'authorId': '2884561', 'name': 'Sebastian Ruder'}]",4908.0,,30.0,An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms,2016.0

Medically managed opioid withdrawal (detox) can increase the risk of subsequent opioid overdose. We assessed the association between mortality following detox and receipt of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and residential treatment after detox.


DESIGN
Cohort study generated from individually linked public health data sets.


SETTING
Massachusetts, USA.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 30 681 opioid detox patients with 61 819 detox episodes between 2012 and 2014.


MEASUREMENTS
Treatment categories included no post-detox treatment, MOUD, residential treatment or both MOUD and residential treatment identified at monthly intervals. We classified treatment exposures in two ways: (a) 'on-treatment' included any month where a treatment was received and (b) 'with-discontinuation' individuals were considered exposed through the month following treatment discontinuation. We conducted multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses and extended Kaplan-Meier estimator cumulative incidence for all-cause and opioid-related mortality for the treatment categories as monthly time-varying exposure variables.


FINDINGS
Twelve months after detox, 41% received MOUD for a median of 3 months, 35% received residential treatment for a median of 2 months and 13% received both for a median of 5 months. In on-treatment analyses for all-cause mortality compared with no treatment, adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) were 0.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27-0.43] for MOUD, 0.63 (95% CI = 0.47-0.84) for residential treatment and 0.11 (95% CI = 0.03-0.43) for both. In with-discontinuation analyses for all-cause mortality, compared with no treatment, AHRs were 0.52 (95% CI = 0.42-0.63) for MOUD, 0.76 (95% CI = 0.59-0.96) for residential treatment and 0.21 (95% CI = 0.08-0.55) for both. Results were similar for opioid-related overdose mortality.


CONCLUSIONS
Among people who have undergone medically managed opioid withdrawal, receipt of medications for opioid use disorder, residential treatment or the combination of medications for opioid use disorder and residential treatment were associated with substantially reduced mortality compared with no treatment.","[{'authorId': '5651052', 'name': 'A.

According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners.

76dab3f208957388cd31fa832df0df78cfb73753,"Recently, a growing body of literature has shown the importance of emotions in e-learning processes by pointing out their effect on academic achievement. Nevertheless, within innovative teaching models, the affective-behavioral notion of engagement has been neglected. The aim of the present study is to analyse the experienced emotions by students within different e-learning contexts (chats with teacher, private group discussions, forum threads and content activities) and understand their possible relation with students’ engagement. Our results point out that when e-learners experience positive emotions across synchronous learning activities (chats with teachers and among students) the engagement dimensions of affective relevance and participation significantly increase. Further, we found that negative emotions play a central role during the interactive activities with teacher, as performing these learning tasks can be a first warning of an insufficient preparation. Therefore the study demonstrates the importance for an e-teacher to regulate students’ negative emotions experienced across the e-learning activities, as they can negatively influence both affective and behavioural dimensions of engagement.","[{'authorId': '1393658299', 'name': 'Francesca D’Errico'}, {'authorId': '5532680', 'name': 'M.

76ed6d64e85c17145d8e6065a72ec7a546caa3d4,"Adults and children are spending more time interacting with media and technology and less time participating in activities in nature. This life-style change clearly has ramifications for our physical well-being, but what impact does this change have on cognition? Higher order cognitive functions including selective attention, problem solving, inhibition, and multi-tasking are all heavily utilized in our modern technology-rich society. Attention Restoration Theory (ART) suggests that exposure to nature can restore prefrontal cortex-mediated executive processes such as these. Consistent with ART, research indicates that exposure to natural settings seems to replenish some, lower-level modules of the executive attentional system. However, the impact of nature on higher-level tasks such as creative problem solving has not been explored. Here we show that four days of immersion in nature, and the corresponding disconnection from multi-media and technology, increases performance on a creativity, problem-solving task by a full 50% in a group of naive hikers. Our results demonstrate that there is a cognitive advantage to be realized if we spend time immersed in a natural setting. We anticipate that this advantage comes from an increase in exposure to natural stimuli that are both emotionally positive and low-arousing and a corresponding decrease in exposure to attention demanding technology, which regularly requires that we attend to sudden events, switch amongst tasks, maintain task goals, and inhibit irrelevant actions or cognitions. A limitation of the current research is the inability to determine if the effects are due to an increased exposure to nature, a decreased exposure to technology, or to other factors associated with spending three days immersed in nature.","[{'authorId': '4295633', 'name': 'R.

The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is ‘being there’, often called ‘presence’, the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not ‘there’ and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.","[{'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

This exposure process may be done through actual exposure, with visualization, by imagination or using virtual reality (VR), that provides users with computer simulated environments with and within which they can interact. VR is made possible by the capability of computers to synthesize a 3D graphical environment from numerical data. Furthermore, because input devices sense the subject’s reactions and motions, the computer can modify the synthetic environment accordingly, creating the illusion of interacting with, and thus being immersed within the environment. Starting from 1995, different experimental studies have been conducted in order to investigate the effect of VR exposure in the treatment of subclinical fears and anxiety disorders. This review will discuss their outcome and provide guidelines for the use of VR exposure for the treatment of anxious patients.","[{'authorId': '39777674', 'name': 'A.

Then, the MSIQDE with global optimization ability is used to optimize the parameters of the DBN to construct an optimal DBN model, which is further applied to propose a new fault classification, namely MSIQDE-DBN method. Finally, the vibration data of rolling bearings from the Case Western Reserve University and a real-world engineering application are carried out to verify the performance of the MSIQDE-DBN method. The experimental results show that the MSIQDE takes on better optimization performance, and the MSIQDE-DBN can obtain higher classification accuracy than the other comparison methods.","[{'authorId': '1776017', 'name': 'Wu Deng'}, {'authorId': '49957754', 'name': 'Hailong Liu'}, {'authorId': '46372456', 'name': 'Junjie Xu'}, {'authorId': '47940999', 'name': 'Huimin Zhao'}, {'authorId': '48481679', 'name': 'Yingjie Song'}]",267.0,,31.0,An Improved Quantum-Inspired Differential Evolution Algorithm for Deep Belief Network,2020.0

77809fc3b7f8363aa63208104db5a5ad0aae611c,"How our brain represents our body through the integration of internal and external sensory information so that we can interact with our surrounding environment has become a matter of interest especially in the field of neurorehabilitation. In this regard, there is an increasing interest in the use of multisensory integration techniques—such as the use of body ownership illusions—to modulate distorted body representations after brain damage. In particular, cross-modal illusions such as mirror visual feedback therapy (MVFT) have been widely used for motor rehabilitation. Despite the effectiveness of the MVFT for motor rehabilitation, there are some limitations to fully modify the distorted internal representation of the paretic limb in patients with stroke. A possible explanation for this relies on the physical limitations of the mirror in reproducing upper-limb distortions, which can result in a reduced sense of ownership of the mirrored limb. New digital technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and 360° videos allow researchers to create body ownership illusions by adapting virtual bodies so that they represent specific morphological characteristics including upper-limb distortions. In this manuscript, we present a new rehabilitation approach that employs full virtual body ownership illusions, using a 360° video system, for the assessment and modulation of the internal representation of the affected upper limb in stroke patients. We suggest modifying the internal representation of the upper limb to a normal position before starting motor rehabilitation training.","[{'authorId': '1413274580', 'name': 'Marta Matamala-Gomez'}, {'authorId': '9568293', 'name': 'Clelia Malighetti'}, {'authorId': '1743009', 'name': 'P.

Sadness heightens a person's sensitivity to the potentially harmful consequences of indulgent consumption, which decreases indulgence when a hedonic eating goal is salient. As sadness is often associated with a loss, this protective function is geared toward preventing future losses. The execution of this function is mitigated by feelings of safety, a counterforce to concerns about the harmful consequences of goal pursuit. Alternatively, when a hedonic eating goal is not salient, or a salient goal does not have harmful consequences, sadness results in emotion regulation (i.e., indulging as a means of feeling better). This conceptualization and findings show that the effects of emotions on indulgent consumption can be goal-dependent, and that emotions can aid consumers in the balancing of long-term goals and well-being.","[{'authorId': '48005513', 'name': 'A.

High-status help seekers were expected to be viewed as competent and their request as representing their high motivation to overcome a transient difficulty, resulting in autonomy-oriented help (i.e., tools to solve the problem). Help seeking is viewed as a stigma-consistent behavior that implies weakness when help seekers are low-status individuals and as strength when they are high-status individuals. Three experiments supported these predictions. The 4th experiment indicated that low-status persons who seek autonomy-oriented help are not seen as chronically dependent. Implications of these findings for helping and inequality are discussed.","[{'authorId': '39532519', 'name': 'A.

Previous research examining the influence of incidental negative emotions on brand evaluations has generally found that negative emotions lead to negative evaluations. The current research suggests that for fear, the relationship may be more positive. Since people cope with fear through affiliation with others, in the absence of other individuals, consumers may seek affiliation with an available brand. This, in turn, will enhance emotional attachment to that brand. Four studies demonstrate that consumers who experience fear in the presence of a brand feel greater emotional brand attachment than consumers who experience other emotions such as happiness, sadness, or excitement. The findings from the research advance understanding of consumer-brand relationships by demonstrating that relationships between consumers and brands are not merely metaphorical. Rather, under certain circumstances, brands can actually fulfill interpersonal psychological needs.","[{'authorId': '113538896', 'name': 'Lea H.

Before and after the immersion participants completed questionnaires on perceived emotions (PANAS) and emotion regulation ability (ERQ), and performed verbal ﬂuency tasks (picture description). Results: Preliminary results show that: -This virtual and sensory immersion allows a reduction of participants’ level of anxiety and nega-tive emotions. -this immersion allows an improvement of their verbal ﬂuency. -there are differences in emotion and emotion regulation abilities between patients with and without cognitive impairment. Conclusions: This study showed that an immersive experience combining virtual reality, music and odors is able to reduce anxiety level in patients consulting for the ﬁrst time in a memory center, possibly improving their cognitive performance in cognitive tests. Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by brain glucose hypometabolism. Fat-derived brain fuels such ketones (acetoacetate) have been proposed as an alternative fuel to compen-sate for the brain energy deﬁcit widely observed in AD. We have developed brain ketone PET neuroimaging to assess brain energy supply in AD. We report here two strategies that could be effective ways to improve brain energy supply, both of which stimulate brain ketone metabolism. Methods: Participants with mild AD (72 6 8 y) were offered the opportunity to participate in a study that provided either a ketogenic supplement (providing 30 g/day of medium chain triglycerides) for one month (N ¼ 6; in progress), or a supervised physical exercise program involving walking on a treadmill (15-40 minutes per session, 3 days/week) for 3 months (N ¼ 10). Quan-titative measurement of brain uptake of glucose (CMRglu) and acetoacetate (CMRacac) using PETand MR imaging were done before and at the end of the two interventions. Results: Compared to base-line, plasma acetoacetate increased by 158% in the ketogenic supplement group and by 146% in the Walking group (both p < 0.05). Post-intervention, global and regional CMRacac increased by 2-3 fold in both groups (all p < 0.05), whereas global and regional CMRglu remained unchanged (all p (cid:2) 0.10). Of note, the blood-to-brain acetoacetate inﬂux rate constant increased by 66% ( p ¼ 0.03) only in the Walking group. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that individual lifestyle interventions such as a ketogenic supplement or a supervised walking program improve brain ketone metabolism while maintaining brain glucose metabolism in mild AD. These results demonstrate the utility of brain ketone and glucose PET to assess interventions that may improve brain energy supply. These two strategies suggest a potential complementarity of combining both a ketogenic and physical activity intervention to optimize brain energy since the ketogenic supplement increased brain ketone availability while the physical exercise both plasma ketones and the brain’s capacity to take up ketones.

Little research has examined how these skills develop after early childhood and how they may be trained. We tested the hypothesis that experience in acting, an activity in which one must step into the shoes of others, leads to growth in both empathy and theory of mind. In two studies, we followed children (elementary school aged) and adolescents (high school freshmen) receiving 1 year of either acting or other arts training (visual arts, music) and assessed empathy and theory of mind before and after training. In both studies, those receiving acting (but not other arts) training showed significant gains in empathy scores; in Study 2, adolescents receiving acting training also showed significant gains on a naturalistic measure of theory of mind, the Empathic Accuracy Paradigm. These findings demonstrate plasticity in empathy and theory of mind long past the watershed age of 3 to 4 years and suggest that both capacities are enhanced by role-playing.","[{'authorId': '3374865', 'name': 'T.

In such situations, a psychologist might recommend a program of exposure therapy in order to help break the pattern of avoidance and fear. In this form of therapy, psychologists create a safe environment in which to ""expose"" individuals to the things they fear and avoid.

The purpose of this review is to configure primarily qualitative and mixed methods findings from studies meeting our selection and quality criterion to answer the review question: How do robotic construction kits function as computational manipulatives in P–12 STEM education? Our synthesis of the literature has resulted in four key insights that are new to the field. First, RCKs have a unique double application: They may be used for direct instruction in robotics (first-order uses) or as analogical tools for learning in other domains (second-order uses). Second, RCKs make possible additional routes to learning through the provision of immediate feedback and the dual modes of representation unique to RCKs. Third, RCKs support a computational thinking learning progression beginning with a lower anchor of sequencing and finishing with a high anchor of systems thinking. And fourth, RCKs support evolving problem-solving abilities along a continuum, ranging from trial and error to heuristic methods associated with robotics study. Furthermore, our synthesis provides insight into the second-order (analogical) uses of RCKs as computational manipulatives in the disciplines of physics and biology. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.

78a1686d3898c5923c3d3e0606996b22a3c4a159,"Milton Erickson, MD, who has been practicing clinical hypnosis for more than 50 years, is widely considered the leading clinician and innovator in modern medical hypnosis. Although he has published extensively, many clinicans and researchers continue to have difficulty understanding Erickson's techniques and the process in which he involves his subjects as he conducts hypnosis. Hypnotic Realities is a wellwritten, practical book that clarifies and illustrates many, if not most, of the numerous induction techniques that Erickson uses. Secondarily, it provides further elaboration of the variables that Erickson considers to constitute the hypnotic process. Erickson is foremost a skilled psychotherapist who attempts to understand and appreciate how his subjects think and how their capacity to dissociate can be influenced through his alliance with them. Hypnotic Realities, which is accompanied by a 1-hour cassette tape recording in which some of the book's material is recorded verbatim, is a book mostly about the induction of hypnotic states and the deepening of the trance experience. The transcript of the trance training of eight subjects is presented. I found that the cassette tape was not particularly useful and added unnecessarily to the expense of the book. Throughout the book Ernest Rossi and Erickson have an ongoing dialogue clarifying the process in which Erickson is engaging with his subjects. The book is well organized with an extensive explanation of the goals Erickson is trying to achieve. Milton Erickson is uniquely creative in his approaches to initiating hypnotic states in his subjects. Through his subtly orchestrated sentences, phrases, and speech modulations he creates a receptive-accepting alliance, which allows his subjects to experience their inner world. His conceptualizations to his subjects are concise and simple. The indirectness of his various suggestions and maneuvers greatly augment and further his subjects' trance experience. He is skilled at utilizing trance logic, an intuitive logic that deals more with inductive reasoning than with deductive reasoning. This sometimes makes more sense to the actual subject than to someone reading about what Erickson does and is possibly one of the reasons that he has been criticized. Hypnotic Realities should have a broad appeal to all who are interested in the process of hypnosis.","[{'authorId': '74904027', 'name': 'M. Erickson'}, {'authorId': '3475672', 'name': 'E.

The cause of motion sickness, and especially the reason behind its variability across observers has remained unclear. According to the most popular theory, motion sickness is caused by sensory cue conflicts, known as the evolutionary hypothesis. Our prior work indicates considerable individual variability in observer’s sensitivity to cues that specify 3D motion. If cue conflicts are the cause of motion sickness, people who are particularly sensitive to these cues should be more susceptible. In a large sample of individuals, we related the propensity for motion sickness to sensitivity to multiple 3D motion cues. As hypothesized, propensity for motion sickness was predicted by cue sensitivity, but this relationship was specific to visual motion parallax cues. We also determined that, by tailoring the interpupillary distance of the device to the individual observer, excluded other explanations, including inherent sex differences in VR tolerance. Lastly, we found that observers self-regulate motion sickness through suppression of head movement. These results identify the cause of motion sickness in VR, and suggest that sickness may be eliminated by targeted reduction of cue conflicts due to motion parallax.","[{'authorId': '3063507', 'name': 'Jacqueline M.

Ground truth was defined based on the median arousal and valence scores given to clips in a preliminary study. The arousal classes were calm, medium aroused and activated and the valence classes were unpleasant, neutral and pleasant. A one-participant-out cross validation was employed to evaluate the classification performance in a user-independent approach. The best classification accuracy of 68.5% for three labels of valence and 76.4% for three labels of arousal were obtained using a modality fusion strategy and a support vector machine.

Emotion recognition from EEG signals has facilitated to impaired peoples to intact with real world. Multi-components EEG signal need to decomposed into set of components to extract the hidden information, empirical selection of decomposition parameters can lead to loss of information due to mode mixing, generation of noisy modes, poor signal synthesis, etc. In this paper, optimized variational mode decomposition is proposed for emotion recognition using single-channel EEG signals. The Eigenvector centrality method (EVCM) is employed for dominant channel selection. An optimum number of modes ( ${K}_{\textit {opt}}$ ) and penalty factor ( $\alpha _{\textit {opt}}$ ) are selected adaptively for decomposition of non-stationary EEG signals. Time-domain features are elicited from the modes of EEG signals. The posthoc analysis are employed for significant features selection, these features are used as input to different classifiers for emotion classification. The overall accuracy of 97.24% is achieved with an extreme learning machine classifier for a four emotion classification. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by five performance parameters. F-1 score, false-positive rate, Mathew’s correlation coefficient, and Cohen’s Kappa of 0.9454, 0.94%, 92.92%, and 0.9633 is obtained.

In recent years, a considerable number of publications have appeared on different aspects of virtual reality exposure therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The purpose of the present article is to review the evidence that has emerged to support the potential of this therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders.


RECENT FINDINGS
Case histories and open comparative studies, as well as randomized controlled studies, have been published on the use of virtual reality exposure therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Most studies in the field have been on specific phobias, in particular on fear of flying, acrophobia, fear of driving, claustrophobia and fear of spiders. In addition, several studies have been published on the use of virtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

Within face‐responsive regions, emotional faces evoke stronger responses than neutral faces (“valence effect”). We used fMRI and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to test the hypothesis that emotional faces differentially alter the functional coupling among face‐responsive regions. Three monkeys viewed conspecific faces with neutral, threatening, fearful, and appeasing expressions. Using Bayesian model selection, various models of neural interactions between the posterior (TEO) and anterior (TE) portions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the amygdala, the orbitofrontal (OFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) were tested. The valence effect was mediated by feedback connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO, and feedback connections from VLPFC to the amygdala and TE. Emotional faces were associated with differential effective connectivity: Fearful faces evoked stronger modulations in the connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO; threatening faces evoked weaker modulations in the connections from the amygdala and VLPFC to TE; and appeasing faces evoked weaker modulations in the connection from VLPFC to the amygdala. Our results suggest dynamic alterations in neural coupling during the perception of behaviorally relevant facial expressions that are vital for social communication.","[{'authorId': '143881179', 'name': 'Ning Liu'}, {'authorId': '1402123088', 'name': 'F.

The study started from the theoretical assumption that police officers, through institutional actions, can be endowed with self-regulatory capacities that allow them to understand and manage aggressiveness, preventing aversive behavior. The study focused specifically on the reality of the Military Police of the Federal District. The methodological course involved the search for books and scientific articles related to self-management of aggression in journals and virtual libraries. The study adopted the assumption that police training and the daily situations to which they are subjected must be counterbalanced by institutional initiatives that allow the maintenance of evaluative and decision-making capacities in adverse situations, through the promotion and development of competences, abilities and skills of self-regulation of the aggressiveness.

Studies have shown that virtual reality (VR) can trigger stronger and more specific emotional reactivity in users than other visual/audio media. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) usually suffer from social impairments, such as challenges in emotion perception and emotion expression. A smart VR eHealth system that carefully triggers specific emotional reactions and detects the patterns in children with ASD can help with early screening, intervention, and emotional regulation. This paper proposes a VR gaming system that makes use of psychophysiological sensor signals, in-game performance and responses, stressor mini-games to detect different emotional reactivity patterns, and dynamically changes the game scene according to the current emotional status. This is a framework of a long-term study, where the ultimate goal is to develop a VR system with real-time feedback to assist early screening and diagnosis of ASD.","[{'authorId': '2141346242', 'name': 'Estephanos Mekbib'}, {'authorId': '2151496447', 'name': 'Yan Huang'}, {'authorId': '2056242624', 'name': 'Chao Mei'}, {'authorId': '2153684333', 'name': 'Y.

Methods: 34 male residents were observed for 12 months before and after opening the garden. Behaviors were assessed using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory Short Form (CMAI), incident reports, as needed medications (pro re nata [PRN]), and surveys of staff and residents' family members as indices of affect. Results: Final CMAI scores and total PRNs employed were lower than baseline values with a trend for residents who used the garden more often to have less agitated behavior. Verbal inappropriate behaviors did not change significantly whereas physical incidents increased. Staff and family members felt that the wander garden decreased inappropriate behaviors and improved mood and quality of life of the dementia residents. Conclusions: Study design characteristics and garden management may have affected behaviors both positively and negatively.

Behavioural activation has attracted increased interest in recent years. It has been over 5 years since our meta-analyses summarised the evidence supporting and this systematic review updates those findings and examines moderators of treatment effect. Method Randomised trials of behavioural activation for depression versus controls or anti-depressant medication were identified using electronic database searches, previous reviews and reference lists. Data on symptom level and study level moderators were extracted and analysed using meta-analysis, sub-group analysis and meta-regression respectively. Results Twenty six randomised controlled trials including 1524 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. A random effects meta-analysis of symptom level post treatment showed behavioural activation to be superior to controls (SMD −0.74 CI −0.91 to −0.56, k = 25, N = 1088) and medication (SMD −0.42 CI −0.83 to-0.00, k = 4, N = 283). Study quality was low in the majority of studies and follow- up time periods short. There was no indication of publication bias and subgroup analysis showed limited association between moderators and effect size.

We combine these data sources to predict elementary students’ success within the system as well as components of their math identity as measured though a standardized survey. Data from 147 students was examined longitudinally over a year of study. The results indicated links between math success and non-cognitive measures of math identity. Additionally, the results indicate that math identity was strongly predicted by click-stream variables and the production of more lexically sophisticated and cohesive language. In addition, significant variance in math identity was explained by affective and cognitive variables.

The contingencies with related aspects (such as comprehension, recollection and appreciation of the simulated environment) were investigated as well. Based on a comprehensive conceptual framework, a set of scales measuring relevant cognitive and affective aspects was employed. Main results are that simulations were perceived as valid and acceptable, that appraisals differ according to lighting and time-of-day conditions, and that provision of sound enhances the perceived quality of presentations.

7d71380b2dd811fc8fb494917c1e84300f9a4668,"BACKGROUND
Dementia is a progressive global cognitive impairment syndrome. In 2010, more than 35 million people worldwide were estimated to be living with dementia. Some people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to dementia but others remain stable or recover full function. There is great interest in finding good predictors of dementia in people with MCI. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the best-known and the most often used short screening tool for providing an overall measure of cognitive impairment in clinical, research and community settings.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the MMSE at various thresholds for detecting individuals with baseline MCI who would clinically convert to dementia in general, Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow-up.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register of diagnostic and intervention studies (inception to May 2014); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to May 2014); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to May 2014); BIOSIS (Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); Web of Science Core Collection, including the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (inception to May 2014), and LILACS (BIREME) (1982 to May 2014). We also searched specialized sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews, most recently in May 2014: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven, www.mediondatabase.nl), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, via the Cochrane Library), HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database, via the Cochrane Library), and ARIF (University of Birmingham, UK, www.arif.bham.ac.uk). No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used as a method to restrict the search overall so as to maximize sensitivity. We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, tracked citations in Scopus and Science Citation Index, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on MMSE for dementia diagnosis to try to locate possibly relevant but unpublished data.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We considered longitudinal studies in which results of the MMSE administered to MCI participants at baseline were obtained and the reference standard was obtained by follow-up over time. We included participants recruited and clinically classified as individuals with MCI under Petersen and revised Petersen criteria, Matthews criteria, or a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. We used acceptable and commonly used reference standards for dementia in general, Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. We assessed the identified full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create two by two tables for dementia in general and other dementias. Two authors independently performed quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Due to high heterogeneity and scarcity of data, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic curve.


MAIN RESULTS
In this review, we included 11 heterogeneous studies with a total number of 1569 MCI patients followed for conversion to dementia. Four studies assessed the role of baseline scores of the MMSE in conversion from MCI to all-cause dementia and eight studies assessed this test in conversion from MCI to Alzheimer´s disease dementia. Only one study provided information about the MMSE and conversion from MCI to vascular dementia. For conversion from MCI to dementia in general, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 23% to 76% and specificities from 40% to 94%. In relationship to conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 27% to 89% and specificities from 32% to 90%. Only one study provided information about conversion from MCI to vascular dementia, presenting a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 80% with an incidence of vascular dementia of 6.2%. Although we had planned to explore possible sources of heterogeneity, this was not undertaken due to the scarcity of studies included in our analysis.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Our review did not find evidence supporting a substantial role of MMSE as a stand-alone single-administration test in the identification of MCI patients who could develop dementia. Clinicians could prefer to request additional and extensive tests to be sure about the management of these patients. An important aspect to assess in future updates is if conversion to dementia from MCI stages could be predicted better by MMSE changes over time instead of single measurements. It is also important to assess if a set of tests, rather than an isolated one, may be more successful in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia.","[{'authorId': '1398752242', 'name': 'I.

Interview data from 28 teachers were examined by coding utterances on teacher and student interactions. Results indicate that teachers defined the quality of the relationship mostly by the level of communion (friendly vs. hostile), instead of by the level of agency (in control vs. powerless). Analyses of mentioned teacher and student behavior show a friendly interactional pattern for positive relationships and a hostile pattern for problematic ones. In teachers' perceptions, positive and problematic relationships also differed in context where encounters take place and topic of talk. Contrary to interactions in problematic relationships, encounters in positive relationships were mostly situated outside the classroom context and conversations during these encounters covered a wide range of topics. Implications for teacher education programs are discussed.","[{'authorId': '153657563', 'name': 'Luce C. A.

A number of his conclusions have been overturned: youth and modest aspirations no longer are seen as prerequisites of SWB. E. Diener's (1984) review placed greater emphasis on theories that stressed psychological factors. In the current article, the authors review current evidence for Wilson's conclusions and discuss modern theories of SWB that stress dispositional influences, adaptation, goals, and coping strategies. The next steps in the evolution of the field are to comprehend the interaction of psychological factors with life circumstances in producing SWB, to understand the causal pathways leading to happiness, understand the processes underlying adaptation to events, and develop theories that explain why certain variables differentially influence the different components of SWV (life satisfaction, pleasant affect, and unpleasant affect).","[{'authorId': '66813148', 'name': 'E.

Both groups revealed significant progress in a range of anxiety, avoidance and behavi our measurements when confronted with virtual as well as real height circumstances. Despite VR participants experiencing considerably shorter treatment times than the real -world subjects, significant improvements were recorded on the Behavioural Avoidance Test, the Attitudes Toward Heights Questionnaire and the Acrophobia Questionnaire.

Methods: The system integrates a 64-channel dry EEG form factor with wireless data streaming for online analysis. A real-time software framework is applied, including adaptive artifact rejection, cortical source localization, multivariate effective connectivity inference, data visualization, and cognitive state classification from connectivity features using a constrained logistic regression approach (ProxConn). We evaluate the system identification methods on simulated 64-channel EEG data. Then, we evaluate system performance, using ProxConn and a benchmark ERP method, in classifying response errors in nine subjects using the dry EEG system. Results: Simulations yielded high accuracy (AUC = 0.97 ± 0.021) for real-time cortical connectivity estimation. Response error classification using cortical effective connectivity [short-time directdirected transfer function (sdDTF)] was significantly above chance with similar performance (AUC) for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.09) and LCMV (0.72 ± 0.08) source localization. Cortical ERPbased classification was equivalent to ProxConn for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.16) butsignificantlybetterforLCMV (0.82 ± 0.12). Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility for real-time cortical connectivity analysis and cognitive state classification from highdensity wearable dry EEG. Significance: This paper is the first validated application of these methods to 64-channel dry EEG. This study addresses a need for robust real-time measurement and interpretation of complex brain activity in the dynamic environment of the wearable setting. Such advances can have broad impact in research, medicine, and brain-computer interfaces.

While most authors focus on frontal electrode pairs (e.g., F3/F4 or F7/F8), several recent studies have indicated that EEG asymmetries can also be observed outside the frontal lobe and in frequency bands other than alpha. Because the focus of most EEG asymmetry research is on the correlations between asymmetry and other traits, much less is known about the distribution of patterns of asymmetry at the population level. To systematically assess these asymmetries in a representative sample, we determined EEG asymmetries across the head in the alpha, beta, delta and theta frequency bands in 235 healthy adults. We found significant asymmetries in all four frequency bands and across several brain areas, indicating that EEG asymmetries are not limited to frontal alpha. Asymmetries were not modulated by sex. They were modulated by direction of hand preference, with stronger right-handedness predicting greater right (relative to left) alpha power, or greater left (relative to right) activity. Taken together, the present results show that EEG asymmetries other than frontal alpha represent markers of asymmetric brain function that should be explored further.","[{'authorId': '1940521', 'name': 'S.

In general, depression is treated with antidepressant drugs, and usually assisted by non-medication treatments, such as psychotherapy and physical therapy. Due to their expensive and time-consuming nature, these therapy sessions often ended with patients losing motivation to continue, and results unsatisfied recovery progress. In addition, both psychotherapy and physical therapy are highly human intensive. Thus, a novel neurofeedback game framework, which supports depression rehabilitation may provide new opportunities. In this paper, we present a new Virtual-Reality based neurofeedback game framework for depression rehabilitation, which would increase patients' motivation for therapy, and lower the cost for both patients and therapists. In our framework, patients' EEG data are pervasively recorded using an innovative three-electrode EEG collector. Then the data are processed and calculated into feedback features, and finally represented back to patients through Virtual-Reality games in real-time.

A sequential series of 18 children and adults aged 4.4 to 21.5 years (mean 12.2 years) with clinically diagnosed ASD of varying severity used the BPAS. Users and caregivers were interviewed about perceived negative effects and design concerns. Most users were able to wear and use the BPAS (n=16/18, 89%), with most of them reporting no negative effects (n=14/16, 87.5%). Two users reported temporary negative effects: eye strain, dizziness, and nasal discomfort. Caregivers observed no negative effects in users (n=16/16, 100%). Most users (77.8%) and caregivers (88.9%) had no design concerns.

However, this body of research has only rarely been integrated and critically evaluated and the prospects for the reliable pharmacological manipulation of hypnotic suggestibility remain poorly understood. Here we draw on pharmacological, genotyping, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological research to synthesize current knowledge regarding the potential role of multiple widely-studied neurochemicals in response to suggestion. Although we reveal multiple limitations with this body of evidence, we identify converging results implicating different neurochemical systems in response to hypnotic suggestion. We conclude by assessing the extent to which different results align or diverge and outline multiple avenues for future research. Elucidating the neurochemical systems underlying response to suggestion has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of suggestion.","[{'authorId': '47388227', 'name': 'D.

Previous research has suggested that emotional regulation (ER) and emotional dysregulation (ED) may be factors which are correlated with symptom severity and maintenance of TR-PTSD. This embedded mixed-methods pilot study (n = 9) sought to explore the impact of 3MDR on ER and ED of MMs and veterans. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS-18) data were collected at baseline, prior to each session, and at one week, one month, and three months postintervention and analyzed. Qualitative data collected from sessions, debriefs, and follow-up interviews were transcribed and descriptively analyzed. Results demonstrated statistically significant decreases in DERS-18 scores from preintervention to postintervention at each timepoint. Qualitatively, participants perceived improvements in ER within specified DERS-18 domains. We describe how 3MDR’s unique and novel approach addresses ED through cognitive–motor stimulation, narration, divergent thinking, reappraisal of aversive stimuli, dual-task processing, and reconsolidation of traumatic memories.

80614632d4b8be36ffa6cab129db1da0d87f8189,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD), commonly referred to social phobia, is one of the most an immense and unreasonable fear of social interaction. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the most thoroughly studied nonpharmacologic approach to the treatment of SAD patients. In CBT, patients are gradually, in vivo, exposed to anxiety-provoking real-life situations until habituation occurs and patients’ fear dissipates. Although effective for most patients, there are some clear limitations: some specific and required social situations are difficult to arrange due to unpredictability and possibly short duration of these naturally occurring social interactions, the therapist has limited control over anxiety provoking elements during the exposure, and individuals with social phobia have high refusal rate for in vivo exposure to the dreaded and fearful social situation. Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) has been suggested as an alternative to overcome many shortcomings of in vivo exposure. Contrary to exposure in vivo, in a VRET system the therapist can manipulate the exposure elements in a safer, manageable and cost-effective way. A VRET system presents fear eliciting stimuli to the patient in a Virtual Reality environment where the parameters of its anxiety evoking stimuli can be easily gradually manipulated by a therapist. The state of the art and recent enhancement of Internet and VR technology seems to be able to meet the ever-increasing demand for more accessibility and efficiency of mental healthcare services by bringing the VRET system directly at patient’s home. This thesis presents the development and evaluation of such an envisioned home-based VRET system for SAD patients. The blue-print of the envisioned system design entails several key elements that need to be established. All those key elements were investigated and evaluated empirically in three separated studies followed up by a feasibility study. The first key element identified, is the system’s ability to measure the patient’s anxiety level automatically. Traditionally in VRET this is done using self-reported anxiety measurements, where patients are asked to report their anxiety every four or five minutes. Without the direct involvement of a therapist, it is up to the system to determine the appropriate timing, therefore, the timing is a crucial element. An empirical study involving 24 participants investigated the effects of three different types of automatic self-reported anxiety timing mechanisms (dialogue dependent, speech dependent and context independent). The results showed that the participants preferred a dialogue dependent timing mechanism above speech dependent or timing dependent mechanism, since it was considered as less interruptive. Moreover, the study also confirmed the needs for an accurate automatic self-reported anxiety timing mechanisms, as it could affect people’s experience and their behaviour in a dialogue with virtual human. The second key element is the system’s ability to elicit and control the anxiety evoking stimuli within the social scene. This was investigated in two successive empirical studies. The first study investigated whether an exposure to various virtual social scenarios was associated with different levels of anxiety. The 24 participants were exposed to a free-speech dialogue interaction with a virtual character in a neutral world, blind date and job interview setting. The results showed that the participants’ level of anxiety increased significantly from the neutral world, the blind date to the job interview. This indicates that various virtual social scenarios are indeed able to evoke different levels of anxiety. The second study investigated anxiety control within a dialogue in VRET system. For this, the study assessed the association between the ratio of negative and positive dialogue responses made by a virtual character and individual’s level of anxiety. Twenty-four participants were exposed to two different experimental conditions: a positive, and a negative virtual job interview condition. In the positive condition, in the course of time the number of positive responses from the virtual character increased while negative responses decreased. In the negative condition, the opposite happened. The results showed that the manipulation of the dialogue style in both conditions had a significant effect on people’s level of anxiety, their attitude, their speech behaviour, their dialogue experiences, their own emotion, and how they perceived the emotion of the virtual human. These finding demonstrate that social dialogues in a virtual environment can be manipulated for therapeutic purposes effectively. The third key element of the envisioned system is the possibility to introduce autonomous anxiety regulation. Traditionally, in the clinic a therapist tries to regulate the patients’ anxiety. However, in a home situation, a system would have to do this regulation automatically. A third empirical study was conducted to investigate and evaluate the ability and effectiveness of an automatic feedback-loop regulation mechanism for maintaining individual’s anxiety on a predefined target level. A group of 24 participants were exposed into two different system response conditions: a static and a dynamic condition. In the static condition participants were exposed to a static set of virtual reality stressors while in the dynamic condition they were exposed to a set of virtual reality stressors that changed dynamically aiming at keeping the anxiety of the participants at stable level. In the static condition, the anxiety dropped as indicated by decreased self-reported anxiety, decreased heart rate, increased heart rate variability, and longer answers. In contrary, in the dynamic condition, the participant’s anxiety level was maintained around a pre-set anxiety reference level. Therefore, the findings demonstrate that individuals’ level of anxiety can be regulated automatically using an automatic feedback-loop mechanism. Besides those three important key elements of the system design blue-print, the envisioned system also has a number of practical and important elements such as the development of a virtual health agent, the therapist application, and a secure remote database server. Together these elements lay the foundation for a home-based VRET system. To evaluate the feasibility of such proposed system to treat people with SAD at home, an empirical study was conducted. The home-based VRET system was evaluated with a group of five social anxiety disorder patients. All patients received a complete home-based VRET system and were scheduled to perform 10 treatment sessions at home. The study findings showed that the proposed system could evoke the required anxiety, as expected, which over time dropped as patients’ self-reported anxiety and heart rate gradually decreased during the exposure sessions. To conclude, this thesis argues that the proposed home-based VRET system could evoke the required anxiety in patients with substantial level of presence. By meeting the above mentioned key challenges of our study, we showed that an effective home-based VRET system can be built and provided in due course. Therefore, this finding suggests that delivering a home-based VRET system is indeed possible, which could provide numerous benefits for both patients and therapists.","[{'authorId': '2255068550', 'name': 'Tim van der Hagen'}, {'authorId': '2255246438', 'name': 'Dwi Hartanto'}]",2.0,,149.0,Computer-Based Social Anxiety Regulation in Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy,2019.0

The present study investigated whether VR scenarios that were developed for contamination concerns evoke anxiety, disgust, and the urge to wash in individuals with high (n = 33) and low (n = 33) contamination fear. In addition, the feasibility of VR exposure in inducing disgust was examined through testing the mediator role of disgust in the relationship between contamination anxiety and the urge to wash. Participants were immersed in virtual scenarios with varying degrees of dirtiness and rated their level of anxiety, disgust, and the urge to wash after performing the virtual tasks. Data were collected between September and December 2019. The participants with high contamination fear reported higher contamination-related ratings than those with low contamination fear. The significant main effect of dirtiness indicated that anxiety and disgust levels increased with increasing overall dirtiness of the virtual scenarios in both high and low contamination fear groups. Moreover, disgust elicited by VR mediated the relationship between contamination fear and the urge to wash. The findings demonstrated the feasibility of VR in eliciting emotional responses that are necessary for conducting exposure in individuals with high contamination fear. In conclusion, VR can be used as an alternative exposure tool in the treatment of contamination-based OCD.","[{'authorId': '6365978', 'name': 'Mujgan Inozu'}, {'authorId': '3045902', 'name': 'U.

Methods: A controlled study involving 18 agoraphobic participants assigned to two groups: VRET only and VRET with cognitive therapy. Nine specific virtual environments were developed using an affordable game level editor. Results: Questionnaires, behavioural tests and physiological measures indicated a positive effect of VRET. Correlations supported the predictive value of presence towards treatment outcome. The addition of cognitive therapy did not provide significant additional benefit. Conclusions: Overall, the isolated effects of VRET did not seem to be significantly less than the effects of VRET combined with cognitive therapy. Future research should explore the use of other components in addition to cognitive therapy and VRET for agoraphobia as well as its possible use in patients’ homes.","[{'authorId': '47667468', 'name': 'E.

To explore the potential of immersive virtual reality (VR) in this respect, we conducted a semi-structured interview study (N = 22) among children aged 6–13 years. This study consisted of two parts: (1) a VR experience and (2) a semi-structured interview to investigate (1) to what extent children are able to recall and understand information about the impact of food products on their health and the environment when provided to them as pop-ups in a VR supermarket; (2) what rational and emotional processes are triggered by this information; and (3) what children’s expectations about the real-life application and impact of the pop-ups are, and why. Interview data were analysed using the framework method. Results showed that although all participants were able to recall the information, only children from an average age of ten years old also understood the information. When participants understood the information, they were often aware of and felt sorry for their negative behavioural impact. Most participants expected their behaviour to positively change when imagining real-life application of the pop-ups.","[{'authorId': '6721122', 'name': 'E.

Based on these features, six classifiers were used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Nearest Mean (NM), K-Nearest Neighborhood (K-NN), 1-Nearest Neighborhood (1-NN), FLD and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). They classified emotions in two classes (low and high) through arousal, valence and liking dimensions. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method has been implemented to evaluate the performance of classifiers. To enhance the accuracy of classification, combination at feature and classifier levels were performed. Via the concatenation method, combination at feature level was done. Then, by Majority voting, Fixed and Stacking algorithms, combination at classifier level were implemented.

Results indicate that despite the significant direct effect between the two emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression) on emotional exhaustion, both strategies failed to show a mediating effect between perceived student misbehaviour and emotional exhaustion. However, teacher efficacy in handling student misbehaviour was found to mediate the relationship between perceived student misbehaviour and emotional exhaustion.

This preliminary study endeavored to evaluate the use of virtual reality (VR) enhanced exposure therapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) consequent to the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001.


METHOD
Participants were assigned to a VR treatment (N = 13) or a waitlist control (N = 8) group and were mostly middle-aged, male disaster workers. All participants were diagnosed with PTSD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). The study was conducted between February 2002 and August 2005 in offices located in outpatient buildings of a hospital campus.


RESULTS
Analysis of variance showed a significant interaction of time by group (p < .01) on CAPS scores, with a between-groups posttreatment effect size of 1.54. The VR group showed a significant decline in CAPS scores compared with the waitlist group (p < .01).

In academic achievement, student engagement is considered a prime factor to enhance motivation among students. Student engagement is a constructive approach that refers to the level of concentration, inquisitiveness, and enthusiasm that students demonstrate when they learn. The study aims to elucidate the development of a three-dimensional construct of student engagement based on psycho-education oriented measures such as behavioural, cognitive and emotional engagement. Data from 470 students studying in science, humanities, and engineering streams from different universities of Punjab, was collected via random sampling technique. The factor analysis of the scale reveals that 31 items had three factors, behavioural, cognitive, and affective engagement. Good internal reliability (????=0.889) and adequate convergent and discriminant validities are reported, which establishes good psychometric properties of the scale.

We adopt ubiquitous hardware available in most computer systems, namely, webcam and mouse. Information from multiple input modalities is fused together for effective human attention detection. We invite human subjects to carry out experiments in reading articles when being imposed upon different kinds of distraction to induce them into different levels of attention. Machine-learning techniques are applied to identify useful features to recognize human attention level by building up user-independent models. Our result indicate performance improvement with multimodal inputs from webcam and mouse over that of a single device. We believe that our work has revealed and intersting affective computing direction with potential application in e-learning.","[{'authorId': '2109045012', 'name': 'Jiajia Li'}, {'authorId': '1706729', 'name': 'G.

This type of approach is used to identify the behavior of an individual in different fields, such as medicine, education, psychology, etc., in order to assess the effect that the content has on the individual that is interacting with it. This article shows a systematic review of articles that report studies on emotion recognition with physiological signals and video games, between January 2010 and April 2016. We searched in eight databases, and found 15 articles that met the selection criteria. With this systematic review, we found that the use of video games as emotion stimulation tools has become an innovative field of study, due to their potential to involve stories and multimedia tools that can interact directly with the person in fields like rehabilitation. We detected clear examples where video games and physiological signal measurement became an important approach in rehabilitation processes, for example, in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatments.","[{'authorId': '1404849943', 'name': 'M.

Whereas past work has focused on material and emotional costs of empathy, here, we examined whether people experience empathy as cognitively taxing and costly, leading them to avoid it. We developed the empathy selection task, which uses free choices to assess the desire to empathize. Participants make a series of binary choices, selecting situations that lead them to engage in empathy or an alternative course of action. In each of 11 studies (N = 1,204) and a meta-analysis, we found a robust preference to avoid empathy, which was associated with perceptions of empathy as more effortful and aversive and less efficacious. Experimentally increasing empathy efficacy eliminated empathy avoidance, suggesting that cognitive costs directly cause empathy choice. When given the choice to share others' feelings, people act as if it is not worth the effort. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).","[{'authorId': '2195291560', 'name': 'C.

This detector combines the acquisition of traditional physiological signals, namely, galvanic skin response, heart rate, and electromyogram, and the use of supervised classification techniques by means of Gaussian processes. It aims at detecting the emotional impact of a video clip in a new way by first identifying emotional events in the affective stream (fast increase of the subject excitation) and then by giving the associated binary valence (positive or negative) of each detected event. The study was conducted to be as close as possible to realistic conditions by especially minimizing the use of active calibrations and considering on-the-fly detection. Furthermore, the influence of each physiological modality is evaluated through three different key-scenarios (mono-user, multi-user and extended multi-user) that may be relevant for consumer applications. A complete description of the experimental protocol and processing steps is given. The performances of the detector are evaluated on manually labeled sequences, and its robustness is discussed considering the different single and multi-user contexts.","[{'authorId': '143728351', 'name': 'J.

As teachers’ empathic abilities increase, it seems likely that they would be better able to understand and respond appropriately to their students. Teachers’ perspective‐taking was positively associated with their positive perceptions of student–peer relations, school norms and educational opportunities. Teachers’ personal distress was negatively related to student–peer relations. Empathy was unrelated to student–teacher relations.

This opens up lines for EEG to provide more information about brain activity in everyday life, rather than in a laboratory setting. To take advantage of the technological advances that have allowed for this, we introduce the Brain-EE system, a method for evaluating user engaged enjoyment that uses a commercially available EEG tool (Muse). During testing, fifteen participants engaged in two tasks (playing two different video games via tablet), and their EEG data were recorded. The Brain-EE system supported much of the previous literature on enjoyment; increases in frontal theta activity strongly and reliably predicted which game each individual participant preferred.

 Immersive virtual reality (IVR) presents new possibilities for application in health care. Health care professionals can now immerse their patients in environments to achieve exposure to a specific scene or experience, evoke targeted emotional responses, inspire, or distract from an experience occurring in reality.
 
 
 
 This review aimed to identify patient-focused applications for head-mounted IVR for acute treatment of health conditions and determine the technical specifications of the systems used.
 
 
 
 A systematic review was conducted by searching medical and engineering peer-reviewed literature databases in 2018. The databases included PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Association for Computing Machinery, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Scopus, and Web of Science. Search terms relating to health and IVR were used. To be included, studies had to investigate the effectiveness of IVR for acute treatment of a specific health condition. IVR was defined as a head-mounted platform that provides virtual and auditory immersion for the participant and includes a minimum of 3 degrees of orientation tracking. Once identified, data were extracted from articles and aggregated in a narrative review format.
 
 
 
 A total of 58 studies were conducted in 19 countries. The studies reported IVR use for 5 main clinical areas: neurological and development (n=10), pain reduction through distraction (n=20), exposure therapy for phobias (n=9), psychological applications (n=14), and others (n=5). Studies were primarily feasibility studies exploring systems and general user acceptance (n=29) and efficacy studies testing clinical effect (n=28).
 
 
 
 IVR has a promising future in health care, both in research and commercial realms. As many of the studies examined are still exploring the feasibility of IVR for acute treatment of health conditions, evidence for the effectiveness of IVR is still developing.

Several theoreticians have suggested that our own body serves as a fundamental reference in visual perception of sizes and distances, although compelling experimental evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. In contrast, modern textbooks typically explain the perception of object size and distance by the combination of information from different visual cues. Here, we describe full body illusions in which subjects experience the ownership of a doll's body (80 cm or 30 cm) and a giant's body (400 cm) and use these as tools to demonstrate that the size of one's sensed own body directly influences the perception of object size and distance. These effects were quantified in ten separate experiments with complementary verbal, questionnaire, manual, walking, and physiological measures. When participants experienced the tiny body as their own, they perceived objects to be larger and farther away, and when they experienced the large-body illusion, they perceived objects to be smaller and nearer. Importantly, despite identical retinal input, this ""body size effect"" was greater when the participants experienced a sense of ownership of the artificial bodies compared to a control condition in which ownership was disrupted. These findings are fundamentally important as they suggest a causal relationship between the representations of body space and external space. Thus, our own body size affects how we perceive the world.","[{'authorId': '2223697473', 'name': 'Bjö Rn Van Der Hoort'}, {'authorId': '2926904', 'name': 'Arvid Guterstam'}, {'authorId': '144940712', 'name': 'H.

Attentional difficulties may be associated with duration of illness. Method Female participants with AN (restricting subtype; n=24) and healthy comparison women (n=24) were randomly allocated to subliminal or supraliminal exposure to visual stimuli (food, neutral and aversive images) while performing the 1-back and 2-back working-memory tasks. Results Participants with AN made fewer errors than the healthy comparison group in the subliminal condition but significantly more errors in the supraliminal condition [condition×group interaction, F(1, 44)=6.82, p<0.01]: this was irrespective of stimulus type (food, neutral and aversive) and task (1-back or 2-back). The total number of errors made correlated positively with the duration of the AN for both the 1-back task (rs=0.46, p<0.05) and for the 2-back task (rs=0.53, p<0.01).

The purpose of this research was to investigate whether playing with and caring for a virtual pet dog would improve empathy and humane attitudes, and whether these outcomes would be related to children's sex, play type and duration, and companion bonding. The sample comprised 51 students in grades 4 and 5 from a multicultural, working class, neighborhood school in Surrey, British Columbia. Although 78 percent were from a non-English culture, all communicated satisfactorily in English. A repeated measures design was used in this study and consisted of: (1) a first pretest followed by three weeks with no intervention, (2) a second pretest followed by a three week intervention with Nintendogs, and (3) a posttest. The students also completed a weekly log and were interviewed after the intervention. The instruments used were: (1) Bryant Index of Empathy, (2) Intermediate Attitude Scale, and (3) Companion Animal Bonding Revised Scale. Quantitative findings revealed that empathy and humane attitude posttest scores significantly increased, with females scoring higher on pretest and posttest. Also, students who developed stronger companion bonds tended to have higher empathy scores, and that play and care were positively correlated with humane attitude scores. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews revealed that most students formed an emotional bond with their virtual pet dog, believing it possessed emotions, needs and interests. Play type and duration by females and males were similar. The research results suggest that playing with and caring for a virtual pet dog may promote empathy and humane attitudes, and that children's sex and play type and duration are related to empathy and attitude. Further research should be conducted with an independent control group and a larger sample to better understand the socio-emotional effects of virtual pets on children.

The ""universal"" in UDL does not mean there is a single optimal solution for everyone. Instead, it underscores the need for flexible approaches to teaching and learning that meet the needs of different kinds of learners. In this first UDL Reader, Anne Meyer and David H. Rose, cofounders of CAST, the educational nonprofit that developed the UDL framework, bring together a collection of articles on the practical, classroom dimensions of the UDL revolution in education. The authors offer insights on learner differences, the capacities of new media in the classroom, and effective teaching and assessment practices. The volume also includes lessons from teacher professional development workshops, classroom-based research, and UDL practitioners themselves. A highly readable volume aimed particularly at school teachers and administrators, this book is also an uncommonly accessible introduction to UDL for all readers committed to creating improved and universal access to educational materials for all students.","[{'authorId': '2061308349', 'name': 'David H.

85314eee1865c5b220d4b89868ccd83f951afc90,"Introduction The development and use of serious games for mental health disorders are on the rise. Yet, little is known about the impact of these games on clinical mental health symptoms. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of serious games on symptoms of mental disorder. Method We conducted a systematic search in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases, using mental health and serious games-related keywords. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review, and nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results All of the serious games were provided via personal computer, mostly on CD-ROM without the need for an internet connection. The studies targeted age groups ranging from 7 to 80 years old. The serious games focused on symptoms of depression (n = 2), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 2), autism spectrum disorder (n = 2), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 1), cognitive functioning (n = 2), and alcohol use disorder (n = 1). The studies used goal-oriented (n = 4) and cognitive training games (n = 6). A total of 674 participants were included in the meta-analysis (380 in experimental and 294 in control groups). A meta-analysis of 9 studies comprising 10 comparisons, using a random effects model, showed a moderate effect on improvement of symptoms [g = 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.28–0.83); P < 0.001], favoring serious games over no intervention controls. Discussion/conclusion Though the number of comparisons in the meta-analysis was small, these findings suggest that serious gaming interventions may be effective for reducing disorder-related symptoms. More studies are needed in order to attain deeper knowledge of the efficacy for specific mental disorders and the longer term effects of this new type of treatment for mental disorders.","[{'authorId': '4940640', 'name': 'Ho Ming Lau'}, {'authorId': '2153940907', 'name': 'J.

It introduces the idea of stacking depth, that is, where a participant can simulate the process of entering the virtual environment while already in such an environment, which can be repeated to several levels of depth. An experimental study including 24 subjects was carried out. Half of the subjects were transported between environments by using virtual head-mounted displays, and the other half by going through doors. Three other binary factors were whether or not gravity operated, whether or not the subject experienced a virtual precipice, and whether or not the subject was followed around by a virtual actor. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic representation systems and egocentric/exocentric perceptual positions were assessed by a preexperiment questionnaire. Presence was assessed by the subjects as their sense of being there, the extent to which they experienced the virtual environments as more the presenting reality than the real world in which the experiment was taking place, and the extent to which the subject experienced the virtual environments as places visited rather than images seen. A logistic regression analysis revealed that subjective reporting of presence was significantly positively associated with visual and kinesthetic representation systems, and negatively with the auditory system. This was not surprising since the virtual reality system used was primarily visual. The analysis also showed a significant and positive association with stacking level depth for those who were transported between environments by using the virtual HMD, and a negative association for those who were transported through doors. Finally, four of the subjects moved their real left arm to match movement of the left arm of the virtual body displayed by the system. These four scored significantly higher on the kinesthetic representation system than the remainder of the subjects.","[{'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

Here we show how recent evidence probing the impact of hypnosis and suggestion can inform and advance a neurophenomenological approach. In contrast to meditative practices that involve lengthy and intensive training, hypnosis induces profound alterations in subjective experience following just a few words of suggestion. Individuals highly responsive to hypnosis can quickly and effortlessly manifest atypical conscious experiences as well as override deeply entrenched processes. These capacities open new avenues for suspending habitual modes of attention and achieving refined states of meta-awareness. Furthermore, hypnosis research sheds light on the effects of suggestion, expectation, and interpersonal factors beyond the narrow context of hypnotic procedures. Such knowledge may help to further foster phenomenological interviewing methods, improve experiential reports, and elucidate the mechanisms of contemplative practices. Incorporating hypnosis and suggestion into the broader landscape of neurophenomenology, therefore, would likely help bridge subjective experience and third-person approaches to the mind.","[{'authorId': '8565047', 'name': 'M.

Depression and substance abuse are common and costly disorders that frequently co-occur, but controversy about effective treatment for patients with both disorders persists.


OBJECTIVE
To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the efficacy of antidepressant medications for treatment of combined depression and substance use disorders.


DATA SOURCES
PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane database search (1970-2003), using the keywords antidepressant treatment or treatment depressed in conjunction with each of the following alcohol dependence, benzodiazepine dependence, opiate dependence, cocaine dependence, marijuana dependence, and methadone; a search of bibliographies; and consultation with experts in the field.


STUDY SELECTION
Among inclusion criteria used for study selection were prospective, parallel group, double-blind, controlled clinical trials with random assignment to an antidepressant medication or placebo for which trial patients met standard diagnostic criteria for current alcohol or other drug use and a current unipolar depressive disorder. Of the more than 300 citations extracted, 44 were placebo-controlled clinical trials, 14 of which were selected for this analysis and included 848 patients: 5 studies of tricyclic antidepressants, 7 of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and 2 from other classes


DATA EXTRACTION
We independently screened the titles and abstracts of each citation, identified placebo-controlled trials of patients with both substance dependence and depression, applied the inclusion criteria, and reached consensus. Data on study methods, sample characteristics, and depression and substance use outcomes were extracted. The principal measure of effect size was the standardized difference between means on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS).


DATA SYNTHESIS
For the HDS score, the pooled effect size from the random-effects model was 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.58). Heterogeneity of effect on HDS across studies was significant (P <.02), and studies with low placebo response showed larger effects. Moderator analysis suggested that diagnostic methods and concurrent psychosocial interventions influenced outcome. Studies with larger depression effect sizes (>0.5) demonstrated favorable effects of medication on measures of quantity of substance use, but rates of sustained abstinence were low.


CONCLUSIONS
Antidepressant medication exerts a modest beneficial effect for patients with combined depressive- and substance-use disorders. It is not a stand-alone treatment, and concurrent therapy directly targeting the addiction is also indicated. More research is needed to understand variations in the strength of the effect, but the data suggest that care be exercised in the diagnosis of depression-either by observing depression to persist during at least a brief period of abstinence or through efforts by clinical history to screen out substance-related depressive symptoms.","[{'authorId': '3795745', 'name': 'E.

Ultimately, the success of any emerging technology will rely on the experience it provides the end user, and not on the technology itself. Subjective methods for quality-of-experience (QoE) assessment have as main disadvantage that converting such human factors into a quality rating is difficult, particularly for everyday users. To overcome this limitation, recent research has explored the use of objective methods to monitor neurophysiological correlates of relevant perception processes. In this paper, we describe the development of a neurophysiological sensor-equipped head-mounted display that combines a consumer off-the-shelf VR headset, a modified low-cost portable device for electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition repurposed to simultaneously acquire EEG, electrocardiogram (ECG), and electrooculogram (EOG) signals with high-quality dry electrodes. The device was evaluated under three different scenarios, each one designed to test the different ExG modalities. Initial tests showed promising results and allowed for (1) steady-state visually evoked potentials to be accurately measured from EEG, (2) heart rate variability measurements to discriminate between different affective videos, and (3) EOG measurements to monitor gaze direction and eye blinks, all while users were mobile. Being able to accurately monitor signals from the autonomic and central nervous systems in an unobtrusive and portable manner is an important step for instrumental QoE assessment of emerging VR/AR applications.","[{'authorId': '34086027', 'name': 'Raymundo Cassani'}, {'authorId': '41021670', 'name': 'Marc-Antoine Moinnereau'}, {'authorId': '2632038', 'name': 'T.

The willing receptivity of the low status group may indicate its acceptance of the inequality, and lack of receptivity for such help may be motivated by the desire to achieve social equality.

864f8ed71cf3c61baf68e4b7571207896f65daa3,"Abstract During the last two decades, Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has been tested in hundreds of randomized controlled trials, often with promising results. However, the control groups were often waitlisted, care-as-usual or attention control. Hence, little is known about the relative efficacy of ICBT as compared to face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 1418 participants, guided ICBT for psychiatric and somatic conditions were directly compared to face-to-face CBT within the same trial. Out of the 2078 articles screened, a total of 20 studies met all inclusion criteria. Results showed a pooled effect size at post-treatment of Hedges g = .05 (95% CI, −.09 to .20), indicating that ICBT and face-to-face treatment produced equivalent overall effects. Study quality did not affect outcomes. While the overall results indicate equivalence, there have been few studies of the individual psychiatric and somatic conditions so far, and for the majority, guided ICBT has not been compared against face-to-face treatment. Thus, more research, preferably with larger sample sizes, is needed to establish the general equivalence of the two treatment formats.","[{'authorId': '2538572', 'name': 'P.

The underlying neural mechanisms can be studied by using the illusion where a person is made to feel that a rubber hand is his or her own hand by brushing the person's hidden real hand and synchronously brushing the artificial hand that is in full view. Here we show that threat to the rubber hand can induce a similar level of activity in the brain areas associated with anxiety and interoceptive awareness (insula and anterior cingulate cortex) as when the person's real hand is threatened. We further show that the stronger the feeling of ownership of the artificial hand, the stronger the threat-evoked neuronal responses in the areas reflecting anxiety. Furthermore, across subjects, activity in multisensory areas reflecting ownership predicted the activity in the interoceptive system when the hand was under threat. Finally, we show that there is activity in medial wall motor areas, reflecting an urge to withdraw the artificial hand when it is under threat. These findings suggest that artificial limbs can evoke the same feelings as real limbs and provide objective neurophysiological evidence that the rubber hand is fully incorporated into the body. These findings are of fundamental importance because they suggest that the feeling of body ownership is associated with changes in the interoceptive systems.","[{'authorId': '144940712', 'name': 'H.

868a88d9140b55cc67d948b01b391b1a0c6d75b0,"Background: Exposure therapy involves exposure to feared stimuli and is considered to be the gold-standard treatment for anxiety disorders. While its application in Virtual Reality (VR) has been very successful for phobic disorders, the effects of exposure to virtual social stimuli in Social Anxiety Disorder are heterogeneous. This difference has been linked to demands on realism and presence, particularly social presence, as a pre-requisite in evoking emotional experiences in virtual social interactions. So far, however, the influence of social presence on emotional experience in social interactions with virtual agents remains unknown. Objective: We investigated the relationship between realism and social presence and the moderating effect of social presence on the relationship between agent behavior and experienced emotions in virtual social interaction. Methods: Healthy participants (N = 51) faced virtual agents showing supportive and dismissive behaviors in two virtual environments (short interactions and oral presentations). At first, participants performed five blocks of short one-on-one interactions with virtual agents (two male and two female agents per block). Secondly, participants gave five presentations in front of an audience of 16 agents. In each scenario, agent behavior was a within subjects factor, resulting in one block of neutral, two blocks of negative, and two blocks of positive agent behavior. Ratings of agent behavior (valence and realism), experience (valence and arousal), and presence (physical and social) were collected after every block. Moderator effects were investigated using mixed linear models with random intercepts. Correlations were analyzed via repeated measures correlations. Results: Ratings of valence of agent behaviors showed reliable relationships with experienced valence and less reliable relationships with experienced arousal. These relationships were moderated by social presence in the presentation scenario. Results for the interaction scenario were weaker but potentially promising for experimental studies. Variations in social presence and realism over time were correlated but social presence proved a more reliable moderator. Conclusion: Our findings emphasize the role of social presence for emotional experience in response to specific agent behaviors in virtual social interactions. While these findings should be replicated with experimental designs and in clinical samples, variability in social presence might account for heterogeneity in efficacy of virtual exposure to treat social anxiety disorder.","[{'authorId': '2053795228', 'name': 'Michael Pfaller'}, {'authorId': '30692915', 'name': 'Leon O.

In order to answer this question, we conducted an experiment studying the sense of embodiment when interacting with three different virtual hand representations, each one providing a different degree of visual realism but keeping the same control mechanism. The main experimental task was a Pick-and-Place task in which participants had to grasp a virtual cube and place it to an indicated position while avoiding an obstacle (brick, barbed wire or fire). An additional task was considered in which participants had to perform a potentially dangerous operation towards their virtual hand: place their virtual hand close to a virtual spinning saw. Both qualitative measures and questionnaire data were gathered in order to assess the sense of agency and ownership towards each virtual hand. Results show that the sense of agency is stronger for less realistic virtual hands which also provide less mismatch between the participant's actions and the animation of the virtual hand. In contrast, the sense of ownership is increased for the human virtual hand which provides a direct mapping between the degrees of freedom of the real and virtual hand.","[{'authorId': '1854224', 'name': 'F.

Although deep belief network (DBN) has witnessed the success in various domains including early works in emotion recognition based on EEG, it remains unclear whether DBN could improve emotion classification in music domains, especially in dynamic strategy that considers time-varying characteristics of emotion. This paper presents an early study of applying DBNs to improve emotion recognition in music listening where emotions were annotated continuously in time by subjects. Our subject-dependent results using stratified 10-fold cross-validation strategy suggested that DBNs could improve performance in valence classification with fractal dimension (FD), power spectral density (PSD), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) features and improve performance in arousal classification with FD and DWT features. Furthermore, we found that the size of sliding window affected classification accuracies when using features in time (FD) and time-frequency (DWT) domains, while smaller window (1-4 seconds) could achieve higher performance compared with a larger window (5-8 seconds).","[{'authorId': '2280801', 'name': 'Nattapong Thammasan'}, {'authorId': '2562352', 'name': 'Ken-ichi Fukui'}, {'authorId': '9136228', 'name': 'M.

In Study 2 we found moderate levels of agreement between ratings of competence by subjects and their roommates. Interpersonal competence scores were also related in predictable ways to subject and roommate reports of masculinity and femininity, social self-esteem, loneliness, and social desirability. In Study 3 we obtained ratings of subjects' competence from their close friends and new acquaintances.

Our main contribution is to propose a perceptual evaluation of a simple virtual reality system. The goal is to assess whether real humans are also able to accurately estimate a virtual human motion before collision avoidance. Results show that, even through a simple system, users are able to correctly evaluate the situation of an interaction on the qualitative point of view. Especially, in comparison with real interactions, users accurately decide whether they should give way to the virtual human or not. However, on the quantitative point of view, it is not easy for users to determine whether they will collide with virtual humans or not. On one hand, deciding to give way or not is a two-choice problem. On the other hand, detecting future collision requires to determine whether some visual variables belong some interval or not.

Analyses showed that SEBEs simulating either a natural or a lounge environment were perceived as more pleasant and restorative (fascination/being away) than a standard break room, which in turn facilitated the recovery of personal resources (mood, fatigue, arousal).

Feminist perspectives assume patriarchal control to be at the root of domestic violence, and see anger and alcohol as excuses for abusive behaviour. Psychological approaches identify anger and alcohol as risk factors for violence in some subgroups of offenders. A risk–needs model is presented, in which a distinction is drawn between acute and stable dynamic risk factors. Both may be targets of intervention, but addressing stable dynamic risk factors is more likely to effect enduring change. A theoretical understanding is required to identify stable dynamic risk factors, and here we suggest an affective defence approach to anger-related domestic violence and a social problem solving approach to alcohol-related domestic violence. Further developments in risk assessment and treatment matching are recommended.","[{'authorId': '2648380', 'name': 'M. McMurran'}, {'authorId': '114486949', 'name': 'E.

However, the ever-increasing costs of looking after an aging population, many of whom suffer chronic diseases, is straining the finances of healthcare systems around Europe. This situation has given rise to a great deal of attention being paid to the development of telerehabilitation (TR) systems, which have been designed to take rehabilitation beyond hospitals and care centers. In this article, we propose which features should be addressed in the development of TR systems, that is, they should consider adaptive, multisensorial, physiological and social aspects. For this aim, the research project Vi-SMARt is being conducted for evaluating whether and how different technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), multi-sensorial feedback, or telemonitoring, may be exploited for the development of the next generation of TR systems. Beyond traditional aural and visual feedback, the exploitation of haptic sense by using devices such as haptic gloves or wristbands, can provide patients with additional guidance in the rehabilitation process. For telemonitoring, Electroencephalography (EEG) devices show signs of being a promising approach, not only to monitor patients’ emotions, but also to obtain neuro-feedback useful for controlling his/her interaction with the system and thus to provide a better rehabilitation experience.","[{'authorId': '40927918', 'name': 'Elena Navarro'}, {'authorId': '145676827', 'name': 'P.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adulthood is a prevalent, distressing, and impairing condition that is not fully treated by pharmacotherapy alone and lacks evidence-based psychosocial treatments.


OBJECTIVE
To test cognitive behavioral therapy for ADHD in adults treated with medication but who still have clinically significant symptoms.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS
Randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for 86 symptomatic adults with ADHD who were already being treated with medication. The study was conducted at a US hospital between November 2004 and June 2008 (follow-up was conducted through July 2009). Of the 86 patients randomized, 79 completed treatment and 70 completed the follow-up assessments.


INTERVENTIONS
Patients were randomized to 12 individual sessions of either cognitive behavioral therapy or relaxation with educational support (which is an attention-matched comparison).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The primary measures were ADHD symptoms rated by an assessor (ADHD rating scale and Clinical Global Impression scale) at baseline, posttreatment, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. The assessor was blinded to treatment condition assignment. The secondary outcome measure was self-report of ADHD symptoms.


RESULTS
Cognitive behavioral therapy achieved lower posttreatment scores on both the Clinical Global Impression scale (magnitude -0.0531; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.01 to -0.05; P = .03) and the ADHD rating scale (magnitude -4.631; 95% CI, -8.30 to -0.963; P = .02) compared with relaxation with educational support. Throughout treatment, self-reported symptoms were also significantly more improved for cognitive behavioral therapy (beta = -0.41; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.17; P <001), and there were more treatment responders in cognitive behavioral therapy for both the Clinical Global Impression scale (53% vs 23%; odds ratio [OR], 3.80; 95% CI, 1.50 to 9.59; P = .01) and the ADHD rating scale (67% vs 33%; OR, 4.29; 95% CI, 1.74 to 10.58; P = .002). Responders and partial responders in the cognitive behavioral therapy condition maintained their gains over 6 and 12 months.


CONCLUSION
Among adults with persistent ADHD symptoms treated with medication, the use of cognitive behavioral therapy compared with relaxation with educational support resulted in improved ADHD symptoms, which were maintained at 12 months.

Use of virtual reality could facilitate new learning. Aims To test the hypothesis that enabling patients to test the threat predictions of persecutory delusions in virtual reality social environments with the dropping of safety-seeking behaviours (virtual reality cognitive therapy) would lead to greater delusion reduction than exposure alone (virtual reality exposure). Method Conviction in delusions and distress in a real-world situation were assessed in 30 patients with persecutory delusions. Patients were then randomised to virtual reality cognitive therapy or virtual reality exposure, both with 30 min in graded virtual reality social environments. Delusion conviction and real-world distress were then reassessed. Results In comparison with exposure, virtual reality cognitive therapy led to large reductions in delusional conviction (reduction 22.0%, P = 0.024, Cohen's d = 1.3) and real-world distress (reduction 19.6%, P = 0.020, Cohen's d = 0.8).

The project was characterized by a strong involvement of the teachers, that modeled a substantial part of the ordinary classroom work for embedding the in-situ experimentation and designing a smooth learning path. To our knowledge CASTOR is one of the first authoring systems allowing the direct creation of structured stories in-situ, rather than the simple gathering of material. Its architecture is based on a story model presented in previous works [3, 20] and characterized by the use of the environmental and social context for augmenting the emotional engagement of the story listeners. All the components of the architecture have been designed for complying with the learning needs and the skills of a class of young children. The final part of the paper will present the results of the experimentation, that gave interesting insights not only on the use of the authoring interface itself, but also on its effects on the children learning process.","[{'authorId': '1715699', 'name': 'Fabio Pittarello'}, {'authorId': '46557906', 'name': 'Luca Bertani'}]",20.0,,25.0,CASTOR: learning to create context-sensitive and emotionally engaging narrations in-situ,2012.0

To clarify this relationship, we investigate the role of temporal focus on the effect of specific positive emotions on self-control dilemmas in snack consumption. In four studies, we demonstrate that participants experiencing a future-focused positive emotion (i.e., hopefulness) consume less unhealthy food and have lower preferences for unhealthy snacks than those in a past- or present-focused emotional state (i.e., pride, happiness). We demonstrate the role of temporal focus through its natural occurrence in emotion-induction essays (study 1), chronic temporal focus (study 2), and manipulation of anticipated versus retrospective emotional states (study 3). A fourth study demonstrates that self-control benefits do not arise from future-focused negative emotions (i.e., fear) as they do from future-focused positive emotions.

89e6a25fcd35844cf5dd74206112c4b8b211c967,"Numerous studies use arm movements (arm flexion and extension) to investigate the interaction between emotional stimuli and approach/avoidance behaviour. In many experiments, however, these arm movements are ambiguous. Arm flexion can be interpreted either as pulling (approach) or as withdrawing (avoidance). On the contrary, arm extension can be interpreted as reaching (approach) or as pushing (avoidance). This ambiguity can be resolved by regarding approach and avoidance as flexible action plans that are represented in terms of their effects. Approach actions reduce the distance between a stimulus and the self, whereas avoidance actions increase that distance. In this view, action effects are an integral part of the representation of an action. As a result, a neutral action can become an approach or avoidance reaction if it repeatedly results in decreasing or increasing the distance to a valenced stimulus. This hypothesis was tested in the current study. Participants responded to positive and negative words using key-presses. These “neutral” responses (not involving arm flexion or extension) were consistently followed by a stimulus movement toward or away from the participant. Responses to emotional words were faster when the response's effect was congruent with stimulus valence, suggesting that approach/avoidance actions are indeed defined in terms of their outcomes.","[{'authorId': '117291811', 'name': 'Saskia van Dantzig'}, {'authorId': '2842071', 'name': 'D.

In recent years, virtual reality (VR) has been also used as a method to elicit emotions in laboratory environments. However, there is still a need to analyse the validity of VR in order to extrapolate the results it produces and to assess the similarities and differences in physiological responses provoked by real and virtual environments. We investigated the cardiovascular oscillations of 60 participants during a free exploration of a real museum and its virtualisation viewed through a head-mounted display. The differences between the heart rate variability features in the high and low arousal stimuli conditions were analysed through statistical hypothesis testing; and automatic arousal recognition models were developed across the real and the virtual conditions using a support vector machine algorithm with recursive feature selection. The subjects’ self-assessments suggested that both museums elicited low and high arousal levels. In addition, the real museum showed differences in terms of cardiovascular responses, differences in vagal activity, while arousal recognition reached 72.92% accuracy. However, we did not find the same arousal-based autonomic nervous system change pattern during the virtual museum exploration. The results showed that, while the direct virtualisation of a real environment might be self-reported as evoking psychological arousal, it does not necessarily evoke the same cardiovascular changes as a real arousing elicitation. These contribute to the understanding of the use of VR in emotion recognition research; future research is needed to study arousal and emotion elicitation in immersive VR.","[{'authorId': '1401067645', 'name': 'J.

The prototype we describe has been developed on top of the Unreal Tournament game engine and relies on a ""causal engine"", which essentially bypasses the native Physics engine to generate alternative consequences to player interventions. It operates using a small depth-bound planning system which determines the most appropriate object behaviours following player interaction.

This has served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD. One emerging form of treatment for combat-related PTSD that has shown promise involves the delivery of exposure therapy using immersive Virtual Reality (VR). Initial outcomes from open clinical trials have been positive and fully randomized controlled trials are currently in progress to further validate this approach. Based on our research group's initial positive outcomes using VR to emotionally engage and successfully treat persons undergoing exposure therapy for PTSD, we have begun development in a similar VR-based approach to deliver stress resilience training with military service members prior to their initial deployment. The Stress Resilience In Virtual Environments (STRIVE) project aims to create a set of combat simulations (derived from our existing Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan exposure therapy system) that are part of a multi-episode narrative experience. Users can be immersed within challenging combat contexts and interact with virtual characters within these episodes as part of an experiential learning approach for training a range of psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioral emotional coping strategies believed to enhance stress resilience. The STRIVE project aims to present this approach to service members prior to deployment as part of a program designed to better prepare military personnel for the types of emotional challenges that are inherent in the combat environment. During these virtual training experiences users are monitored physiologically as part of a larger investigation into the biomarkers of the stress response. One such construct, Allostatic Load, is being directly investigated via physiological and neuro-hormonal analysis from specimen collections taken immediately before and after engagement in the STRIVE virtual experience.","[{'authorId': '29861580', 'name': 'A.

However, a growing number of researchers support the idea that nonconscious processes may hold the keys to higher forms of intelligence. Subliminal messages expose individuals to visual or/and auditory stimuli below the threshold of perception. The current review aims to explore the effectiveness of subliminal cues on fundamental aspects of metacognition such as higher cognitive and emotional meta-abilities, affective and behavioral regulation, and academic achievement. In this context, we search for and classify the existing subliminal training techniques, while evaluating the usability of ICTs such as virtual reality, mobile apps, intelligent tutoring systems, and software in subliminal learning and training. The results of this review revealed that subliminal techniques improve all those aspects that assure metacognitive improvements in terms of self- & emotional regulation, higher mental abilities, and behavioral modification. Subliminal cues lower people's shields and update filtering mechanisms enabling people to focus on positive rather than negative interpretations. Subliminal techniques are under the umbrella of metacognitive strategies, since they can used consciously to increase self-regulation capacity as wells as expand the horizons of consciousness. Subliminal teaching techniques can be used by teachers and parents in general and special education to instill higher-level needs & motives, accelerate students’ performance and unfold students’ existing but underdeveloped abilities. Therapists can also utilize these methods to help patients with phobia, anxiety and depression to overcome fear. Subliminal techniques can be also used as a strategy by leaders, mentors, and employees to build trust, inspire and provide humanity with innovative ideas. ICTs provide the ideal environment for implementing subliminal training. However, more research is needed.","[{'authorId': '1724307', 'name': 'A.

Theoretical neuroanatomic models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the results of previous neuroimaging studies of PTSD highlight the potential importance of the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions in this disorder. However, the functional relationship between these brain regions in PTSD has not been directly examined.


OBJECTIVE
To examine the relationship between the amygdala and medial prefrontal regions during symptom provocation in male combat veterans (MCVs) and female nurse veterans (FNVs) with PTSD.


DESIGN
Case-control study.


SETTING
Academic medical center.


PARTICIPANTS
Volunteer sample of 17 (7 men and 10 women) Vietnam veterans with PTSD (PTSD group) and 19 (9 men and 10 women) Vietnam veterans without PTSD (control group).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We used positron emission tomography and the script-driven imagery paradigm to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during the recollection of personal traumatic and neutral events. Psychophysiologic and emotional self-report data also were obtained to confirm the intended effects of script-driven imagery.


RESULTS
The PTSD group exhibited rCBF decreases in medial frontal gyrus in the traumatic vs neutral comparison. When this comparison was conducted separately by subgroup, MCVs and FNVs with PTSD exhibited these medial frontal gyrus decreases. Only MCVs exhibited rCBF increases in the left amygdala. However, for both subgroups with PTSD, rCBF changes in medial frontal gyrus were inversely correlated with rCBF changes in the left amygdala and the right amygdala/periamygdaloid cortex. Furthermore, in the traumatic condition, for both subgroups with PTSD, symptom severity was positively related to rCBF in the right amygdala and negatively related to rCBF in medial frontal gyrus.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest a reciprocal relationship between medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala function in PTSD and opposing associations between activity in these regions and symptom severity consistent with current functional neuroanatomic models of this disorder.","[{'authorId': '4807594', 'name': 'L.

Depression is associated with impaired emotion-regulation skills, but few studies have examined whether such impairments apply to a musical context also. The aim of the present study was thus to compare depressed and non-depressed individuals with regard to their use of music for emotion regulation in everyday life. Seventy-seven listeners (19–65 years old) filled out a brief questionnaire, which measured emotion regulation in terms of the prevalence of various regulation goals, strategies, and mechanisms. The overall results indicated that the most frequent goal was to enhance positive emotions. Discharge was the most frequently used strategy and suppression was the least frequently used. A range of causal mechanisms were reported to occur. Contrary to our hypotheses, there were few differences between depressed and non-depressed listeners. We argue that knowledge gained from studies of emotion regulation may be used in field interventions that aim to teach depressed individuals how to use music to regulate emotions effectively.","[{'authorId': '118049772', 'name': 'Laura S.

Does the mammalian brain use similar brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act upon the world? Recent advances in training deep neural networks has exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic weights to map millions of observations along ecologically relevant objective functions. This class of models has dramatically outstripped simpler, more intuitive models, operating robustly in real-life contexts spanning perception, language, and action coordination. These models do not learn an explicit, human-interpretable representation of the underlying structure of the data; rather, they use local computations to interpolate over task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space. Furthermore, counterintuitively, over-parameterized models, similarly to evolutionary processes, can be simple and parsimonious as they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse set of functions. In contrast to traditional scientific models, where the ultimate goal is interpretability, over-parameterized models eschew interpretability in favor of solving real-life problems or tasks. We contend that over-parameterized blind fitting presents a radical challenge to many of the underlying assumptions and practices in computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. At the same time, this shift in perspective informs longstanding debates and establishes unexpected links with evolution, ecological psychology, and artificial life.","[{'authorId': '1787630', 'name': 'U.

Most patients with GAD never seek treatment, and those who do seek treatment often drop out before completing treatment. Although it is an understudied treatment, Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) indicate preliminary efficacy for the treatment of GAD symptoms, but many patients with GAD present other associated symptoms (e.g., attention deficits) that complicate the treatment. Virtual Reality DBT® Mindfulness Skills learning has recently been developed to make learning mindfulness easier for patients with emotion dysregulation who have trouble concentrating. Virtual Reality (VR) might serve as a visual guide for practicing mindfulness as it gives patients the illusion of “being there” in the 3D computer generated world. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of two MBIs (a MBI in a group setting alone and the same MBI plus 10 min VR DBT® Mindfulness skills training) to reduce GAD symptoms. A secondary aim was to explore the effect in depression, emotion regulation, mindfulness, and interoceptive awareness. Other exploratory aims regarding the use of VR DBT® Mindfulness skills were also carried out. The sample was composed of 42 patients (roughly half in each group) with GAD attending PC visits. After treatment, both groups of patients showed significant improvements in General Anxiety Disorder measured by the GAD-7 using mixed regression models [MBI alone (B = -5.70; p < 0.001; d = -1.36), MBI+VR DBT® Mindfulness skills (B = -4.38; p < 0.001; d = -1.33)]. Both groups also showed significant improvements in anxiety, depression, difficulties of emotion regulation and several aspects of mindfulness and interoceptive awareness. Patients in the group that received additional 10 min VR DBT Mindfulness Skills training were significantly more adherent to the treatment than those receiving only standard MBI (100% completion rate in MBI + VR vs. 70% completion rate in MBI alone; Fisher = 0.020). Although randomized controlled studies with larger samples are needed, this pilot study shows preliminary effectiveness of MBI to treat GAD, and preliminary evidence that adjunctive VR DBT® Mindfulness Skills may reduce dropouts.","[{'authorId': '1403286034', 'name': 'M.

VR consists of a three-dimensional, computer-generated environment viewed through a head-mounted display. This medium has provided new possibilities to adapt problematic behaviors that affect mental health. VR is no longer unaffordable for individuals, and with mobile phone technology being able to track movements and project images through mobile head-mounted devices, VR is now a mobile tool that can be used at work, home, or on the move. Objective In line with recent advances in technology, in this review, we aimed to critically assess the current state of research surrounding mental health. Methods We compiled a table of 82 studies that made use of head-mounted devices in their interventions. Results Our review demonstrated that VR is effective in provoking realistic reactions to feared stimuli, particularly for anxiety; moreover, it proved that the immersive nature of VR is an ideal fit for the management of pain. However, the lack of studies surrounding depression and stress highlight the literature gaps that still exist. Conclusions Virtual environments that promote positive stimuli combined with health knowledge could prove to be a valuable tool for public health and mental health. The current state of research highlights the importance of the nature and content of VR interventions for improved mental health. While future research should look to incorporate more mobile forms of VR, a more rigorous reporting of VR and computer hardware and software may help us understand the relationship (if any) between increased specifications and the efficacy of treatment.","[{'authorId': '51048478', 'name': 'S.

It proposes an overarching framework comprising conceptual and technical frameworks for enhancing the online communication skills of lifelong learners. Our approach interprets the emotional state of people using webcams and microphones and combines relevant and timely feedback based upon learner's facial expressions and verbalizations (like sadness, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, surprise, and neutral). The feedback generated from the webcams is expected to to-face trainings and better helps the interests of lifelong learners who prefer to study at their own pace, place and time. Our small-scale proof of concept study exemplifies the practical application of FILTWAM and provides first evaluation results on that. This study will guide future development of software, training materials, and research. It will validate the use of webcam data for a real-time and adequate interpretation of facial expressions into emotional states.

8c418d9f7016ce5f3719f0abfdc7f9b7065e0bea,"Background Previous review studies have suggested that computer games can serve as an alternative or additional form of treatment in several areas (schizophrenia, asthma or motor rehabilitation). Although several naturalistic studies have been conducted showing the usefulness of serious video games in the treatment of some abnormal behaviours, there is a lack of serious games specially designed for treating mental disorders. Aim The purpose of our project was to develop and evaluate a serious video game designed to remediate attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. Method and results The video game was created and developed within the European research project PlayMancer. It aims to prove potential capacity to change underlying attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. New interaction modes were provided by newly developed components, such as emotion recognition from speech, face and physiological reactions, while specific impulsive reactions were elicited. The video game uses biofeedback for helping patients to learn relaxation skills, acquire better self-control strategies and develop new emotional regulation strategies. In this article, we present a description of the video game used, rationale, user requirements, usability and preliminary data, in several mental disorders.","[{'authorId': '1397920429', 'name': 'F.

8c74fc02ff5cbece8e813ab99defabffb24249ec,"Neuroimagingstudies with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have begun to describe the functional neuroanatomy of emotion. Taken separately, specific studies vary in task dimensions and in type(s) of emotion studied and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity. By examining findings across studies, we sought to determine if common or segregated patterns of activations exist across various emotional tasks. We reviewed 55 PET and fMRI activation studies (yielding 761 individual peaks) which investigated emotion in healthy subjects. Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings. We divided the brain into 20 nonoverlapping regions, and characterized each region by its responsiveness across individual emotions (positive, negative, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), to different induction methods (visual, auditory, recall/imagery), and in emotional tasks with and without cognitive demand. Our review yielded the following summary observations: (1) The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing; (2) fear specifically engaged the amygdala; (3) sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate; (4) emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala; (5) induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula; (6) emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula. This review provides a critical comparison of findings across individual studies and suggests that separate brain regions are involved in different aspects of emotion.","[{'authorId': '2095487589', 'name': 'K.

8cb44f06586f609a29d9b496cc752ec01475dffe,"An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of ""normal"" examples with only a small percentage of ""abnormal"" or ""interesting"" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of oversampling the minority (abnormal)cla ss and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)tha n only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)t han varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC)and the ROC convex hull strategy.","[{'authorId': '144539424', 'name': 'N.

The proposed architecture is independent of any hand-crafted feature extraction and performs better than the earlier proposed convolutional neural network based approaches. We visualize the automatically extracted features which have been learned by the network in order to provide a better understanding. The standard datasets, i.e. Extended Cohn-Kanade (CKP) and MMI Facial Expression Databse are used for the quantitative evaluation. On the CKP set the current state of the art approach, using CNNs, achieves an accuracy of 99.2%. For the MMI dataset, currently the best accuracy for emotion recognition is 93.33%. The proposed architecture achieves 99.6% for CKP and 98.63% for MMI, therefore performing better than the state of the art using CNNs. Automatic facial expression recognition has a broad spectrum of applications such as human-computer interaction and safety systems. This is due to the fact that non-verbal cues are important forms of communication and play a pivotal role in interpersonal communication. The performance of the proposed architecture endorses the efficacy and reliable usage of the proposed work for real world applications.","[{'authorId': '2095137891', 'name': 'Peter Burkert'}, {'authorId': '2083913613', 'name': 'Felix Trier'}, {'authorId': '145181206', 'name': 'Muhammad Zeshan Afzal'}, {'authorId': '145279674', 'name': 'A.

VR involves immersion in a computer-generated virtual environment that minimizes avoidance and facilitates emotional processing. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate evidence on the intervention effect of VR on anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain. The research strategy of this systematic review included three electronic databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect) based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Published quantitative studies from 2000 to 2020 were identified, which examined the effect of VR intervention on four different symptoms related to symptoms experienced by cancer patients. Quality assessments, data extractions, and analysis were completed on all included studies. A total of 882 titles and abstracts were screened, and 23 studies were included in the review. The studies were grouped according to the symptoms: anxiety and depression, fatigue, and pain. The review showed that VR intervention is more effective compared with the control (i.e., standard care) for anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain. VR can reduce effectively these symptoms in different contexts and diseases, including cancer. The evidence suggests that there is value in exploring this intervention as a potential crossover treatment for these symptoms in patients. This study contributes to evidence that distraction is an effective symptom management mechanism. The findings are congruent with the theoretical framework, supporting the premise that VR, as an emotion-focused distraction intervention, decreases the severity of these symptoms.","[{'authorId': '2058979166', 'name': 'Androniki Ioannou'}, {'authorId': '4658847', 'name': 'E.

Along with the adversity in the online course of target language learning, student engagement has been considered important to improve learners’ academic achievements of the target language. Although there has been a growing interest in the relationship between students’ perceived social support and their online learning engagement, the literature lacks an in-depth investigation of the intricate relations between these two constructs in an online English as a foreign language (EFL) learning setting during the pandemic. To address this gap, this study attempts to develop a model which depicts the relationships between students’ perceived social support and their online English learning engagement. A total of 615 university students in China were invited to take part in the study. By conducting structural equation modeling, the results confirmed the mediational model in which behavioral engagement completely mediated the relationships between social support (teacher support and peer support) and three other types of student engagement (cognitive, emotional and social engagement). These findings suggest designing effective instruction and developing support strategies in online teaching to enhance EFL learners’ engagement during the COVID-19 lockdown.","[{'authorId': '2006243724', 'name': 'Lin Luan'}, {'authorId': '2041743876', 'name': 'Jong-Chao Hong'}, {'authorId': '2044463807', 'name': 'M.

It was declared pandemic in March 2020. It is important to know predictors of poor outcomes in order to optimize the strategies of care in newly diagnosed patients. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) constitutes a novel prognostic marker for oncologic, cardiovascular and infectious diseases. We aimed to assess its prognostic value in COVID-19. We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 131 patients with COVID-19 from March to May 2020. We analyzed the association of an NLR = 3 with severe COVID-19, baseline characteristics of the population and the mortality rate. The median age was 52 years, and 54% were men. 21 patients presented criteria of severe disease, 9 of them required mechanical ventilation. NLR = 3 was found in 81% (18/21) of severe patients and in 33% (36/110) of mild patients (OR = 8.74. 95% CI 2.74-27.86; p < 0.001). Age and hypertension were associated with severe disease. A mortality rate of 7% (9) was obtained. Seven of the 9 patients who died presented NLR = 3, with a significant association between mortality and NLR = 3 (p = 0.03).

8d611c2a1d9ee423b465f35dbda1d30d05e26c85,"Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming more and more common in Clinical Psychology. Two of the technologies that are more consolidated in this field are virtual reality (VR) and telepsychology. There are other technological innovations that are beginning to be used in clinical and health psychology such as ambient intelligence, ubiquitous computing or persuasive computing. In the last fifteen years there has been a proliferation of studies testing the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for several mental disorders and health conditions. The essence of VR is that it can simulate reality and add a new possibility: the user has the illusion of “being” in the computer-generated environment while interacting with the VR objects. This unique feature of VR is very relevant for its use in Clinical Psychology. At the same time, it can raise several ethical issues. It is important to investigate the possible effects of blurring the distinction between real and virtual worlds in vulnerable populations. Some other concerns regarding the use of VR in therapy have already been investigated, such as cybersickness. After ten years of experience treating patients with VR, this has not been a problem in the published efficacy studies. Telepsychology has also been used to improve the delivery of CBT. A number of Internetdelivered programs have already become important tools in the health system. The main advantage is that online therapy can reach people who might not otherwise seek therapy, such as disabled people or those who live in remote areas. However, several concerns have been raised about self-help procedures, like the issue of self-diagnosis. and the fact that patients usually have all of the necessary self-help information at their disposal. It is important to establish criteria to protect people from the possible negative effects of this. Other innovations such as ambient intelligence and pervasive computing bring up other ethical issues. For example, is privacy being compromised too much when people are located using GPS or physiologically monitored 24 hours a day? Criteria for considering these issues must be established. Our research group has been working with new technologies and therapies for the last fifteen years. This paper addresses the ethical issues we have encountered in our research and clinical practice; it also explores ethical issues that will become increasingly important.","[{'authorId': '145945543', 'name': 'C.

8d9bc4b8023554857a0acfe97bc5142ee09fd051,"ABSTRACT Research is increasingly demonstrating the therapeutic benefits of virtual reality interventions for various mental health conditions, though these rarely translate from research to application in clinical settings. This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of current virtual reality interventions for emotional disorders, with a focus on clinical and technological features that influence translation of treatments from research to clinical practice. A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, for studies including the application of a virtual reality intervention to a clinical population of adults with an emotional disorder. Thirty-seven eligible studies were identified, appraised, and assessed for bias. Treatment effects were typically large across studies, with virtual reality being considered an efficacious treatment modality for various anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Virtual reality interventions were typically used for delivering exposure in cognitive behavioural therapy approaches. Considerable variability was seen in cost, technological specifications, degree of therapist involvement, delivery format, dosage, duration, and frequency of treatment. Suboptimal methodological rigour was identified in some studies. Remote use of virtual reality was rare, despite increasing options for in home use. Virtual reality interventions have the potential to overcome barriers to care and better meet the needs of consumers. Future research should examine the efficacy of virtual reality for treatment of depressive disorders and obsesive compulsive disorder. Improved methodological reporting and development of transdiagnostic and remotely delivered virtual reality interventions, will likely increase the translation of this treatment modality.","[{'authorId': '49147541', 'name': 'D.

In doing so, we provide data that address 3 important and often overlooked research questions in the field of autism and technology, working in school-based settings with 31 autistic children from 6 to 16 years of age. First, what type of VR HMD device (and experiences therein) are preferred by children on the autism spectrum using HMDs (given possible sensory concerns). Second, how do children on the autism spectrum report the physical experience, enjoyment, and potential of VR HMDs in their classrooms? Finally, we were interested in exploring what children on the autism spectrum would like to use VR in schools for? Through a mixed methods approach, we found that costly and technologically advanced HMDs were preferred (namely: HTC Vive). In addition, HMDs were reported as being enjoyable, physically and visually comfortable, easy to use, and exciting, and children wanted to use them again. They identified several potential usages for HMDs, including relaxing/feeling calm, being able to explore somewhere virtually before visiting in the real world, and to develop learning opportunities in school. We discuss these findings in the context of VR in classrooms, in addition to considering limitations and implication of our findings.","[{'authorId': '4488906', 'name': 'N.

This study confirms a number of known affective correlates in a realistic, uncontrolled environment for the emotions of valence (or pleasure), arousal and dominance: (1) a significant decrease in frontal power in the theta range is found for increasingly positive valence, (2) a significant frontal increase in power in the alpha range is associated with increasing emotional arousal, (3) a significant right posterior power increase in the delta range correlates with increasing arousal and (4) asymmetry in power in the lower alpha bands correlates with self-reported valence. Furthermore, asymmetry in the higher alpha bands correlates with self-reported dominance. These last two effects provide a simple measure for subjective feelings of pleasure and feelings of control.","[{'authorId': '2938586', 'name': 'Boris Reuderink'}, {'authorId': '1753164', 'name': 'C.

The findings suggest that the social interaction afforded by a social networking environment was short-lived, individual-centered and casual. Communication skills and autonomy on the part of students are required to foster communication.

Experiment 1 tested the authors' predictions in an intercultural context of helping. Confirming their specific Empathy × Group Membership moderation hypothesis, empathy had a stronger effect on helping intentions when the helper and the target belonged to the same cultural group than when they belonged to different groups. Experiment 2 replicated these findings in a modified minimal group paradigm using laboratory-created groups. Moreover, this second experiment also provides evidence for the hypothesized psychological mechanisms underlying the empathy-(ingroup) helping relationship. Specifically, analyses in the ingroup condition confirmed that the strength of the empathy-(ingroup) helping relationship systematically varied as a function of perceived similarities among ingroup members.

In this paper, a new effective EEG feature named differential entropy is proposed to represent the characteristics associated with emotional states. Differential entropy (DE) and its combination on symmetrical electrodes (Differential asymmetry, DASM; and rational asymmetry, RASM) are compared with traditional frequency domain feature (energy spectrum, ES). The average classification accuracies using features DE, DASM, RASM, and ES on EEG data collected in our experiment are 84.22%, 80.96%, 83.28%, and 76.56%, respectively. This result indicates that DE is more suited for emotion recognition than traditional feature, ES. It is also confirmed that EEG signals on frequency band Gamma relates to emotional states more closely than other frequency bands. Feature smoothing method- linear dynamical system (LDS), and feature selection algorithm- minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (MRMR) algorithm also help to increase the accuracies and efficiencies of EEG-based emotion classifiers.","[{'authorId': '7899830', 'name': 'Ruo-Nan Duan'}, {'authorId': '2682019', 'name': 'Jia-Yi Zhu'}, {'authorId': '1715839', 'name': 'Bao-Liang Lu'}]",531.0,,9.0,Differential entropy feature for EEG-based emotion classification,2013.0

Dispite teacher-student conflicts are unevitable, and important consequences arise there from, teacher-student conflicts remain poorly studied. The present study aims to examine the strategies teachers use to resolve teacher-student conflicts. To investigate the process of conflict between a teacher and a student, a case study method was used. Respondents – teachers - were asked to recall a conflict occurring between them and a student during the school years, describe how the incident was handled, and the consequences of it. The number of respondents constituted 31 teachers. Their average age was 43, 6 years . By gender there were 2 males and 29 females; work experience was from 2 till 35 years. An analysis of the cases enabled to distinguish two groups of teachers’ reactions to the conflicts. One of them is focus on communication with student on the issue and discovering of the reasons of his / her behaviour. Resolving conflict in a cooperative way involves teacher’s endeavours to perceive accurately student’s positions and motivation, recognise the legitimacy of each other’s interests, and search for a solution accommodating the needs of both sides. The second group of teachers’ reactions to the conflicts manifests itself by the lack of the reflection of the motives and causes of the student’s inappropriate behaviour. Thus, recorded conflicts are considered as no n cooperative (destructive) ones. This study give insight into the role of teacher in relation to conflict resolution with student .

Instead, individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a framework. We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person's emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes--response-dependent and response-independent--that could support interpersonal regulation. This framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse, heretofore independent data on ""pieces"" of interpersonal regulation, and identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.","[{'authorId': '2268731', 'name': 'Jamil Zaki'}, {'authorId': '2055993791', 'name': 'W.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to explore the “dark nuances” of social media by identifying moral disengagement (MD) mechanisms and hostile emotions in people discussing the hosting of immigrants and examining the relationship between MD mechanisms and hostile emotions expressed online (annoyance, irritation and contempt).


Design/methodology/approach
The method was based on a psycho-lexicographical approach that analysed the in vivo real words, adopting a quanti-qualitative point of view. The investigation started from the case of a Facebook post in support of immigrants after a serious shipwreck causing the death of more than 700 would-be migrants. More than 10,000 comments were codified. For the comments against the hosting of such immigrants, the authors followed a codebook aimed at identifying MD mechanisms and hostile emotions.


Findings
The main findings show an interplay between different hostile negative emotions and online MD mechanisms. The greater the intensity of hostile emotions, the more the locus of disengagement moves from the unethical individual’s behaviour – for example, offering moral justifications – to the target recipient of such behaviour – for example, blaming or dehumanising.


Practical implications
The study could be applicable in designing and developing algorithms and technological tools aimed at preventive interventions to promote moral awareness and emotional regulation in online settings.


Social implications
The study may be a useful contribution to understanding unethical orientation by identifying areas where education can intervene in reducing harmful behavioural tendencies.


Originality/value
This study takes together expressed hostile emotions and MD mechanisms by means of the analysis of real words in vivo through social media discussions.

In recent decades this approach has brought valuable insight into the cognition of an interacting human. Automated RBSD can be used to set up a brain–computer interface (BCI) providing a novel input modality for technical systems solely based on brain activity. In BCIs the user usually sends voluntary and directed commands to control the connected computer system or to communicate through it. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach by fusing BCI technology with cognitive monitoring, providing valuable information about the users' intentions, situational interpretations and emotional states to the technical system. We call this approach passive BCI. In the following we give an overview of studies which utilize passive BCI, as well as other novel types of applications resulting from BCI technology. We especially focus on applications for healthy users, and the specific requirements and demands of this user group. Since the presented approach of combining cognitive monitoring with BCI technology is very similar to the concept of BCIs itself we propose a unifying categorization of BCI-based applications, including the novel approach of passive BCI.","[{'authorId': '36476952', 'name': 'T.

They underscore the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and amygdala in 2 broad approach-and withdrawal-related emotion systems. Components and measures of affective style are identified. Emphasis is given to affective chronometry and a role for the PFC in this process is proposed. Plasticity in the central circuitry of emotion is considered, and implications of data showing experience-induced changes in the hippocampus for understanding psychopathology and stress-related symptoms are discussed. Two key forms of affective plasticity are described–context and regulation. A role for the hippocampus in context-dependent normal and dysfunctional emotional responding is proposed. Finally, implications of these data for understanding the impact on neural circuitry of interventions to promote positive affect and on mechanisms that govern health and disease are considered. Biobehavioral scientists are increasingly recognizing the importance of emotion for the fundamental tasks of survival and adaptation (A. facilitates decision making, has significant influence on learning and memory, and provides the motivation for critical action in the face of environmental incentives. Emotion is also the stuff of individual differences. It is a key component, if not the major ingredient, for many of the fundamental dimensions of personality and vulnerability factors that govern risk for psychopathology (see Davidson, Abercrombie, Nitschke, & Putnam, 1999). Some of the most impressive evidence for brain plasticity is emotional learning (LeDoux, 1996). Plasticity in the neural circuitry underlying emotion is also likely to play an important role in understanding the impact of early environmental factors in influencing later individual differences and risk for psychopathology (Meaney et al., 1996). Moreover, plasticity in the neural circuitry underlying emotion can be recruited for therapeutic change using both nonpharmacological and pharmacological intervention (Davidson, 1994a). In this article, we provide a broad overview of the underlying biological bases of emotion with a focus on the neural circuitry at the human level. We begin with some historical background to set the stage for modern psychophysiological and neuroscientific research. The subcomponents of emotion that are suggested by these findings are highlighted. Individual differences in affective style are then considered. The different parameters of affective style that can be objectively measured are identified, and some data are reviewed to illustrate how these parameters can be assessed. Plasticity in this circuitry is then described, and the implications of these data for understanding the etiology of psychopathology and stress-related symptoms are discussed.

We report here the application of a method based on information theory that decomposes one or more ERPs recorded at multiple scalp sensors into a sum of components with fixed scalp distributions and sparsely activated, maximally independent time courses. Independent component analysis (ICA) decomposes ERP data into a number of components equal to the number of sensors. The derived components have distinct but not necessarily orthogonal scalp projections. Unlike dipole-fitting methods, the algorithm does not model the locations of their generators in the head. Unlike methods that remove second-order correlations, such as principal component analysis (PCA), ICA also minimizes higher-order dependencies. Applied to detected-and undetected-target ERPs from an auditory vigilance experiment, the algorithm derived ten components that decomposed each of the major response peaks into one or more ICA components with relatively simple scalp distributions. Three of these components were active only when the subject detected the targets, three other components only when the target went undetected, and one in both cases. Three additional components accounted for the steady-state brain response to a 39-Hz background click train. Major features of the decomposition proved robust across sessions and changes in sensor number and placement. This method of ERP analysis can be used to compare responses from multiple stimuli, task conditions, and subject states.","[{'authorId': '2952058', 'name': 'S.

Yet despite this, educational software has traditionally attempted to harness games as extrinsic motivation by using them as a sugar coating for learning content. This article tests the concept of intrinsic integration as a way of creating a more productive relationship between educational games and their learning content. Two studies assessed this approach by designing and evaluating an educational game called Zombie Division to teach mathematics to 7- to 11-year-olds. Study 1 examined the learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic, or control variants of Zombie Division for 2 hr, supported by their classroom teacher. Study 2 compared time on task for the intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice of which game to play. The results showed that children learned more from the intrinsic version of the game under fixed time limits and spent 7 times longer playing it in free-time situations. Together, these studies offer evidence for the genuine value of an intrinsic approach for creating effective educational games. The theoretical and commercial implications of these findings are discussed.","[{'authorId': '70227521', 'name': 'C. S. Nair'}, {'authorId': '144004030', 'name': 'A.

It remains unclear whether NFB can be used to aid and sustain complex emotions, with ecological validity implications. We provide a technical proof of concept of a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) NFB procedure. Using rtfMRI-NFB, we enabled participants to voluntarily enhance their own neural activity while they experienced complex emotions. The rtfMRI-NFB software (FRIEND Engine) was adapted to provide a virtual environment as brain computer interface (BCI) and musical excerpts to induce two emotions (tenderness and anguish), aided by participants' preferred personalized strategies to maximize the intensity of these emotions. Eight participants from two experimental sites performed rtfMRI-NFB on two consecutive days in a counterbalanced design. On one day, rtfMRI-NFB was delivered to participants using a region of interest (ROI) method, while on the other day using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our multimodal VR/NFB approach was technically feasible and robust as a method for real-time measurement of the neural correlates of complex emotional states and their voluntary modulation. Guided by the color changes of the virtual environment BCI during rtfMRI-NFB, participants successfully increased in real time, the activity of the septo-hypothalamic area and the amygdala during the ROI based rtfMRI-NFB, and successfully evoked distributed patterns of brain activity classified as tenderness and anguish during SVM-based rtfMRI-NFB. Offline fMRI analyses confirmed that during tenderness rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the septo-hypothalamic area and other regions ascribed to social affiliative emotions (medial frontal / temporal pole and precuneus). During anguish rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the amygdala and other dorsolateral prefrontal and additional regions associated with negative affect. These findings were robust and were demonstrable at the individual subject level, and were reflected in self-reported emotion intensity during rtfMRI-NFB, being observed with both ROI and SVM methods and across the two sites. Our multimodal VR/rtfMRI-NFB protocol provides an engaging tool for brain-based interventions to enhance emotional states in healthy subjects and may find applications in clinical conditions associated with anxiety, stress and impaired empathy among others.","[{'authorId': '4449210', 'name': 'V.

However, some patients are resistant to self-compassion. Aims To investigate whether the effects of self-identification with virtual bodies within immersive virtual reality could be exploited to increase self-compassion in patients with depression. Method We developed an 8-minute scenario in which 15 patients practised delivering compassion in one virtual body and then experienced receiving it from themselves in another virtual body. Results In an open trial, three repetitions of this scenario led to significant reductions in depression severity and self-criticism, as well as to a significant increase in self-compassion, from baseline to 4-week follow-up. Four patients showed clinically significant improvement. Conclusions The results indicate that interventions using immersive virtual reality may have considerable clinical potential and that further development of these methods preparatory to a controlled trial is now warranted.

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders vary considerably according to variables such as index subject characteristics, study setting, sampling frame, diagnostic methods used, as well as country of geographic origin. To date, most studies comprise clinical or treatment referral samples in tertiary care or subjects enrolled in clinical trials and genetic cohort collections. Such samples carry the potential for overestimation of both the frequency and severity of psychiatric comorbidity. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases restricted to population-based study publications in the English between May 1, 2015, and May 31, 2020. A comprehensive keyword list was generated to investigate co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. A wide range of DSM-5 based disorders such as anxiety, mood, ADHD, intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder, eating/feeding, gender dysphoria and sleep-wake disorders were assessed. Initial search revealed a total of 1674 articles after removal of duplicates. Two independent researchers conducted a parallel-blinded screening process to identify the eligible studies based on titles and abstracts; 39 studies were analyzed in the current review. The main findings show prevalence estimates of 22.9% (95% CI: 17.7- 29.2) for intellectual disability; 26.2% (22-31) for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 11.1% (8.6-14.1) for anxiety disorders; 19.7% (11.9-30.7) for sleep disorders; 7% (5.2- 9.3) for disruptive disorders; 2% (1.3- 3.1) for bipolar disorders; 2.7% (1.8- 4.2) for depression; 1.8% (0.4–8.7) for obsessive-compulsive disorder; and 0.6% (0.3–1.1) for psychosis. Psychiatric comorbidity in population-based studies is lower than in clinical and referred samples. However, our results also indicate that the frequency of psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with ASD in the population context is considerable, without the influence of referral bias implicit in clinical and treatment samples.

Experiment II demonstrated that this load effect was partially compensated for by high accountability. Findings support a two-stage model of utterance planning: the controlled processes of monitoring and adjustment operate on the output of a predominantly automatic stage of planning. Cognitive load impairs monitoring and adjustment, and leads to ‘standard’ utterances that are not adapted to the addressee's perspective.

The tendency for people to present a favourable image
of themselves on questionnaires is called socially
desirable responding (SDR). SDR confounds research
results by creating false relationships or obscuring
relationships between variables. Social desirability (SD)
scales can be used to detect, minimise, and correct for
SDR in order to improve the validity of questionnairebased
research. The aim of this review was to
determine the proportion of health-related studies that
used questionnaires and used SD scales and estimate
the proportion that were potentially affected by SDR.
Methods:
Questionnaire-based research studies listed on CINAHL
in 2004-2005 were reviewed. The proportion of studies
that used an SD scale was calculated. The influence of
SDR on study outcomes and the proportion of studies
that used statistical methods to control for social
desirability response bias are reported.
Results:
Fourteen thousand two hundred and seventy-five
eligible studies were identified. Only 0.2% (31) used
an SD scale. Of these, 43% found SDR influenced their
results. A further 10% controlled for SDR bias when
analysing the data. The outcomes in 45% of studies
that used an SD scale were not influenced by SDR.
Conclusions:
While few studies used an SD scale to detect or control
for SD bias, almost half of those that used an SD scale
found SDR influenced their results.
Recommendations:
Researchers using questionnaires containing socially
sensitive items should consider the impact of SDR on
the validity of their research and use an SD scale to
detect and control for SD bias.","[{'authorId': '74994746', 'name': 'van de Mortel'}, {'authorId': '52055947', 'name': 'F. Thea'}]",1596.0,,51.0,Faking it: Social desirability response bias in self-report research,2008.0

In this article, we first present an overview of IVET and review IVET-based research within psychology and other fields. Next, we propose a general model of social influence within immersive virtual environments and present some preliminary findings regarding its utility for social psychology.

The contribution of hypnosis to enhancing athletes' performance is also recognized, but the value of hypnosis in enhancing imagery has little recognition. The reason for this neglect is explored. The study used Martens' Sport Imagery Questionnaire, which asked the participants to image 4 different situations in their own sport—practicing alone, practicing in front of others, watching a teammate, and competing. Participants reported their subjective impression of vividness on four dimensions—visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and affective. The 14 athletes participating imaged each situation in and out of hypnosis—half of the time the imagery in hypnosis came first and half after. The participants reported that the imagery under hypnosis was more intense for each dimension and more intense for each situation. Whether the imagery was done under hypnosis first or after was not significant. The findings suggest that hypnosis substantially enhances imagery intensity and effectiveness.","[{'authorId': '119919604', 'name': 'Donald R.

We show how path information can be categorized and modeled using a dynamic multinomial probit model of Web browsing. We estimate this model using data from a major online bookseller. Our results show that the memory component of the model is crucial in accurately predicting a path. In comparison, traditional multinomial probit and first-order Markov models predict paths poorly. These results suggest that paths may reflect a user's goals, which could be helpful in predicting future movements at a website. One potential application of our model is to predict purchase conversion. We find that after only six viewings purchasers can be predicted with more than 40% accuracy, which is much better than the benchmark 7% purchase conversion prediction rate made without path information. This technique could be used to personalize Web designs and product offerings based upon a user's path.","[{'authorId': '1946128', 'name': 'A.

Brain oscillations represent the combined electrical activity of neuronal assemblies, usually measured as specific frequencies representing slower (delta, theta, alpha) and faster (beta, gamma) oscillations. Hypnosis has been most closely linked to power in the theta band and changes in gamma activity. These oscillations are thought to play a critical role in both the recording and recall of declarative memory and emotional limbic circuits. The authors propose that this role may be the mechanistic link between theta (and perhaps gamma) oscillations and hypnosis, specifically, that the increases in theta oscillations and changes in gamma activity observed with hypnosis may underlie some hypnotic responses. If these hypotheses are supported, they have important implications for both understanding the effects of hypnosis and for enhancing response to hypnotic treatments.","[{'authorId': '4622000', 'name': 'Stephen R.

Process evidence suggests that this phenomenon occurs because ambient light luminance influences mental alertness, which in turn influences food choices.

961e2908c80c6f1e09fb12e1390def4be5db4d93,"Schizophrenia is a devastating mental illness and is characterized by hallucinations and delusions as well as social skills deficits. Generally, social skills training designed to help patients develop social skills includes role-playing, but this form of training has typical shortcomings, which are largely due to a trainer's difficulties to project emotion. Virtual reality (VR)-based techniques have the potential to solve these difficulties, because they provide a computer-generated but realistic three-dimensional world and humanlike avatars that can provide emotional stimuli. In this paper, we report on a method of implementing virtual environments (VEs) in order to train people with schizophrenia to develop conversational skills in specific situations, which could overcome the shortcomings of or complement conventional role-playing techniques. The paper reports the efficacy of the proposed approach in a preliminary clinical trial with 10 patients with schizophrenia.","[{'authorId': '143720898', 'name': 'J.

The study of attitudes takes a central position in social psychology. Decades of research have demonstrated that attitudes are important for understanding how individuals perceive the world and how they behave.
 One of the key aspects of attitudes is their cognitive, affective, and behavioral content. That is, an individual may associate an attitude object with cognitions or beliefs, emotional reactions, and intentions or past actions. The attitude itself may also have a simple (e.g., positive or negative) structure or a more conflicted, ambivalent (e.g., simultaneously positive and negative) structure; it may serve different psychological functions (e.g., simplification of knowledge, value-expression); and it may vary in strength. Diverse techniques have been developed to measure attitudes, showing that they are useful predictors of behavior and that the strength of this link depends on diverse factors, such as how strongly the attitude is held, the individual’s personality, and the context. Overall, the long history of research on attitudes has supported their considerable theoretical and practical relevance.","[{'authorId': '8313569', 'name': 'Lukas J.

The two musical cues under investigation are tempo and rhythmic unit. The participants are asked to label music fragments by using opposite meaningful words belonging to four semantic scales, namely “Tension” (ranging from Relaxing to Stressing), “Expressiveness” (Expressionless to Expressive), “Amusement” (Boring to Amusing) and “Attractiveness” (Pleasant to Unpleasant). The participants also have to indicate how much they feel certain basic emotions while listening to each music excerpt. The rated emotions are “Happiness,” “Surprise,” and “Sadness.” This study makes it possible to draw some interesting conclusions about the associations between note value and emotions.","[{'authorId': '1405526330', 'name': 'Alicia Fernández-Sotos'}, {'authorId': '1397896370', 'name': 'A.

Hence, text and talk-in-interaction are the basic psycho-discursive practices ( Wetherell, Subjectivity 22: 7381, 2008) where the intersubjective nature of sense making is revealed. Peirce is an inspiring point of reference for psycho-semiotics also at a methodological level, since he considered not only deduction and induction as research practices able to characterize the process of scientific knowledge production, but he emphasized an inferential modality labeled abduction. Moving from such assumptions, the aim of the present paper is to introduce the notion of diatext as a reflexive way to enhance the value of this abducing procedure. Diatextual approach is a specific methodological orientation within critical discourse analysis specifically aimed at capturing the dynamics between interlocutors, text, and context which characterize any kind of human interaction. A corpus of empirical data, collected within different social contexts, will allow us to discuss and to understand how diatexts actually work as yeast for human discourses.","[{'authorId': '8766211', 'name': 'A.

However, few studies have investigated what makes a natural sound renew and re-energize people, especially in the face of significant stressors caused by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study examined the interactive mechanism towards the perceived restorative characteristics of natural soundscapes: fascination, being-away, compatibility, and extent. Two groups of data were collected in Burleigh Heads National Park, Australia, before the outbreak of COVID-19 (n = 526) and in October 2020 (n = 371). The objective measures of LAeq confirmed that the acoustic environment of Burleigh Heads National Park are quiet and peaceful for attention restoration. The results of the subject evaluation revealed that participants from the post-COVID-19 group reported higher stress levels, while there was a greater mental restoration through water sounds. There are significant differences between the pre- and post-COVID-19 groups with respect to the relationships among the perceived restorative characteristics of natural soundscapes. The direct effects of extent and fascination, as well as the mediating effects of fascination, were more significant among the post-COVID-19 group than the pre-COVID-19 group. However, the effects of being-away on compatibility were less significant in the post-COVID-19 group.

The purpose of this paper is to explore how mood can influ- ence the choice of conflict management strategies. Unlike other studies that artificially manipulate emotions, this one focuses on the differences in emotional experience that occur naturally. Results suggest that moods in- fluence the choice of conflict handling strategies. Specifically, it has been found that positive affect predicts integrating, while negative affect predicts dominating. In conclusion, it is suggested that the intrapersonal influence of emotions is particularly noticeable when people experience high-aroused affective states.","[{'authorId': '144797488', 'name': 'C.

HRT begins with developing an in-depth understanding of the client's unique pulling behaviors. The major components of HRT can then be carried out in a way that targets the client's specific needs. These include awareness training and self-monitoring, stimulus control and competing response procedures. Within each of these components the client learns to recognize his or her pulling urges, avoid situations in which pulling is more likely and adopt behaviors that can be used instead of pulling.

As various forms of art performances are recorded by the panoramic camera and broadcasted on the Internet, the impact of this new VR-based media to the viewers needs to be systematically studied. In this work, a two-level usability framework is proposed, which combines the traditional concepts of presence and the quality evaluation of art performances, aiming to systematically study the usability of such VR application. Both the conventional video and the panoramic video of a theatre performance were captured simultaneously, and were replayed to two groups of viewers in a cinematic setup and through an HMD respectively. The psychological measurement methods, including the questionnaire and the interview, as well as the psychophysical measurement methods, including the EEG and the motion capture techniques were both used in the study. The results show that the such VR application duplicates the live performance better by providing a higher sense of presence, higher engagement levels, and stronger desire to see live performance. For visual intensive performance contents, the new VR-based media can provide a better user experience.

The experimental results demonstrated that the subjects emotions had been sufficiently evoked and efficiently recognized by our system. Clinically, patients with disorder of consciousness (DOC), such as coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state and emergence minimally conscious state, suffer from motor impairment and generally cannot provide adequate emotion expressions.

98766de33c1bcaac404f4ea7969a65a7d606055e,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a very prevalent disorder in primary care (PC). Most patients with GAD never seek treatment, and those who do seek treatment often drop out before completing treatment. Although it is an understudied treatment, Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) indicate preliminary efficacy for the treatment of GAD symptoms, but many patients with GAD present other associated symptoms (e.g., attention deficits) that complicate the treatment. Virtual Reality DBT Mindfulness Skills learning has recently been developed to make learning mindfulness easier for patients with emotion dysregulation who have trouble concentrating. Virtual Reality (VR) might serve as a visual guide for practicing mindfulness as it gives patients the illusion of “being there” in the 3D computer generated world. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of two MBIs (a MBI in a group setting alone and the same MBI plus 10 min VR DBT Mindfulness skills training) to reduce GAD symptoms. A secondary aim was to explore the effect in depression, emotion regulation, mindfulness, and interoceptive awareness. Other exploratory aims regarding the use of VR DBT Mindfulness skills were also carried out. The sample was composed of 42 patients (roughly half in each group) with GAD attending PC visits. After treatment, both groups of patients showed significant improvements in General Anxiety Disorder measured by the GAD-7 using mixed regression models [MBI alone (B = -5.70; p < 0.001; d = -1.36), MBI+VR DBT Mindfulness skills (B = -4.38; p < 0.001; d = -1.33)]. Both groups also showed significant improvements in anxiety, depression, difficulties of emotion regulation and several aspects of mindfulness and interoceptive awareness. Patients in the group that received additional 10 min VR DBT Mindfulness Skills training were significantly more adherent to the treatment than those receiving only standard MBI (100% completion rate in MBI + VR vs. 70% completion rate in MBI alone; Fisher = 0.020). Although randomized controlled studies with larger samples are needed, this pilot study shows preliminary effectiveness of MBI to treat GAD, and preliminary evidence that adjunctive VR DBT Mindfulness Skills may reduce dropouts. 2.

Fear reactions in spider-phobic patients can be activated by specific perceptual cues or by conceptual fear-related information. Matching perceptual fear cues and fear-related information were expected to result in maximal fear responses, perceptual fear cues alone in less fear, and information alone in the weakest responses.


METHOD
We used virtual reality to manipulate the available cues and information. Forty-eight phobic patients and 48 healthy participants were repeatedly exposed to either a perceptual cue, information, or a combination of both.


RESULTS
In conditions with a fear-relevant perceptual cue, phobic patients reported increased fear compared to the condition with information only. Across exposures trials, these reactions diminished. Skin conductance in phobic patients was significantly higher in the combined than in the cue or the information condition.


CONCLUSIONS
Perceptual cues are essential for phobic fear reactions in spider phobia. In combination with fear-relevant information, perceptual cues activate an intense and persistent fear reaction.","[{'authorId': '2195636', 'name': 'Henrik M.

98a143857e8f815426bdb8ff71e8cd674ca91677,"Topographic EEG measures were compared in 12 adult male subjects during performance of a signal recognition task, presented at three difficulty levels. EEG data were recorded from 17 standard cortical sites, referenced to linked earlobes. Digitized mean spectral magnitude values were calculated for sequential 2 second epochs for each condition, log transformed and subjected to statistical analysis. A good and a poor performance group was established on the basis of scores registered at the highest difficulty level and confirmed statistically. Within-group comparisons showed different EEG patterns for the two performance groups, both within and across difficulty level. The poor performance group showed a progressive pattern of disengagement (increase in 8-12 Hz activity) which diminished gradually as difficulty escalated and was replaced by a pattern of increasing engagement (decrease in 8-12 Hz activity). Good performers showed the same level of engagement independent of difficulty. Performance data alone failed to differentiate between groups under low and moderate task demands. Detailed evaluation of the underlying mechanisms revealed a tendency for all subjects to develop brief periods of disengagement after each stimulus presentation. This pattern became increasingly generalized in poor performers during the low gain task but was also present at the most difficult test level. These findings provide some insight into the dynamics of Central Nervous Systems regulatory mechanisms which modulate sustained cognitive performance under varying demand conditions. They document a propensity for some individuals to become disengaged over time, thereby requiring greater cognitive resource mobilization as task demand increases. Assessment of this trait may be useful in the prediction of performance capability under high demand conditions.","[{'authorId': '32713368', 'name': 'B. Veigel'}, {'authorId': '3700987', 'name': 'M.

But tools for psychotherapy are evolving in a much more complex environment than a designer's chaise lounge. In particular, virtual reality (VR) devices have the potential for appearing soon in many consulting rooms. The use of VR in medicine is not a novelty. Applications of virtual environments for health care have been developed in the following areas: surgical procedures (remote surgery or telepresence, augmented or enhanced surgery, and planning and simulation of procedures before surgery); preventive medicine and patient education; medical education and training; visualization of massive medical databases; and architectural design for health care facilities. However, there is a growing recognition that VR can play an important role in clinical psychology, too. To exploit and understand this potential is the main goal of the Telemedicine and Portable Virtual Environment in Clinical Psychology--VEPSY Updated--a European Community-funded research project (IST-2000-25323, http://www.vepsy.com). The project will provide innovative tools-telemedicine and portable-for the treatment of patients, clinical trials to verify their viability, and action plans for dissemination of its results to an extended audience-potential users and influential groups. The project will also develop different personal computer (PC)-based virtual reality modules to be used in clinical assessment and treatment. In particular, the developed modules will address the following pathologies: anxiety disorders; male impotence and premature ejaculation; and obesity, bulimia, and binge-eating disorders.","[{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

Low-frequency noise was found to be increased at high-impedance sites relative to low-impedance sites, especially when the recording environment was warm and humid. The increased noise at the high-impedance sites caused an increase in the number of trials needed to obtain statistical significance in analyses of P3 amplitude, but this could be partially mitigated by high-pass filtering and artifact rejection. High electrode impedance did not reduce statistical power for the N1 wave unless the recording environment was warm and humid. Thus, high electrode impedance may increase noise and decrease statistical power under some conditions, but these effects can be reduced by using a cool and dry recording environment and appropriate signal processing methods.","[{'authorId': '3901250', 'name': 'E.

Thus, the current study analyzed presence, self-reported anxiety, and a physiological parameter (heart rate [HR]) in a sample of 30 high anxious and 35 low anxious participants. Both groups delivered a 5 minute speech in a virtual lecture hall. Results indicate no mediating influences of presence on group differences in self-reported state anxiety during the speech, but point toward negative correlations between state anxiety and the iGroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) scales ""sense of being there"" and ""realism."" Furthermore, HR was found to be unrelated to self-reported presence. Only the IPQ scale ""spatial presence"" showed a marginally significant influence on group differences in state anxiety. The present results support the assumption that presence and anxiety are logically distinct, meaning that presence does not directly influence the intensity of an emotion felt in a VE. Rather, it constitutes a precondition for an emotion to be at all elicited by a VE. Also, HR has proven to be no adequate substitute measure for presence, since it only assesses anxiety not presence. It may, however, mediate the interplay between trait anxiety and state anxiety. Possible implications of the current findings are discussed alongside the problem of using presence questionnaires that seem to be prone to subjective bias (i.e., participants confusing presence and emotion).","[{'authorId': '2144008', 'name': 'A.

Fifty participants aged between 18 and 35 completed the Trier Social Stress Test. They were then randomly assigned to the intervention (biofeedback game) or control group (a non-biofeedback game) for thirty minutes. Perceived stress, heart rate and mood were measured before and after participants had played the games. Results: A mixed factorial ANOVA showed a significant interaction between time and game type in predicting perceived stress [F(1,48) = 14.19, p < 0.001]. Participants in the biofeedback intervention had significantly reduced stress compared to the control group. There was also a significant interaction between time and game in predicting heart rate [F(1,48) = 6.41, p < 0.05].

The VR was associated with improvements in older adultsʻ affect and stress, relationship with their family member, and overall quality of life, compared to baseline. Family membersʻ negative affect, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden also decreased and their mental health improved after using the VR, compared to baseline. Using the VR, however, did not change their relationship with the older adult. In addition, older adults and family members who experienced the VR sessions as more socially engaging reported better psychological and relational well-being, with older adults also experiencing greater improvements in overall quality of life. Finally, preliminary results suggest that older adults with dementia and their family members might benefit even more from using the VR than older adults with MCI and their family members.","[{'authorId': '6531171', 'name': 'T.

However, recently this relationship has been called into question. Indeed, despite a link between how we perceive and how we feel about our body seeming intuitive, until now lack of an experimental method to manipulate body size has meant that a causal link, even in healthy participants, has remained elusive. Recent developments in body perception research demonstrate that the perceptual experience of the body can be readily manipulated using multisensory illusions. The current study exploits such illusions to modulate perceived body size in an attempt to influence body satisfaction. Participants were presented with stereoscopic video images of slimmer and wider mannequin bodies viewed through head-mounted displays from first person perspective. Illusory ownership was induced by synchronously stroking the seen mannequin body with the unseen real body. Pre and post-illusion affective and perceptual measures captured changes in perceived body size and body satisfaction. Illusory ownership of a slimmer body resulted in participants perceiving their actual body as slimmer and giving higher ratings of body satisfaction demonstrating a direct link between perceptual and affective body representations. Change in body satisfaction following illusory ownership of a wider body, however, was related to degree of (non-clinical) eating disorder psychopathology, which can be linked to fluctuating body representations found in clinical samples. The results suggest that body perception is linked to body satisfaction and may be of importance for eating disorder symptomology.","[{'authorId': '145115292', 'name': 'C.

Virtual reality (VR) can provide exposure to nature for those living in isolated confined environments. We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood.


METHODS
There were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality.


RESULTS
Reductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (-0.59, -0.52, and 0.32 μS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline ( 1.2 and 1.1 points), but the control scene did not ( 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect ( 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene ( 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points).


DISCUSSION
Natural scene VR provided relaxation both objectively and subjectively, and scene preference had a significant effect on mood and perception of scene quality. VR may enable relaxation for people living in isolated confined environments, particularly when matched to personal preferences.Anderson AP, Mayer MD, Fellows AM, Cowan DR, Hegel MT, Buckey JC.

The SCM previously demonstrated separate stereotype dimensions of warmth (low-high) and competence (low-high), identifying four distinct out-group clusters. The SCM predicts that only extreme out-groups, groups that are both stereotypically hostile and stereotypically incompetent (low warmth, low competence), such as addicts and the homeless, will be dehumanized. Prior studies show that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is necessary for social cognition. Functional magnetic resonance imaging provided data for examining brain activations in 10 participants viewing 48 photographs of social groups and 12 participants viewing objects; each picture dependably represented one SCM quadrant. Analyses revealed mPFC activation to all social groups except extreme (low-low) out-groups, who especially activated insula and amygdala, a pattern consistent with disgust, the emotion predicted by the SCM. No objects, though rated with the same emotions, activated the mPFC. This neural evidence supports the prediction that extreme out-groups may be perceived as less than human, or dehumanized.","[{'authorId': '3705092', 'name': 'L.

The present investigation compared the effect of behavioral realism on users' nonverbal behavior, self-presence, social presence, and interpersonal attraction during a dyadic interaction. Fifty-one dyads (aged 18 to 26) embodied either a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands and inferred arm movements, an avatar consisting of only a floating head and mapped hands, or a static full-bodied avatar. Planned contrasts compared the effect of behavioral realism against no behavioral realism, and compared the effect of low versus high behavioral realism. Results show that participants who embodied the avatar with only a floating head and hands experienced greater social presence, self-presence, and interpersonal attraction than participants who embodied a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands. In contrast, there were no significant differences on these measures between participants in the two mapped-hands conditions and those who embodied a static avatar. Participants in the static-avatar condition rotated their own physical head and hands significantly less than participants in the other two conditions during the dyadic interaction. Additionally, side-to-side head movements were negatively correlated with interpersonal attraction regardless of condition.

The latter, in the forefront of which are exposure and response prevention techniques, are likely to benefit from the rise of virtual reality (VR). However, very few studies have been conducted on the use of VR in OCD and these suffer from several limitations including a lack of ecological validity. This proof of concept study aims to evaluate a personalised exposure protocol using immersive video in a patient suffering from severe and resistant OCD. This protocol consisted of 15 weekly sessions of exposure via a VR headset to 360° immersive videos filmed from the subject’s viewpoint in their own environment. Besides the high acceptability of the immersive device, our patient exhibited a therapeutic response with a reduction in emotional responses measured by skin conductance recording, a reduction in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. This study thus provided promising results in a patient initially refractory to conventional treatments. Replication of these results on a sufficiently large group of patients would place personalised immersive 360o video exposure as a technique of choice in the therapeutic arsenal for OCD due to its cost-effectiveness and high acceptability.","[{'authorId': '14114642', 'name': 'B.

Little is known, however, about whether emotion regulation also has cognitive consequences. A process model of emotion suggests that expressive suppression should reduce memory for emotional events but that reappraisal should not. Three studies tested this hypothesis. Study 1 experimentally manipulated expressive suppression during film viewing, showing that suppression led to poorer memory for the details of the film. Study 2 manipulated expressive suppression and reappraisal during slide viewing. Only suppression led to poorer slide memory. Study 3 examined individual differences in typical expressive suppression and reappraisal and found that suppression was associated with poorer self-reported and objective memory but that reappraisal was not. Together, these studies suggest that the cognitive costs of keeping one's cool may vary according to how this is done.","[{'authorId': '46307979', 'name': 'J.

In this context, it is increasingly common for preschool schools to incorporate students with special educational needs, including those with Down syndrome. These inclusion cases have been sparsely documented, so an investigation was proposed whose main objective was to know the characteristics of the teaching practice of those who work with these students. This approach was generated from four dimensions: personal, interpersonal, institutional and didactic. A qualitative research perspective and case study method were adopted. Three educators with experience in inclusion to students with Down syndrome participated. The technique used was the semi-structured interview, the data were categorized inductively. It was identified that teachers: have conceptual clarity in inclusive education and barriers to learning and participation; are looking for continuous training spaces for a relevant practice; emphasize the leadership as favorable for an inclusive education; its didactic planning privileges learning for life with the use of teaching materials; emphasize the importance of taking care of the student's location in the classroom, as well as following work routines; develop a qualitative evaluation of learning and promote collaborative work with parents and regular classroom support services. The research allows teachers to analyze efforts to attend students with relevance, through the self-training and support of the school community.","[{'authorId': '2126895139', 'name': 'Nayeli Lormendez Trujillo'}, {'authorId': '2126917748', 'name': 'Amanda Cano Ruíz'}]",3.0,,61.0,"Educación inclusiva de preescolares con síndrome de Down: la mirada de un grupo de educadoras de Veracruz, México",2020.0

An AAC system was devised in order to generate a stimulus set covering nine discrete sectors of a two-dimensional emotion space by means of a 16-channel feed-forward artificial neural network. This system was used to generate a stimulus set of short pieces of music, which were rendered using a sampled piano timbre and evaluated by a group of experienced listeners who ascribed a two-dimensional valence-arousal coordinate to each stimulus. The underlying musical feature set, initially drawn from the literature, was subsequently adjusted by amplifying or attenuating the quantity of each feature in order to maximize the spread of stimuli in the valence-arousal space before a second listener evaluation was conducted. This process was repeated a third time in order to maximize the spread of valence-arousal coordinates ascribed to the generated stimulus set in comparison to a spread taken from an existing prerated database of stimuli, demonstrating that this prototype AAC system is capable of creating short sequences of music with a slight improvement on the range of emotion found in a stimulus set comprised of real-world, traditionally composed musical excerpts.","[{'authorId': '2109421853', 'name': 'Duncan A.

For this reason, many authors are exploring how to induce relevant emotions and to improve the level of involvement in the interactive experience. In order to mediate the affective response several authors state that there is a mutual relationship between emotion and cognition. This vision suggests that it is possible to manipulate the emotional response by using two different strategies focused on cognitive and affective factors: matching expectations or defining specific goals and interpretations. By combining these strategies, our study aimed to test the impact of the characteristics of an interactive media virtual reality (VR) on the affective state of the participants. In particular, we simultaneously manipulated the background narrative and the ecological features of the virtual environment (VE). We also assessed the effects on user’s affective response by combining self-report evaluations and physiological measurements.

The purpose of this paper is to review the emerging VR applications developed for the evaluation and treatment of patients with neurological diseases. We start by discussing the impact of novel VR tasks that encourage and facilitate the patient's empowerment and involvement in the rehabilitation process. Then, a systematic review was carried out on six well-known electronic libraries using the terms: “Virtual Reality AND Neurorehabilitation,” or “Head Mounted Display AND Neurorehabilitation.” This review focused on fully-immersive VR systems for which 12 relevant studies published in the time span of the last five years (from 2014 to 2019) were identified. Overall, this review paper examined the use of VR in certain neurological conditions such as dementia, stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis. Most of the studies reveal positive results suggesting that VR is a feasible and effective tool in the treatment of neurological disorders. In addition, the finding of this systematic literature review suggested that low-cost, immersive VR technologies can prove to be effective for clinical rehabilitation in healthcare, and home-based setting with practical implications and uses. The development of VR technologies in recent years has resulted in more accessible and affordable solutions that can still provide promising results. Concluding, VR and interactive devices resulted in the development of holistic, portable, accessible, and usable systems for certain neurological disease interventions. It is expected that emerging VR technologies and tools will further facilitate the development of state of the art applications in the future, exerting a significant impact on the wellbeing of the patient.","[{'authorId': '2932471', 'name': 'Eirini C.

In a single-factor repeated-measures experiment, we manipulated the degree of illusory embodiment and assessed the emotional responses to virtual stimuli. We presented emotional stimuli in the same environment as the virtual body. Participants experienced higher arousal, dominance, and more intense valence in the high embodiment condition compared to the low embodiment condition. The illusion of embodiment thus intensifies the emotional processing of the virtual environment.

The scope of the present contribution is to extend the discourse on VR use to promote relaxation, by proposing a third approach. This would be based on VR with personalized content, based on user research to identify important life events. As a second step, distinctive features of such events may be rendered with symbols, activities or other virtual environments contents.

The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computer-controlled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases tele-presence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.","[{'authorId': '40372043', 'name': 'Kristine L.

This synchronicity is also the main underlying mechanism for information integration and processing in the brain. Clinical medicine has found that some of the neurological diseases that are difficult to cure have deficiencies or abnormalities in the whole or local integration processes of the brain. By studying the synchronization capabilities of the brain-network, we can intensively describe and characterize both the state of the interactions between brain regions and their differences between people with a mental illness and a set of controls by measuring the rapid changes in brain activity in patients with psychiatric disorders and the strength and integrity of their entire brain network. This is significant for the study of mental illness. Because static brain network connection methods are unable to assess the dynamic interactions within the brain, we introduced the concepts of dynamics and variability in a constructed EEG brain functional network based on dynamic connections, and used it to analyze the variability in the time characteristics of the EEG functional network. We used the spectral features of the brain network to extract its synchronization features and used the synchronization features to describe the process of change and the differences in the brain network's synchronization ability between a group of patients and healthy controls during a working memory task. We propose a method based on the fusion of traditional features and spectral features to achieve an adjustment of the patient's brain network synchronization ability, so that its synchronization ability becomes consistent with that of healthy controls, theoretically achieving the purpose of the treatment of the diseases. Studying the stability of brain network synchronization can provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanism and cure of mental diseases and has a wide range of potential applications.","[{'authorId': '1473172040', 'name': 'Haifang Li'}, {'authorId': '1473243199', 'name': 'Rong Yao'}, {'authorId': '11043987', 'name': 'Xiaoluan Xia'}, {'authorId': '41051414', 'name': 'Guimei Yin'}, {'authorId': '49981745', 'name': 'Hongxia Deng'}, {'authorId': '2000516353', 'name': 'Pengfei Yang'}]",4.0,,58.0,Adjustment of Synchronization Stability of Dynamic Brain-Networks Based on Feature Fusion,2019.0

Ryff, is the essence of psychological adaptation of the child to school. The research was aimed at exploring the conditions of psychological adaptation to school in chidlren as a process that promotes psychological well-being at this age. The research goals were as follows: to explore the character and dynamics of school adaptation in first-graders; to compare the notions of successful adaptation in teachers and parents; to study the relationship between successful psychological adaptation to school and a) the features of the internal position of student, b) the type of parenting style. The sample consisted of 122 first-graders (7—8 years old) and 110 parents. It was empirically proven that all components of psychological well-being in primary school children, namely: positive relations in the form of cooperation in joint educational activities with the teacher and peers; self-acceptance represented in the form of internal position of student as self-identification with the social role of the student; competence as mastering the means of learning activity and autonomy as an independent implementation of the latter; important goals in the form of meaningful acceptance of learning objectives; personal growth, expressed in the content and pace of individual progress in personal and metacognitive development — all these are determined by the psychological readiness of teachers and parents to transform their relationships with the child and to establish adequate forms of educational cooperation. It is argued that disharmonious types of parenting styles interfere with the child’s psychological adaptation to school.","[{'authorId': '97748019', 'name': 'O.

Indeed, there is evidence that HRI is more likely to be accepted by the user if it is sensitive towards the user’s affective states, as expression and understanding of emotions facilitate to complete the mutual sympathy in human communication. To approach the affective human-robot interface, one of the most important prerequisites is a reliable emotion recognition system which guarantees acceptable recognition accuracy, robustness against any artifacts, and adaptability to practical applications. Emotion recognition is an extremely challenging task in several respects. One of the main difficulties is that it is very hard to uniquely correlate signal patterns with a certain emotional state because even it is difficult to define what emotion means in a precise way. Moreover, it is the fact that emotion-relevant signal patterns may widely differ from person to person and from situation to situation. Gathering “ground-truth” dataset is also problematical to build a generalized emotion recognition system. Therefore, a number of assumptions are generally required for engineering approach to emotion recognition. Most research on emotion recognition so far has focused on the analysis of a single modality, such as speech and facial expression (see (Cowie et al., 2001) for a comprehensive overview). Recently some works on emotion recognition by combining multiple modalities are reported, mostly by fusing features extracted from audiovisual modalities such as facial expression and speech. We humans use several modalities jointly to interpret emotional states in human communication, since emotion affects almost all modes, audiovisual (facial expression, voice, gesture, posture, etc.), physiological (respiration, skin temperature etc.), and contextual (goal, preference, environment, social situation, etc.) states. Hence, one can expect higher recognition rates through the integration of multiple modalities for emotion recognition. On the other hand, however, more complex classification and fusion problems arise. In this chapter, we concentrate on the integration of speech signals and physiological measures (biosignals) for emotion recognition based on a short-term observation. Several advantages can be expected when combining biosensor feedback with affective speech.

Multivariate source-separation analysis methods have been particularly effective at improving signal-to-noise ratio while reducing the dimensionality of the data, and are widely used for cleaning, classifying, and source-localizing multichannel neural time series data. Most source-separation methods produce a spatial component (that is, a weighted combination of channels to produce one time series); here, this is extended to apply sourceseparation to a time series, with the idea of obtaining a weighted combination of successive time points, such that the weights are optimized to satisfy some criteria. This is achieved via a two-stage source-separation procedure, in which an optimal spatial filter is first constructed, and then its optimal temporal basis function is computed. This second stage is achieved with a time-delay-embedding matrix, in which additional rows of a matrix are created from time-delayed versions of existing rows. The optimal spatial and temporal weights can be obtained by solving a generalized eigendecomposition of covariance matrices. The method is demonstrated in simulated data and in an empirical EEG study on theta-band activity during response conflict. Spatiotemporal source separation has several advantages, including defining empirical filters without the need to apply sinusoidal narrowband filters.","[{'authorId': '2249969957', 'name': 'Michael X.

Among the main consequences of chronic and excessive alcohol use are cognitive and executive deficits. Some of these deficits may be reversed in specific cognitive and executive domains with behavioral approaches consisting of cognitive training. The advent of computer-based interventions may leverage these improvements, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of digital interactive-based interventions are still scarce. Objective The aim of this study is to explore whether a cognitive training approach using VR exercises based on activities of daily living is feasible for improving the cognitive function of patients with AUD undergoing residential treatment, as well as to estimate the effect size for this intervention to power future definitive RCTs. Methods This study consisted of a two-arm pilot RCT with a sample of 36 individuals recovering from AUD in a therapeutic community; experimental group participants received a therapist-guided, VR-based cognitive training intervention combined with treatment as usual, and control group participants received treatment as usual without cognitive training. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery of tests was used both at pre- and postassessments, including measurement of global cognition, executive functions, attention, visual memory, and cognitive flexibility. Results In order to control for potential effects of global cognition and executive functions at baseline, these domains were controlled for in the statistical analysis for each individual outcome. Results indicate intervention effects on attention in two out of five outcomes and on cognitive flexibility in two out of six outcomes, with effect sizes in significant comparisons being larger for attention than for cognitive flexibility. Patient retention in cognitive training was high, in line with previous studies. Conclusions Overall, the data suggest that VR-based cognitive training results in specific contributions to improving attention ability and cognitive flexibility of patients recovering from AUD.

Here we demonstrate that a virtual limb can be made to feel part of your body if appropriate multisensory correlations are provided. We report an illusion that is invoked through tactile stimulation on a person's hidden real right hand with synchronous virtual visual stimulation on an aligned 3D stereo virtual arm projecting horizontally out of their shoulder. An experiment with 21 male participants showed displacement of ownership towards the virtual hand, as illustrated by questionnaire responses and proprioceptive drift. A control experiment with asynchronous tapping was carried out with a different set of 20 male participants who did not experience the illusion. After 5 min of stimulation the virtual arm rotated. Evidence suggests that the extent of the illusion was also correlated with the degree of muscle activity onset in the right arm as measured by EMG during this period that the arm was rotating, for the synchronous but not the asynchronous condition. A completely virtual object can therefore be experienced as part of one's self, which opens up the possibility that an entire virtual body could be felt as one's own in future virtual reality applications or online games, and be an invaluable tool for the understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying body ownership.","[{'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

The proposed internalization model of reflective emotion regulation argues that caregivers’ co-regulation of emotionally challenging events plays a constitutive role for the development of 4- to 6-year-olds’ reflective emotion regulation. The model specifies the gradual shift from co- to self-regulation by focusing on two important ways how caregivers structure emotionally challenging interactions: Through emotion talk, caregivers promote the development of preschoolers’ emotional awareness. Once established, they support children in establishing a repertoire of effective emotion regulation strategies and they guide preschoolers’ emerging skills to generate, evaluate, and select from alternative appraisals or behavioral responses.","[{'authorId': '115964516', 'name': 'Judith Rebecca Silkenbeumer'}, {'authorId': '2052760391', 'name': 'Eva-Maria Schiller'}, {'authorId': '6051757', 'name': 'Manfred Holodynski'}, {'authorId': '4185170', 'name': 'Joscha Kärtner'}]",23.0,,87.0,The role of co-regulation for the development of social-emotional competence,2016.0

A novel virtual reality and motion-assisted exposure therapy, called 3MDR, provides treatment in an immersive, personalized and activating context. Objective: To study the efficacy of 3MDR for veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Method: In a randomized controlled trial (n = 43) 3MDR was compared to a non-specific treatment component control group. Primary outcome was clinician-rated PTSD symptoms at baseline, after 3MDR, and at the 12-week and 16-week follow-up (primary end point). Intention-to-treat analyses of covariance and mixed models were applied to study differences between groups at the end point and over the course of intervention, controlling for baseline scores. Results: The decrease in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to end point was significantly greater for 3MDR as compared to the control group, with a large effect size (F[1, 37] = 6.43, p = 0.016, d = 0.83). No significant between-group difference was detected in the course of PTSD symptoms during treatment when including all time points. The dropout rate was low (7%), and 45% of the patients in the 3MDR group improved clinically. The number needed to treat was 2.86. Conclusions: In this trial, 3MDR significantly decreased PTSD symptoms in veterans with, on average, a history of 4 unsuccessful treatments. The low dropout rate may be indicative of high engagement. However, a lack of significant differences on secondary outcomes limits conclusions that can be drawn on its efficacy and underlines the need for larger phase III trials. These data show emerging evidence for 3MDR and its potential to progress PTSD treatment for veterans (Dutch Trial Register Identifier: NL5126).","[{'authorId': '41037107', 'name': 'M.

Here we utilize neural responses in the electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked by multiple presentations of short film clips to index brain states marked by high levels of correlation within and across subjects. We formulate a novel signal decomposition method which extracts maximally correlated signal components from multiple EEG records. The resulting components capture correlations down to a one-second time resolution, thus revealing that peak correlations of neural activity across viewings can occur in remarkable correspondence with arousing moments of the film. Moreover, a significant reduction in neural correlation occurs upon a second viewing of the film or when the narrative is disrupted by presenting its scenes scrambled in time. We also probe oscillatory brain activity during periods of heightened correlation, and observe during such times a significant increase in the theta band for a frontal component and reductions in the alpha and beta frequency bands for parietal and occipital components. Low-resolution EEG tomography of these components suggests that the correlated neural activity is consistent with sources in the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Put together, these results suggest that the observed synchrony reflects attention- and emotion-modulated cortical processing which may be decoded with high temporal resolution by extracting maximally correlated components of neural activity.","[{'authorId': '143764752', 'name': 'J.

These children had presented with total lack of awareness of their scalp hair pulling behaviors until they had actually twisted and pulled off clumps of hair. It was also suggested, under hypnosis, that upon learning to recognize impending scalp hair pulling behaviors, the patients would become free to choose to willfully pull their hair or to resist the impulse and not pull. At no point was the explicit suggestion given that they stop pulling their hair. A preliminary condition was agreed to by the parents that redefined the patients' hair as their own property and affirmed their sole responsibility for its care and maintenance. An element of secondary gain was identified in each of these cases. Scalp hair pulling was hypothesized to provide these particular patients with a vehicle with which to oppose their overbearing and over-involved parents. The technique of direct suggestion under hypnosis, aimed at alerting the patients to impending scalp hair pulling behaviors was combined with forming contracts with the parents to relinquish their authority over matters regarding the patients' hair. This combination provided an effective treatment that extinguished the scalp hair pulling in 7 visits or less. These cases received follow-up at intervals up to 6 months and no evidence of relapse was found.","[{'authorId': '117157356', 'name': 'Alex Iglesias'}]",13.0,,44.0,Hypnosis as a Vehicle for Choice and Self-Agency in the Treatment of Children with Trichotillomania,2003.0

The computer vision-based techniques depend on the traits captured by image sensors such as facial expressions, gesture and posture analysis, and gaze direction. The physiological and neurological signal based approach depends on the sensor data, like heart rate (HR), electroencephalogram (EEG), blood pressure (BP), and galvanic skin response (GSR). A brief analysis of the available datasets for Engagement Recognition and its features are also summarized. This study highlights a few commercially available wearables which provides the physiological signals that helps in student’s attentivity recognition.

To investigate the feasibility of a novel collaborative multiplayer methodology, we created Space Connection, a videogame to promote empathy in teenagers. Space Connection depicts a futuristic adventure aboard a spaceship in which players have to jointly use their powers to solve a set of physics-based puzzles. The game relies on the use of physiological self-regulation to activate the playing partner powers. Using a low-cost brain computer interface and a respiration rate sensor we provided players with two game powers, namely telekinesis and timemanipulation which are mapped to changes in attention and relaxation. In this paper we describe the game mechanics in three different scenarios: i) the cryogenic room, ii) the space ship corridor and iii) the cargo hold. Finally, we performed a feasibility study with 10 users (aged 22.2 ± 5.6) to evaluate the game experience. Results revealed high scores in enjoyment and empathy but low scores on interface control.

A biometric sensor network (BSN) consisting of web cameras, a wall-mounted camera and a high-performance computing machine was designed to capture students’ head poses, eye gaze, body movements, and facial emotions. These low-level features are used to train an AI-based model to estimate the behavioral and emotional engagement in the class environment. A set of experiments was conducted to compare the proposed technology with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

Spaces can affect both the acoustic properties of the sound event itself and may also impose boundaries to the actions one can take with respect to this event. Virtual acoustic rooms of different sizes were used in a subjective and psychophysiological experiment that evaluated the influence of the auditory space perception on emotional responses to various sound sources. Participants (N = 20) were exposed to acoustic spaces with sound source positions and room acoustic properties varying across the experimental conditions. The results suggest that, overall, small rooms were considered more pleasant, calmer, and safer than big rooms, although this effect of size seems to disappear when listening to threatening sound sources. Sounds heard behind the listeners tended to be more arousing, and elicited larger physiological changes than sources in front of the listeners. These effects were more pronounced for natural, compared to artificial, sound sources, as confirmed by subjective and physiological measures.","[{'authorId': '1398935536', 'name': 'A.

Eleven nonphobic participants were exposed to each virtual environment for 15 min. Heart rate, skin resistance, and skin temperature were measured during physiological monitoring, and the Presence and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire scores were obtained after each exposure. This study found that skin resistance and heart rate variability can be used to show arousal of participants exposed to the virtual environment experience and that such measures generally returned to normal over time. The data suggest that skin resistance and heart rate can be used as objective measures in monitoring the reaction of non-phobic participants to virtual environments.

Adolescent substance users face serious health and social consequences and benefit from early diagnosis and treatment. The objectives of this study were to observe trends in treatment utilization; examine correlates of treatment utilization and treatment types/settings among adolescent substance users with and without substance use disorder (SUD); and assess gender differences.


METHODS
National Survey on Drug Use and Health data were pooled across 2002 to 2013, with a combined sample of 79,885 past-year substance users ages 12 to 17 (17,510 with SUD and 62,375 without SUD). Treatment was defined as receiving treatment or counseling for use of alcohol or any drug, not counting cigarettes. Trends were assessed by joinpoint linear regression, and multivariable logistic regression assessed odds ratios of treatment utilization.


RESULTS
Percentages of past-year treatment use did not change in 2002 to 2013. Treatment utilization was more prevalent among adolescents with SUD than without (11.4% vs. 1.4%) and among males than females. Among adolescents with and without SUD, criminal justice involvement and perceiving a need for treatment increased adolescent treatment utilization, while SUDs other than alcohol abuse, older age, and talking to parents increased treatment use among adolescents with SUD, and polysubstance use and male gender increased treatment among those without SUD. Treatment gaps persisted among non-Hispanic Blacks for both groups with and without SUD, male Hispanics with SUD, female non-Hispanic Asians without SUD, and private insurance coverages. Gender differences were observed in SUD, race/ethnicity, and insurance coverage. Most adolescents received treatment for both alcohol and drug use, and self-help group and outpatient rehabilitation facility were the most used treatment settings.


CONCLUSIONS
Treatment utilization among adolescents with past-year substance use remained low and unimproved in 2002 to 2013. Treatment gaps among minority populations, insurance coverage, and in educating adolescents on seeking relevant treatment must be addressed. Using screening processes such as Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment, health professionals can help prevent lifelong SUD by recognizing and addressing substance misuse early.","[{'authorId': '5787943', 'name': 'Sarah P.

Self-reported emotional eating has been associated with physical-health concerns. However, experimental studies indicate that negative-mood inductions do not reliably lead to increased eating in healthy eaters, not even among those with a high desire to eat when emotional. We argue that experimental studies will help us understand emotional eating only if they account for the following ideas: (a) Emotional eating may require that people learn to associate emotion with eating, (b) emotional eating may follow only specific discrete emotions, and (c) emotional eating may depend on social context. Each of these points suggests a fruitful direction for future research. Specifically, future studies must acknowledge, identify, and account for variations in the extent to which people have learned to associate emotions with eating; assess or elicit strong discrete emotions; and systematically examine the effect of social context on emotional eating.","[{'authorId': '72625509', 'name': 'G.

To extract the original expectation of mind, emotion recognition and classification is essential. But due to some complexities, the proper recognition of human emotion from Electroencephalogram (EEG) has become too much challenging. In this paper, we propose a system of emotion recognition from EEG signal based on Discrete Wavelet Transform. The most significant features (i) Wavelet Energy and (ii) Wavelet Entropy are calculated for detecting four different emotions namely happy, angry, sad and relaxed. Firstly we rearranged the prepossessed data properly by selecting the proper channel and sub-band. The extracted features are then trained in the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to classify emotion separately. Our proposed method showed 78.7±2.6% sensitivity, 82.8±6.3% specificity and 62.3±1.1% accuracy on the internationally authorized ‘DEAP’ database.","[{'authorId': '2302197', 'name': 'M.

a175e706365b61558b081aa4400ba29c7276114d,"Background Electrophysiological recordings contain mixtures of signals from distinct neural sources, impeding a straightforward interpretation of the sensor-level data. This mixing is particularly detrimental when distinct sources resonate in overlapping frequencies. Fortunately, the mixing is linear and instantaneous. Multivariate source separation methods may therefore successfully separate statistical sources, even with overlapping spatial distributions. New Method We demonstrate a feature-guided multivariate source separation method that is tuned to narrowband frequency content as well as binary condition differences. This method — comparison scanning generalized eigendecomposition, csGED — harnesses the covariance structure of multichannel data to find directions (i.e., eigenvectors) that maximally separate two subsets of data. To drive condition specificity and frequency specificity, our data subsets were taken from different task conditions and narrowband-filtered prior to applying GED. Results To validate the method, we simulated MEG data in two conditions with shared noise characteristics and unique signal. csGED outperformed the best sensor at reconstructing the ground truth signals, even in the presence of large amounts of noise. We next applied csGED to a published empirical MEG dataset on visual perception vs. imagery. csGED identified sources in alpha, beta, and gamma bands, and successfully separated distinct networks in the same frequency band. Comparison with Existing Method(s) GED is a flexible feature-guided decomposition method that has previously successfully been applied. Our combined frequency- and condition-tuning is a novel adaptation that extends the power of GED in cognitive electrophysiology. Conclusions We demonstrate successful condition-specific source separation by applying csGED to simulated and empirical data.","[{'authorId': '1601268933', 'name': 'Marrit B.

a1b744ed3ee78ee9a6ae89792f3ed2bec7536f0b,"IntroductionPlay refers to an activity that is predominantly pleasurable. For many children, there is no other meaning to it than just enjoying yourself, alone or in the company of others. In other words, the motivation for play is purely intrinsic, and implies active engagement. It provides children with the opportunity for escaping reality, setting new rules and exploring new avenues, extending their world and possibilities without the serious consequences of taking risks. This perceived sense of freedom and safety encourages children to discover, practice and master their competencies without the fear of failure, and therefore contributes to their adaptive functioning and well-being (e.g., Lester & Russell, 2010; Pellegrini, 2009).The premise that play promotes healthy child development is well established among professionals and academics (e.g., Burdette & Whitaker, 2005; Ginsburg, 2007). In particular, the American Academy of Pediatrics (2007) advocates that parents should prioritize child-directed and non-structured free play (from here on referred to as free play), over adult-driven play. Apparently, in adult-driven play children tend to conform to adults' norms, which may restrain them from exploring the effectiveness and adjustment of their behaviors. Conversely, when it is the child who chooses when, how and with whom to play, directing the playtime without external constraints, there are more opportunities to follow his/her own interests, and to practice novel skills and domains, which often implies making decisions under risks and uncertainty (e.g., Gray, 2011; Hurwitz, 2003).Despite its critical role in child development, there has been a reduction of time and opportunities for free play. Over the past half century, children's free time has declined severely in many countries in Europe and the developed countries. In a recent international survey, Play Report (2010), almost three quarters of the surveyed parents agreed that they do not have enough time to play with their children, with Portuguese parents reporting the highest levels of agreement, along with Chinese. From 1981 to 1997 children lost 25% of time for free play (Hofferth, 2009). In 2008, 25% of Los Angeles' kindergarten teachers reported that their children had no time available for free play (Miller & Almon, 2009).One of the reasons for this serious decrease in free play is the current trend of institutionalizing children's free time with early stimulation and structured enrichment activities, which are believed to guarantee academic success in children. On the other hand, this decrease coincides with the rise of parents' safety concerns, particularly in those neighborhoods where road traffic, strangers or violence demand adults' constant supervision of children's playtime (Ginsburg, 2007). Even when children do have unscheduled time and safe places to play, they often engage in screen activities than in free play (Schwarzmueller & Rinaldo, 2013).The decline of play time, has been accompanied by a decline in young people's mental health, and these decreases are believed to be connected (Gray, 2011). Indeed, persistent absence of free play is believed to negatively affect children's development (Pellis & Pellis, 2006). However, to date, only scarce empirical data has examined this relationship. Much of the research comes from studies with rats, showing that depriving an animal from play brings harmful effects in terms of emotional regulation deficits, failures in social interactions and externalizing behavior (Hol, Van den Berg, Van Ree, & Spruijt, 1999; Pellis & Pellis, 2006; Pellis & Pellis, 2007; Spinka, Newberry, & Bekoff, 2001; Van den Berg et al., 1999). Given the obvious ethical issues of replicating these studies with children, there is a lack of research on the impact of a deficit in free playtime on children's development (Lester & Russell, 2010). In a pilot study with young people who had committed homicide, Brown (1998) revealed that 90% of them reported play deprivation and/or major play abnormalities in their childhood, compared to 10% of the non-homicidal comparison group. …","[{'authorId': '35525456', 'name': 'Guida Veiga'}, {'authorId': '39737670', 'name': 'C.

It is widely believed that growing training sets and models should improve accuracy and result in better products. As DL application domains grow, we would like a deeper understanding of the relationships between training set size, computational scale, and model accuracy improvements to advance the state-of-the-art. 
This paper presents a large scale empirical characterization of generalization error and model size growth as training sets grow. We introduce a methodology for this measurement and test four machine learning domains: machine translation, language modeling, image processing, and speech recognition. Our empirical results show power-law generalization error scaling across a breadth of factors, resulting in power-law exponents---the ""steepness"" of the learning curve---yet to be explained by theoretical work. Further, model improvements only shift the error but do not appear to affect the power-law exponent. We also show that model size scales sublinearly with data size. These scaling relationships have significant implications on deep learning research, practice, and systems. They can assist model debugging, setting accuracy targets, and decisions about data set growth. They can also guide computing system design and underscore the importance of continued computational scaling.","[{'authorId': '3130228', 'name': 'Joel Hestness'}, {'authorId': '46617804', 'name': 'Sharan Narang'}, {'authorId': '2774880', 'name': 'Newsha Ardalani'}, {'authorId': '2040049', 'name': 'G.

a1db2dc1a766c31a86ac5cd2760d3b29522bc6c1,"In 1890, William James hypothesized that emotions are our perception of physiological changes. Many different theories of emotion have emerged since then, but it has been demonstrated that a specifically induced physiological state can influence an individual's emotional responses to stimuli. In the present study, auditory and/or vibrotactile heartbeat stimuli were presented to participants (N = 24), and the stimuli's effect on participants' physiological state and subsequent emotional attitude to affective pictures was measured. In particular, we aimed to investigate the effect of the perceived distance to stimuli on emotional experience. Distant versus close sound reproduction conditions (loudspeakers vs. headphones) were used to identify whether an ""embodied"" experience can occur in which participants would associate the external heartbeat sound with their own. Vibrotactile stimulation of an experimental chair and footrest was added to magnify the experience. Participants' peripheral heartbeat signals, self-reported valence (pleasantness) and arousal (activation) ratings for the pictures, and memory performance scores were collected. Heartbeat sounds significantly affected participants' heartbeat, the emotional judgments of pictures, and their recall. The effect of distance to stimuli was observed in the significant interaction between the spatial location of the heartbeat sound and the vibrotactile stimulation, which was mainly caused by the auditory-vibrotactile interaction in the loudspeakers condition. This interaction might suggest that vibrations transform the far sound condition (sound via loudspeakers) in a close-stimulation condition and support the hypothesis that close sounds are more affective than distant ones. These findings have implications for the design and evaluation of mediated environments.","[{'authorId': '1398935536', 'name': 'A. Tajadura-Jiménez'}, {'authorId': '2166897', 'name': 'A.

The design was a case study, 12 weeks intervention, with no follow-up. The setting was a university research laboratory. The participants were a referred sample of three children with cerebral palsy, age 7-12, all male. All completed the intervention. Participants trained on the Rutgers Ankle CP system for 36 rehabilitation sessions (12 weeks, three times/week), playing two custom virtual reality games. The games were played while participants were seated, and trained one ankle at-a-time for strength, motor control, and coordination. The primary study outcome measures were for impairment (DF/PF torques, DF initial contact angle and gait speed), function (GMFM), and quality of life (Peds QL). Secondary outcome measures relate to game performance (game scores as reflective of ankle motor control and endurance). Gait function improved substantially in ankle kinematics, speed and endurance. Overall function (GMFM) indicated improvements that were typical of other ankle strength training programs. Quality of life increased beyond what would be considered a minimal clinical important difference. Game performance improved in both games during the intervention. This feasibility study supports the assumption that game-based robotic training of the ankle benefits gait in children with CP. Game technology is appropriate for the age group and was well accepted by the participants. Additional studies are needed however, to quantify the level of benefit and compare the approach presented here to traditional methods of therapy.","[{'authorId': '50059207', 'name': 'G.

Experiment 2 revealed the same confirmatory responses for participants performing a concurrent distracter task, indicating that induced mood states suppress reasoning by depleting central executive resources.

Artificial intelligence masters poker Computers can beat humans at games as complex as chess or go. In these and similar games, both players have access to the same information, as displayed on the board. Although computers have the ultimate poker face, it has been tricky to teach them to be good at poker, where players cannot see their opponents' cards. Moravčík et al. built a code dubbed DeepStack that managed to beat professional poker players at a two-player poker variant called heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. Instead of devising its strategy beforehand, DeepStack recalculated it at each step, taking into account the current state of the game. The principles behind DeepStack may enable advances in solving real-world problems that involve information asymmetry. Science, this issue p. 508 Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker, the quintessential game of imperfect information, is a long-standing challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect-information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated, with statistical significance, professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce strategies that are more difficult to exploit than prior approaches.","[{'authorId': '35208406', 'name': 'Matej Moravcík'}, {'authorId': '8649018', 'name': 'Martin Schmid'}, {'authorId': '2625574', 'name': 'Neil Burch'}, {'authorId': '1759154', 'name': 'V.

a21d16d4404503555820cdf67e3e08fc3fa460fb,"Virtual realities are a set of emerging electronic technologies, with applications in a wide range of fields. This includes education, training, athletics, industrial design, architecture and landscape architecture, urban planning, space exploration, medicine and rehabilitation, entertainment, and model building and research in many fields of science (Aukstalnis, & Blatner, 1992; Earnshaw, Vince, Guedj, & Van Dam, 2001; Hamit, 1993; Helsel, 1992a, 1992b, 1992c; Helsel & Roth, 1991; Hillis, 1999; Mayr, 2001; Middleton, 1992; Pimentel & Teixiera, 1992; Rheingold, 1991; Vince, 1998). Virtual reality (VR) can be defined as a class of computer-controlled multisensory communication technologies that allow more intuitive interactions with data and involve human senses in new ways. Virtual reality can also be defined as an environment created by the computer in which the user feels present (Jacobson, 1993a). This technology was devised to enable people to deal with information more easily. VR provides a different way to see and experience information, one that is dynamic and immediate. It is also a tool for modelbuilding and problem solving. VR is potentially a tool for experiential learning. The virtual world is interactive; it responds to the user’s actions. Virtual reality evokes a feeling of immersion, a perceptual and psychological sense of being in the digital environment presented to the senses. The sense of presence or immersion is a critical feature distinguishing virtual reality from other types of computer applications. An excellent extensive set of web links for companies involved with the production of virtual reality technologies, applications, and consulting services is available at http://www.cyberedge.com/4f.html. Virtual reality is a new type of computer tool that adds vast power to scientific visualization. Buxton (1992) explains that “Scientific visualization involves the graphic rendering of complex data in a way that helps make pertinent aspects and relationships within the data more salient to the viewer. The idea is to tailor the visual presentation to take better advantage of the human ability to recognize patterns and see structures” (p. 27). However, as Erickson (1993) explains, the word “visualization” is really too narrow when considering virtual reality. “Perceptualization” is probably more appropriate. With virtual reality, sound and touch, as well as visual appearance, may be used effectively to represent data. Perceptualization involving the sense of touch may include both tactile feedback (passive touch, feeling surfaces and textures) and haptic feedback (active touch, where there is a sense of force feedback, pressure, or resistance) (Brooks, 1988; Delaney, 2000; Dowding, 1991; Hon, 1991, 1992; Marcus, 1994; McLaughlin, Hespanha, & Sukhatme, 2001; Minsky, 1991; Sorid, 2000). The key to visualization is in representing information in ways that can engage any of our sensory systems and thus draw on our extensive experience in organizing and interpreting sensory input (Erickson, 1993). The term Virtual Reality was coined by Jaron Lanier one of the developers of the first immersive interface devices (Hall, 1990). Virtual often denotes the computer-generated counterpart of a physical object: a “virtual room,” a “virtual glove,” a “virtual chair.” Other terms such as “virtual worlds,” “virtual environments,” and “cyberspace” are used as global terms to identify this technology. For example, David Zelter of the MIT Media Lab suggests that the term “virtual environments” is more appropriate than virtual reality since virtual reality, like artificial intelligence, is ultimately unattainable (Wheeler, 1991). But virtual reality remains the most commonly used generic term (although many researchers in the field vehemently dislike this term). Virtual reality provides a degree of interactivity that goes beyond what can be found in traditional multimedia programs. Even a sophisticated multimedia program, such as the Palenque DVI program, which features simulated spatial exploration of an ancient Mayan pyramid, is limited to predetermined paths. With a virtual world you can go anywhere and explore any point of view.","[{'authorId': '116264688', 'name': 'Karen Petroski'}]",67.0,,238.0,Virtual realities,2018.0

a2647209f947b1eae63550849346e5da2aeffda6,"The person-centred approach to dementia care emerges from a new emphasis on the experience of the person with dementia. The person is seen as attempting to manage and cope with their difficulties, through a variety of coping mechanisms. Some are able to seek to maximize their cognitive capacities, and there are a number of strategies now available to assist in this process. However, the emotional aspects merit increased attention, with more awareness needed of the range of powerful emotions that may be present, and of the possibility of therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Many of the difficult behaviours seen in dementia may be understood more fully with an appreciation of their emotional underpinning, in feelings of anger, fear, insecurity and hopelessness. The interaction between caregiver strain and challenging behaviour also merits further exploration. The person-centred approach has many implications for practice, as well as for research. The perspective of the person with dementia, and outcomes reflecting that perspective, must be represented in research studies in dementia care. Caregivers, whether family members or paid workers, require additional support in order to recognize the person's needs and to meet them in ways which enable the person's identity and full human value to be upheld.","[{'authorId': '38321997', 'name': 'R.

The results provide strong evidence that positive emotions and appraisals correlate significantly in daily life. Importantly, we found that the positive emotions’ overlap on theoretically relevant, as compared to irrelevant, appraisals was stronger and more predictive of their co-occurrence. Furthermore, appraisal overlap on theoretically relevant appraisals predicted the co-occurrence of positive emotions even when the appraisal of pleasantness was excluded, indicating that positive emotions do not co-occur just by virtue of their shared valence.

This can be detrimental for teachers’ health but the effects of such inauthentic emotion expressions on students are largely unexplored. In two exploratory studies we investigated the impact of teachers’ emotions and emotional authenticity (expressing truly felt emotions) on students’ emotions of enjoyment, anger, and anxiety. In study 1 we used generalised (trait-level) assessments from teachers (N = 81) and students (N = 786) on emotions and emotional authenticity. As emotions are dynamic in nature, we further used the experience sampling method with a randomly chosen subsample (N = 128 students) in study 2 to assess momentarily perceived teacher emotional authenticity and students’ emotions in the classroom. In study 1 we found teachers’ and students’ self-reported enjoyment (but not anger and anxiety) to be interrelated. In study 2, all three (perceived) teacher emotions were related to students’ emotions. Further, in both studies students’ perceptions of their teachers’ emotional authenticity related to their own emotions. Although teachers’ self-reported and students’ perceived emotional authenticity did not converge, the results show that emotional authenticity matters to students.

a39d7f10cbb02db057ad81272828202797edcdea,"Background Intervention programs to promote physical activity in older adults, either in group or home settings, have shown equivalent health outcomes but different results when considering adherence. Group-based interventions seem to achieve higher participation in the long-term. However, there are many factors that can make of group exercises a challenging setting for older adults. A major one, due to the heterogeneity of this particular population, is the difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a technology-based intervention that enable online group exercises in older adults with different levels of skills. Methods A total of 37 older adults between 65 and 87 years old followed a personalized exercise program based on the OTAGO program for fall prevention, for a period of eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a tablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to the Control group, representing the traditional individual home-based training program, or the Social group, representing the online group exercising. Pre- and post- measurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes. Results After the eight-weeks training program there were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in terms of physical outcomes, given the high level of adherence of both groups. Considering the baseline measures, however, the results suggest that while in the Control group fitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case for the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For psychological outcomes there were improvements on both groups, regardless of the application used. There was no significant difference between groups in social wellbeing outcomes, both groups seeing a decrease in loneliness despite the presence of social features in the Social group. However, online social interactions have shown to be correlated to the decrease in loneliness in the Social group. Conclusion The results indicate that technology-supported online group-exercising which conceals individual differences in physical skills is effective in motivating and enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter individuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together despite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise might reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context. However, results from this pilot are limited to a small sample size and therefore are not conclusive. Longer term interventions with more participants are instead recommended to assess impacts on wellbeing and behavior change.","[{'authorId': '144791489', 'name': 'Marcos Báez'}, {'authorId': '10010597', 'name': 'I.

a3d65b1124feb59518472c7ad3b90ab88b9aa10b,"ABSTRACT Introduction: Depersonalisation and derealisation disorders refer to feelings of detachment and dissociation from one’s “self” or surroundings. A reduced sense of self (or “presence”) and emotional “numbness” is thought to be mediated by aberrant emotional processing due to biases in self-referent multi-sensory integration. This emotional “numbing” is often accompanied by suppressed autonomic arousal to emotionally salient stimuli. Methods: 118 participants completed the Cambridge Depersonalisation scale [Sierra, & Berrios, 2000. The Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale: A new instrument for the measurement of depersonalisation. Psychiatry Research, 93, 153–164)] as an index of dissociative anomalous experience. Participants took part in a novel “Implied Body-Threat Illusion” task; a pantomimed injection procedure conducted directly onto their real body (hand). Objective psychophysiological data were recorded via standardised threat-related skin conductance responses and finger temperature measures. Results: Individuals predisposed to depersonalisation/derealisation revealed suppressed skin conductance responses towards the pantomimed body-threat. Although the task revealed a reliable reduction in finger temperature as a fear response, this reduction was not reliably associated with measures of dissociative experience. Conclusions: The present findings significantly extend previous research by revealing emotional suppression via a more direct body-threat task, even for sub-clinical groups. The findings are discussed within probabilistic and predictive coding frameworks of multi-sensory integration underlying a coherent sense of self.","[{'authorId': '4974132', 'name': 'Hayley Dewe'}, {'authorId': '34657206', 'name': 'Derrick G.

Close interpersonal distance (IPD) increases emotional responses during interaction and has been related to avoidance behavior in social anxiety. However, a systematic investigation of the effects of IPD on subjective experience combined with measures of physiological arousal and behavioral responses during real-time social interaction has been missing. Virtual Reality allows for a controlled manipulation of IPD while maintaining naturalistic social encounters. The present study investigates IPD in social interaction using a novel paradigm in Virtual Reality. Thirty-six participants approached virtual agents and engaged in short interactions. IPD was varied between 3.5 and 1 m by manipulating the distance at which agents reacted to the participant's approach. Closer distances were rated as more arousing, less pleasant, and less natural than longer distances and this effect was significantly modulated by social anxiety scores. Skin conductance responses were also increased at short distances compared to longer distances. Finally, an interaction of IPD and social anxiety was observed for avoidance behavior, measured as participants' backward motion during interaction, with stronger avoidance related to close distances and high values of social anxiety.

a4732dbeb3275472bc0eaf6d31de3aa6c865c057,"ABSTRACT Memories for events can be retrieved from visual perspectives that were never experienced, reflecting the dynamic and reconstructive nature of memories. Characteristics of memories can be altered when shifting from an own eyes perspective, the way most events are initially experienced, to an observer perspective, in which one sees oneself in the memory. Moreover, recent evidence has linked these retrieval-related effects of visual perspective to subsequent changes in memories. Here we examine how shifting visual perspective influences the accuracy of subsequent memories for complex events encoded in the lab. Participants performed a series of mini-events that were experienced from their own eyes, and were later asked to retrieve memories for these events while maintaining the own eyes perspective or shifting to an alternative observer perspective. We then examined how shifting perspective during retrieval modified memories by influencing the accuracy of recall on a final memory test. Across two experiments, we found that shifting visual perspective reduced the accuracy of subsequent memories and that reductions in vividness when shifting visual perspective during retrieval predicted these changes in the accuracy of memories. Our findings suggest that shifting from an own eyes to an observer perspective influences the accuracy of long-term memories.","[{'authorId': '11019541', 'name': 'Petra Marcotti'}, {'authorId': '4698298', 'name': 'Peggy L.

Recent advances in affective computing, however, allow for the detection of such states and give us tools to tackle the connected problems within automotive user interfaces. We see potential in building a system which reacts upon possibly dangerous driver states and influences the driver in order to drive more safely. We compare different interaction approaches for an affective automotive interface, namely Ambient Light, Visual Notification, a Voice Assistant, and an Empathic Assistant. Results of a simulator study with 60 participants (30 each with induced sadness/anger) indicate that an emotional voice assistant with the ability to empathize with the user is the most promising approach as it improves negative states best and is rated most positively. Qualitative data also shows that users prefer an empathic assistant but also resent potential paternalism. This leads us to suggest that digital assistants are a valuable platform to improve driver emotions in automotive environments and thereby enable safer driving.","[{'authorId': '2059598559', 'name': 'Michael Braun'}, {'authorId': '2059452452', 'name': 'Jonas Schubert'}, {'authorId': '1781197', 'name': 'Bastian Pfleging'}, {'authorId': '1693046', 'name': 'Florian Alt'}]",54.0,,62.0,Improving Driver Emotions with Affective Strategies,2019.0

It is shown that gradually since the end of the 60s of the XX century, the socio-economic and public sphere is turning to invest in education and health, indicators of well-being are being developed. Within the framework of the economy of well-being, it is shown that contributions to the quality of life enhance economic development. The analysis of the wide-scale PISA project shows an increasing body of data on the well-being of schoolchildren. It is shown that over the course of six successive waves of the PISA project, research interest has expanded from recording academic achievements in different countries to indicators of the quality of the educational environment and then to discussing the well-being of schoolchildren. Initially, the characteristics of the school environment were analyzed as factors that contribute to improving academic achievement. Since 2015, well-being has been studied as such, recognizing the importance of a student's well-being and experiences outside of their relationship to achievement. The well-being of schoolchildren is described as a set of its components such as cognitive, psychological, social, physical, and material. The article states that this turn indicates a significant change in the “education” construct itself: it is now considered not only as a preparation for the future life through the achievement of educational results by the student, but also as a part of the life cycle, valuable in itself.","[{'authorId': '72740396', 'name': 'K.

A new 13-item scale has been developed for measuring severity of illness in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia, the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (P & A). The scale has five subscales covering the main factors that reduce quality of life in panic disorder patients (panic attacks, avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, disability and worries about health). The application of this scale in a double-blind placebo-controlled panic disorder trial is described. At the same time, the aim of the study was to compare the therapeutic effects of aerobic exercise with a treatment of well-documented efficacy.


METHODS
Patients with Panic disorder (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to three treatment modalities: running (n=45), clomipramine (n=15) or placebo (n=15). Treatment efficacy was measured with the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (P & A) and other rating scales.


RESULTS
According to the P & A and other scales, both exercise and clomipramine led to a significant decrease of symptoms in comparison to placebo treatment. Clomipramine was significantly more effective and improved anxiety symptoms significantly earlier than exercise. The evaluation of the P & A subscales revealed that exercise exerted its effect mainly reducing anticipatory anxiew and panic-related disability.


CONCLUSIONS
The new Panic and Agoraphobia Scale was shown to be sensitive to differences between different panic treatments. Analysis of the scales five subscores may help to understand mechanisms of action of panic disorder treatments.","[{'authorId': '5849184', 'name': 'B. Bandelow'}, {'authorId': '5051661', 'name': 'A.

To investigate social impairment in girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), compare the social functioning of boys and girls with ADHD, and explore the association between social dysfunction and conditions comorbid with ADHD.


METHOD
Four groups of index children were studied: 267 children (127 girls) with ADHD and 234 non-ADHD comparison children (114 girls). Groups were compared on social functioning, psychopathology, and demographic characteristics.


RESULTS
Girls with ADHD manifested significant deficits in interpersonal functioning compared with girls without ADHD and evidenced a similar degree of social impairment compared with boys with ADHD. ADHD and associated comorbid disorders were significant correlates of specific domains of social dysfunction in boys and girls with ADHD.


CONCLUSIONS
Interpersonal deficits are a major correlate of ADHD, irrespective of gender, and appear to stem from the behaviors associated with ADHD as well as behaviors characteristic of conditions comorbid with ADHD.","[{'authorId': '47624965', 'name': 'R.

In similar circumstances, younger people would use digital technologies to stay occupied and connected, but few elderly citizens have this capability. Our research investigates the ways that the social wellbeing of elderly citizens, wherever they reside, can be enhanced by their use of information and communications technologies (ICT), particularly digital technologies. A 2-year action research study of the social use of ICT by residents in aged-care facilities was conducted in order to determine how developing digital capabilities could enhance their wellbeing. Research interventions included the establishment of computer kiosks in aged-care facilities and weekly classes for developing ICT skills. As their digital capability improved, many of the elderly residents were observed to engage in meaningful computer-based activities of their own choosing. A set of themes among these activities was identified: connection, self-worth/esteem and personal development, productivity, occupation, self-sufficiency, being in control, and enjoyment. Our results are consistent with recently reported domains of social wellbeing among recipients of community-based aged-care services: (a) social participation and involvement, (b) occupation, (c) control over daily life and (d) dignity.","[{'authorId': '143812974', 'name': 'H.

In contrast to this widely held view, we provide evidence that the prospect of enduring pain and exerting effort for a prosocial cause can promote contributions to the cause. Specifically, we show that willingness to contribute to a charitable or collective cause increases when the contribution process is expected to be painful and effortful rather than easy and enjoyable. Across five experiments, we document this “martyrdom effect,” show that the observed patterns defy standard economic and psychological accounts, and identify a mediator and moderator of the effect. Experiment 1 showed that people are willing to donate more to charity when they anticipate having to suffer to raise money. Experiment 2 extended these findings to a non-charity laboratory context that involved real money and actual pain. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the martyrdom effect is not the result of an attribute substitution strategy (whereby people use the amount of pain and effort involved in fundraising to determine donation worthiness). Experiment 4 showed that perceptions of meaningfulness partially mediate the martyrdom effect. Finally, Experiment 5 demonstrated that the nature of the prosocial cause moderates the martyrdom effect: the effect is strongest for causes associated with human suffering. We propose that anticipated pain and effort lead people to ascribe greater meaning to their contributions and to the experience of contributing, thereby motivating higher prosocial contributions. We conclude by considering some implications of this puzzling phenomenon. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[{'authorId': '3448518', 'name': 'Christopher Y.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Factor analyses of a new questionnaire supported a 4-factor model of emotion regulation strategies, including passivity, expressing emotions, seeking emotional information or support, and solving the problem. Results suggest that age differences in emotion regulation (such as older adults' increased endorsement of passive emotion regulation relative to young adults) are partially due to older adults' decreased ability to integrate emotion and cognition, increased prioritization of emotion regulation goals, and decreased tendency to express anger.","[{'authorId': '5373056', 'name': 'A.

Other scales were administered to assess convergent and discriminant validity, and sensitivity to change was evaluated in a study of fluvoxamine. Each item was frequently endorsed across a range of severity. Good interrater reliability, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency were obtained. BDD-YBOCS scores correlated with global severity scores but not with a measure of general psychopathology; they were modestly positively correlated with depression severity scores. Three factors accounted for 59.6 percent of the variance. The scale was sensitive to change in BDD severity. The BDD-YBOCS appears to be a reliable and valid measure of BDD severity and is a suitable outcome measure in treatment studies of BDD.","[{'authorId': '35180852', 'name': 'K.

To answer this question, we investigated whether these spaces refer to a similar or different physical distance. Methodology Participants provided reachability-distance (for potential action) and comfort-distance (for social processing) judgments towards human and non-human virtual stimuli while standing still (passive) or walking toward stimuli (active). Principal Findings Comfort-distance was larger than other conditions when participants were passive, but reachability and comfort distances were similar when participants were active. Both spaces were modulated by the social valence of stimuli (reduction with virtual females vs males, expansion with cylinder vs robot) and the gender of participants. Conclusions These findings reveal that peripersonal reaching and interpersonal comfort spaces share a common motor nature and are sensitive, at different degrees, to social modulation. Therefore, social processing seems embodied and grounded in the body acting in space.","[{'authorId': '1902889', 'name': 'T. Iachini'}, {'authorId': '3200187', 'name': 'Y.

The use of virtual reality has recently been proposed for the treatment of various psychiatric conditions, including the spectrum of schizophrenia. Our review aims to investigate the current available evidence regarding the use of immersive virtual reality in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. (2) Methods: From April 2019 to June 2020, we conducted a systematic review aimed at identifying therapeutic applications in immersive virtual reality for the spectrum of schizophrenia, searching for relevant studies on Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINHAL. (3) Results: We identified a total of 2601 unique records. Of these, 64 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and six out of these met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final systematic review. (4) Conclusions: The available data on immersive virtual reality are currently limited due to the few studies carried out on the topic; however, it has demonstrated its effectiveness and versatility in successfully treating various psychotic symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, or cognitive and social skills. Existing literature agrees on safe, tolerable, and long-term persistence of the therapeutic effects obtained by immersive VR. No serious side effects have been reported. In some specific cases, VR therapy was found to be very effective compared to usual treatment, allowing effective drug free interventions, and therefore without side effects for patients, even in those resistant to normal drug therapies.","[{'authorId': '1909721327', 'name': 'Emanuele Bisso'}, {'authorId': '39934347', 'name': 'M.

In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ( $\approx 15$  years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.","[{'authorId': '3035541', 'name': 'Klaus Greff'}, {'authorId': '2100612', 'name': 'R.

a7b70d7828a744890d12215f99c6587c61c9ed48,"Abstract Self-control involves the inhibition of behavior motivated by short-term reward. Self-control is generally considered to be critical to health and well-bring. However, from an evolutionary standpoint, inhibiting short-term reward may not always be functional. We suggest that the functionality of maintaining or ceasing inhibitory self-control is highly context-dependent. We have elsewhere proposed the dual component theory of inhibition regulation (DCTIR). The DCTIR proposes a functional processing mechanism that determines whether to continue or cease inhibitory self-control. According to the DCTIR, the functionality of continued application of inhibition is conditional on the availability of resources and stability of the environment. To test these predictions, we developed an online game called “Food Quest,” in which participants are asked to imagine that they are on a journey. They are faced with the decision of whether or not to engage in a behavior with a short-term reward but with a long-term cost. The game environment is manipulated by varying game lifespan as well as the distribution and prevalence of resources. Results were consistent with predictions from the DCTIR that self-control was more functional in environments characterized by longevity and plentiful resources, but not in more dangerous, highly variable environments. Implications and future directions are discussed.","[{'authorId': '40063863', 'name': 'Joshua J. Reynolds'}, {'authorId': '3455503', 'name': 'Sean M.

a7d8c8f8e9c381b258ecbbec6c7a7c436f72372c,"BACKGROUND: Medical procedures often evoke pain and anxiety in pediatric patients. Virtual reality (VR) is a relatively new intervention that can be used to provide distraction during, or to prepare patients for, medical procedures. This meta-analysis is the first to collate evidence on the effectiveness of VR on reducing pain and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing medical procedures. METHODS: On April 25, 2018, we searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO with the keywords “VR,” “children,” and “adolescents.” Studies that applied VR in a somatic setting with participants ≤21 years of age were included. VR was defined as a fully immersive 3-dimensional environment displayed in surround stereoscopic vision on a head-mounted display (HMD). We evaluated pain and anxiety outcomes during medical procedures in VR and standard care conditions. RESULTS: We identified 2889 citations, of which 17 met our inclusion criteria. VR was applied as distraction (n = 16) during venous access, dental, burn, or oncological care or as exposure (n = 1) before elective surgery under general anesthesia. The effect of VR was mostly studied in patients receiving burn care (n = 6). The overall weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) for VR was 1.30 (95% CI, 0.68–1.91) on patient-reported pain (based on 14 studies) and 1.32 (95% CI, 0.21–2.44) on patient-reported anxiety (based on 7 studies). The effect of VR on pediatric pain was also significant when observed by caregivers (SMD = 2.08; 95% CI, 0.55–3.61) or professionals (SMD = 3.02; 95% CI, 0.79–2.25). For anxiety, limited observer data were available. CONCLUSIONS: VR research in pediatrics has mainly focused on distraction. Large effect sizes indicate that VR is an effective distraction intervention to reduce pain and anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing a wide variety of medical procedures. However, further research on the effect of VR exposure as a preparation tool for medical procedures is needed because of the paucity of research into this field.","[{'authorId': '46469459', 'name': 'R.

Methods: Data were collected using a mixed methods approach: quantatively, using a pre and post test measure using two previously validated tools together with qualitative reflections related to the immersive learning experience. Results: The quantitative aspect of the study demonstrated that the immersive experience solidified the already positive attitude that the participants had towards mental health and to empathy. The qualitative findings demonstrate that immersive learning brought an awareness of being empathic to the fore. Conclusions: The findings provide evidence regarding the impact of immersive learning as a pedagogical approach.

In the current clinical practice, the psychiatric diagnosis is made through clinician-administered rating scales and questionnaires, disregarding the potential contribution provided by physiological signs. The aim of this paper is to investigate how changes in the autonomic nervous system activity can be correlated with clinical mood swings. More specifically, a group of ten bipolar patients underwent an emotional elicitation protocol to investigate the autonomic nervous system dynamics, through the electrodermal activity (EDA), among different mood states. In addition, a control group of ten healthy subjects were recruited and underwent the same protocol. Physiological signals were analyzed by applying the deconvolutive method to reconstruct EDA tonic and phasic components, from which several significant features were extracted to quantify the sympathetic activation. Experimental results performed on both the healthy subjects and the bipolar patients supported the hypothesis of a relationship between autonomic dysfunctions and pathological mood states.","[{'authorId': '145254408', 'name': 'A.

A randomized controlled trial (n = 138) was conducted to test the effectiveness of a biofeedback video game (Dojo) for adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety. Adolescents (11–15 years old) were randomly assigned to play Dojo or a control game (Rayman 2: The Great Escape). Initial screening for anxiety was done on 1,347 adolescents in five high schools; only adolescents who scored above the “at-risk” cut-off on the Spence Children Anxiety Survey were eligible. Adolescents’ anxiety levels were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and at three month follow-up to examine the extent to which playing Dojo decreased adolescents’ anxiety. The present study revealed equal improvements in anxiety symptoms in both conditions at follow-up and no differences between Dojo and the closely matched control game condition. Latent growth curve models did reveal a steeper decrease of personalized anxiety symptoms (not of total anxiety symptoms) in the Dojo condition compared to the control condition. Moderation analyses did not show any differences in outcomes between boys and girls nor did age differentiate outcomes. The present results are of importance for prevention science, as this was the first full-scale randomized controlled trial testing indicated prevention effects of a video game aimed at reducing anxiety. Future research should carefully consider the choice of control condition and outcome measurements, address the potentially high impact of participants’ expectations, and take critical design issues into consideration, such as individual- versus group-based intervention and contamination issues.","[{'authorId': '48156000', 'name': 'H.

EEG data that were recorded on smartphone in both outdoors and indoors conditions were used for evaluation (N = 27). A direct comparison between the original ASR and Riemannian ASR (rASR) was conducted for three performance measures: reduction of eye-blinks (sensitivity), improvement of visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) (specificity), and computation time (efficiency).

We propose that people differ in their negative affect valuation (NAV; the extent to which negative affective states are valued as pleasant, useful/helpful, appropriate, and meaningful experiences) and that affect-health links are moderated by NAV. These predictions were tested in a life span sample of 365 participants ranging from 14-88 years of age using reports of momentary negative affect and physical well-being (via experience sampling) and assessments of NAV and psychosocial and physical functioning (via computer-assisted personal interviews and behavioral measures of hand grip strength). Our study demonstrated that the more individuals valued negative affect, the less pronounced (and sometimes even nonexistent) were the associations between everyday experiences of negative affect and a variety of indicators of poorer psychosocial functioning (i.e., emotional health problems, social integration) and physical health (i.e., number of health conditions, health complaints, hand grip strength, momentary physical well-being). Exploratory analyses revealed that valuing positive affect was not associated with the analogous moderating effects as NAV. These findings suggest that it may be particularly important to consider NAV in models of affect-health links.","[{'authorId': '3221271', 'name': 'G. Luong'}, {'authorId': '4721060', 'name': 'C.

Secondly, the reasoning method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were introduced into the multi system, and a kind of multi emotion decision model based on the emotion reasoning was constructed. The hierarchical structure method was used to solve the complex decision problem of the humanoid robot in the intelligent home environment. Then, based on the emotion energy theory, a mood state regulation algorithm based on the combination of HMM-based spontaneous transfer and stimulus transfer was established. In addition, on this basis, the design and implementation of humanoid robot associative memory model was realized. Finally, the theory and algorithm were integrated into the interactive platform of human-computer expression, and the validity of the model was analysed and verified. The results showed that, on this robot platform, the process of human-computer interaction and cooperation which integrated emotion evaluation, emotional decision, associative memory and emotion regulation was realized. As a result, the computer emotion decision based on artificial intelligence can be well applied in many fields.","[{'authorId': '3450230', 'name': 'Yiliang Shi'}, {'authorId': '2116685685', 'name': 'Cong Li'}]",5.0,"{'name': '2018 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Intelligent Systems (ICVRIS)', 'pages': '293-295'}",9.0,Exploration of Computer Emotion Decision Based on Artificial Intelligence,2018.0

a99cb2bfe2e5edad41d10578158ada3f1f59b254,"Man and technology seem to co-evolve into a process of reciprocal conditioning. On the one hand, the man modifies (and evolves) the technology according to his needs, on the other the technology revolutionates the man and the way in which it lives. Psychology, therefore, as a discipline afferent to the human sciences, is called to take an interest in this relationship and to understand its complexity. A fundamental role in this sense is covered by “cyberpsychology” which investigates all those psychological phenomena that are associated with technology and aims to analyse the processes of change triggered by the interaction between man and the new media. From the psychological point of view, if on the one hand it is important to understand how man changes in contact with the new technologies and to what problems he is meeting. On the other hand, there is a need to understand how new technologies, given their transformative potential, can find a place within the therapeutic practice. In this regard, some of the technologies used in the clinical field have been analysed including: virtual reality, biosensors, artificial intelligence and affective computing. With the aim of understanding to what extent and how technological progress and the emergence of new technologies can contribute and generate value within the psychological panorama. Following the PRISMA statement a bibliographic research was carried out, which provided for consultation of the Medline and PsycINFO databases. The criteria according to which works have been selected rather than others refer to their precision and sensitivity with which they propose to treat technological applications in the field of health psychology and from this the emergence of the new theme “CYBER HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY”. The results of the research suggest that the integrated use of psychological techniques and new technologies is extremely productive in terms of potential improvement of health and therefore of “health empowerment”. In this vision, new technologies are not intended to replace traditional procedures but to integrate them by making available features and potential that man does not have in nature. Given the great potential of the instruments analyzed that still today continue to evolve and refine it is advisable to know them, validate their effectiveness and adapt our operational models to new realities.","[{'authorId': '3528448', 'name': 'P.

The present study aims to investigate the effect of Gross model-based emotion regulation training on the reduction of craving beliefs in drug-addicted people. Methods The present study was a quasi-experimental design. This was a pre- and post-test design that consisted of control and experimental groups. The study population comprised all addicted individuals who visited addiction treatment clinics in Marivan, Iran. About 30 drug-addicted individuals by the random selection method were chosen. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups. Results were analyzed by univariate covariance analysis. Findings Gross model-based emotion regulation training reduced signs and beliefs associated with temptation in drug-addicted people (P < 0.05). Conclusion Considering the present study’s findings, we recommend that addiction treatment centers teach strategies of emotion regulation to drug-addicted people by establishing workshops with the intent to reduce temptation signs.","[{'authorId': '8116098', 'name': 'Hamed Choopan'}, {'authorId': '8171249', 'name': 'S.

aa402eecb2de77e41436e33a7b1468bd481feae3,"This study sought to challenge prevalent accounts of emotional eating by exploring the effects of situation-dependent emotions on consumers’ food craving. Four specific game situations in the context of spectator sports, each corresponding to the four types of emotional coping (outcome-desire conflict, avoidance, fulfillment, and pursuit), were identified as follows: decisive victories, decisive losses, close victories, and close losses. By employing laboratory-based virtual reality spectatorship, Study 1 tested the causal effects of happiness (fulfillment), anger (conflict), sadness (conflict), fear (avoidance), and hope (pursuit) on food craving. Study 2 further designed fans’ previous association between emotions and eating as a moderating mechanism in the context of online sport viewership. The results of the two experiments supported the three theoretical principles of eating behavior, including the “food as fuel” principle of anger, the hedonic eating principle of happiness, and the self-regulation principle of hope. However, the results rejected the escape awareness principle of sadness and fear. The study concludes with a discussion of context-dependent emotional positioning and intervention strategies for marketers and policy makers.","[{'authorId': '103655777', 'name': 'Yonghwan Chang'}]",1.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '12'}",54.0,Effects of Game Situation-Dependent Emotions on Sport Spectators’ Food Craving,2021.0

While meditation programs draw inspiration from Buddhist textual sources for the benefits of meditation, these sources also acknowledge a wide range of other effects beyond health-related outcomes. The Varieties of Contemplative Experience study investigates meditation-related experiences that are typically underreported, particularly experiences that are described as challenging, difficult, distressing, functionally impairing, and/or requiring additional support. A mixed-methods approach featured qualitative interviews with Western Buddhist meditation practitioners and experts in Theravāda, Zen, and Tibetan traditions. Interview questions probed meditation experiences and influencing factors, including interpretations and management strategies. A follow-up survey provided quantitative assessments of causality, impairment and other demographic and practice-related variables. The content-driven thematic analysis of interviews yielded a taxonomy of 59 meditation-related experiences across 7 domains: cognitive, perceptual, affective, somatic, conative, sense of self, and social. Even in cases where the phenomenology was similar across participants, interpretations of and responses to the experiences differed considerably. The associated valence ranged from very positive to very negative, and the associated level of distress and functional impairment ranged from minimal and transient to severe and enduring. In order to determine what factors may influence the valence, impact, and response to any given experience, the study also identified 26 categories of influencing factors across 4 domains: practitioner-level factors, practice-level factors, relationships, and health behaviors. By identifying a broader range of experiences associated with meditation, along with the factors that contribute to the presence and management of experiences reported as challenging, difficult, distressing or functionally impairing, this study aims to increase our understanding of the effects of contemplative practices and to provide resources for mediators, clinicians, meditation researchers, and meditation teachers.","[{'authorId': '35258461', 'name': 'Jared R.

However, the particular spatial layouts created to represent time may differ across cultures. This paper examines whether people automatically access and use culturally specific spatial representations when reasoning about time. In Experiment 1, we asked Hebrew and English speakers to arrange pictures depicting temporal sequences of natural events, and to point to the hypothesized location of events relative to a reference point. In both tasks, English speakers (who read left to right) arranged temporal sequences to progress from left to right, whereas Hebrew speakers (who read right to left) arranged them from right to left, replicating previous work. In Experiments 2 and 3, we asked the participants to make rapid temporal order judgments about pairs of pictures presented one after the other (i.e., to decide whether the second picture showed a conceptually earlier or later time-point of an event than the first picture). Participants made responses using two adjacent keyboard keys. English speakers were faster to make ""earlier"" judgments when the ""earlier"" response needed to be made with the left response key than with the right response key. Hebrew speakers showed exactly the reverse pattern. Asking participants to use a space-time mapping inconsistent with the one suggested by writing direction in their language created interference, suggesting that participants were automatically creating writing-direction consistent spatial representations in the course of their normal temporal reasoning. It appears that people automatically access culturally specific spatial representations when making temporal judgments even in nonlinguistic tasks.","[{'authorId': '2588198', 'name': 'Orly Fuhrman'}, {'authorId': '1806966', 'name': 'L.

It is the fourth-most common psychiatric illness and a leading cause of disability. OCD is associated with significant impairment in functioning, quality of life and disability. If untreated, OCD is a chronic illness with a waxing and waning of symptoms. A recent meta-analysis of long-term naturalistic prospective studies demonstrated that nearly a half of patients experience remission with much higher rates of remission in Indian patients compared to those in the west [2]. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may improve outcomes. Despite OCD being a common mental illness, most seek treatment after several years of suffering. Those who suffer from OCD tend to be secretive about their symptoms and suffer from shame and embarrassment. Less than a third of OCD sufferers receive appropriate pharmacotherapy and even less receive evidence-based psychotherapy. 
 
 
 
 
Symptoms 
The hallmarks of OCD are presence of obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are repetitive, unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images or urges that are mostly ego-dystonic and cause severe distress or anxiety. Compulsions (or rituals) are repetitive behaviours or mental acts that are performed in response to an obsession to reduce anxiety/distress or prevent a dreaded consequence. Obsessions and compulsions are time consuming, distressing and are often resisted unsuccessfully. Clinical manifestations of OCD are remarkably similar across cultures and geographic locations. Common obsessions and compulsions and symptom dimensions identified through factor-analytical studies are shown in Table 1.

ab77e32d02cbd227a6dd73e4d6fbc2f9d726719a,Human emotion is a complex and psycho physiological state of mind which can be expressed as positive or negative reactions to external and internal stimuli. Typical communication channels that indicate emotions are voice and facial expressions. People who are paralyzed or have other severe movement disorders have no way of expressing their emotions thereby forming a wide communication rift between them and the outside world. Communication through eye tracking is one of the alternative ways of giving such disabled patients to interact with the outside world. This paper investigates the possibility of recognizing emotions using signal processing of Electroencephalography using discrete wavelet transform and feeding appropriate values to an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for classification. The system enables severely disabled as well as able users to interact with the system using eye movement in order to respond to detected emotion. The solution can be used to detect emotions of motor disabled people and provision a means of communication; also it is a learning tool for trainee neurologists. The prototype was built using Matlab successfully and it was evaluated by experts and the intended users very creditably stating it as a useful software for disabled people.,"[{'authorId': '2057092061', 'name': 'Janani Harischandra'}, {'authorId': '2255378559', 'name': 'M.U.S. Perera'}]",10.0,,3.0,Intelligent emotion recognition system using brain signals (EEG),2012.0

In this article, we present a theoretical account for the dynamics of affect (DynAffect) that identifies the major processes underlying individual differences in the temporal dynamics of affective experiences. It is hypothesized that individuals are characterized by an affective home base, a baseline attractor state around which affect fluctuates. These fluctuations vary as the result of internal or external processes to which an individual is more or less sensitive and are regulated and tied back to the home base by the attractor strength. Individual differences in these 3 processes--affective home base, variability, and attractor strength--are proposed to underlie individual differences in affect dynamics. The DynAffect account is empirically evaluated by means of a diffusion modeling approach in 2 extensive experience-sampling studies on people's core affective experiences. The findings show that the model is capable of adequately capturing the observed dynamics in core affect across both large (Study 1) and shorter time scales (Study 2) and illuminate how the key processes are related to personality and emotion dispositions. Implications for the understanding of affect dynamics and affective dysfunctioning in psychopathology are also discussed.","[{'authorId': '48586713', 'name': 'Peter Kuppens'}, {'authorId': '49944201', 'name': 'Zita Oravecz'}, {'authorId': '2109141', 'name': 'F.

Yet little is known about the validity of indirect questioning in reducing social desirability bias. This article reports on three studies that examine indirect questioning as a technique to reduce social desirability bias on self-report measures. The effects of asking indirect (i.e., structured, projective) questions were compared with direct (i.e., structured, personal) questions The pattern of results indicates that indirect questioning reduces social desirability bias on variables subject to social influence and has no significant effect on socially neutral variables. The social nature of the differences between direct and indirect questioning groups, and the attribution of an undesirable trait to an out-group but not an in-group target, supports the view that subjects projected their beliefs and evaluations in the indirect response situation. These results are consistent across several product categories and indirect question wordings.","[{'authorId': '144561841', 'name': 'R.

Despite the wide popularity of the topic, current attempts to summarize the research in the field are narrative reviews. We address this gap by providing a descriptive systematic review, in which we investigated oscillatory correlates of maintenance of verbal and visual information in WM. The systematic approach enabled us to challenge some common views popularized by previous research. The identified literature (100 EEG/MEG studies) highlighted the importance of theta oscillations in verbal WM: frontal midline theta enhanced with load in most verbal studies, while more equivocal results have been obtained in visual studies. Increasing WM load affected alpha activity in most studies, but the direction of the effect was inconsistent: the ratio of studies that found alpha increase versus decrease with increasing load was 80/20% in the verbal WM domain and close to 60/40% in the visual domain. Alpha asymmetry (left < right) was a common finding in both verbal and visual WM studies. Beta and gamma activity studies yielded the least convincing data: a diversity in the spatial and frequency distribution of beta activity prevented us from making a coherent conclusion; gamma rhythm was virtually neglected in verbal WM studies with no systematic support for sustained gamma changes during the delay in EEG studies in general.","[{'authorId': '46991903', 'name': 'Y.

A major one in the elderly population is the difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a novel virtual gym that enables online group-exercises in older adults with different levels of skills. 
Methods. A total of 37 older adults (65-87 years old) followed a personalized exercise program based on the OTAGO program for fall prevention, for a period of eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a tablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to a Control group (individual training) or Social group (online group-exercising). Pre- and post- measurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes. The study received ethical approval from the CREATE-NET Ethics Committee on ICT Research Involving Human Beings (Application N. 2014-001). 
Results. There were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in terms of physical outcomes. Interestingly though, while in the Control group fitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case for the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For psychological and social wellbeing outcomes there were improvements on both groups, regardless of the application used. 
Conclusion. Group exercising in a virtual gym can be effective in motivating and enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter individuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together despite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise can reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context. Longer term interventions with more participants are instead recommended to assess impacts on wellbeing.","[{'authorId': '144791489', 'name': 'Marcos Báez'}, {'authorId': '1869670', 'name': 'I. K.

Although many existing works focus on emotion recognition from music, there seems to be a relative scarcity of research on emotion recognition from general sounds. One of the key characteristics of sound events is the sound source spatial position, i.e. the location of the source relatively to the acoustic receiver. Existing studies that aim to investigate the relation of the latter source placement and the elicited emotions are limited to distance, front and back spatial localization and/or specific emotional categories. In this paper we analytically investigate the effect of the source angular position on the listener's emotional state, modeled in the well-established valence/arousal affective space. Towards this aim, we have developed an annotated sound events dataset using binaural processed versions of the available International Affective Digitized Sound (IADS) sound events library. All subjective affective annotations were obtained using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) approach. Preliminary results obtained by processing these annotation scores are likely to indicate a systematic change in the listener affective state as the sound source angular position changes.

EEG provides a convenient, non-intrusive, and accurate way of capturing brain signals in multiple channels at fine temporal resolution. We propose an ensemble learning algorithm for automatically computing the most discriminative subset of EEG channels for internal emotion recognition. Our method describes an EEG channel using kernel-based representations computed from the training EEG recordings. For ensemble learning, we formulate a graph embedding linear discriminant objective function using the kernel representations. The objective function is efficiently solved via sparse non-negative principal component analysis and the final classifier is learned using the sparse projection coefficients. Our algorithm is useful in reducing the amount of data while improving computational efficiency and classification accuracy at the same time. The experiments on publicly available EEG dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the compared methods.","[{'authorId': '3356790', 'name': 'H.

We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution. Key messages Systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trials Funnel plots, plots of the trials' effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biases Funnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trials Funnel plot asymmetry was found in 38% of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13% of reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Critical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure","[{'authorId': '46915007', 'name': 'M.

From this it is deduced that individuals who show good perception of heart activity tend to exhibit higher levels of a momentarily experienced emotion (in this case anxiety) and to score higher on the personality trait “Emotional Lability.” The aspect of cardiac awareness considered here is perception of heart beats. Subjects were instructed to count heart beats (only by concentrating on their body but not by taking their pulse) during a signalled time interval and the reported number of beats was then compared to the actual number of beats as extracted from the EKG. Additionally, skin conductance and respiration were recorded. During the experimental task (i.e., counting heart beats) increases in heart rate, respiration rate and number of spontaneous fluctuations in skin conductance were recorded. Groups of good and poor perceivers were formed on the basis of accuracy on the perception task.

Existing studies on the relation between sense of presence and level of anxiety, however, have yielded mixed results on the correlation between the two. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed publications on VRET for anxiety that included self-reported presence and anxiety. The comprehensive search of the literature identified 33 publications with a total of 1196 participants. The correlation between self-reported sense of presence and anxiety was extracted and meta-analyzed. Potential moderators such as technology characteristics, sample characteristics including age, gender and clinical status, disorder characteristics and study design characteristics such as measurements were also examined. The random effects analysis showed a medium effect size for the correlation between sense of presence and anxiety (r = .28; 95% CI: 0.18–0.38). Moderation analyses revealed that the effect size of the correlation differed across different anxiety disorders, with a large effect size for fear of animals (r = .50; 95% CI: 0.30–0.66) and a no to small effect size for social anxiety disorder (r = .001; 95% CI: −0.19–0.19). Further, the correlation between anxiety and presence was stronger in studies with participants who met criteria for an anxiety disorder than in studies with a non-clinical population. Trackers with six degrees of freedom and displays with a larger field of view resulted in higher effect sizes, compared to trackers with three degrees of freedom and displays with a smaller field of view.

The current study tested whether emotion dysregulation, assessed by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), would predict posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) through anxiety sensitivity (AS). Alternate cognitive-affective mediators (i.e., distress tolerance and intolerance of uncertainty) were explored.


METHOD
A total of 259 trauma-exposed community members (ages averaging 37.39; evenly distributed by gender) from a larger clinical trial targeting suicide risk factors completed a clinical interview and self-report questionnaires at baseline, Week-3, and 1-month follow-up appointments.


RESULTS
AS at Week 3 significantly mediated the relationship between initial emotion dysregulation and 1-month follow-up posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) after controlling for condition and baseline symptoms (β = .07; standard error = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = [0.01, 0.14]). Effects held for one out of six emotion dysregulation subscales. Distress tolerance and intolerance of uncertainty were not significant mediators (ps > .05).

Over the same period, the CAF strengthened its mental health system. This article explores the effect of these events on the prevalence of past-year mental disorders over the period 2002-2013. Method: The data sources were 2 highly comparable population-based mental health surveys of CAF Regular Force personnel done in 2002 and 2013 (n = 5155 and 6996, respectively). Data were collected via in-person interviews with Statistics Canada personnel using the World Health Organization’s Composite International Diagnostic Interview to assess past-year disorders. Results: In 2013, 16.5% had 1 or more of the 6 past-year disorders assessed in the survey, with the most common conditions being major depressive episode (MDE), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which affected 8.0%, 5.3%, and 4.7%, respectively.

But what exactly do people seek when they seek emotions? What kinds of gratifications do they obtain from the experience of emotions during media use? An overview of research on emotional gratifications shows that emotions can be gratifying in multiple ways – ranging from simple hedonistic gratifications to more complex gratifications such as feeling competent or morally good. An integrative framework is outlined that aims at a more systematic understanding of emotional gratifications and their influence on selective media use. We suggest that different aspects of an emotion's gratification potential are appraised simultaneously, and integrated into a holistic appraisal outcome that can be conceptualized as ‘meta-emotion’. Meta-emotions guide the recipient's intuitive decision to accept, or reject a media offer's invitation to experience emotions.","[{'authorId': '143851531', 'name': 'Anne Bartsch'}, {'authorId': '50365749', 'name': 'Roland Mangold'}, {'authorId': '2028410588', 'name': 'R.

This pilot study addresses this void by investigating neural and behavioral changes in a Phase I trial in young adults with high‐functioning ASD who received an evidence‐based behavioral intervention, Virtual Reality‐Social Cognition Training over 5 weeks for a total of 10 hr. The participants were tested pre‐ and post‐training with a validated biological/social versus scrambled/nonsocial motion neuroimaging task, previously shown to activate regions within the social brain networks. Three significant brain‐behavior changes were identified. First, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus, a hub for socio‐cognitive processing, showed increased brain activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli in individuals with greater gains on a theory‐of‐mind measure. Second, the left inferior frontal gyrus, a region for socio‐emotional processing, tracked individual gains in emotion recognition with decreased activation to social versus nonsocial stimuli. Finally, the left superior parietal lobule, a region for visual attention, showed significantly decreased activation to nonsocial versus social stimuli across all participants, where heightened attention to nonsocial contingencies has been considered a disabling aspect of ASD. This study provides, albeit preliminary, some of the first evidence of the harnessable neuroplasticity in adults with ASD through an age‐appropriate intervention in brain regions tightly linked to social abilities. This pilot trial motivates future efforts to develop and test social interventions to improve behaviors and supporting brain networks in adults with ASD.

Although the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the general and military population seem very similar, combat-related PTSD (cr-PTSD) is typically thought to be more severe due to the repeated and prolonged exposure of traumatic events. Therapeutic adherence is reported a problem in military populations compromising treatment efficacy. Therefore, a new potential supplementary treatment is specially designed for patients with cr-PTSD. This intervention is called Military Motion Memory Desensitization and Reprocessing (3MDR). The treatment incorporates key elements of successful treatments as Virtual Reality Exposure (VRE) and Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) and adds motion to the condition. We aimed at designing a treatment procedure that preserved dual task processing principle, yet introduced new engagement by performing the desensitization during motion by to walking on a treadmill. Moreover, we aimed at exposure to real high-affect pictures of deployment setting. Subjects walk a repetitive cycle while walking and viewing high affect pictures of deployment scenes. Dual task processing was maintained by an oscillating ball. Aspects of presence are adhered to, to maximize possible positive outcome.


METHOD
Two veterans with chronic PTSD, received four weekly sessions of 3MDR therapy. The indicator of effectiveness was difference in CAPS (Clinical Administrated PTSD Scale)-score. The treatment was designed on the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) facility.


RESULTS
The 3MDR treatment did further decrease PTSD symptoms. Patients were highly satisfied about the treatment and had no attention to drop out.


CONCLUSION
The results of the two cases suggest that the 3MDR treatment is a successful, more additional treatment that goes further into the patients affect where other treatment may stagnate. The presence was highly appreciated. Further research with more patients needs to be performed to obtain more reliable results.","[{'authorId': '143978558', 'name': 'E.

Ever since the 19th century, experimental psychologists have attempted to understand and explain human emotion. Despite an extensive amount of research conducted by psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists over the past 150 years, researchers still cannot agree on the definition of emotion itself and have continued to try and devise ways to measure emotional states. In this paper, we provide an overview of the most prominent theories in emotional psychology (dating from the late 19th century to the present day), as well as a summary of a number of studies which attempt to measure certain aspects of emotion. This paper is organized chronologically; first with an analysis of various uni-modal studies, followed by a review of multi-modal research. Our findings suggest that there is insufficient evidence to neither prove nor disprove the existence of coherent emotional expression, both within subjects and between subjects. Furthermore, the results seem to be heavily influenced by both experimental conditions as well as by the theoretical assumptions that underpin them.","[{'authorId': '10416787', 'name': 'Thanyathorn Thanapattheerakul'}, {'authorId': '2061417743', 'name': 'Katherine Mao'}, {'authorId': '52188327', 'name': 'Jacqueline Amoranto'}, {'authorId': '123784534', 'name': 'Jonathan H.

We tested this assumption by using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to classify brain activity patterns of 6 basic emotions (disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise) in 3 experiments. Emotions were induced with short movies or mental imagery during functional magnetic resonance imaging. MVPA accurately classified emotions induced by both methods, and the classification generalized from one induction condition to another and across individuals. Brain regions contributing most to the classification accuracy included medial and inferior lateral prefrontal cortices, frontal pole, precentral and postcentral gyri, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Thus, specific neural signatures across these regions hold representations of different emotional states in multimodal fashion, independently of how the emotions are induced. Similarity of subjective experiences between emotions was associated with similarity of neural patterns for the same emotions, suggesting a direct link between activity in these brain regions and the subjective emotional experience.","[{'authorId': '8013229', 'name': 'H.

Three classes of evidence--crosssectional, longitudinal, and experimental--are documented to test their model. Relevant studies are described and their effect sizes combined meta-analytically. The results reveal that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes, as well as behaviors paralleling success.

It has been suggested that one reason why obese children stop exercising is the perception of bodily sensations. In a counterbalanced design, a total of 109 children (33 overweight, 10-15 years old) were asked to walk twice for 6 minutes on a treadmill under one of two conditions: (a) traditional condition (TC)-focusing their attention on their physical feelings and sensations or (b) distraction condition (DC)-focusing their attention on a virtual environment. Attentional focus during exercise, bad-good feeling states (pre- and postexperimental), perceived exertion (3 minutes and post), heart rate, and enjoyment were assessed. Results indicated that overweight children focused on internal information under the TC, but they significantly shifted their attention to regard the external environment in the DC. This attentional distraction effect of VR was more intense in overweight than in normal-weight children. No differences between groups were found when examining changes in feeling states and perceived exertion. VR increased enjoyment during exercise, and children preferred exercise using virtual environments. VR is useful to promote distraction and may help overweight and obese children to enjoy exercise.","[{'authorId': '145562686', 'name': 'R.

Yet traditional facial control techniques provide precise but complex sets of control parameters, which are not adapted for non-expert users. In this article, we present a system that generates a simple, 2-Dimensional interface that offers an efficient control over the facial expressions of any synthetic character. The interface generation process relies on the analysis of the deformation of a real human face. The principal geometrical and textural variation patterns of the real face are detected and automatically reorganized onto a low-dimensional space. This control space can then be easily adapted to pilot the deformations of synthetic faces. The resulting virtual character control interface makes it easy to produce varied emotional facial expressions, both extreme and subtle. In addition, the continuous nature of the interface allows the production of coherent temporal sequences of facial animation.","[{'authorId': '1688878', 'name': 'Nicolas Stoiber'}, {'authorId': '1697632', 'name': 'R.

Suboptimal treatment results may be due to the failure of existing approaches to address all TTM styles. Methods Thirty-eight DSM-IV TTM participants were randomly assigned across two study sites to Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) -enhanced cognitive-behavioral treatment (consisting of an 11-week acute treatment and 3-month maintenance treatment) or a minimal attention control (MAC) condition. MAC participants had active treatment after the 11-week control condition. Follow-up study assessments were conducted three and six months after the maintenance period. Results Open trial treatment resulted in significant improvement in TTM severity, emotion regulation (ER) capacity, experiential avoidance, anxiety and depression with changes generally maintained over time. In the randomized controlled trial, those with active treatment had greater improvement than those in the MAC condition for both TTM severity and ER capacity. Correlations between changes in TTM severity and ER capacity were not reported at post-treatment but did occur in maintenance and follow-up indicating reduced TTM severity with improved ER capacity. Conclusions DBT-enhanced cognitive-behavioral treatment is a promising treatment for TTM. Future studies should compare this approach to other credible treatment interventions and investigate the efficacy of this approach in more naturalistic samples with greater comorbidity.","[{'authorId': '6094463', 'name': 'N.

One perennial challenge is that the magnitude of the task-evoked pupil response diminishes over the course of an experiment, a phenomenon we refer to as a fatigue effect. Reducing fatigue effects may improve sensitivity to task effects and reduce the likelihood of confounds due to systematic physiological changes over time. In this paper, we investigated the degree to which fatigue effects could be ameliorated by experimenter intervention. In Experiment 1, we assigned participants to one of three groups-no breaks, kinetic breaks (playing with toys, but no social interaction), or chatting with a research assistant-and compared the pupil response across conditions. In Experiment 2, we additionally tested the effect of researcher observation. Only breaks including social interaction significantly reduced the fatigue of the pupil response across trials. However, in all conditions we found robust evidence for fatigue effects: that is, regardless of protocol, the task-evoked pupil response was substantially diminished (at least 60%) over the duration of the experiment. We account for the variance of fatigue effects in our pupillometry data using multiple common statistical modeling approaches (e.g., linear mixed-effects models of peak, mean, and baseline pupil diameters, as well as growth curve models of time-course data). We conclude that pupil attenuation is a predictable phenomenon that should be accommodated in our experimental designs and statistical models.","[{'authorId': '41067765', 'name': 'Drew J.

The main line began with Jean Piaget and includes developmental psychologists who have studied the acquisition of moral concepts and reasoning. The alternative line began in the 1990s with a new synthesis of evolutionary, neurological, and social-psychological research in which the central phenomena are moral emotions and intuitions. In this essay, I show how both of these lines have been shaped by an older debate between two 19th century narratives about modernity: one celebrating the liberation of individuals, the other mourning the loss of community and moral authority. I suggest that both lines of moral psychology have limited themselves to the moral domain prescribed by the liberation narrative, and so one future step for moral psychology should be to study alternative moral perspectives, particularly religious and politically conservative ones in which morality is, in part, about protecting groups, institutions, and souls.","[{'authorId': '2480714', 'name': 'J.

However, it can be said that virtual reality is in the early days of adoption for education. Studies show that using virtual reality in education can positively affect students’ learning experiences. In this study, the effect of an educational virtual reality game, named “Keşfet Kurtul”, on fourth-grade students’ academic achievement in fractions and their engagement to mathematics was investigated. The experimental study was carried out using a quasi-experimental design. The educational VR game was used in the treatment group (N = 32). In the comparison group (N = 32), the method applied in school, which includes predominantly mobile applications developed in fractions, were used. As a result of the research; the educational VR game “Keşfet Kurtul” was found to increase academic achievement and to maintain the level of student engagement in mathematics. It was determined that the experimental method has the same effect as the method applied in school in the comparison group, in terms of academic achievement and student engagement to mathematics. Besides, in terms of social sub-dimension of student engagement, it was observed that Keşfet Kurtul was more effective than the method applied in school.","[{'authorId': '100559161', 'name': 'Emrah Akman'}, {'authorId': '3021021', 'name': 'R.

b07bc7c2e7b6207eba1fd85bf92e2425ef295b92,"Background Novel nonpharmacological therapies are being developed to prevent cognitive decline and reduce behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia. Virtual reality (VR) reminiscence was reported to improve anxiety, apathy, and cognitive function immediately after intervention in individuals at residential aged care facilities. However, its effect on elderly patients with dementia and how long this effect could last remain unknown. Objective The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of immersive VR reminiscence in people with dementia both immediately after and 3-6 months after intervention. Methods A pilot study was conducted in 2 dementia care units. VR reminiscence therapy sessions were conducted twice per week for a 3-month period. Cognitive function, global status, depressive symptoms, and caregiver burden were assessed before and immediately after VR intervention in 20 participants. Subsequently, 7 participants were reassessed 3-6 months after the VR intervention. Wilcoxon sign-rank test was used for statistical comparisons of the changes. Results There were no significant changes in cognitive function, global status, and caregiver burden immediately after the VR intervention, but there was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (P=.008). Moreover, compared with the cognitive function immediately after VR, it kept declining 3-6 months after. Conclusions Immersive VR reminiscence can improve mood and preserve cognitive function in elderly patients with dementia during the period of the intervention. Studies using a control group and comparing the use of VR with traditional forms of reminiscence should be conducted in the future to confirm and expand on these findings.","[{'authorId': '5978619', 'name': 'Ling-Chun Huang'}, {'authorId': '145142380', 'name': 'Yuan-Han Yang'}]",8.0,,27.0,The Long-term Effects of Immersive Virtual Reality Reminiscence in People With Dementia: Longitudinal Observational Study,2022.0
b07e6104d909b6d81a2f382d6d2a0400dd430f97,"Despite centuries of speculation about how to manage negative emotions, little is actually known about which emotion-regulation strategies people choose to use when confronted with negative situations of varying intensity. On the basis of a new process conception of emotion regulation, we hypothesized that in low-intensity negative situations, people would show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by engagement reappraisal, which allows emotional processing. However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3). In response to these emotional contexts, participants chose between using either reappraisal or distraction as an emotion-regulation strategy. Results in all experiments supported our hypothesis. This pattern in the choice of emotion-regulation strategies has important implications for the understanding of healthy adaptation.","[{'authorId': '5236984', 'name': 'G.

In this paper, we explore how emotive Virtual Reality (VR) content can also cause pupil dilation. VR has been shown to be able to evoke negative and positive arousal in users when they are immersed in different virtual scenes. In our research, VR scenes were used as emotional triggers. Five emotional VR scenes were designed in our study and each scene had five emotion segments; happiness, fear, anxiety, sadness, and disgust. When participants experienced the VR scenes, their pupil dilation and the brightness in the headset were captured. We found that both the negative and positive emotion segments produced pupil dilation in the VR environments. We also explored the effect of showing heart beat cues to the users, and if this could cause difference in pupil dilation. In our study, three different heart beat cues were shown to users using a combination of three channels; haptic, audio, and visual. The results showed that the haptic-visual cue caused the most significant pupil dilation change from the baseline.

b0dfdb9a4ff0b013beddc4874fc3d9e1fb68b6e5,"Background: Gambling disorder (GD) is characterized by a significant lack of self-control and is associated with impulsivity-related personality traits. It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression.","[{'authorId': '2366468', 'name': 'S.

Load sharing varies by physical closeness and relationship quality. We investigated the effect of load sharing on emotional arousal via galvanic skin response, an indicator of sympathetic nervous system arousal, during a social stressor. Social stress was elicited in 66 adolescent girls (Mage = 15 years) using a spontaneous public-speaking task. Mother-daughter dyads reported their relationship quality, and physical closeness was manipulated by having mothers either touch or not touch their daughter's hand during the performance. We found evidence of load sharing among dyads who held hands, independent of relationship quality. However, without physical contact, load sharing was only evident among dyads with higher relationship quality. Thus, high relationship quality buffers against threat in a similar way to the physical comfort of a loved one.","[{'authorId': '3714961', 'name': 'Jessica P.

Recent works show that the performance of a FER algorithm can be improved by disentangling the expression information from identity features. In this paper, we present Transfer-based Expression Recognition Generative Adversarial Network (TER-G AN) that combines the effectiveness of a novel feature disentanglement technique with the concept of identity-invariant expression representation learning for FER. More specifically, TER-GAN learns a disentangled expression representation by extracting expression features from one image and transferring the expression information to the identity of another image. To improve the feature disentanglement process and to learn an identity-invariant expression representation, we introduce a novel expression consistency loss and an identity consistency loss that exploit expression and identity information from both real and synthetic images. We evaluated the performance of our proposed facial expression recognition technique by employing four public facial expression databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, MMI, BU-3DFE.

In response to these limitations, a multilevel and hierarchical instrument was developed in consultation with a wide range of methodological and statistical experts. The instrument focuses on the operational details of studies and results in a profile of scores instead of a single score to represent study quality. A pilot test suggested that satisfactory between-judge agreement can be obtained using well-trained raters working in naturalistic conditions.

ApEn statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. We have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy (SampEn), and have compared ApEn and SampEn by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. We have also evaluated cross-ApEn and cross-SampEn, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series.

b35ef05cf12c8980684eb7e1d63452d3a5ffbb13,"Under what conditions will a bystander intervene to try to stop a violent attack by one person on another? It is generally believed that the greater the size of the crowd of bystanders, the less the chance that any of them will intervene. A complementary model is that social identity is critical as an explanatory variable. For example, when the bystander shares common social identity with the victim the probability of intervention is enhanced, other things being equal. However, it is generally not possible to study such hypotheses experimentally for practical and ethical reasons. Here we show that an experiment that depicts a violent incident at life-size in immersive virtual reality lends support to the social identity explanation. 40 male supporters of Arsenal Football Club in England were recruited for a two-factor between-groups experiment: the victim was either an Arsenal supporter or not (in-group/out-group), and looked towards the participant for help or not during the confrontation. The response variables were the numbers of verbal and physical interventions by the participant during the violent argument. The number of physical interventions had a significantly greater mean in the in-group condition compared to the out-group. The more that participants perceived that the Victim was looking to them for help the greater the number of interventions in the in-group but not in the out-group. These results are supported by standard statistical analysis of variance, with more detailed findings obtained by a symbolic regression procedure based on genetic programming. Verbal interventions made during their experience, and analysis of post-experiment interview data suggest that in-group members were more prone to confrontational intervention compared to the out-group who were more prone to make statements to try to diffuse the situation.","[{'authorId': '144931212', 'name': 'M.

The relation between prefrontal electroencephalographic asymmetry and emotion in children is well known. The association between positive emotion (assessed via parent report), empathy (measured via observation), and second-by-second brain electrical activity (recorded during a pleasurable task) was investigated using a sample of one hundred twenty-eight 6- to 10-year-old children. Contentment related to increasing left frontopolar activation (p < .05). Empathic concern and positive empathy related to increasing right frontopolar activation (ps < .05). A second form of positive empathy related to increasing left dorsolateral activation (p < .05). This suggests that positive affect and (negative and positive) empathy both relate to changes in prefrontal activity during a pleasurable task.","[{'authorId': '6347602', 'name': 'Sharee N.

Little is known about the general population prevalence or severity of DSM-IV mental disorders.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate 12-month prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse control, and substance disorders in the recently completed US National Comorbidity Survey Replication.


DESIGN AND SETTING
Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 using a fully structured diagnostic interview, the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.


PARTICIPANTS
Nine thousand two hundred eighty-two English-speaking respondents 18 years and older.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Twelve-month DSM-IV disorders.


RESULTS
Twelve-month prevalence estimates were anxiety, 18.1%; mood, 9.5%; impulse control, 8.9%; substance, 3.8%; and any disorder, 26.2%. Of 12-month cases, 22.3% were classified as serious; 37.3%, moderate; and 40.4%, mild. Fifty-five percent carried only a single diagnosis; 22%, 2 diagnoses; and 23%, 3 or more diagnoses. Latent class analysis detected 7 multivariate disorder classes, including 3 highly comorbid classes representing 7% of the population.


CONCLUSION
Although mental disorders are widespread, serious cases are concentrated among a relatively small proportion of cases with high comorbidity.","[{'authorId': '2350669', 'name': 'R.

b40ae33d946b7eff700f35723aa7524ef3d1947b,"ABSTRACT Several Virtual Reality (VR) applications for the understanding, assessment and treatment of mental health problems have been developed in the last 15 years. Typically, in VR the patient learns to manipulate problematic situations related to his/her problem. In fact, VR can be described as an advanced form of human–computer interface that is able to induce a feeling of ‘presence’ in the computer-generated world experienced by the user. This feature transforms VR in an ‘empowering environment’, a sheltered setting where patients can start to explore and act without feeling threatened. With such assurance, they can freely explore, experiment, feel, live out and experience feelings and/or thoughts. The paper presents the current state of clinical research in this area. Furthermore, the open source ‘NeuroVR’ system and its potential clinical applications are presented and discussed.","[{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

One of the four blocks (in counterbalanced order) was designed to be stressful (S), while the other blocks were designed to be calm (C). The motions required of the users were the same in both conditions; only the visual and audio feedback were different across the S and C conditions. Users' self-scored arousal in the S condition was significantly higher. We analyzed the recorded motions by segmenting out 2747 ""fast motions"", i.e., intervals of time where the sum of the speed of the hands was above a threshold. A simple machine learning algorithm (a decision tree) could learn to classify these fast motions as either calm or stressed, with ≈80% accuracy, using only two features: the maximum speed achieved during the motion, and the heart rate at the moment of maximum speed, where both features were normalized. If only the maximum speed feature is used (i.e., with no physiological data), ≈70% accuracy is achieved.","[{'authorId': '2094395735', 'name': 'Patrice Robitaille'}, {'authorId': '3197167', 'name': 'Michael J.

In this work, we study the use of deep learning to automatically discover emotionally relevant features from speech. It is shown that using a deep recurrent neural network, we can learn both the short-time frame-level acoustic features that are emotionally relevant, as well as an appropriate temporal aggregation of those features into a compact utterance-level representation. Moreover, we propose a novel strategy for feature pooling over time which uses local attention in order to focus on specific regions of a speech signal that are more emotionally salient. The proposed solution is evaluated on the IEMOCAP corpus, and is shown to provide more accurate predictions compared to existing emotion recognition algorithms.","[{'authorId': '2536431', 'name': 'Seyedmahdad Mirsamadi'}, {'authorId': '47223178', 'name': 'Emad Barsoum'}, {'authorId': '2109292017', 'name': 'Cha Zhang'}]",503.0,,12.0,Automatic speech emotion recognition using recurrent neural networks with local attention,2017.0

Accurate identi ﬁ cation of emotions helps in the development of affective computing, brain – computer interface, medical diagnosis system, etc. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are one such source to capture and study human emotions. In this Letter, a novel time-order representation based on the S-transform and convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for the identi ﬁ cation of human emotions. EEG signals are transformed into time-order representation (TOR) based on the S-transform. This TOR is given as an input to CNN to automatically extract and classify the deep features. Emotional states of happiness, fear, sadness, and relax are classi ﬁ ed with an accuracy of 94.58%. The superiority of the method is judged by evaluating four performance parameters and comparing it with existing state-of-the-art on the same dataset. non-stationary informative details of the signals. TOR based on the S-transform method with ResNet-50 provides superior performcace to the existing state-of-the-art for emotion recognition. The proposed TOR based on the S-transform will be explored in other application.

Due to the enormous diffusion of the World Wide Web (WWW), telepsychology, and telehealth in general, have become accepted and validated methods for the treatment of many different health care concerns. The introduction of the Web 2.0 has facilitated the development of new forms of collaborative interaction between multiple users based on 3-D virtual worlds. This paper describes the development and implementation of a form of tailored immersive e-therapy called p-health whose key factor is interreality, that is, the creation of a hybrid augmented experience merging physical and virtual worlds. We suggest that compared with conventional telehealth applications such as emails, chat, and videoconferences, the interaction between real and 3-D virtual worlds may convey greater feelings of presence, facilitate the clinical communication process, positively influence group processes and cohesiveness in group-based therapies, and foster higher levels of interpersonal trust between therapists and patients. However, challenges related to the potentially addictive nature of such virtual worlds and questions related to privacy and personal safety will also be discussed.","[{'authorId': '39777674', 'name': 'A.

We included studies where the Y-BOCS was applied to a sample of adults and reliability estimate was reported. Out of the 11,490 references located, 144 studies met the selection criteria. For the total scale, the mean reliability was 0.866 for coefficients alpha, 0.848 for test–retest correlations, and 0.922 for intraclass correlations. The moderator analyses led to a predictive model where the standard deviation of the total test and the target population (clinical vs. nonclinical) explained 38.6% of the total variability among coefficients alpha.

Here, we used multisensory illusions to elicit illusory ownership of obese and slim bodies during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results implicate the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex in the development of negative feelings toward the body through functional interactions with the posterior parietal cortex, which mediates perceived obesity. Moreover, cingulate neural responses were modulated by nonclinical eating-disorder psychopathology and were attenuated in females.

This article evaluates the characteristics of scheduling algorithms on human rescheduling performance, the quality of which was related to complacency. It is suggested that scheduling algorithms be characterized as having result comprehensibility (the result respects the scheduler's expectations in terms of the discourse rules of the information display) or algorithm comprehensibility (the complexity of the algorithm hides some important constraints). The findings stress, on the one hand, that result comprehensibility is necessary to achieve good production performance and to limit complacency. On the other hand, algorithm comprehensibility leads to poor performance due to the very high cost of understanding the algorithm. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","[{'authorId': '33829090', 'name': 'J.

The current experiment explores the beneficial effects of immersing an individual into VR after a stressful encounter. The potential restorative effects of three unique immersive VR environments were examined by inducing stress and negative affect in 69 participants, and then randomly assigning them to freely explore one of three environments (a virtual nature setting, a virtual urban cityscape, or a neutral environment composed of solid geometric shapes) for 10 min. Participants who explored the nature environment were found to have significantly improved affect (as measured by a standardized questionnaire), and significantly lower stress levels (as measured by self-report and skin conductance levels) compared to those who explored the urban and geometric environments. The results suggest that virtual nature has restorative properties similar to real nature, and that simply immersing participants into a virtual nature setting can reduce stress. These results also suggest that the content of the VR experience (i.e., whether it contains nature) is important in promoting restoration, and that in the absence of nature, stress levels remain unchanged. inTroduCTion Over the last 30 years, researchers have provided empirical evidence suggesting that surrounding oneself with nature can have restorative effects on emotional, physiological and cognitive states. The restorative effects of exposure to nature have been classified as a reduction in cognitive fatigue, decreases in both physiological and cognitive stress, a decrease in negative affect, and an in-(2008) comparing the effects of interacting with natural versus urban environments has found that individuals performed better on a working memory task after taking a walk in a local park versus taking a walk in a local downtown area.

b594fe310ff33339ec054dbe533181846065cc53,"Psychiatric practitioners, seasoned and new alike, should welcome the recent publication of the third edition of Russell Barkley’s classic textbook on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The first edition was published in 1981 and was followed by the second edition, which was published 17 years later in 1998. Fortunately, Dr. Barkley has not waited another 17 years to update his classic textbook, as research in the field of ADHD has accelerated considerably in recent years, making this new edition a much needed and anticipated addition to any practicing clinician’s library. While the structure of the new edition is basically the same in terms of chapters and topics (with the exception of 1 new chapter on combined child therapies), there are many new and welcome added features. Most notably, there is now a section at the end of each chapter entitled “Key Clinical Points,” which highlights and summarizes learning points for the reader. The value of this cannot be overstated, particularly for the busy clinician! Furthermore, Dr. Barkley has included in Appendix I, at the end of chapter 1, an International Consensus Statement on ADHD that he and many other experts coauthored in 2002, which does much to dispel many of the myths about ADHD propagated in the media and by some special interest groups. The book is very well written, well edited, and well referenced and includes material dated through the year 2004 and some references from 2005. The lag between the date of these articles and the publication date of this book in 2006 is to be expected, given the long lead time for the compilation and publication of textbooks. Lastly, there is now an accompanying “Clinical Workbook” that provides many useful forms and rating scales for the busy practitioner. Dr. Barkley invited back all of the principal authors of chapters from the 1998 edition of the book, and some chapters were written by other experts. The first-time reader of any edition of this book will find the initial chapters particularly fascinating, especially chapter 1 on the history of ADHD, as these chapters summarize trends and changes in the field that have occurred since the 1930s. It is also noteworthy in this era of massive textbooks with multiple contributors that Part I of this book on the “Nature of ADHD,” with 7 chapters, is written and updated entirely by Dr. Barkley. This section forms a solid basis upon which the other 2 sections of the book, “Assessment” and “Treatment,” can build. A high point in the first part of the book is Dr. Barkley’s conceptual, theoretical model of self-regulation and executive dysfunction presented in chapter 7, which integrates quite well extant research findings in imaging, neurobiology, and neuropsychology. Part II of this new edition, “Assessment,” includes 4 expanded and improved chapters on topics such as the diagnostic interview, rating scales, tests, and the assessment of adults with ADHD. There is also an expanded chapter 10, which includes 10 clinical cases presented to integrate and facilitate the development of diagnosis and treatment strategies. This chapter will be particularly useful for clinicians, since it presents a variety of cases of ADHD and the common or challenging psychiatric comorbid disorders such as oppositional defiant, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Part III, “Treatment,” includes 11 chapters on interventions, such as medications, psychotherapy, and psychoeducation for patients and their families. A particularly well written chapter is chapter 20 on combined child therapies, in which Dr. Barkley and his coauthors review findings from the historic National Institute of Mental Health Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD. There are a few minor suggestions for the next edition that would make this already valuable book even better. Expansion of the number of figures and tables, particularly in the section on treatment, and the addition of flowcharts to aid in decision making would highlight key recommendations in the text. It would also be helpful if such decision trees included further recommendations or even algorithms on addressing the psychiatric comorbid disorders such as tic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the others described in chapter 10.

Thirteen veterans suffering from PTSD play the game while we record their skin conductance. Game logs are used to identify individual events, and continuous decomposition analysis is applied to the skin conductance signals to derive event-related stress responses. The extracted skin conductance features from this analysis are used to profile each individual player in terms of stress response. We observe a large degree of variation across the 13 veterans which further validates the idiosyncratic nature of PTSD physiological manifestations. Further to game data and skin conductance signals we ask PTSD patients to indicate the most stressful event experienced (class-based annotation) and also compare the stress level of all events in a pairwise preference manner (rank-based annotation). We compare the two annotation stress schemes by correlating the self-reports to individual event-based stress manifestations. The self-reports collected through class-based annotation exhibit no correlation to physiological responses, whereas, the pairwise preferences yield significant correlations to all skin conductance features extracted via continuous decomposition analysis. The core findings of the paper suggest that reporting of stress preferences across events yields more reliable data that capture aspects of the stress experienced and that features extracted from skin conductance via continuous decomposition analysis offer appropriate predictors of stress manifestation across PTSD patients.","[{'authorId': '1757823', 'name': 'Christoffer Holmgård'}, {'authorId': '1686193', 'name': 'Georgios N.

b5d34c84fa9fd8698db8e211f841390ecdf75f88,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder is one of the more common serious mental illnesses. The shame and secrecy associated with it, as well as lack of recognition of its characteristic symptoms, can lead to delay in diagnosis and treatment. Effective psychological and drug treatments are available for the distressing, time consuming, repetitive thoughts and rituals and the associated functional impairment. This article reviews the presentation and assessment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and discusses the current best treatment options, as well as directions for the future.

We searched for the term “obsessive compulsive disorder” in electronic databases and referred to published systematic reviews, including the recently published guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).

Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs throughout the life span, and children as young as 6 or 7 present with the characteristic impairing symptoms (box 1). At the other end of the age range, patients may present for the first time in old age. Most adults with the disorder report onset in childhood or adolescence. The condition can result in considerable disability; for example, children may drop out of education and adults can become housebound. The World Health Organization rates obsessive-compulsive disorder as one of the top 20 most disabling diseases. If untreated, it generally persists,1 yet effective, evidence based psychological and drug treatments are available.

Recent epidemiological studies report prevalence rates of 0.8% in adults and 0.25% in 5-15 year old children,2 3 although earlier studies suggested rates as high as 1-3% in adults and 1-2% in children and adolescents.

People of all ages with obsessive-compulsive disorder understand the senseless nature of their repetitive, unwanted behaviours and intrusive, recurrent thoughts. This may lead to shame, reluctance to seek help, and poor recognition by health professionals. People with the disorder have long delays in accessing effective treatments—17 years …","[{'authorId': '6887443', 'name': 'I. Heyman'}, {'authorId': '1382533982', 'name': 'D.

Dr. Lazarus and his collaborator, Dr. Susan Folkman, present here a detailed theory of psychological stress, building on the concepts of cognitive appraisal and coping which have become major themes of theory and investigation. As an integrative theoretical analysis, this volume pulls together two decades of research and thought on issues in behavioral medicine, emotion, stress management, treatment, and life span development. A selective review of the most pertinent literature is included in each chapter. The total reference listing for the book extends to 60 pages. This work is necessarily multidisciplinary, reflecting the many dimensions of stress-related problems and their situation within a complex social context. While the emphasis is on psychological aspects of stress, the book is oriented towards professionals in various disciplines, as well as advanced students and educated laypersons. The intended audience ranges from psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, nurses, and social workers to sociologists, anthropologists, medical researchers, and physiologists.","[{'authorId': '5628684', 'name': 'R.

Motion artifacts corrupt the EEG and mask underlying neural signals of interest. The cause of motion artifacts in EEG is often attributed to electrode motion relative to the skin, but few studies have examined EEG signals under head motion. In the current study, we tested how motion artifacts are affected by the overall mass and surface area of commercially available electrodes, as well as how cable sway contributes to motion artifacts. To provide a ground-truth signal, we used a gelatin head phantom with embedded antennas broadcasting electrical signals, and recorded EEG with a commercially available electrode system. A robotic platform moved the phantom head through sinusoidal displacements at different frequencies (0–2 Hz). Results showed that a larger electrode surface area can have a small but significant effect on improving EEG signal quality during motion and that cable sway is a major contributor to motion artifacts. These results have implications in the development of future hardware for mobile brain imaging with EEG.","[{'authorId': '7684638', 'name': 'Evangelia-Regkina Symeonidou'}, {'authorId': '34011439', 'name': 'Andrew D.

According to large population-based surveys, up to 33.7% of the population are affected by an anxiety disorder during their lifetime. Substantial underrecognition and undertreatment of these disorders have been demonstrated. There is no evidence that the prevalence rates of anxiety disorders have changed in the past years. In cross-cultural comparisons, prevalence rates are highly variable. It is more likely that this heterogeneity is due to differences in methodology than to cultural influences.

Participants (aged 6–18 years) included 29 girls and 20 boys with CAH and unaffected siblings (25 girls and 17 boys). Psychological adjustment was assessed with parent reports on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Information about disease characteristics was obtained from medical records. Our study reveals that there was higher incidence of parent-reported problem of anxious/depressed and withdrawn/depressed behaviours, somatic complaints, social, thought, and attention problems, and rule-breaking, aggressive, internalizing, and externalizing behaviour among children with CAH compared to controls. The prevalence of internalizing behaviour problems was higher in CAH boys compared with that of controls. Psychosocial adjustment of girls with CAH was found to be similar to unaffected female controls and was within the normal population range. Family income may be associated with behavioral outcome. Glucocorticoid dose may reflect disease severity which may be associated with behavioral outcome. We conclude that internalizing behavioral problem was prevalent among boys with CAH reflecting maladaptive adjustment in coping with chronic illness.

On the other hand, scholars have explored Virtual Environment (VE) to create virtual nature and provide a complex experience of exposure to natural elements virtually. However, there is a lack of understanding about such studies in general, which use VE as a reliable tool to support biophilic design. Thus, the authors conducted a literature review on the applications, capabilities, and limitations of VE for biophilic design. The literature review shows that VE is capable of supporting critical features of biophilic design studies such as representing combinations of biophilic patterns, providing multimodal sensory inputs, simulating stress induction tasks, supporting required exposure time to observe biophilic patterns, and measuring human’s biological responses to natural environment. However, factors affecting user’s experience of a virtual biophilic environment exist, such as VE experience dimensions, user-related factors, cybersickness, navigational issues, and possible limitations of VE sensory input. Overall, biophilic design studies in VEs are still limited. Nevertheless, there are many opportunities for further research in this field.","[{'authorId': '83192688', 'name': 'M.

Here we present four studies supporting this perspective by showing that the hand acts as a metric which individuals use to scale the apparent sizes of objects in the environment. However to test this, one must be able to manipulate the size and/or dimensions of the perceiver’s hand which is difficult in the real world due to impliability of hand dimensions. To overcome this limitation, we used virtual reality to manipulate dimensions of participants’ fully-tracked, virtual hands to investigate its influence on the perceived size and shape of virtual objects. In a series of experiments, using several measures, we show that individuals’ estimations of the sizes of virtual objects differ depending on the size of their virtual hand in the direction consistent with the body-based scaling hypothesis. Additionally, we found that these effects were specific to participants’ virtual hands rather than another avatar’s hands or a salient familiar-sized object. While these studies provide support for a body-based approach to the scaling of the spatial layout, they also demonstrate the influence of virtual bodies on perception of virtual environments.","[{'authorId': '3233832', 'name': 'Sally A.

Results showed that subjects treated with VR-GET showed significant reductions in PTSD and anxiety severity and significant improvements on the emotional Stroop test. Changes in depression and other measures of neuropsychological function were not significant. Change scores on the emotional Stroop test did not correlate with changes in self-report measures of PTSD.

CBIs are based on constructive meditations where imagery abilities are essential. One of the major difficulties that participants report during the training is the difficulty related to imagery abilities. Virtual reality (VR) can be a useful tool to overcome this limitation because it can facilitate the construction and sustainment of mental images. The machine to be another (TMTBA) uses multi-sensory stimulation to induce a body swap illusion. This system allows participants to see themselves from a third perspective and have the illusion of touching themselves from outside. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of a self-compassion meditation procedure based on the TMTBA system versus the usual meditation procedure (CAU) in increasing positive affect states, mindful self-care, and adherence to the practice, and explore the influence of imagery abilities as moderators of the effects of the condition on adherence. A sample of 16 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: TMTBA-VR and CAU. All participants had to listen to an audio meditation about self-compassion and answer questionnaires before and after the training. The TMTBA-VR condition also had a body swap experience at the end of the meditation while listening to self-compassionate messages. Afterward, they were invited to practice this meditation for 2 weeks and then measured again. After the compassion practice, both conditions significantly increased positive qualities toward self/others, decreased negative qualities toward self, and increased awareness and attention to mental events and bodily sensations, with no differences between the conditions. After 2 weeks, both conditions showed a similar frequency of meditation practice and increases in specific types of self-care behaviors, with the frequency of clinical self-care behaviors being significantly higher in TMTBA. Finally, lower imagery ability in the visual and cutaneous modality were moderators of the efficacy of the TMTBA (vs. CAU) condition in increasing adherence to the practice. Embodied VR could be an interesting tool to facilitate and increase the efficacy of CBIs by facilitating the construction of positive and powerful mental images.","[{'authorId': '3325539', 'name': 'A.

Although comfortable interpersonal distance seems to be dependent on social factors such as the gender, age and activity of the confederates, it also seems to be modulated by the way we represent our peripersonal-action space. To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the relation between the emotional responses registered through electrodermal activity (EDA) triggered by human-like point-light displays (PLDs) carrying different facial expressions (neutral, angry, happy) when located in the participants peripersonal or extrapersonal space, and the comfort distance with the same PLDs when approaching and crossing the participants fronto-parallel axis on the right or left side. The results show an increase of the phasic EDA for PLDs with angry facial expressions located in the peripersonal space (reachability judgment task), in comparison to the same PLDs located in the extrapersonal space, which was not observed for PLDs with neutral or happy facial expressions. The results also show an increase of the comfort distance for PLDs approaching the participants with an angry facial expression (interpersonal comfort distance judgment task), in comparison to PLDs with happy and neutral ones, which was related to the increase of the physiological response. Overall, the findings indicate that comfort social space can be predicted from the emotional reaction triggered by a confederate when located within the observer’s peripersonal space. This suggests that peripersonal-action space and interpersonal-social space are similarly sensitive to the emotional valence of the confederate, which could reflect a common adaptive mechanism in specifying theses spaces to subtend interactions with both the physical and social environment, but also to ensure body protection from potential threats.","[{'authorId': '41033515', 'name': 'A.

Since it has been recognized that emotions have a pivotal role for the human mind, an ever increasing number of laboratories and research centers are interested in affective sciences, affective neuroscience, affective psychology and affective psychopathology. Therefore, this paper presents multidisciplinary research results of Laboratory for Interactive Simulation System at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb in the stress resilience. Patient's distortion in emotional processing of multimodal input stimuli is predominantly consequence of his/her cognitive deficit which is result of their individual mental health disorders. These emotional distortions in patient's multimodal physiological, facial, acoustic, and linguistic features related to presented stimulation can be used as indicator of patient's mental illness. Real-time processing and analysis of patient's multimodal response related to annotated input stimuli is based on appropriate machine learning methods from computer science. Comprehensive longitudinal multimodal analysis of patient's emotion, mood, feelings, attention, motivation, decision-making, and working memory in synchronization with multimodal stimuli provides extremely valuable big database for data mining, machine learning and machine reasoning. Presented multimedia stimuli sequence includes personalized images, movies and sounds, as well as semantically congruent narratives. Simultaneously, with stimuli presentation patient provides subjective emotional ratings of presented stimuli in terms of subjective units of discomfort/distress, discrete emotions, or valence and arousal. These subjective emotional ratings of input stimuli and corresponding physiological, speech, and facial output features provides enough information for evaluation of patient's cognitive appraisal deficit.

In the current study we aimed to examine effects of frustration on brain activity while performing a well-learned task in participants with low and high tolerance for arousal. Prior to the functional magnetic resonance imaging session, the subjects underwent 2 weeks of Braille reading training. Frustration induction was obtained by using a novel highly difficult tactile task based on discrimination of Braille-like raised dots patterns and negative feedback. Effectiveness of this procedure has been confirmed in a pilot study using galvanic skin response and questionnaires. Brain activation pattern during tactile discrimination task before and after frustration were compared directly. Results revealed changes in brain activity in structures mostly reported in acute stress studies: striatum, cingulate cortex, insula, middle frontal gyrus and precuneus and in structures engaged in tactile Braille discrimination: SI and SII. Temperament type affected activation pattern. Subjects with low tolerance for arousal showed higher activation in the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule than high reactivity group. Even though performance in the discrimination trials following frustration was unaltered, we observed increased activity of primary and secondary somatosensory cortex processing the tactile information. We interpret this effect as an indicator of additional involvement required to counteract the effects of frustration.","[{'authorId': '5542266', 'name': 'Maria Bierzyńska'}, {'authorId': '40401798', 'name': 'M.

In addition to summarizing past and current literature regarding the social behaviors of children with ADHD, these behaviors are discussed in terms of subtype and gender differences and treatment implications. Given limited effectiveness of treatment options, whether it be medication, behavioral modification, or social skills training, there is a need to examine additional factors that may contribute to the social impairment of children with ADHD. Therefore, this review focuses on potential neuropsychological deficits, biased perceptions of social ability, and deficits in encoding and processing social information that may contribute to the social impairment of children with ADHD.

At the same time, the subjects' skin electrical (EDA) , pulse frequency (Pf) , respiratory frequency (Rf) physiological data and Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) data before and after walking were collected; the mean value of three dimensions of SAM and the emotion difference before and after the experiment were calculated. The differences of physiological indexes and subjective mood changes of subjects were tested by paired sample t-test. Results: Compared with the daily environment, the ΔEDA, ΔPf and ΔRf of the subjects in the virtual natural environment were all decreased , and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). There were statistically significant differences in pleasure and arousal between subjects before and after using the virtual natural environment (P <0.05). Compared with the daily environment, the Δpleasure degree of subjects using the virtual natural environment increased, and the Δarousal degree and Δdominance degree decreased, and the differences were statistically significant (P <0.05).

The PTSD Checklist-Military version, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were used as outcome measures. Of those who completed post-treatment assessment, 75% had experienced at least a 50% reduction in PTSD symptoms and no longer met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD at post treatment. Average PSTD scores decreased by 50.4%, depression scores by 46.6%, and anxiety scores by 36%. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that statistically significant improvements in PTSD, depression, and anxiety occurred over the course of treatment and were maintained at follow up. There were no adverse events associated with VRET treatment. This study provides preliminary support for the use of VRET in combat-related PTSD. Further study will be needed to determine the wider utility of the method and to determine if it offers advantages over other established PTSD treatment modalities.","[{'authorId': '1773493', 'name': 'R.

The burden of dementia is borne not only by people with dementia, but by their carers, both informal and professional. The major direct financial costs are managed by the welfare sector, through the provision of community services and residential care, whereas indirect costs are largely attributed to informal carers. Advances in care practices would be of considerable benefit. The health sector has had its main impact in the area of dementia by providing skills and expertise necessary for comprehensive, holistic assessments. Kitwood challenges this medical model, which he labels as …

However, there are interindividual differences in the analgesic effect of changing the visual body image. We hypothesized that a negative body image associated with changing the visual body appearance causes interindividual differences in the analgesic effect although the relationship between the visual body appearance and analgesic effect has not been clarified. We investigated whether a negative body image associated with changes in the visual body appearance increased pain. Twenty-five healthy individuals participated in this study. To evoke a negative body image, we applied the method of rubber hand illusion. We created an “injured rubber hand” to evoke unpleasantness associated with pain, a “hairy rubber hand” to evoke unpleasantness associated with embarrassment, and a “twisted rubber hand” to evoke unpleasantness associated with deviation from the concept of normality. We also created a “normal rubber hand” as a control. The pain threshold was measured while the participant observed the rubber hand using a device that measured pain caused by thermal stimuli. Body ownership experiences were elicited by observation of the injured rubber hand and hairy rubber hand as well as the normal rubber hand. Participants felt more unpleasantness by observing the injured rubber hand and hairy rubber hand than the normal rubber hand and twisted rubber hand (p<0.001). The pain threshold was lower under the injured rubber hand condition than with the other conditions (p<0.001). We conclude that a negative body appearance associated with pain can increase pain sensitivity.","[{'authorId': '37884510', 'name': 'M. Osumi'}, {'authorId': '7000232', 'name': 'R.

The group program content is informed by a two dimensional model of emotion (arousal, valence), along with music psychology theories about how music evokes emotional responses. The program has been evaluated in two samples of adolescents: 41 “at risk” adolescents (76% males; Mage = 14.8 years) attending an educational re-engagement program and 216 students (100% females; Mage = 13.6 years) attending a mainstream secondary school. Results showed significant pre- to post-program improvements in measures of emotion awareness, identification, and regulation (p < 0.01 to p = 0.06 in the smaller “at risk” sample and all p < 0.001 in the mainstream school sample). Participant ratings of engagement and likelihood of using the strategies learned in the program were high. Tuned In shows promise as a brief emotion regulation intervention for adolescents, and these findings extend an earlier study with young adults.

b9f521c3befd7bcdcaecc8bfd6ef527a0f751c13,"Recent approaches in the research on walkable environments and wellbeing go beyond correlational analysis to consider the specific characteristics of individuals and their interaction with the immediate environment. Accordingly, a need has been accentuated for new human-centered methods to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying environmental effects on walking and consequently on wellbeing. Immersive virtual environments (IVEs) were suggested as a potential method that can advance this type of research as they offer a unique combination between controlled experimental environments that allow drawing causal conclusions and a high level of environmental realism that supports ecological validity. The current study pilot tested a walking simulator with additional sensor technologies, including biosensors, eye tracking and gait sensors. Results found IVEs to facilitate extremely high tempo-spatial-resolution measurement of physical walking parameters (e.g., speed, number of gaits) along with walking experience and wellbeing (e.g., electrodermal activity, heartrate). This level of resolution is useful in linking specific environmental stimuli to the psychophysiological and behavioral reactions, which cannot be obtained in real-world and self-report research designs. A set of guidelines for implementing IVE technology for research is suggested in order to standardize its use and allow new researchers to engage with this emerging field of research.","[{'authorId': '20472032', 'name': 'Amit Birenboim'}, {'authorId': '1421576799', 'name': 'Pazit Ben-Nun Bloom'}, {'authorId': '2046355264', 'name': 'Hila Levit'}, {'authorId': '145060551', 'name': 'Itzhak Omer'}]",14.0,,81.0,"The Study of Walking, Walkability and Wellbeing in Immersive Virtual Environments",2021.0

Methods: Fourteen non-medicated school-aged children with ADHD, received 18 training sessions during 6 weeks. Training included walking on a treadmill while negotiating virtual obstacles. Behavioral symptoms, cognition and gait were tested before and after the training and at 6-weeks follow-up. Results: Based on parental report, there was a significant improvement in children’s social problems and psychosomatic behavior after the training. Executive function and memory were improved post-training while attention was unchanged. Gait regularity significantly increased during dual-task walking. Long-term training effects were maintained in memory and executive function. Conclusion: Treadmill-training augmented with virtual-reality is feasible and may be an effective treatment to enhance behavior, cognitive function and dual-tasking in children with ADHD.","[{'authorId': '1402105804', 'name': 'S.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a noninvasive and nonradioactive solution for emotion identification. Accurate and automatic classification of emotions can boost the development of human–computer interface. This article proposes automatic extraction and classification of features through the use of different convolutional neural networks (CNNs). At first, the proposed method converts the filtered EEG signals into an image using a time–frequency representation. Smoothed pseudo-Wigner–Ville distribution is used to transform time-domain EEG signals into images. These images are fed to pretrained AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 along with configurable CNN. The performance of four CNNs is evaluated by measuring the accuracy, precision, Mathew’s correlation coefficient, F1-score, and false-positive rate. The results obtained by evaluating four CNNs show that configurable CNN requires very less learning parameters with better accuracy. Accuracy scores of 90.98%, 91.91%, 92.71%, and 93.01% obtained by AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16, and configurable CNN show that the proposed method is best among other existing methods.","[{'authorId': '36279503', 'name': 'S.

bac02b33806a5eca3ba3523cd8e7fb41e8b858ff,"Background: A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) in specific phobias, but research in seriously impaired patients with agoraphobia is lacking. In this randomized controlled trial with patients with agoraphobia and panic disorder, VRET and exposure in vivo were compared in terms of outcome and processes involved. Methods: Patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia (n = 55) were randomly assigned to receive 4 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) followed by either 6 sessions of VRET or 6 sessions of exposure in vivo or to a waiting list control condition. Results: Analyses showed that both active treatment packages were significantly more effective than no treatment and that no differences between VRET and exposure in vivo were found in three out of four outcome measures. On the panic disorder severity scale, however, CBT plus exposure in vivo was more effective than CBT plus VRET. The results show clear synchrony of temporal processes involved in VRET and exposure in vivo on weekly avoidance measures and cognitive measures. Further, it was shown that initial changes in agoraphobic cognitions during the CBT phase predicted later changes in agoraphobic avoidance behavior. Conclusion: These data support the notion that therapeutic processes involved might be the same in VRET and exposure in vivo. However, given the slight superiority of exposure in vivo above VRET, the costs involved in the implementation of VRET and the lack of long-term follow-up, VRET cannot yet be recommended for patients with agoraphobia.","[{'authorId': '2097172304', 'name': 'Katharina Meyerbroeker'}, {'authorId': '145500304', 'name': 'N.

Russell's (1974) pleasure, arousal and dominance (P‐A‐D) model. Factor analysis was performed to examine the dimensional structure of affective response to a recreation engagement. Regression models examined the relationship between affect and conventional measures of recreation satisfaction. The results showed that affect did not factor into a 3‐dimensional structure suggested by the P‐A‐D model. Rather, a 1‐dimensional structure emerged. Affect explained moderate amounts of variance in four measures of satisfaction. Measures of satisfaction were also regressed on separate P‐A‐D dimensions. The pleasure dimension was the most important predictor of overall satisfaction with a hunting trip and a summated satisfaction measure.

More specifically, emotions are elicited in agreement with a bidimensional spatial localization of affective states, that is, arousal and valence dimensions. A dedicated experimental protocol was designed and realized where specific affective states are suitably induced while three peripheral physiological signals, i.e., ElectroCardioGram (ECG), ElectroDermal Response (EDR), and ReSPiration activity (RSP), are simultaneously acquired. A group of 35 volunteers was presented with sets of images gathered from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) having five levels of arousal and five levels of valence, including a neutral reference level in both. Standard methods as well as nonlinear dynamic techniques were used to extract sets of features from the collected signals. The goal of this paper is to implement an automatic multiclass arousal/valence classifier comparing performance when extracted features from nonlinear methods are used as an alternative to standard features. Results show that, when nonlinearly extracted features are used, the percentages of successful recognition dramatically increase. A good recognition accuracy (>;90 percent) after 40-fold cross-validation steps for both arousal and valence classes was achieved by using the Quadratic Discriminant Classifier (QDC).","[{'authorId': '1724693', 'name': 'G.

This review takes an evolutionary perspective and characterizes emotion in terms of response tendencies. Emotion regulation is defined and distinguished from coping, mood regulation, defense, and affect regulation. In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground. According to a process model of emotion regulation, emotion may be regulated at five points in the emotion generative process: (a) selection of the situation, (b) modification of the situation, (c) deployment of attention, (d) change of cognitions, and (e) modulation of responses. The field of emotion regulation promises new insights into age-old questions about how people manage their emotions.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Aggregating 115 effect sizes from 83 studies, it finds that technological immersion has a medium-sized effect on presence. Additionally, results show that increased levels of user-tracking, the use of stereoscopic visuals, and wider fields of view of visual displays are significantly more impactful than improvements to most other immersive system features, including quality of visual and auditory content.

Nightmare pathogenesis remains unexplained, as do differences between nontraumatic and posttraumatic nightmares (for those with or without posttraumatic stress disorder) and relations with waking functioning. No models adequately explain nightmares nor have they been reconciled with recent developments in cognitive neuroscience, fear acquisition, and emotional memory. The authors review the recent literature and propose a conceptual framework for understanding a spectrum of dysphoric dreaming. Central to this is the notion that variations in nightmare prevalence, frequency, severity, and psychopathological comorbidity reflect the influence of both affect load, a consequence of daily variations in emotional pressure, and affect distress, a disposition to experience events with distressing, highly reactive emotions. In a cross-state, multilevel model of dream function and nightmare production, the authors integrate findings on emotional memory structures and the brain correlates of emotion.","[{'authorId': '117883465', 'name': 'R.

Whilst student-teacher closeness is known to reduce student aggression and improve behaviour, it is not yet known why some teachers experience close relationships with disruptive students and others do not. This qualitative study therefore examined relational closeness between elementary teachers and disruptive students in Sydney, Australia. Using a teacher speech sample task, we identified eight disruptive students with ‘complicated’ student-teacher relationships: high in both closeness and conflict. Eleven classroom teachers and seven support teachers each spoke about their relationships with the eight students. Speech samples were analysed using an inductive content analysis to determine characteristics that may facilitate relational closeness in spite of student-teacher conflict. Findings revealed two characteristics of teachers’ speech that guided relational closeness: attributions for disruptive behaviour and emotional competence. Not all teachers, however, described a close relationship. These findings provide new directions for interventions that aim to improve student-teacher relationship quality.","[{'authorId': '144650596', 'name': 'Kevin F.

The significant worldwide prevalence and negative impact of anxiety are documented and highlight the importance of increasing therapist and patient use of effective treatment.

In particular, virtual reality (VR) technology is discussed as a way to increase the availability of exposure therapy. Incorporating VR in therapy can increase the ease, acceptability, and effectiveness of treatment for anxiety. VR exposure therapy (VRET) permits individualized, gradual, controlled, immersive exposure that is easy for therapists to implement and often more acceptable to patients than in vivo or imaginal exposure. VR is presented as a scalable tool that can augment access to and effectiveness of exposure therapy thus improving treatment of anxiety disorders. VR also has the potential to help with assessment and with therapist training standardization. The authors advocate for providing continuing education in VRET to practicing clinicians and including training in exposure therapy and VRET in training programs.

Background: Chronic low back pain is the most prevalent chronic pain condition worldwide and access to behavioral pain treatment is limited. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain.


OBJECTIVE
Objective: To conduct a double-blind, parallel arm, single cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic.


METHODS
Methods: A national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported non-malignant low back pain > 6 months duration and with average pain intensity > 4/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to one of two daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework.


RESULTS
The study sample was 179 adults (female: 77%; Caucasian: 91%; at least some college education: 92%; mean age: 51.5 years, SD=13.1; average pain intensity: 5/10, SD=1.2; back pain duration >5 years: 67%). No group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx vs. Sham VR (p<0.0001). For the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest p-value = .0090), and between-groups Cohen's d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49 indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.17-1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress. Between group comparisons for physical function and sleep disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group vs. the Sham VR group (p=0.0224 and p=.0132, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent; MME) did not reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (p<0.01) but not for ShamVR.


CONCLUSIONS
EaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects. Home-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand non-pharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to propose the use of a virtual reality (VR)-based approach to improve teacher education and life-long professional development. Through constant training in real-life based situations but within a safe three-dimensional virtual school environment, teachers are given the opportunity to experience and learn how to react to different types of incidents that may take place in a school environment.


Design/methodology/approach
The current paper presents the design cycle that was followed for the implementation of the VR teacher training system. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a case study that aimed to promote teachers’ understanding of student’s problematic situations related to substance use. As part of the experimental investigation, the impact of the VR system on participants’ emotions and mood states is evaluated through Electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, heart rate (HR) recordings and self-reported data.


Findings
Results indicate significant changes to participant’s negative emotional and mood states, suggesting that the scenario and the VR experience had a strong impact on them. Moreover, participants’ HR was increased during the experiment, while the analysis of the EEG signal indicated that the participants experienced a stressful situation that could justify the change in their negative emotions and mood states.


Originality/value
The proposed VR-based approach aims to provide an innovative framework to teacher education and the related training methodology. In the long-term, the proposed VR system aims to form a new paradigm of teacher training, an alternative safe method that will allow user-teachers to learn through trial and error techniques that reflect real-life situations within a three-dimensional school space and without the risk of harming real students. To the best of our knowledge this is one of the first systematic attempts to use a VR-based methodology to address real teachers’ needs. The development of the VR application is linked to both strong theoretical foundations in education derived from the literature but also from real teachers’ problems and requirements derived from an extensive literature analysis, survey and interviews with experts including teachers, school counselors and psychologists. The VR tool addresses specific teachers’ competences as outcome, after an extensive documentation of existing Teachers’ Competence Models and significant guidance by experts who pointed specific competencies of primary importance to teachers.

bcbd6bb487a868f7eea2eecc9a1465f2d6b29544,"Background Rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a subject's illusion of the self-ownership of a rubber hand that was touched synchronously with their own hand. Although previous studies have confirmed that this illusion disappears when the rubber hand was touched asynchronously with the subject's hand, the minimum temporal discrepancy of these two events for attenuation of RHI has not been examined. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, various temporal discrepancies between visual and tactile stimulations were introduced by using a visual feedback delay experimental setup, and RHI effects in each temporal discrepancy condition were systematically tested. The results showed that subjects felt significantly greater RHI effects with temporal discrepancies of less than 300 ms compared with longer temporal discrepancies. The RHI effects on reaching performance (proprioceptive drift) showed similar conditional differences. Conclusions/Significance Our results first demonstrated that a temporal discrepancy of less than 300 ms between visual stimulation of the rubber hand and tactile stimulation to the subject's own hand is preferable to induce strong sensation of RHI. We suggest that the time window of less than 300 ms is critical for multi-sensory integration processes constituting the self-body image.","[{'authorId': '32626573', 'name': 'Sotaro Shimada'}, {'authorId': '2068894968', 'name': 'Kensuke Fukuda'}, {'authorId': '1805464', 'name': 'K.

bcce20e219157965bc7fef295881dd704a19c417,"Virtual Reality (VR) could be an interesting tool to combat obesity and sedentariness in children. During the last years a multidisciplinary research team comprised of engineers, psychologists, physiotherapists and paediatricians have been testing these technologies. Throughout the tests, physiological (cardiovascular and metabolic response with biomedical sensors (smart fabrics TIAS) and psychological responses have been collected. The results presented in this paper reflect two main aspects: 1) the feasibility of the monitoring techniques employed and 2) the validity of virtual reality and exergaming technologies as promoters of physical activity and their potential as tools in clinical intervention programs. In the first study (n=90) children, a commercial platform was tested as support tool to aerobic exercise in a treadmill. Results showed a more physiological effort by obese group and limitations to measure effort perception with Borg scale especially in obese group. In second study (n=126) a new VR platform was developed (VREP) and tested as support of aerobic activities, a difference of first study, all the boys completed both conditions (same Aerobic exercise with/without support VR). 59.5% felt that they had to exert more effort in the traditional condition. Regarding to acceptability in both studies the vast majority of the participants liked the idea of combining physical activity with the VR platform as a form of treatment to increase physical activity. The capacity of VR technology to create controllable, multisensory, interactive 3D stimulus environments within which children's performance can be motivated, recorded, and measured, has been tested in these studies, offering clinical assessment and intervention options which are not possible using traditional methods.","[{'authorId': '3077120', 'name': 'J.

We analyzed the newly developed VR continuous performance test (VR-CPT) for Korean children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TDC). To identify specific features of a virtual environment that influence the attention performance of children, we investigated whether the presence of a virtual teacher and social cues in the VR environment affects their attention performance. A total of 38 participants (18 TDC and 20 ADHD children and adolescents) were recruited for VR-CPT testing. Bivariate correlational analysis was conducted to examine the associations between the results of the VR-CPT and ADHD questionnaires to determine the capacity of VR-CPT to mirror real-life attention behaviors. Mixed-design analysis of variables was conducted to compare the effects of the social aspects of the VR-CPT on attention performance in groups. There were significant associations between ADHD rating scores and the omission error, commission error, reaction time (RT), reaction time variability (RTV), and total accuracy of the VR-CPT in the ADHD group. In addition, the ADHD group exhibited comparable performance with the TDC group for all measures of the VR-CPT. Also there seemed to be a trend of decreasing RTV when a virtual teacher with social cues was present compared with the equipment control condition in the ADHD group. Performance in the VR-CPT program was associated with behavioral measures of ADHD symptoms. Adding social aspects to a VR environment commonly encountered by children and adolescents has the potential to make a difference in the attention performance of youths with ADHD.","[{'authorId': '40941943', 'name': 'Hyojung Eom'}, {'authorId': '1973742', 'name': 'K.

The DOCS is a 20-item measure that assesses the four dimensions of OC symptoms most reliably replicated in previous structural research. Factorial validity of the DOCS was supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of 3 samples, including individuals with OC disorder, those with other anxiety disorders, and nonclinical individuals. Scores on the DOCS displayed good performance on indices of reliability and validity, as well as sensitivity to treatment and diagnostic sensitivity, and hold promise as a measure of OC symptoms in clinical and research settings.","[{'authorId': '5086385', 'name': 'J.

bd73152fde2070b539f2c15a0f754efa472ecbee,"In this article we propose mechanisms that govern the processing of emotional information, particularly those involved in fear reduction. Emotions are viewed as represented by information structures in memory, and anxiety is thought to occur when an information structure that serves as program to escape or avoid danger is activated. Emotional processing is denned as the modification of memory structures that underlie emotions. It is argued that some form of exposure to feared situations is common to many psychotherapies for anxiety, and that confrontation with feared objects or situations is an effective treatment. Physiological activation and habituation within and across exposure sessions are cited as indicators of emotional processing, and variables that influence activation and habituation of fear responses are examined. These variables and the indicators are analyzed to yield an account of what information must be integrated for emotional processing of a fear structure. The elements of such a structure are viewed as cognitive representations of the stimulus characteristic of the fear situation, the individual's responses in it, and aspects of its meaning for the individual. Treatment failures are interpreted with respect to the interference of cognitive defenses, autonomic arousal, mood state, and erroneous ideation with reformation of targeted fear structures. Applications of the concepts advanced here to therapeutic practice and to the broader study of psychopathology are discussed.","[{'authorId': '6041993', 'name': 'E.

In this vein, we provide a concrete solution that personalizes game maps in a top-down action-shooter game to suit an individual player's preferences. The need for personalized PCG is steadily growing as the player market diversifies, making it more difficult to design a game that will accommodate a broad range of preferences and skills. In the solution presented here, the geometry of the map and the density of content within that geometry are represented and generated in distinct evolutionary processes, with the player's preferences being captured and utilized through a combination of interactive evolution and a player model formulated as a recommender system. All these components were implemented into a test bed game and experimented on through an unsupervised public experiment. The solution is examined against a plausible random baseline that is comparable to random map generators that have been implemented by independent game developers. Results indicate that the system as a whole is receiving better ratings, that the geometry and content evolutionary processes are exploring more of the solution space, and that the mean prediction accuracy of the player preference models is equivalent to that of existing recommender system literature. Furthermore, we discuss how each of the individual solutions can be used with other game genres and content types.","[{'authorId': '1686864', 'name': 'W.

The purpose of the present study was to compare therapeutic effects of an electromyography (EMG) biofeedback augmented by virtual reality (VR) and EMG biofeedback alone on the triceps and biceps (T:B) muscle activity imbalance and elbow joint movement coordination during a reaching motor taskOBJECTIVE: To compare therapeutic effects of an electromyography (EMG) biofeedback augmented by virtual reality (VR) and EMG biofeedback alone on the triceps and biceps muscle activity imbalance and elbow joint movement coordination during a reaching motor task in normal children and children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP).


METHODS
18 children with spastic CP (2 females; mean±standard deviation = 9.5 ± 1.96 years) and 8 normal children (3 females; mean ± standard deviation = 9.75 ± 2.55 years) were recruited from a local community center. All children with CP first underwent one intensive session of EMG feedback (30 minutes), followed by one session of the EMG-VR feedback (30 minutes) after a 1-week washout period. Clinical tests included elbow extension range of motion (ROM), biceps muscle strength, and box and block test. EMG triceps and biceps (T:B) muscle activity imbalance and reaching movement acceleration coordination were concurrently determined by EMG and 3-axis accelerometer measurements respectively. Independent t-test and one-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed at p < 0.05.


RESULTS
The one-way repeated ANOVA was revealed to be significantly effective in elbow extension ROM (p = 0.01), biceps muscle strength (p = 0.01), and box and block test (p = 0.03). The one-way repeated ANOVA also revealed to be significantly effective in the peak triceps muscle activity (p = 0.01). However, one-way repeated ANOVA produced no statistical significance in the composite 3-dimensional movement acceleration coordination data (p = 0.12).


CONCLUSIONS
The present study is a first clinical trial that demonstrated the superior benefits of the EMG biofeedback when augmented by virtual reality exercise games in children with spastic CP. The augmented EMG and VR feedback produced better neuromuscular balance control in the elbow joint than the EMG biofeedback alone.","[{'authorId': '2115614159', 'name': 'J. W.

In this paper, an immersive VR rehabilitation training system endowed with wearable haptics is proposed for children with neuromotor impairments: it aims to enhance involvement and engagement of patients, to provide congruent multi-sensory afferent feedback during motor exercises and to benefit from the flexibility of VR in adapting exercises to the patient’s need. An experimental rehabilitation session conducted with children with cerebral palsy (CP) and developmental dyspraxia (DD) has been performed to evaluate the usability of the system and proof of concept trial of the proposed approach. We compared CP/DD performance with both typically developing children and adult control group. Results show the system was compliant with different levels of motor skills and allowed patients to complete the experimental rehabilitation session, with performance varying according to the expected motor abilities of different groups. Moreover, a kinematic assessmentbased on the presented system has been designed. Obtained results reflected different motor abilities of patients and participants, suggesting suitability of the proposed kinematic assessment as a motor function outcome.","[{'authorId': '144038568', 'name': 'Ilaria Bortone'}, {'authorId': '2307424', 'name': 'D.

be615d52027cf249d543a88398557e9b8f2b6d51,"Phobias are described as an exaggerated, irrational fear of specific objects or situations, characterized by significant avoidance of any in vivo or in vitro exposure to fear stimuli or enduring it with great distress when avoidance is not possible. About 4.4% percent of the adult population in the USA has one or more phobias which will mostly persist for years and become chronic; complete remissions without treatment are very rare (Narrow et al., 2002).Social phobia is the most common anxiety disorder and the 3rd most common psychiatric disorder (Craske, 1999), having a one year prevalence of 3.2% in the US. It is characterized by excessive and persistent anxiety in social situations ranging from public speaking to performing a task in the presence of others. Most often, the severity of symptoms and degree of impairment vary, given one's work demands and the stability of social relations. Recent studies show that social phobia interferes with work performance (in 93% of the cases), social life (in 82% of the individuals) and close relationships (in 71% of the individuals) (Ruscio et al., 2007; Wallach, 2009). A specific phobia is an intense, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Adults with phobias most often realize that these fears are irrational, but they often find that facing, or even thinking about facing the feared object or situation brings on severe anxiety. Specific phobias are rather common as they affect 19.2 million adults in the US. Among the simple phobia subtypes established by DSM - IV, fear of flying has become very common in modern societies. Statistics in US and Europe show that 10%-15% percent from the general population suffer from fear of flying and about 20%-25% experience high levels of anxiety during flying (Ost, 1997; Muhlberger, 2001). Acrophobia or fear of heights it also rather common and it is known to affect 1 in 20 adults (Coelho et al., 2009).To a great extent, phobia is the result of classical conditioning or vicarious learning. Fear is maintained by the avoidance behavior: avoidance impedes confronting the phobia symptoms (e.g. subjective anxiety and physiological arousal) and therefore fear is not solved but negatively reinforced (therefore, exposure has the role of fear extinction) (Rothbaum et al, 2000; Emmelkamp et al., 2002). Studies investigating the impact of exposure on phobia symptoms have provided empirical evidence showing that it plays a major role in treatment outcome (Rothbaum et al, 2000; Emmelkamp et al., 2002; Powers & Emmelkamp, 2008; Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2008).In addition to conditioning studies, there is a large amount of research showing that both dysfunctional cognitions (Beck, 1976) and irrational beliefs (Ellis, 1979) explain to a great extent anxiety symptoms (Chambless et al., 1998; Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2008; Wallach et al. 2009). Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT) advances two main irrational beliefs as leading to anxiety: demandingness (DEM) and awfulizing (AWF). DEM refers to absolutist requirements, from self, others, and the world, formulated as ""musts"" or ""shoulds"". AWF refers to believing that a particular situation is catastrophic. Thus, anxiety is experienced when events are incongruent with the formulated demands of one's goals and the person evaluates the situation as being a catastrophe and/or unbearable, experiencing a low emotion-focused coping potential (David et al., 2002). Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies (CBT), namely REBT, use a number of techniques to identify and restructure dysfunctional beliefs/irrational beliefs that lead to anxiety, as well as assimilate rational cognitions and functional responses. As a matter of fact, there is extensive empirical data supporting the efficacy of CBT in treating phobias (Ost et al., 1997; Chambless et al., 1998; Choy et al., 2007; Zlomke et al. 2008; Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2008; Wallach et al. 2009) with a large number of studies supporting the use of treatment that combines both cognitive and behavioral (mainly exposure) components (Ost et al. …","[{'authorId': '4041318', 'name': 'R.

Highly personalized practising can be required before patients are ready to perform in vivo exposure. Virtual reality-based therapy could be beneficial for this group. Aims: To assess the feasibility and potential effect of virtual reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy (VR-CBT) for patients with severe generalized SAD. Methods: Fifteen patients with generalized SAD attended up to 16 VR-CBT sessions. Questionnaires on clinical and functional outcomes, and diary assessments on social activity, social anxiety and paranoia were completed at baseline, post-treatment and at 6-months follow-up. Results: Two patients dropped out of treatment. Improvements in social anxiety and quality of life were found at post-treatment. At follow-up, depressive symptoms had decreased, and the effect on social anxiety was maintained. With respect to diary assessments, social anxiety in company and paranoia were significantly reduced by post-treatment. These improvements were maintained at follow-up. No increase was observed in social activity. Conclusions: This uncontrolled pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and treatment potential of VR-CBT in a difficult-to-treat group of patients with generalized SAD. Results suggest that VR-CBT may be effective in reducing anxiety as well as depression, and can increase quality of life.","[{'authorId': '10719925', 'name': 'C.

bf0c30728216c4f8977af3cb4bc2829c50485f26,"It is generally assumed that technology assists individuals in improving the quality of their lives. However, the impact of new technologies and media on well-being and positive functioning is still somewhat controversial. In this paper, we contend that the quality of experience should become the guiding principle in the design and development of new technologies, as well as a primary metric for the evaluation of their applications. The emerging discipline of Positive Psychology provides a useful framework to address this challenge. Positive Psychology is the scientific study of optimal human functioning and flourishing. Instead of drawing on a ""disease model"" of human behavior, it focuses on factors that enable individuals and communities to thrive and build the best in life. In this paper, we propose the ""Positive Technology"" approach--the scientific and applied approach to the use of technology for improving the quality of our personal experience through its structuring, augmentation, and/or replacement--as a way of framing a suitable object of study in the field of cyberpsychology and human-computer interaction. Specifically, we suggest that it is possible to use technology to influence three specific features of our experience--affective quality, engagement/actualization, and connectedness--that serve to promote adaptive behaviors and positive functioning. In this framework, positive technologies are classified according to their effects on a specific feature of personal experience. Moreover, for each level, we have identified critical variables that can be manipulated to guide the design and development of positive technologies.","[{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

Physiological indicators, including EEG (electroencephalogram), blood pressure, skin conductance, and pulse, were monitored in 180 Chinese university students (mean age: 20.72 ± 2.56 years) while they were watching bamboo videos. Before and after watching the videos, their psychological indicators, including positive and negative moods, were measured using the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. After watching the bamboo videos of different durations, all of the physiological indicators responded to the stimulation after only 1 min. The indicators showed different trends at 1, 3 and 5 min. EEG decreased and then was maintained at a stable level after 1 min, and the high β, low β, and α waves had no significant differences between 1, 3 and 5 min. Blood pressure dropped to a stable state after 3 min, and the decline was significantly different greater after 3 min than after 1 min. Skin conductance increased for 1 to 5 min, and it did not stabilize after a long time (5 min). Pulse decreased after 1 min but increased after 5 min. After watching the videos with bamboo of varying structures, the physiological and psychological indicators showed significantly different changes. Skin conductance significantly increased (mean value: 6.78%), and the amount of sweat was more effectively reduced, thereby reducing tension, when the students viewed videos of sympodial bamboo forests compared with monopodial bamboo forests. Bamboo forests with a higher canopy density (0.83–0.85) could significantly decrease α waves (mean value: 1.50 Hz), relaxing the human body. High β and low β waves showed greater decreases, with tension reduced more effectively, when bamboo forests with a low tilt ratio (< 1.5%) were viewed. Bamboo forests with neat undergrowth could have more beneficial physiological and psychological effects on the human body.","[{'authorId': '2108034919', 'name': 'Yuqian Wang'}, {'authorId': '46332956', 'name': 'Mingyan Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2118798532', 'name': 'Yinshu Huang'}, {'authorId': '1705432570', 'name': 'Zhiyi Sheng'}, {'authorId': '2107971005', 'name': 'Xiao Huang'}, {'authorId': '2108810892', 'name': 'Wei Lin'}, {'authorId': '6388016', 'name': 'Qibing Chen'}, {'authorId': '48568342', 'name': 'Xi Li'}, {'authorId': '2111854625', 'name': 'Zhenghua Luo'}, {'authorId': '40908491', 'name': 'Bingyang Lv'}]",14.0,,62.0,Physiological and Psychological Effects of Watching Videos of Different Durations Showing Urban Bamboo Forests with Varied Structures,2020.0

In the present study, two meta-analyses examined the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety. The first meta-analysis tested whether virtual reality exposure therapy reduces social anxiety more than a waitlist control condition.

The second meta-analysis tested whether the standard treatment for social anxiety, which includes in vivo or imaginal exposure, leads to greater effects than virtual reality exposure therapy. The second meta-analysis, consisting of seven studies and 340 total participants, showed essentially no difference in effect sizes between virtual reality exposure and in vivo or imaginal exposure. The results of the two meta-analyses support the use of virtual reality in the treatment of social anxiety.","[{'authorId': '115557090', 'name': 'Rachel K Chesham'}, {'authorId': '5877808', 'name': 'J.

Pediatric headache is highly widespread and is associated with distress and reduced quality of life. Pharmacological treatment of chronic headache in children has been only partially effective and, as in medication-overuse headache, can sometimes be counterproductive. Therefore, there is a substantial need to develop other effective methods of treatment. Here we present the rationale, feasibility, and preliminary results of a pilot study applying a novel system, combining virtual reality and biofeedback, aimed as an abortive treatment of pediatric chronic headache.


DESIGN
A prospective single-arm open-label, pilot study. Ten children attending an outpatient pediatric neurology clinic were treated by the proposed system. Participants practiced relaxation with biofeedback and learned to associate successful relaxation with positive pain-free virtual images of themselves.


RESULTS
Nine patients completed the 10-session intervention. Ratings of pain, daily functioning, and quality of life improved significantly at 1 and at 3 months posttreatment. Most patients reported applying their newly acquired relaxation and imagery skills to relieve headache outside the lab.


CONCLUSION
This novel system, combining biofeedback and virtual reality, is feasible for pediatric use. Randomized controlled studies in larger populations are needed in order to determine the utility of the system in reducing headache, improving daily functioning, and elevating quality of life.","[{'authorId': '144920903', 'name': 'S.

These include: poor infrastructure; shortage of facilities; a weak tourist image; a lack of know-how with regard to how to welcome visitors and market tourism services; and the scarcity of available capital. In the research reported on in this paper, we explore the involvement of microcredit institutions to alleviate these issues. Because tourism is not yet developed in our study area of West Cameroon, action research was considered the only way to validate (by action) the recommendations of both the actors and the researchers. Action research permits the researchers to study the complex issues that typify the management of tourist destinations, including, for example, governance problems. It allows for networking and capacity to change the ways in which actions are carried out. The paper explores possible synergies between microfinance institutions (MFIs) and small and medium tourism businesses in an African rural community. First, we emphasise the obstacles to the formation of partnerships between MFIs and tourism businesses and we suggest ways to minimise them. Second, we describe how we facilitated networking between tourism actors and MFIs, which enabled the development of tourism products through new partnerships. As a result, four businesses are currently operating. From a research perspective, we point out the strengths and weaknesses of different types of associations and list the challenges. The results indicate that asymmetry of information and a lack of entrepreneurial spirit emerge as key concerns. The action research has promoted place and community based development. However, we underline that proper tourism development also requires the participation of stakeholders acting at different spatial scales.","[{'authorId': '2072511437', 'name': 'Serge Schmitz'}, {'authorId': '2082498142', 'name': 'Dieudonné Lekane Tsobgou'}]",13.0,,62.0,Developing Tourism Products and new Partnerships through Participative Action Research in Rural Cameroon,2016.0

c0dd4c59635057ea71ac3b16605cde650d4f86f3,"Craving is recognized as an important diagnosis criterion for substance use disorders (SUDs) and a predictive factor of relapse. Various methods to study craving exist; however, suppressing craving to successfully promote abstinence remains an unmet clinical need in SUDs. One reason is that social and environmental contexts recalling drug and alcohol consumption in the everyday life of patients suffering from SUDs often initiate craving and provoke relapse. Current behavioral therapies for SUDs use the cue-exposure approach to suppress salience of social and environmental contexts that may induce craving. They facilitate learning and cognitive reinforcement of new behavior and entrain craving suppression in the presence of cues related to drug and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, craving often overweighs behavioral training especially in real social and environmental contexts with peer pressure encouraging the use of substance, such as parties and bars. In this perspective, virtual reality (VR) is gaining interest in the development of cue-reactivity paradigms and practices new skills in treatment. VR enhances ecological validity of traditional craving-induction measurement. In this review, we discuss results from (1) studies using VR and alternative virtual agents in the induction of craving and (2) studies combining cue-exposure therapy with VR in the promotion of abstinence from drugs and alcohol use. They used virtual environments, displaying alcohol and drugs to SUD patients. Moreover, some environments included avatars. Hence, some studies have focused on the social interactions that are associated with drug-seeking behaviors and peer pressure. Findings indicate that VR can successfully increase craving. Studies combining cue–exposure therapy with virtual environment, however, reported mitigated success so far.","[{'authorId': '1403606465', 'name': 'Antoine Hone-Blanchet'}, {'authorId': '40507078', 'name': 'T.

c0f3b9f747c4ea17526f9cd51e32e7502bff5a02,"In this paper, we conduct a literature survey on various virtual reality (VR) treatments in psychiatry. We collected 36 studies that used VR to provide clinical trials or therapies for patients with psychiatric disorders. In order to gain a better understanding of the management of pain and stress, we first investigate VR applications for patients to alleviate pain and stress during immersive activities in a virtual environment. VR exposure therapies are particularly effective for anxiety, provoking realistic reactions to feared stimuli. On top of that, exposure therapies with simulated images are beneficial for patients with psychiatric disorders such as phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Moreover, VR environments have shown the possibility of changing depression, cognition, even social functions. We review empirical evidence from VR-based treatments on psychiatric illnesses such as dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), schizophrenia and autism. Through cognitive training and social skill training, rehabilitation through VR therapies helps patients to improve their quality of life. Recent advances in VR technology also demonstrate potential abilities to address cognitive and functional impairments in dementia. In terms of the different types of VR systems, we discuss the feasibility of the technology within different stages of dementia as well as the methodological limitations. Although there is room for improvement, its widespread adoption in psychiatry is yet to occur due to technical drawbacks such as motion sickness and dry eyes, as well as user issues such as preoccupation and addiction. However, it is worth mentioning that VR systems relatively easily deliver virtual environments with well-controlled sensory stimuli. In the future, VR systems may become an innovative clinical tool for patients with specific psychiatric symptoms.","[{'authorId': '2149271166', 'name': 'Mi Jin Park'}, {'authorId': '2155184481', 'name': 'Dong Jun Kim'}, {'authorId': '32610214', 'name': 'Unjoo Lee'}, {'authorId': '28940774', 'name': 'E.

The objective is to investigate, in an open study, the effectiveness of the combined use of computer generated environments involving driving games (game reality [GR]) and a virtual reality (VR) driving environment in exposure therapy for the treatment of driving phobia following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) program. Fourteen subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for Simple Phobia/Accident Phobia and were referred from the emergency department of a general hospital were exposed to a Virtual Driving Environment (Hanyang University Driving Phobia Environment) and computer driving games (London Racer/Midtown Madness/Rally Championship). Patients who experienced ""immersion"" (i.e., a sense of presence with heightened anxiety) in one of the driving simulations (defined as an increase in SUD ratings of 3 and/or an increase of heart rate > 15 BPM in a 1-h trial session of computer simulation driving) were exposed to a cognitive behavioral program of up to 12 1-h sessions involving graded driving simulation tasks with self-monitoring, physiological feedback, diaphragmatic breathing and cognitive reappraisal. Subjects were assessed at the beginning and end of therapy with measurements of: physiological responsivity (heart rate), subjective ratings of distress (SUD), rating scales for severity of fear of driving (FDI), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CAPS) and depression (HAM-D) and achievement of target behaviors. Of all patients 7/14 (50%) became immersed in the driving environments. This immersed group (n = 7) completed the exposure program. Pre- and post-treatment comparisons showed significant post treatment reductions on all measures SUDS (p = 0.008), FDI (p = 0.008), CAPS (p = 0.008), HR (p = 0.008), CAPS (p = 0.008), HAM-D (p = 0.031). Further analysis of the FDI showed significant reductions in all three subscales: travel distress (p = 0.008), travel avoidance (p = 0.008), and maladaptive driving strategies (p = 0.016). The findings of this study suggest that VR and GR may have a useful role in the treatment of driving phobia post-accident even when co-morbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression are present.","[{'authorId': '2210591854', 'name': 'David G.

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of pre-meal VGP and a glucose preload on subjective emotions, subjective appetite, and FI in boys with OW/OB. On 4 separate mornings, boys with OW/OB (n = 22; mean ± SD: age = 11.9 ± 1.6 years; body mass index percentile = 94.3 ± 3.9) participated in 4 test conditions. Two hours after a standardized breakfast, boys consumed equally sweetened preloads (250 mL) of sucralose (0 kcal) or glucose (200 kcal), with or without 30 min of subsequent VGP. Immediately after each test condition, FI was evaluated during an ad libitum pizza meal. Subjective appetite was measured at 0 (baseline), 15, and 30 min. Subjective emotions (aggression, anger, excitement, disappointment, happiness, upset, and frustration) were measured at 0 and 30 min. VGP did not affect FI, but the glucose preload decreased FI compared with the sucralose control (Δ = -103 ± 48 kcal, p < 0.01). However, cumulative FI (preload kcal + meal kcal) was 9% higher after the glucose preload (p < 0.01). Subjective appetite increased with time (p < 0.05) but was not influenced by preload or VGP. Frustration was the only subjective emotion that increased following VGP (p < 0.01).

Such procedures have sufficient temporal resolution to be used in the study of brief emotional experiences denoted by spontaneous facial expressions. In adults and infants, the experimental arousal of positive, approach-related emotions is associated with selective activation of the left frontal region, while arousal of negative, withdrawal-related emotions is associated with selective activation of the right frontal region. Individual differences in baseline measures of frontal asymmetry are associated with dispositional mood, affective reactivity, temperament, and immune function.

c30bd06bb90bbc3c552358ea7235267ecbf57dbb,"Research on predominantly male autistic samples has indicated that impairments in facial emotion recognition typically associated with autism spectrum conditions are instead due to co-occurring alexithymia. However, whether this could be demonstrated using more realistic facial emotion recognition stimuli and applied to autistic females was unclear. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed online self-report measures of autism spectrum condition severity and alexithymia, and afacial emotion recognition deficit that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition severity, were associated with less accurate facial emotion recognition. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy. However, alexithymia (and autism spectrum condition severity) was not associated with speed of emotion processing. The findings are primarily discussed with the theoretical view that perceiving and experiencing emotions share the same neural networks, thus being able to recognise one’s own emotions may facilitate the ability to recognise others’. This study is in line with previous similar research on autistic males and suggests impairments in facial emotion recognition in autistic females should be attributed to co-occurring alexithymia. Lay abstract Research with autistic males has indicated that difficulties in recognising facial expressions of emotion, commonly associated with autism spectrum conditions, may instead be due to co-occurring alexithymia (a condition involving lack of emotional awareness, difficulty describing feelings and difficulty distinguishing feelings from physical bodily sensations) and not to do with autism. We wanted to explore if this would be true for autistic females, as well as to use more realistic stimuli for emotional expression. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed self-report measures of autism spectrum condition traits and alexithymia and completed a visual test that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition features, were associated with less accuracy in identifying emotions. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy. However, alexithymia (and levels of autism spectrum condition traits) was not associated with speed of emotion processing. We discuss the findings in terms of possible underlying mechanisms and the implications for our understanding of emotion processing and recognition in autism.","[{'authorId': '1825973584', 'name': 'Louise Ola'}, {'authorId': '1404708665', 'name': 'F.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT®) is the most effective treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, but demand for DBT® far exceeds existing clinical resources. Most patients with BPD never receive DBT®. Incorporating computer technology into the DBT® could help increase dissemination. Immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers. This case study explored the feasibility/clinical potential of using immersive virtual reality technology to enhance DBT® mindfulness skills training of a 32 year old female diagnosed with BPD. Prior to using VR, the patient experienced difficulty practicing DBT® mindfulness due to her emotional reactivity, and difficulty concentrating. To help the patient focus her attention, and to facilitate DBT® mindfulness skills learning, the patient looked into virtual reality goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a 3D computer-generated river while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios. Urges to commit suicide, urges to self harm, urges to quit therapy, urges to use substances, and negative emotions were all reduced after each VR mindfulness session and VR mindfulness was well accepted/liked by the patient. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, results from this feasibility study were encouraging. Future controlled studies are needed to quantify whether VR-enhanced mindfulness training has long term benefits e.g., increasing patient acceptance and/or improving therapeutic outcome. Computerizing some of the DBT® skills treatment modules would reduce cost and increase dissemination.","[{'authorId': '1422265704', 'name': 'Maria V.

It is of particular relevance in the analysis of event-related brain oscillatory responses. This work is focused on the identification and quantification of relevant frequency patterns in motor imagery (MI) related EEGs utilized for brain-computer interface (BCI) purposes. The main objective of the paper is to perform comparative analysis of different approaches to spectral signal representation such as power spectral density (PSD) techniques, atomic decompositions, time-frequency (t-f) energy distributions, continuous and discrete wavelet approaches, from which band power features can be extracted and used in the framework of MI classification. The emphasis is on identifying discriminative properties of the feature sets representing EEG trials recorded during imagination of either left- or right-hand movement. Feature separability is quantified in the offline study using the classification accuracy (CA) rate obtained with linear and nonlinear classifiers. PSD approaches demonstrate the most consistent robustness and effectiveness in extracting the distinctive spectral patterns for accurately discriminating between left and right MI induced EEGs. This observation is based on an analysis of data recorded from eleven subjects over two sessions of BCI experiments. In addition, generalization capabilities of the classifiers reflected in their intersession performance are discussed in the paper.","[{'authorId': '37103065', 'name': 'P.

We investigated military occupational outcomes of diagnosed mental disorders in a cohort of 30,513 personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission. Methods: Cohort members were military personnel who deployed on the Afghanistan mission from 2001 to 2008. Mental disorder diagnoses and their attribution to the Afghanistan mission were ascertained via medical records in a stratified random sample (n = 2014). Career-limiting medical conditions (that is, condition-associated restrictions that reliably lead to medically related attrition) were determined using administrative data. Outcomes were assessed from first Afghanistan-related deployment return. Results: At 5 years of follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimated cumulative fraction with career-limiting medical conditions was 40.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.5 to 46.4) among individuals with Afghanistan service–related mental disorders (ARMD), 23.6% (CI 15.5 to 31.8) with other mental disorders, and 11.1% (CI 8.9 to 13.3) without mental disorders. The adjusted Cox regression hazard ratios for career-limiting medical condition risk were 4.89 (CI 3.85 to 6.23) among individuals with ARMD and 2.31 (CI 1.48 to 3.60) with other mental disorders, relative to those without mental disorders. Conclusions: Notwithstanding the Canadian military’s mental health system investments, mental disorders (particularly ARMD) still led to a high risk of adverse military occupational outcomes. Such investments have intrinsic value but may not translate into reduced medically related attrition without improvements in prevention and treatment effectiveness.","[{'authorId': '4579720', 'name': 'D.

The aim of this study is to classify seven emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, and stress) by machine learning algorithms using physiological signals. 12 college students participated in this experiment over 10 times. Total 70 emotional stimuli (10 emotional stimuli per each emotion) had been tested their suitability and effectiveness prior to experiment. Physiological signals, i.e. EDA, ECG, PPG, and SKT were acquired and were analyzed. Physiological signals were obtained prior to the presentation of emotional stimuli and while emotional stimuli were presented to participants. 28 features were extracted the acquired signals and analyzed for 30 seconds from the baseline and the emotional states. For emotion recognition, the data which is subtracted baseline values from the emotional state applied to 5 machine learning algorithm, i.e. FLD, CART, SOMs, Naive Bayes and SVM. The result showed that an accuracy of emotion classification by SVM was highest and lowest by FLD. This means that SVM is the best emotion recognition algorithm in this study. Our result can help emotion recognition studies lead to better chance to recognize not only basic emotion but also user’s various emotions, e.g., boredom, frustration, love, pain, etc., by using physiological signals. Also, it is able to be applied on many human-computer interaction devices for emotion detection.","[{'authorId': '144684736', 'name': 'E. Jang'}, {'authorId': '1696731', 'name': 'B.

Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","[{'authorId': '34680177', 'name': 'D. Colombo'}, {'authorId': '26364729', 'name': 'J.

c5b4b60614f25db1832943ef2c3a4cba1ee426d8,"Over 90% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) demonstrate atypical sensory behaviors. In fact, hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment is now included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. However, there are children with sensory processing differences who do not meet an ASD diagnosis but do show atypical sensory behaviors to the same or greater degree as ASD children. We previously demonstrated that children with Sensory Processing Disorders (SPD) have impaired white matter microstructure, and that this white matter microstructural pathology correlates with atypical sensory behavior. In this study, we use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tractography to evaluate the structural connectivity of specific white matter tracts in boys with ASD (n = 15) and boys with SPD (n = 16), relative to typically developing children (n = 23). We define white matter tracts using probabilistic streamline tractography and assess the strength of tract connectivity using mean fractional anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate decreased connectivity relative to controls in parieto-occipital tracts involved in sensory perception and multisensory integration. However, the ASD group alone shows impaired connectivity, relative to controls, in temporal tracts thought to subserve social-emotional processing. In addition to these group difference analyses, we take a dimensional approach to assessing the relationship between white matter connectivity and participant function. These correlational analyses reveal significant associations of white matter connectivity with auditory processing, working memory, social skills, and inattention across our three study groups. These findings help elucidate the roles of specific neural circuits in neurodevelopmental disorders, and begin to explore the dimensional relationship between critical cognitive functions and structural connectivity across affected and unaffected children.","[{'authorId': '5767793', 'name': 'Yishin Chang'}, {'authorId': '34629227', 'name': 'J.

However, due to the nested complex and non-linear structure of many machine learning models, this comes with the disadvantage of them acting as a black box, providing little or no information about the internal reasoning. This black box character hampers acceptance and application of non-linear methods in many application domains, where understanding individual model predictions and thus trust in the model’s decisions are critically important. In this thesis, we describe a novel method for explaining non-linear classifier decisions by decomposing the prediction function, called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). We apply our method to Neural Networks, kernelized Support Vector Machines (with non-linear kernels) and Bag of Words feature extraction pipelines and evaluate LRP theoretically, qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison to other recent methods for interpreting model predictions.

The assumptions underlying this structure ignore the reality that natural behavior is rarely discrete, brain activity follows multiple time courses that do not necessarily conform to the trial structure, and the natural environment has statistical structure and dynamics that exhibit long-range temporal correlation. Modern advances in statistical modeling and analysis offer tools that make it feasible for experiments to move beyond rigid independent and identically distributed trial structures. Here we review literature that serves as evidence for the feasibility and advantages of moving beyond trial-based paradigms to understand the neural basis of perception and cognition. Furthermore, we propose a synthesis of these efforts, integrating the characterization of natural stimulus properties with measurements of continuous neural activity and behavioral outputs within the framework of sensory-cognitive-motor loops. Such a framework provides a basis for the study of natural statistics, naturalistic tasks, and/or slow fluctuations in brain activity, which should provide starting points for important generalizations of analytical tools in neuroscience and subsequent progress in understanding the neural basis of perception and cognition.","[{'authorId': '1780005', 'name': 'A.

c6cf704df9f11d60faf3e563217de02c9440b77b,"Human beings are physically independent but are psychologically connected. We spend a lot of time dealing with others' intentions, experiences, and internal states. The term empathy describes these phenomena. Previous studies defined empathy as “the ability and tendency to share and understand others' internal state” (Zaki and Ochsner, 2012). Consistent with this definition, accumulated empirical evidence showed that empathy is a multifaceted construct composed of two components, including affective empathy and cognitive empathy (Hoffman, 1984; Decety and Jackson, 2004; Singer, 2006; Uddin et al., 2007; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009; Barrett et al., 2016). 
 
Recently, ever-growing studies have considered empathy under different viewpoints (e.g., developmental trajectories, naturalism, disordered population, and so on), and have summarized the independence and non-independence of affective empathy and cognitive empathy (Barrett et al., 2016). These studies provide significant contributions to the progress of empathy research. However, we are not yet to fully understand the neurocognitive mechanisms between the affective empathy and cognitive empathy. Three major limitations restrict our knowledge toward empathy. First, it is rare to characterize cognitive and affective empathy in terms of processing speed and involvement of consciousness. Second, previous research often studies cognitive and affective empathy separately. It is hard to identify and explain the interactive nature between these two components. Third, influential factors, including attention and prior knowledge, have not yet been considered in the framework of empathy, thus under-estimating their impacts on empathy processing. Attention and prior knowledge are closely linked with the two aforementioned limitations, specifically processing speed and consciousness involvement as well as the integration of affective empathy and cognitive empathy. Thus, these two factors are discussed in the present opinion. To address these limitations, the present opinion proposes a novel and general framework to summarize both behavioral and neural evidence in the literature. The proposed dual route model of empathy is mainly composed of an automatic, fast, and specific “lower route” with affective empathy as well as a complex, slow, and iterative “higher route” with cognitive empathy. This proposed empathy model aims to integrate these two routes and to include the influences of attention and prior knowledge. 
 
Previously, in the domain of emotion neuroscience, Joseph LeDuox, a pioneer to study emotions, proposed a framework with two parallel neural systems, namely a low road and a high road (LeDoux, 1998). Specifically, the low road, which is a fast, subcortical, short-latency pathway with minimal cortical involvement, directly conveys sensory information from the thalamus to the amygdala, allowing stimuli to be processed automatically without consciousness and awareness (Davis, 1992; LeDoux, 1995, 1997). These features of rapid and automatic processes construct the low road emotion processes. In contrast, the high road indicates the visual pathways from retina neuron to visual cortex, and then connects to inferior temporal lobe for processing higher level consciousness of emotion feeling, and finally directs to the amygdala (LeDoux, 1998). These features of slow processing and more involvement of consciousness establish the high road of emotion. 
 
The present opinion hypothesizes that empathy also has a similar dual route system, which includes an automatic, fast and lower-level route (i.e., lower route) and a complex, slow and higher-level route (i.e., higher route), inside our brain (Figure ​(Figure1).1). The rest of the paper is organized as a series of introductions for each component of empathy. Also, we consider these components in the proposed dual route model of empathy in order to obtain the whole picture of the empathy processing.

Emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals plays a vital role in the development of a brain–computer interface (BCI). Extracting the important information from raw EEG signals is difficult due to its nonstationary nature. Fixing a factual predefined basis function for efficient decomposition using a tunable $Q$ wavelet transform is an arduous task. In this article, an adaptive tunable $Q$ wavelet transform is proposed for the automatic selection of tuning parameters. Optimum tuning parameters are obtained using gray wolf optimization (GWO). Tuning parameters obtained by GWO are used to decompose the EEG signals into subbands (SBs). The set of time-domain features elicited from the SBs are used as an input to multiclass least-squares support vector machine. Classification accuracy of four basic emotions, namely, happy, fear, sad, and relax, is tested and compared with existing methods. An accuracy of 95.70% is achieved with a radial basis function kernel that is about 5% more than the existing methods using the same data set. This article proposes the development of a nonparameterized decomposition method for efficient decomposition of EEG signals. This method can be used with machine learning algorithms to take a step forward in the development of BCI systems.","[{'authorId': '36279503', 'name': 'S. K.

Therefore, they cannot integrate or systematize visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli. The multimodal integration model of the brain can provide a theoretical background from which one can approach multimodal stimulus integration. In this study, we suggest a virtual reality system for the multi-modal assessment of cognitive ability of schizophrenia patients. The virtual reality system can provide multimodal stimuli, such as visual and auditory stimuli, to the patient and can evaluate the patient's multimodal integration and working memory integration abilities by making the patient interpret and react to multimodal stimuli, which must be remembered for a given period of time. The clinical study showed that the virtual reality program developed is comparable to those of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), and it provides some information related to the schizophrenic patients' behavior in 3D virtual environment.","[{'authorId': '143720898', 'name': 'J.

The results show that while both VR and smartphone viewing conditions led to a significant positive effect on the self-reported emotions of the college students, only the smartphone viewing condition had a significant impact on the emotional well-being of the elderly participants. For college students, immersive VR had a stronger effect on inducing positive emotions than smartphone, but for elderly people, the smartphone viewing condition was more effective in improving emotional wellbeing than immersive VR. An analysis of the qualitative data from interviewing the elderly participants also revealed a divergence in the acceptance of VR technologies among elderly adults, and the sense of telepresence had both positive and negative effects on the elderly participants' emotions and experiences.","[{'authorId': '2155192818', 'name': 'Qian Liu'}, {'authorId': '2108126497', 'name': 'Y.

Although there is a great concern about the way a teacher manages students’ behaviour, there is very little relevant data concerning teacher-student conflict. The article aims at revealing the characteristics of conflict resolution between students and teachers from the students’ point of view. To investigate the process of conflict between a teacher and a student, a case study method was used. Respondents were asked to recall a conflict occurring between them and a teacher during the school years, describe how the incident was handled, and the consequences of it. The number of respondents constituted 30 students. Students and teachers actually engage in a range of behaviours. In accordance with the theoretical framework, the four behavioural categories were grouped. Students reported that during the teacher-students conflict a full palette of strategies (dominating, integrating, accommodating and avoiding strategies) was used. Findings revealed that forcing was expressed by arguments, involving a third party and aggression. Avoiding was expressed by crying, avoiding the contact. Accommodating was expressed by pretending and giving in. Apologising, making a compromise, compensation, talking about the problem were examples of an integrating strategy. The results indicated that participants reported 28 behavioural reactions to a classroom conflict. Among them, 12 were those of teacher engagement, and 16 of student engagement. In line with the conglomerated conflict behaviour framework, students reported that both conflict parties (students and teachers) in the case of active student position engaged in more than one type of behaviour in response to a single incident. Understanding students’ experience would allow teachers to better respond and manage students’ reactions, as well as help teachers prevent behaviours such as aggression and promote other behaviours such as motivation.","[{'authorId': '24062950', 'name': 'G.

c872e5c7cc8050d9be978681e6f1a021dab1902e,"Significance The human brain continuously and automatically processes information concerning its internal and external context. We demonstrate the elicitation and subsequent detection and decoding of such “automatic interpretations” by means of context-sensitive probes in an ongoing human–computer interaction. Through a sequence of such probe–interpretation cycles, the computer accumulates responses over time to model the operator’s cognition, even without that person being aware of it. This brings human cognition directly into the human–computer interaction loop, expanding traditional notions of “interaction.” The concept introduces neuroadaptive technology—technology which automatically adapts to an estimate of its operator’s mindset. This technology bears relevance to autoadaptive experimental designs, and opens up paradigm-shifting possibilities for human–machine systems in general. The effectiveness of today’s human–machine interaction is limited by a communication bottleneck as operators are required to translate high-level concepts into a machine-mandated sequence of instructions. In contrast, we demonstrate effective, goal-oriented control of a computer system without any form of explicit communication from the human operator. Instead, the system generated the necessary input itself, based on real-time analysis of brain activity. Specific brain responses were evoked by violating the operators’ expectations to varying degrees. The evoked brain activity demonstrated detectable differences reflecting congruency with or deviations from the operators’ expectations. Real-time analysis of this activity was used to build a user model of those expectations, thus representing the optimal (expected) state as perceived by the operator. Based on this model, which was continuously updated, the computer automatically adapted itself to the expectations of its operator. Further analyses showed this evoked activity to originate from the medial prefrontal cortex and to exhibit a linear correspondence to the degree of expectation violation. These findings extend our understanding of human predictive coding and provide evidence that the information used to generate the user model is task-specific and reflects goal congruency. This paper demonstrates a form of interaction without any explicit input by the operator, enabling computer systems to become neuroadaptive, that is, to automatically adapt to specific aspects of their operator’s mindset. Neuroadaptive technology significantly widens the communication bottleneck and has the potential to fundamentally change the way we interact with technology.","[{'authorId': '36476952', 'name': 'T.

This article examines 2 of the most fundamental properties of affective experience--valence and arousal--asking how they are related to each other on a moment to moment basis. Over the past century, 6 distinct types of relations have been suggested or implicitly presupposed in the literature. We critically review the available evidence for each proposal and argue that the evidence does not provide a conclusive answer. Next, we use statistical modeling to verify the different proposals in 8 data sets (with Ns ranging from 80 to 1,417) where participants reported their affective experiences in response to experimental stimuli in laboratory settings or as momentary or remembered in natural settings. We formulate 3 key conclusions about the relation between valence and arousal: (a) on average, there is a weak but consistent V-shaped relation of arousal as a function of valence, but (b) there is large variation at the individual level, so that (c) valence and arousal can in principle show a variety of relations depending on person or circumstances. This casts doubt on the existence of a static, lawful relation between valence and arousal. The meaningfulness of the observed individual differences is supported by their personality and cultural correlates. The malleability and individual differences found in the structure of affect must be taken into account when studying affect and its role in other psychological phenomena.","[{'authorId': '48586713', 'name': 'Peter Kuppens'}, {'authorId': '2109141', 'name': 'F.

In particular visuo-affective mappings, which are regarded as the foundation for the subjective, emotional elements of empathy, come into play especially during social interactions, when we transform visual information about someone else’s emotional state into similar emotional dispositions of our own. Understanding these processes may provide basic preconditions for game character identification and empathy in three main cases discussed in this paper: (1) when the game character is controlled from a first-person perspective; (2) when the character is controlled from a third-person perspective; and (3) when the character is seen from a thirdperson perspective but not controlled by the player. Given that human cognition springs from neural processes ultimately subserving bioregulation, self-preservation, navigation in a subjective space, and social relationships, we argue that acknowledging this legacy - and perhaps even regarding it as a path through design space - can contribute to effective human-computer interface design.","[{'authorId': '47822217', 'name': 'I.

c9695ec28353e4907387f48dc0d944dbb4edae85,"OBJECTIVE
Prolonged exposure (PE) is an evidence-based psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but there is limited research with active-duty military populations. Virtual reality exposure (VRE) has shown promise but randomized trials are needed to evaluate efficacy relative to existing standards of care. This study evaluated the efficacy of VRE and PE for active duty soldiers with PTSD from deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.


METHOD
Active-duty soldiers (N = 162) were randomized to 10-sessions of PE, VRE, or a minimal attention waitlist (WL). Blinded assessors evaluated symptoms at baseline, halfway through treatment, at posttreatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).


RESULTS
Intent-to-treat analyses found that both PE and VRE resulted in significant reductions in PTSD symptoms relative to those in the WL. The majority of patients demonstrated reliable change in PTSD symptoms. There was no difference between PE and VRE regarding treatment drop out before completing 10 sessions (44 and 41% for VRE and PE, respectively). Contrary to hypotheses, analyses at posttreatment did not show that VRE was superior to PE. Post hoc analyses found that PE resulted in significantly greater symptom reductions than VRE at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Both treatments significantly reduced self-reported stigma.


CONCLUSIONS
PE is an efficacious treatment for active-duty Army soldiers with PTSD from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. Results extend previous evidence supporting the efficacy of PE to active-duty military personnel and raise important questions for future research on VRE.

Specifically, the main purpose of this study is to trace the interaction between metacognition, sympathetic-parasympathetic nervous system and the basic stress-related hormones/neurotransmitters.  To achieve this aim, the research seeks to address the following questions: Can metacognition regulate the stress-related hormones and the sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity? How can it contribute to the regulation of uncontrollable stress? What is the role of executive functions? Can metacognition stop the cells and neurons from degeneration and the brain from shrinking?  The evidence support the hypothesis that there is a deep relationship between metacognition, stress-related hormones and autonomic nervous system. Therefore, the above finding paves the way for the design of new stress management strategies, which could implemented in family, in school and in workplace. Uncontrollable stress constitutes the “health epidemic” of our century. Mental and mood disorders, premature ageing, cognitive impairments, learning disabilities are some of the stress-related threats. There is an urgent need to focus on resilience in order to cope with stress and to stay in balance.","[{'authorId': '1724307', 'name': 'A.

People consistently associate higher-pitched sounds with sweet/sour foods, while lower-pitched sounds tend to be associated with bitter foods. The human voice is key in broadcast advertising, and the role of voice in communication generally is partly characterized by acoustic parameters of pitch. However, it remains unknown whether voice pitch and taste interactively influence consumer behavior. Since consumers prefer congruent sensory information, it is plausible that voice pitch and taste interactively influence consumers' responses to advertising stimuli. Based on the cross-modal correspondence phenomenon, this study aimed to elucidate the role played by voice pitch-taste correspondences in advertising effectiveness. Participants listened to voiceover advertisements (at a higher or lower pitch than the original narrator's voice) for three food products with distinct tastes (sweet, sour, and bitter) and rated their buying intention (an indicator of advertising effectiveness). The results show that the participants were likely to exhibit greater buying intention toward both sweet and sour food when they listened to higher-pitched (vs lower-pitched) voiceover advertisements. The influence of a higher pitch on sweet and sour food preferences was observed in only two of the three studies: studies 1 and 2 for sour food, and studies 2 and 3 for sweet food. These findings emphasize the role that voice pitch-taste correspondence plays in preference formation, and advance the applicability of cross-modal correspondences to business.","[{'authorId': '28988855', 'name': 'Kosuke Motoki'}, {'authorId': '150323860', 'name': 'Toshiki Saito'}, {'authorId': '2389302', 'name': 'R.

Traditional measures of executive function are often based on hypothetical constructs that may have little relevance to real-world behaviours. In fact, some traditional tests utilised today were not originally developed for clinical use. Recently, researchers have been arguing for a new generation of “function-led” neuropsychological assessments that are developed from directly observable everyday behaviours. Although virtual environments (VEs) have been presented as potential aides in enhancing ecological validity, many were modelled on construct-driven approaches found in traditional assessments. In the current paper, we review construct-driven and function-led VE-based neuropsychological assessments of executive functions. Overall, function-led VEs best represent the sorts of tasks needed for enhanced ecological validity and prediction of real-world functioning.","[{'authorId': '145842705', 'name': 'T.

However, in real life humans often face more complex multisensory social situations, involving more than one person. Here we ask if the audiovisual facilitation in emotion recognition previously found in simpler social situations extends to more complex and ecological situations. Stimuli consisting of the biological motion and voice of two interacting agents were used in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with visual, auditory, auditory filtered/noisy, and audiovisual congruent and incongruent clips. We asked participants to judge whether the two agents were interacting happily or angrily. In Experiment 2, another group of participants repeated the same task, as in Experiment 1, while trying to ignore either the visual or the auditory information. The findings from both experiments indicate that when the reliability of the auditory cue was decreased participants weighted more the visual cue in their emotional judgments. This in turn translated in increased emotion recognition accuracy for the multisensory condition. Our findings thus point to a common mechanism of multisensory integration of emotional signals irrespective of social stimulus complexity.","[{'authorId': '2945938', 'name': 'L.

cbdc20d8b86fb3a240133886bfbc7494e2a73657,"Background Military members are at elevated risk of operational stress injuries, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moral injury. Although psychotherapy can reduce symptoms, some military members may experience treatment-resistant PTSD. Multimodular motion-assisted memory desensitization and reconsolidation (3MDR) has been introduced as a virtual reality (VR) intervention for military members with PTSD related to military service. The 3MDR intervention incorporates exposure therapy, psychotherapy, eye movement desensitization and reconsolidation, VR, supportive counselling, and treadmill walking. Objective The objective of this study is to investigate whether 3MDR reduces PTSD symptoms among military members with combat-related treatment-resistant PTSD (TR-PTSD); examine the technology acceptance and usability of the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation ENvironment (CAREN) and 3MDR interventions by Canadian Armed Forces service members (CAF-SMs), veterans, 3MDR clinicians, and operators; and evaluate the impact on clinicians and operators of delivering 3MDR. Methods This is a mixed-methods waitlist controlled crossover design randomized controlled trial. Participants include both CAF-SMs and veterans (N=40) aged 18-60 years with combat-related TR-PTSD (unsuccessful experience of at least 2 evidence-based trauma treatments). Participants will also include clinicians and operators (N=12) who have been trained in 3MDR and subsequently utilized this intervention with patients. CAF-SMs and veterans will receive 6 weekly 90-minute 3MDR sessions. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention. Quantitative data collection will include multiomic biomarkers (ie, blood and salivary proteomic and genomic profiles of neuroendocrine, immune-inflammatory mediators, and microRNA), eye tracking, electroencephalography, and physiological data. Data from outcome measures will capture self-reported symptoms of PTSD, moral injury, resilience, and technology acceptance and usability. Qualitative data will be collected from audiovisual recordings of 3MDR sessions and semistructured interviews. Data analysis will include univariate and multivariate approaches, and thematic analysis of treatment sessions and interviews. Machine learning analysis will be included to develop models for the prediction of diagnosis, symptom severity, and treatment outcomes. Results This study commenced in April 2019 and is planned to conclude in April 2021. Study results will guide the further evolution and utilization of 3MDR for military members with TR-PTSD and will have utility in treating other trauma-affected populations. Conclusions The goal of this study is to utilize qualitative and quantitative primary and secondary outcomes to provide evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of 3MDR for treating CAF-SMs and veterans with combat-related TR-PTSD. The results will inform a full-scale clinical trial and stimulate development and adaptation of the protocol to mobile VR apps in supervised clinical settings. This study will add to knowledge of the clinical effectiveness of 3MDR, and provide the first comprehensive analysis of biomarkers, technology acceptance and usability, moral injury, resilience, and the experience of clinicians and operators delivering 3MDR.

Frequency and duration of peer interaction behaviours were coded. In terms of duration, multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) indicated that participants with ASD spent more time engaged in solitary behaviours, less time engaged in co-operative interaction with peers, and more time engaging in reactive aggression towards peers than either comparison group. In terms of frequency, similar patterns emerged, but additionally participants with ASD engaged in fewer instances of rough/vigorous play, and were subject to more instances of social initiation and instrumental verbal aggression by peers than either comparison group.

cc0fa810fe8d737a78f390bf466bed0715e68f8b,"In vivo body exposure therapy is considered an effective and suitable intervention to help patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) reduce their body image disturbances (BIDs). However, these interventions have notable limitations and cannot effectively reproduce certain fears usually found in AN, such as the fear of gaining weight (FGW). The latest developments in virtual reality (VR) technology and embodiment-based procedures could overcome these limitations and allow AN patients to confront their FGW and BIDs. This study aimed to provide further evidence of the efficacy of an enhanced (by means of embodiment) VR-based body exposure therapy for the treatment of AN. Thirty-five AN patients (16 in the experimental group, 19 in the control group) participated in the study. FGW, BIDs, and other body-related and ED measures were assessed before and after the intervention and three months later. The experimental group received treatment as usual (TAU) and five additional sessions of VR-based body exposure therapy, while the control group received only TAU. After the intervention, ED symptoms were clearly reduced in both groups, with most of the changes being more noticeable in the experimental group. Specifically, after the intervention and at follow-up, significant group differences were found in the FGW and BIDs, with the experimental group showing significantly lower values than the control group. The current study provides new insights and encouraging findings in the field of exposure-based therapies in AN. VR technology might improve research and clinical practice in AN by providing new tools to help patients confront their core fears (i.e., food- or weight-related cues) and improve their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to their body image.","[{'authorId': '1422557810', 'name': 'B.

Although there have been frequent reports of a possible link between the observer’s sense of presence and the experience of bodily discomfort in VR, the amount of literature that discusses the nature of the relationship is limited. Recent research has underlined the possibility that these variables have shared causes, and that both factors may be manipulated with a single approach. This review paper summarizes the concepts of presence and cybersickness and highlights the strengths and gaps in our understanding about their relationship. We review studies that have measured the association between presence and cybersickness, and conclude that the balance of evidence favors a negative relationship between the two factors which is driven principally by sensory integration processes. We also discuss how system immersiveness might play a role in modulating both presence and cybersickness. However, we identify a serious absence of high-powered studies that aim to reveal the nature of this relationship. Based on this evidence we propose recommendations for future studies investigating presence, cybersickness, and other related factors.","[{'authorId': '4966898', 'name': 'Séamas Weech'}, {'authorId': '47752013', 'name': 'Sophie Kenny'}, {'authorId': '1387458734', 'name': 'M.

The disorder generally starts in adolescence, but often goes unnoticed and is severely underdiagnosed. Left untreated, BDD typically persists and causes marked functional impairment in multiple domains. This clinical review considers recent advances in the epidemiology and classification of BDD, including its reclassification in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders under the new ‘Obsessive–Compulsive and Related Disorders’ chapter. Key issues in assessment are outlined including the use of validated screening instruments to minimise misdiagnosis and the importance of risk assessment in this population given the high rates of suicidality and inappropriate use of cosmetic treatments. In addition, current knowledge regarding the causes and mechanisms underlying BDD are summarised. The recommended treatments for BDD are outlined, namely cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Both CBT and pharmacotherapy have been shown to be efficacious treatments for BDD in adult populations, and evidence is emerging to support their use in young people. Although the majority of patients improve with existing evidence-based treatment, a large proportion are left with clinically significant residual symptoms. Priorities for future research are therefore discussed including the need to further refine and evaluate existing interventions with the goal of improving treatment outcomes and to increase their availability.","[{'authorId': '39296957', 'name': 'G.

cd80b9ed23bd9dd0aec5f6a66e819f5f7067322b,"Background Combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be a difficult condition to treat and has been associated with serious medical and economic issues among U.S. military veterans. Distinguishing between treatment responders vs. non-responders in this population has become an important public health priority. This study was conducted to identify pre-treatment characteristics of U.S. veterans with combat-related PTSD that might contribute to favorable and unfavorable responses to high value treatments for this condition. Method This study focused on 805 patients who completed a VHA PTSD residential program between 2000 and 2007. These patients completed the PTSD Clinical Checklist at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a four-month follow-up assessment. Latent growth curve analysis (LCGA) was incorporated to determine trajectories of changes in PTSD across these assessments and whether several key clinical concerns for this population were associated with their treatment responses. Study Findings LCGA indicated three distinct trajectories in PTSD outcomes and identified several clinical factors that were prospectively linked with changes in veterans' posttraumatic symptomatology. When compared to a group with high PTSD symptom severity that decreased over the program but relapsed at follow-up (41%), the near half (48.8%) of the sample with an improving trajectory had less combat exposure and superior physical/mental health. However, when compared to a minority (10.2%) with relatively low symptomatology that also remained somewhat stable, patients in the improving group were younger and also reported greater combat exposure, poorer physical/mental health status, and more problems with substance abuse before the start of treatment. Conclusions Findings suggest that veterans are most likely to benefit from residential treatment in an intermediate range of symptoms and risk factors, including PTSD symptom severity, history of combat exposure, and comorbid issues with physical/mental health. Addressing these factors in an integrative manner could help to optimize the effectiveness of treatments of combat-related PTSD in many cases.","[{'authorId': '3696297', 'name': 'J.

cd8ec8c932d56316eae36c7c22badc5acda3f1b5,"In the last decade, virtual reality (VR) training has been used extensively in video games and military training to provide a sense of realism and environmental interaction to its users. More recently, VR training has been explored as a possible adjunct therapy for people with motor and mental health dysfunctions. The concept underlying VR therapy as a treatment for motor and cognitive dysfunction is to improve neuroplasticity of the brain by engaging users in multisensory training. In this review, we discuss the theoretical framework underlying the use of VR as a therapeutic intervention for neurorehabilitation and provide evidence for its use in treating motor and mental disorders such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and other related clinical areas. While this review provides some insights into the efficacy of VR in clinical rehabilitation and its complimentary use with neuroimaging (e.g., fNIRS and EEG) and neuromodulation (e.g., tDCS and rTMS), more research is needed to understand how different clinical conditions are affected by VR therapies (e.g., stimulus presentation, interactivity, control and types of VR). Future studies should consider large, longitudinal randomized controlled trials to determine the true potential of VR therapies in various clinical populations.","[{'authorId': '143681430', 'name': 'W.

cd99417dfd77e5bf164586d93c6de4baa2481cd2,"Electrophysiological signals across species and recording scales exhibit both periodic and aperiodic features. Periodic oscillations have been widely studied and linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and disease states, while the aperiodic “background” 1/f component of neural power spectra has received far less attention. Most analyses of oscillations are conducted on a priori, canonically-defined frequency bands without consideration of the underlying aperiodic structure, or verification that a periodic signal even exists in addition to the aperiodic signal. This is problematic, as recent evidence shows that the aperiodic signal is dynamic, changing with age, task demands, and cognitive state. It has also been linked to the relative excitation/inhibition of the underlying neuronal population. This means that standard analytic approaches easily conflate changes in the periodic and aperiodic signals with one another because the aperiodic parameters—along with oscillation center frequency, power, and bandwidth—are all dynamic in physiologically meaningful, but likely different, ways. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional narrowband analyses and to reduce the potentially deleterious effects of conflating these features, we introduce a novel algorithm for automatic parameterization of neural power spectral densities (PSDs) as a combination of the aperiodic signal and putative periodic oscillations. Notably, this algorithm requires no a priori specification of band limits and accounts for potentially-overlapping oscillations while minimizing the degree to which they are confounded with one another. This algorithm is amenable to large-scale data exploration and analysis, providing researchers with a tool to quickly and accurately parameterize neural power spectra.","[{'authorId': '35489433', 'name': 'Matar Haller'}, {'authorId': '145106564', 'name': 'Thomas Donoghue'}, {'authorId': '145199446', 'name': 'E.

Such methods have been used to induce ownership over a manikin and a virtual body that substitute the real body, as seen from first-person perspective, through a head-mounted display. However, the perceptual and behavioral consequences of such transformed body ownership have hardly been explored. In Exp. 1, immersive virtual reality was used to embody 30 adults as a 4-y-old child (condition C), and as an adult body scaled to the same height as the child (condition A), experienced from the first-person perspective, and with virtual and real body movements synchronized. The result was a strong body-ownership illusion equally for C and A. Moreover there was an overestimation of the sizes of objects compared with a nonembodied baseline, which was significantly greater for C compared with A. An implicit association test showed that C resulted in significantly faster reaction times for the classification of self with child-like compared with adult-like attributes. Exp. 2 with an additional 16 participants extinguished the ownership illusion by using visuomotor asynchrony, with all else equal. The size-estimation and implicit association test differences between C and A were also extinguished. We conclude that there are perceptual and probably behavioral correlates of body-ownership illusions that occur as a function of the type of body in which embodiment occurs.","[{'authorId': '2037273', 'name': 'Domna Banakou'}, {'authorId': '2913730', 'name': 'R.

Specifically, emotional states are modeled as a combination of arousal and valence dimensions according to the well-known circumplex model of affect, whereas the ANS dynamics is estimated through standard and nonlinear analysis of Heart rate variability (HRV) exclusively, which is derived from the electrocardiogram (ECG). In addition, Lagged Poincaré Plots of the HRV series were also taken into account. The affective sounds were gathered from the International Affective Digitized Sound System and grouped into four different levels of arousal (intensity) and two levels of valence (unpleasant and pleasant). A group of 27 healthy volunteers were administered with these standardized stimuli while ECG signals were continuously recorded. Then, those HRV features showing significant changes (p $<;$ 0.05 from statistical tests) between the arousal and valence dimensions were used as input of an automatic classification system for the recognition of the four classes of arousal and two classes of valence. Experimental results demonstrated that a quadratic discriminant classifier, tested through Leave-One-Subject-Out procedure, was able to achieve a recognition accuracy of 84.72 percent on the valence dimension, and 84.26 percent on the arousal dimension.","[{'authorId': '1724164', 'name': 'M.

Several studies demonstrate that the use of new and combined media enhances how culture is experienced. The benefit is in terms of both number of people who can have access to knowledge and the quality of the diffusion of the knowledge itself. In this regard, CH uses augmented-, virtual-, and mixed-reality technologies for different purposes, including education, exhibition enhancement, exploration, reconstruction, and virtual museums. These technologies enable user-centred presentation and make cultural heritage digitally accessible, especially when physical access is constrained. A number of surveys of these emerging technologies have been conducted; however, they are either not domain specific or lack a holistic perspective in that they do not cover all the aspects of the technology. A review of these technologies from a cultural heritage perspective is therefore warranted. Accordingly, our article surveys the state-of-the-art in augmented-, virtual-, and mixed-reality systems as a whole and from a cultural heritage perspective.

Among the important findings is that teachers practice emotion regulation because they believe it makes them more effective in management, discipline, and their relationships with students. Further, teachers are much more confident that they can communicate their positive emotions than reduce their negative emotions, and they use a variety of emotion regulation strategies, including preventive and reactive methods. These results stand in contrast to the fact that most pre-service programs give little emphasis to relationships among teachers' emotions, classroom management, and teaching practice.","[{'authorId': '47549535', 'name': 'Rosemary E.

ce5db2334d517626e686ee6a6ea17b04e8be54d0,"Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM‐III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM‐5 and ICD‐11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up‐to‐date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence‐supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma‐focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best‐validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two‐thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence‐based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.","[{'authorId': '2508133', 'name': 'R.

cef5157ed4d09d36fe35b63a75f8668976b7cbc3,"Background With the global trend of urbanization, there are increasing reports of a possible association between decreased exposure to nature and increased occurrence of mental disorders. New 360° virtual reality (VR) technology using smartphones and portable VR glasses can overcome spatial and temporal limitations to help people deal with mental fatigue in everyday life. Objective On the basis of attention restoration theory (ART), this study aimed to investigate whether the amplitude of the mismatch negativity (MMN)/P3a complex could act as an event-related potential (ERP) biomarker of involuntary attention restoration during exposure to 360° virtual nature in healthy young adults with different levels of restorative VR experience. Methods A total of 40 healthy adults completed prequestionnaires on demographics and simulator sickness and postquestionnaires on simulator sickness and perceived restorativeness before and after exposure to virtual nature, respectively. During the VR exposure, brain activity was measured by electroencephalography as participants were asked to conduct a 2-tone passive auditory oddball task. Results The amplitude and latency of the MMN/P3a complex were compared between individuals reporting a highly restorative experience and those reporting a less restorative experience. Although viewing a virtual nature environment, the high restorative group (N=19) exhibited significantly reduced P3a amplitudes compared with the low restorative group (N=20; t38=2.57; P=.02; d=0.59). Particularly, a moderate but significant negative correlation was found between the self-reported restorativeness scores and the P3a amplitudes at the fronto-central region (r=−.38; P=.02). However, the latency of the MMN/P3a complex did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (auditory mismatch negativity: t38=−1.47; P=.15 and P3a: t38=−0.31; P=.76). Conclusions Considering individuals’ restorative experience, the amplitude of the fronto-central MMN/P3a complex can potentially be employed as a distinct ERP component of interest in involuntary attention restoration during virtual nature experience in healthy young adults. The findings for the 360° virtual nature experience seem to be consistent with those of previous ERP studies on the effects of meditation practice. This study extends the findings of previous ART and ERP studies of real-world meditation, restoration, and mental fatigue management into the virtual world created by mobile phone–based VR glasses and 360° video content.","[{'authorId': '48028822', 'name': 'K.

cf37b2f20439b3dc129f272a5625134cfbff9c53,"Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence. There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one’s ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 “shelter-in-place” and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. Objective The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. Methods The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. Results The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant’s depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression). Conclusions The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

cf7336556ea94d8b828b32cb0fc6e0a9e04ff792,"Feeling touch on a body part is paradigmatically considered to require stimulation of tactile afferents from the body part in question, at least in healthy non-synaesthetic individuals. In contrast to this view, we report a perceptual illusion where people experience “phantom touches” on a right rubber hand when they see it brushed simultaneously with brushes applied to their left hand. Such illusory duplication and transfer of touch from the left to the right hand was only elicited when a homologous (i.e., left and right) pair of hands was brushed in synchrony for an extended period of time. This stimulation caused the majority of our participants to perceive the right rubber hand as their own and to sense two distinct touches – one located on the right rubber hand and the other on their left (stimulated) hand. This effect was supported by quantitative subjective reports in the form of questionnaires, behavioral data from a task in which participants pointed to the felt location of their right hand, and physiological evidence obtained by skin conductance responses when threatening the model hand. Our findings suggest that visual information augments subthreshold somatosensory responses in the ipsilateral hemisphere, thus producing a tactile experience from the non-stimulated body part. This finding is important because it reveals a new bilateral multisensory mechanism for tactile perception and limb ownership.","[{'authorId': '2085722', 'name': 'Valeria I.

A cross-cultural comparison of the display of anger and happiness in masks used in ritual social functions revealed that a set of geometric patterns, rather than actual facial features, conveyed these different emotional meanings. The power of nonrepresentational visual patterns to produce meaning was examined in a series of studies using materials that presented geometric shapes in a variety of line drawings, large-scale physical movement in classical ballet, and configurations among individuals in 17th-century Dutch art.

A mixed-methods study was conducted with 13 residents of varying cognitive capacity in a residential aged care facility (RACF) operated by a not-for-profit organization in Brisbane, Australia. Residents participated in one facilitated VR session, either as a group or individual session. Residents' mood and apathy were measured by the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) and the Person-Environment Apathy Rating Scale. Residents also completed a structured interview to provide their feedback after the VR session. In addition, four RACF staff members were interviewed about their experience of using the VR in residents and the ongoing feasibility. The experience of VR administered by a researcher and leisure and lifestyle coordinator as a leisure activity, significantly reduced apathy in residents (Z = -2.818, p = 0.005) through observations of increased facial expression, eye contact, physical engagement, verbal tone, and expression. The study did not find a VR impact on the OERS measures; no significant increase in fear/anxiety was observed. Reminiscence was clearly observed in six of the nine residents with the ability to verbally communicate. VR was found not to be helpful in residents during episodes of acute neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. This study suggested feasibility of using fully immersive VR delivered by mobile phone technologies. It provides preliminary data for a controlled trial presently underway examining the effectiveness of VR as a group activity in RAC to improve mood states, behavioral symptoms, and pro re nata psychotropic medication use. Residents indicated that VR was enjoyable with low levels of physical and emotional discomfort reported or observed.","[{'authorId': '13657136', 'name': 'R.

Participants used more negative emotion, cause, sensory, and first person singular words when describing the breakup in comparison to describing the period when they were still dating. In addition, greater avoidance of the breakup predicted greater use of negative emotion, first person singular and third-person pronouns, and less use of cognitive words. Conversely, levels of grief predicted less use of causal words and greater use of first person singular pronouns.

Even “micro-doses” of natural scenery can provide beneficial effects in situations where more extensive interactions with nature are not feasible. In the current study, we evaluated the use of virtual reality (VR) for delivering interactive nature-based content with the goal of prompting active engagement and improving mood states in older adults. Research Design and Methods The researchers developed a novel VR environment that combined 360-degree videos of natural areas and botanical gardens with interactive digital features that allowed users to engage with aspects of the environment. We recruited 50 older adults to try out this VR environment and measured changes in mood states and attitudes toward VR from before versus after the sessions. We controlled for variables such as age, education level, and exposure to nature in everyday life, and we looked for differences in responses to the VR among participants with cognitive impairments (CIs) versus without, and participants with physical disabilities versus without. Results The findings indicated significant improvements in “good” mood and “calm” mood dimensions after exposure to the VR, as well as improvements in attitudes toward the technology. These positive outcomes were significantly greater for participants with physical disabilities compared to those without disabilities. No differences were found in the responses of participants with CIs versus those without. Exit interviews provided a variety of helpful suggestions about ways to improve the VR equipment design and content to meet the needs of an older adult population. Discussion and Implications The study demonstrates that VR can provide a cost-effective, noninvasive, and nonpharmaceutical approach for improving the lives of older adults in both clinical and recreational settings, particularly when real-world access to nature is limited.","[{'authorId': '16086940', 'name': 'S.

d0e03ee23a42d64bb0b18d2e11bc528d2c35fa9a,"Static pictures of emotional facial expressions have been found to activate brain structures involved in the processing of emotional stimuli. However, in everyday live, emotional expressions are changing rapidly, and the processing of the onset vs the offset of the very same emotional expression might rely on different brain networks, presumably leading to different behavioral and physiological reactions (e.g. approach or avoidance). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, this was examined by presenting video clips depicting onsets and offsets of happy and angry facial expressions. Subjective valence and threat ratings clearly depended on the direction of change. Blood oxygen level dependent responses indicate both reward- and threat-related activations for the offset of angry expressions. Comparing onsets and offsets, angry offsets were associated with stronger ventral striatum activation than angry onsets. Additionally, the offset of happy and the onset of angry expressions showed strong common activity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally, the left amygdala and the left insula, whereas the onset of happy and the offset of angry expressions induced significant activation in the left dorsal striatum. In sum, the results confirm different activity in motivation-related brain areas in response to the onset and offset of the same emotional expression and highlight the importance of temporal characteristics of facial expressions for social communication.","[{'authorId': '1684604', 'name': 'A.

However, despite encouraging outcomes from early stage research, a consensus for the best way to develop and evaluate VR treatments within a scientific framework is needed. Objective We aimed to develop a methodological framework with input from an international working group in order to guide the design, implementation, analysis, interpretation, and communication of trials that develop and test VR treatments. Methods A group of 21 international experts was recruited based on their contributions to the VR literature. The resulting Virtual Reality Clinical Outcomes Research Experts held iterative meetings to seek consensus on best practices for the development and testing of VR treatments. Results The interactions were transcribed, and key themes were identified to develop a scientific framework in order to support best practices in methodology of clinical VR trials. Using the Food and Drug Administration Phase I-III pharmacotherapy model as guidance, a framework emerged to support three phases of VR clinical study designs—VR1, VR2, and VR3. VR1 studies focus on content development by working with patients and providers through the principles of human-centered design. VR2 trials conduct early testing with a focus on feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, and initial clinical efficacy.

We found a scarcity of literature providing evidence on how virtual reality (VR) therapy affects the intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and stress levels in COPD patients undergoing in-hospital pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). This study enrolled 50 COPD patients with symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety, randomly assigned to one of two groups. The two groups participated in the traditional PR programme additionally: the VR-group performed 10 sessions of immersive VR-therapy and the control group performed 10 sessions of Schultz autogenic training. Comparison of the changes in stress levels and depressive and anxiety symptoms was the primary outcome. Analysis of the results showed a reduction in stress levels only in the VR-group (p < 0.0069), with a medium effect size (d = 0.353). The symptoms of depression (p < 0.001, d = 0.836) and anxiety (p < 0.0009, d = 0.631) were statistically significantly reduced only in the VR-group, with a strong effect size. The enrichment of pulmonary rehabilitation with immersive VR therapy brings benefits in terms of mood improvement and reduction in anxiety and stress in patients with COPD.","[{'authorId': '66911104', 'name': 'Sebastian Rutkowski'}, {'authorId': '2887591', 'name': 'J.

This method can overcome the difficulty of controlling the variation of luminous conditions, one of the main challenges in experimental studies using daylight, and its novelty lies in the implementation of physically based renderings into an immersive virtual environment. The present work investigates the adequacy of the proposed method to evaluate five aspects of subjective perception of daylit spaces: the perceived pleasantness, interest, excitement, complexity, and satisfaction with the amount of view in the space. To this end, experiments with 29 participants were conducted to compare users’ perceptions of a real daylit environment and its equivalent representation in VR and test the effect of the display method on the participants’ perceptual evaluations, reported physical symptoms, and perceived presence in the virtual space. The results indicate a high level of perceptual accuracy, showing no significant differences between the real and virtual environments on the studied evaluations. In addition, there was a high level of perceived presence in the virtual environment and no significant effects on the participants’ physical symptoms after the use of the VR headset. Following these findings, the presented experimental method in VR seems very promising for use as a surrogate to real environments in investigating the aforementioned five dimensions of perception in daylit spaces.","[{'authorId': '72669828', 'name': 'K.

They all used hypnosis to explore and expand the boundaries of their intelligence. The aim of the current review is to investigate the impact of clinical hypnosis on Metacognition, Consciousness and Intelligence based on the counterpart model. Furthermore, we examine the role of virtual reality hypnosis in service of metacognition. The results showed that clinical hypnosis -with the power of attention and imagery- can effectively and rapidly reformat cognitive and metacognitive skills, upgrade intelligence and raise conscious experience into the higher energy levels. Hypnosis improves metacognition by re-organizing the survival-emotional-reward centers, smoothing the non-verbal pathways for effortless self-regulation. We concluded that the clinical hypnosis guarantees peak performance, innovation, success, and happiness in all areas of life. It can also play a significant role in education as a tool for dealing with the well-established learned weaknesses, for mental/emotional training and brain rewiring, facilitating learning, unlearning and relearning.

Method: A total of 68 adolescents with ADHD and associated psychiatric comorbidities completed a manualized CBT treatment protocol. The intervention used in the study was a downward extension of the Safren et al. program for adults with ADHD who have symptoms unresolved by medication. Outcome variables consisted of narrow band (ADHD) and broadband (e.g., mood, anxiety, conduct) symptom measures (Behavior Assessment System for Children–2nd edition and ADHD–Rating Scales) as well as functioning measures (parent/teacher ratings and several ecologically real-world measures). Results: Treatment effects emerged on the medication dosage, parent rating of pharmacotherapy adherence, adolescent self-report of personal adjustment (e.g., self-esteem), parent and teacher ratings of inattentive symptoms, school attendance, school tardiness, parent report of peer, family and academic functioning and teacher report of adolescent relationship with teacher, academic progress, and adolescent self-esteem. Adolescents with ADHD with oppositional defiant disorder were rated by parents and teachers as benefiting less from the CBT intervention. Adolescents with ADHD and comorbid anxiety/depression were rated by parents and teachers as benefiting more from the CBT intervention. Conclusion: A downward extension of an empirically validated adult ADHD CBT protocol can benefit some adolescents with ADHD.","[{'authorId': '3486571', 'name': 'K.

The theories suggest that perceiving and thinking about emotion involve perceptual, somatovisceral, and motoric reexperiencing (collectively referred to as “embodiment”) of the relevant emotion in one's self. The embodiment of emotion, when induced in human participants by manipulations of facial expression and posture in the laboratory, causally affects how emotional information is processed. Congruence between the recipient's bodily expression of emotion and the sender's emotional tone of language, for instance, facilitates comprehension of the communication, whereas incongruence can impair comprehension.

VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = −2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = −3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1, 70) = 5.223, p = .025, partial η2 = .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1, 70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial η2 = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers’ or therapists’ support has yet to be further investigated.","[{'authorId': '46262782', 'name': 'Sze Ngar Vanessa Yuan'}, {'authorId': '1687108', 'name': 'H.

Over the past few years neuroscientists have made remarkable progress in understanding how the human brain represents categories of objects and actions in natural scenes. However, all current models of high-level human vision operate on hand annotated images in which the objects and actions have been assigned semantic tags by a human operator. No current models can account for high-level visual function directly in terms of low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). To overcome this fundamental limitation we sought to develop a new class of models that can predict human brain activity directly from low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). We explored two classes of models drawn from computer vision and machine learning. The first class of models was based on Fisher Vectors (FV) and the second was based on Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). We find that both classes of models accurately predict brain activity in high-level visual areas, directly from pixels and without the need for any semantic tags or hand annotation of images. This is the first time that such a mapping has been obtained. The fit models provide a new platform for exploring the functional principles of human vision, and they show that modern methods of computer vision and machine learning provide important tools for characterizing brain function.","[{'authorId': '33932184', 'name': 'Pulkit Agrawal'}, {'authorId': '2774233', 'name': 'D.

The purpose of the current pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary impact of using immersive virtual reality environments (IVREs) paired with a brief emotion regulation and risk reduction intervention (ER + IVRE) relative to this same intervention content paired with role-plays (ER + RP).


METHODS
Eighty-five adolescents attending middle school (grades 6th-8th; ages 12-15 years) in an urban northeast city were recruited and randomized to ER + IVRE (n = 44) or ER + RP (n = 41) and had complete data. Data examining acceptability, feasibility, sexual knowledge and attitudes, and ER were collected at baseline and 3 months after intervention completion. Analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores were used to evaluate study outcomes. Within and between intervention effect sizes were calculated with effect sizes ≥.20 considered meaningful.


RESULTS
At the 3-month follow-up assessment, several within intervention condition effect sizes were found to exceed d = 0.20 across the measured sexual attitudes and ER outcomes. Between intervention analyses found that adolescents randomized to ER + IVRE attended more intervention sessions, reported less difficulty accessing ER strategies (d = 0.46), and reported higher emotional self-efficacy (d = 0.20) at the 3-month follow-up relative to adolescents randomized to the ER + RP intervention.

d3d2af271de5fbf5d8f9b8e59fbf64034fa09942,"Background Patients with eating disorders are characterized by pathological eating habits and a tendency to overestimate their weight and body shape. Virtual reality shows promise for the evaluation and management of patients with eating disorders. This technology, when accepted by this population, allows immersion in virtual environments, assessment, and therapeutic approaches, by exposing users to high-calorie foods or changes in body shape. Objective To better understand the value of virtual reality, we conducted a review of the literature, including clinical studies proposing the use of virtual reality for the evaluation and management of patients with eating disorders. Methods We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science up to April 2017. We created the list of keywords based on two domains: virtual reality and eating disorders. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research while minimizing bias. Results The initial database searches identified 311 articles, 149 of which we removed as duplicates. We analyzed the resulting set of 26 unique studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 8 studies were randomized controlled trials, 13 were nonrandomized studies, and 5 were clinical trials with only 1 participant. Most articles focused on clinical populations (19/26, 73%), with the remainder reporting case-control studies (7/26, 27%). Most of the studies used visual immersive equipment (16/26, 62%) with a head-mounted display (15/16, 94%). Two main areas of interest emerged from these studies: virtual work on patients’ body image (7/26, 27%) and exposure to virtual food stimuli (10/26, 38%). Conclusions We conducted a broad analysis of studies on the use of virtual reality in patients with eating disorders.

d3e563d0cfef7e485984620b67fb909a421c1b6a,"In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technologies have become widely used in clinical settings because they offer impressive opportunities for neurorehabilitation of different cognitive deficits. Specifically, virtual environments (VEs) have ideal characteristics for navigational training aimed at rehabilitating spatial memory. A systematic search, following PRISMA guidelines, was carried out to explore the current scenario in neurorehabilitation of spatial memory using virtual reality. The literature on this topic was queried, 5048 papers were screened, and 16 studies were included, covering patients presenting different neuropsychological diseases. Our findings highlight the potential of the navigational task in virtual environments (VEs) for enhancing navigation and orientation abilities in patients with spatial memory disorders. The results are promising and suggest that VR training can facilitate neurorehabilitation, promoting brain plasticity processes. An overview of how VR-based training has been implemented is crucial for using these tools in clinical settings. Hence, in the current manuscript, we have critically debated the structure and the length of training protocols, as well as a different type of exploration through VR devices with different degrees of immersion. Furthermore, we analyzed and highlighted the crucial role played by the selection of the assessment tools.","[{'authorId': '1393025315', 'name': 'J.

d3f21999182274928105bfdfea7f85d4ba1841e7,": Several studies in the last decades have demonstrated that exposure therapy is an effective way to treat anxiety and stress and Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) acts as a completely controlled experience. A new perspective is represented by the use of Virtual Reality (VR) for triggering a broad empowerment process to learn coping skills and emotional regulation to cope with stress and anxiety. The link between these approaches is constituted by the sense of presence. In this view, the experience of “being there” is influenced by the ability of “making sense there” and by the possibility to learn by living real experiences in technology-mediated environments. Thanks to the integration of several advanced technologies (virtual reality, advanced sensors and smartphones), as supported by the Interreality approach, it is possible to take advantage of the sense of presence to overcome the limitations of existing protocols for psychological stress and anxiety. Furthermore, a larger availability of unobtrusive biosensors makes possible the effective measurement of presence (and the related affective states) during the interaction instead of using post-experience self-assessments. Future mediated platforms will provide the following advantages: 1) increased accuracy in assessment of ongoing intervention processes; 2) the ability to correlate specific mental states with specific activities executed in the environments; 3) the ability to study the variables related to stress and anxiety in the framework of simulations representing realistic situations and daily contexts, thus increasing the ecological validity of gathered data.","[{'authorId': '103238720', 'name': 'D.

However, many people are overwhelmed by their emotions, fearful of their feelings, and unable to cope because they believe their sadness or anxiety prohibits effective behaviour. In this extract, Leahy, Tirch and Napolitano explore the multidimensional nature of emotion, and the role of emotion regulation and dysregulation in various psychological disorders. Coping with experience is part of emotional regulation. If the individual copes better - either by problem solving, asserting him or herself, engaging in behavioural activation to seek more rewarding experiences, or reappraisal of the situation - his or her emotions are less likely to escalate. Drawing on the research and different theoretical approaches the authors consider the evolutionary context and value of emotion, the neurobiology of emotion, and the question of causality - do emotions have primacy, or do cognitions lead to emotions? A comprehensive approach to emotion regulation recognises the multifaceted nature of emotion and provides techniques that can address any of these processes, within the context of considerable variation in coping strategies and preferences of the individual.","[{'authorId': '3893793', 'name': 'R.

We developed an easy-to-use VR self-management relaxation tool (VRelax) with immersive 360° nature videos and interactive animated elements. Objective To investigate the immediate effects of VR relaxation on negative and positive affective states and short-term effects on perceived stress and symptoms in patients with a psychiatric disorder, compared to standard relaxation exercises. Methods A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 50 patients receiving ambulatory treatment for anxiety, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to start with VRelax or standard relaxation and used both interventions for 10 days at home. They completed 8 visual analog scales of momentary negative and positive affective states before and after each session. Global perceived stress and psychiatric symptoms were measured before and after both intervention periods. Treatment effects were analyzed with multilevel mixed model regression analyses and 2-way analysis of variance. Results Both VRelax and standard relaxation exercises led to a statistically significant immediate improvement of all negative and positive affective states. Compared to standard relaxation, VRelax resulted in a significantly greater reduction of total negative affective state (change 16.2% versus 21.2%; t1684=−2.02, 95% CI −18.70 to −0.28; P=.04). Specifically, VRelax had a stronger beneficial effect on momentary anxiety (t1684=−3.24, 95% CI −6.86 to −1.69), sadness (t1684=−2.32, 95% CI −6.51 to −0.55), and cheerfulness (t1684=2.35, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.75). There were no significant differences between short-term effects of the two treatments on global perceived stress and symptoms. Conclusions If the results of this trial are replicated and extended, VRelax may provide a much-needed, effective, easy-to-use self-management relaxation intervention to enhance psychiatric treatments.

In an effort to distill the complexity of affective experience, psychologists routinely focus on a simplified subset of subjective rating scales (i.e., dimensions) that capture considerable variability in reported affect: reported valence (i.e., how good or bad?) and reported arousal (e.g., how strong is the emotion you are feeling?). Still, existing theoretical approaches address the basic organization and measurement of these affective dimensions differently. Some approaches organize affect around the dimensions of bipolar valence and arousal (e.g., the circumplex model), whereas alternative approaches organize affect around the dimensions of unipolar positivity and unipolar negativity (e.g., the bivariate evaluative model). In this report, we (a) replicate the data structure observed when collected according to the two approaches described above, and reinterpret these data to suggest that the relationship between each pair of affective dimensions is conditional on valence ambiguity, and (b) formalize this structure with a mathematical model depicting a valence ambiguity dimension that decreases in range as arousal decreases (a triangle). This model captures variability in affective ratings better than alternative approaches, increasing variance explained from ~60% to over 90% without adding parameters.","[{'authorId': '2257418', 'name': 'Alison Mattek'}, {'authorId': '1972046', 'name': 'G.

However, few studies compare its capacity to evoke the same emotional responses as in real scenarios. This study investigates psycho-physiological patterns evoked during the free exploration of an art museum and the museum virtualized through a 3D immersive virtual environment (IVE). An exploratory study involving 60 participants was performed, recording electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals using wearable devices. The real vs. virtual psychological comparison was performed using self-assessment emotional response tests, whereas the physiological comparison was performed through Support Vector Machine algorithms, endowed with an effective feature selection procedure for a set of state-of-the-art metrics quantifying cardiovascular and brain linear and nonlinear dynamics. We included an initial calibration phase, using standardized 2D and 360° emotional stimuli, to increase the accuracy of the model. The self-assessments of the physical and virtual museum support the use of IVEs in emotion research. The 2-class (high/low) system accuracy was 71.52% and 77.08% along the arousal and valence dimension, respectively, in the physical museum, and 75.00% and 71.08% in the virtual museum. The previously presented 360° stimuli contributed to increasing the accuracy in the virtual museum. Also, the real vs. virtual classifier accuracy was 95.27%, using only EEG mean phase coherency features, which demonstrates the high involvement of brain synchronization in emotional virtual reality processes.

Methods:  Twenty adolescents with ASD participated in a six-session virtual reality driving simulator-based experiment, during which their electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded alongside driving events and a therapist's rating of their affective states and mental workload. Five feature generation approaches including statistical features, fractal dimension features, higher order crossings (HOC)-based features, power features from frequency bands, and power features from bins ($\Delta \boldsymbol{f} = 2\;{\rm{Hz}}$ ) were applied to extract relevant features. Individual differences were removed with a two-step feature calibration method. Finally, binary classification results based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and univariate feature selection method were evaluated by leave-one-subject-out nested cross-validation to compare feature types and identify discriminative features. Results: The best classification results were achieved using power features from bins for engagement (0.95) and boredom (0.78), and HOC-based features for enjoyment (0.90), frustration (0.88), and workload (0.86). Conclusion: Offline EEG-based group-level classification models are feasible for recognizing binary low and high intensity of affect and workload of individuals with ASD in the context of driving. However, while promising the applicability of the models in an online adaptive driving task requires further development.

This paper focuses on the concept of e-therapy as a new modality of helping people resolve life and relationship issues. It utilizes the power and convenience of the Internet to allow synchronous and asynchronous communication between patient and therapist.

d6b903a06c5b0bc7bb4f0c09c3b55eb2997db04e,"As many as half of school children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), resulting in marked negative academic, social, and behavioral outcomes. The focus of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on real-world data from novel digital sources, and the emergence of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to reimburse for digital monitoring and neurobehavioral testing suggest an increasing acceptance of the role of technology in augmenting clinical care and research. Empowered Brain is an augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based social-emotional communication aid for students with ASD. In this study, student performance on Empowered Brain is correlated to validated clinical measures of ADHD. Seven high school students with a diagnosis of ASD were recruited from a public high school. All students were assessed for severity of ADHD-related symptoms via three clinical gold-standard assessments, namely the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2), and Teacher Report Form (TRF). Students used Empowered Brain over a one-week period. We measured the correlation of student in-game performance (as measured by point- and star-based rewards) relative to the hyperactivity subscale of the ABC (ABC-H), and the ADHD-subscale of the TRF. All seven students completed the study and managed to successfully use Empowered Brain. Students received a culminative total of 32 sessions, an average of 4.6 sessions per student (range 2–8). Student in-game performance demonstrated highly significant correlation relative to ABC-H (points: p = 0.0013; stars: p = 0.0013), and significant correlation to TRF ADHD scores (points: p = 0.012; stars: p = 0.012). No adverse effects were noted among students who used Empowered Brain. New technologies may herald novel ways of identifying and characterizing symptoms of ADHD in student populations. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain in-game performance correlates with ADHD symptom severity in students with ASD. Larger samples are required to validate these findings, with more diverse participants that can also widen the generalizability of these findings to a broader range of brain conditions that manifest with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Through further research, we may find that such technologies can help us to identify and longitudinally monitor such symptoms, and potentially aid in severity stratification and digital phenotyping.","[{'authorId': '14929613', 'name': 'Neha U.

Interreality integrates assessment and treatment within a hybrid environment, that creates a bridge between the physical and virtual worlds. Our claim is that bridging virtual experiences (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and emotional regulation) with real experiences (allowing both the identification of any critical stressors and the assessment of what has been learned) using advanced technologies (virtual worlds, advanced sensors and PDA/mobile phones) may improve existing psychological treatment. To illustrate the proposed concept, a clinical scenario is also presented and discussed: Daniela, a 40 years old teacher, with a mother affected by Alzheimer's disease.","[{'authorId': '1700503', 'name': 'A.

To examine the effect of HRV biofeedback on symptoms of anxiety and stress, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted from PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. Methods The search identified 24 studies totaling 484 participants who received HRV biofeedback training for stress and anxiety. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. Results The pre-post within-group effect size (Hedges' g) was 0.81. The between-groups analysis comparing biofeedback to a control condition yielded Hedges' g = 0.83. Moderator analyses revealed that treatment efficacy was not moderated by study year, risk of study bias, percentage of females, number of sessions, or presence of an anxiety disorder. Conclusions HRV biofeedback training is associated with a large reduction in self-reported stress and anxiety. Although more well-controlled studies are needed, this intervention offers a promising approach for treating stress and anxiety with wearable devices.","[{'authorId': '2223723587', 'name': 'Vera C.

d72c9a7a914526233b57686afcdf085cccc0d916,"Visiting or viewing nature environments can have restorative psychological effects, while exposure to the built environment typically has less positive effects. A classic view is that this difference in restorative potential of nature and built environments depends on differences in the intrinsic characteristics of the stimuli. In addition, an evolutionary account is often assumed whereby restoration is believed to be a hardwired response to nature’s stimulus-features. Here, we propose the novel hypothesis that the restorative effects of a stimulus do not entirely depend on the stimulus-features per se, but also on the meaning that people assign to the stimulus. Participants conducted cognitively demanding tests prior to and after a brief pause. During the pause, the participants were exposed to an ambiguous sound consisting of pink noise with white noise interspersed. Participants in the “nature sound-source condition” were told that the sound originated from a nature scene with a waterfall; participants in the “industrial sound-source condition” were told that the sound originated from an industrial environment with machinery; and participants in the “control condition” were told nothing about the sound origin. Self-reported mental exhaustion showed that participants in the nature sound-source condition were more psychologically restored after the pause than participants in the industrial sound-source condition. One potential interpretation of the results is that restoration from nature experiences depends on learned, positive associations with nature; not only on hardwired responses shaped by evolution.","[{'authorId': '31517992', 'name': 'Andreas Haga'}, {'authorId': '34622431', 'name': 'Niklas Halin'}, {'authorId': '6429316', 'name': 'M.

d824505d3824b756fbf1f45121904617219706a1,"Recent developments in neuroimaging research support the increased use of naturalistic stimulus material such as film, avatars, or androids. These stimuli allow for a better understanding of how the brain processes information in complex situations while maintaining experimental control. While avatars and androids are well suited to study human cognition, they should not be equated to human stimuli. For example, the uncanny valley hypothesis theorizes that artificial agents with high human-likeness may evoke feelings of eeriness in the human observer. Here we review if, when, and how the perception of human-like avatars and androids differs from the perception of humans and consider how this influences their utilization as stimulus material in social and affective neuroimaging studies. First, we discuss how the appearance of virtual characters affects perception. When stimuli are morphed across categories from non-human to human, the most ambiguous stimuli, rather than the most human-like stimuli, show prolonged classification times and increased eeriness. Human-like to human stimuli show a positive linear relationship with familiarity. Secondly, we show that expressions of emotions in human-like avatars can be perceived similarly to human emotions, with corresponding behavioral, physiological and neuronal activations, with exception of physical dissimilarities. Subsequently, we consider if and when one perceives differences in action representation by artificial agents versus humans. Motor resonance and predictive coding models may account for empirical findings, such as an interference effect on action for observed human-like, natural moving characters. However, the expansion of these models to explain more complex behavior, such as empathy, still needs to be investigated in more detail. Finally, we broaden our outlook to social interaction, where virtual reality stimuli can be utilized to imitate complex social situations.","[{'authorId': '2937188', 'name': 'A.

Social exposure conducted in virtual reality (VR), embedded in individual cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), could be an answer. Aims To show that conducting VR exposure in CBT for SAD is effective and is more practical for therapists than conducting exposure in vivo. Method Participants were randomly assigned to either VR exposure (n = 17), in vivo exposure (n = 22) or waiting list (n = 20). Participants in the active arms received individual CBT for 14 weekly sessions and outcome was assessed with questionnaires and a behaviour avoidance test. (Trial registration number ISRCTN99747069.) Results Improvements were found on the primary (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) and all five secondary outcome measures in both CBT groups compared with the waiting list. Conducting exposure in VR was more effective at post-treatment than in vivo on the primary outcome measure and on one secondary measure. Improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. VR was significantly more practical for therapists than in vivo exposure. Conclusions Using VR can be advantageous over standard CBT as a potential solution for treatment avoidance and as an efficient, cost-effective and practical medium of exposure.","[{'authorId': '144981172', 'name': 'S.

They're learning how to handle new demands in school and social life while dealing with new, intense emotions (both positive and negative), and they're increasingly feeling that they should do so without adult guidance. Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs are one way to help them navigate these difficulties.SEL programs try to help adolescents cope with their difficulties more successfully by improving skills and mindsets, and they try to create respectful school environments that young people want to be a part of by changing the school's climate. In this article, David Yeager defines those terms and explains the changes that adolescents experience with the onset of puberty. Then he reviews a variety of SEL programs to see what works best with this age group.On the positive side, Yeager finds that effective universal SEL can transform adolescents' lives for the better. Less encouragingly, typical SEL programs—which directly teach skills and invite participants to rehearse those skills over the course of many classroom lessons—have a poor track record with middle adolescents (roughly age 14 to 17), even though they work well with children.But some programs stand out for their effectiveness with adolescents. Rather than teaching them skills, Yeager finds, effective programs for adolescents focus on mindsets and climate. Harnessing adolescents' developmental motivations, such programs aim to make them feel respected by adults and peers and offer them the chance to gain status and admiration in the eyes of people whose opinions they value.","[{'authorId': '34677298', 'name': 'D.

In its original form, the law was intended to describe the relation between stimulus strength and habit-formation for tasks varying in discrimination difficultness. But later generations of investigations and textbook authors have rendered it variously as the effects of punishment, reward, motivation, drive, arousal, anxiety, tension or stress upon learning, performance, problem-solving, coping or memory; while the task variable has been commonly referred to as difficulty, complexity or novelty, when it is not omitted altogether. These changes are seldom explicitly discussed, and are often misattributed to Yerkes and Dodson themselves. The various reformulations are seen as reflecting conceptual changes and current developments in the areas of learning, motivation and emotion, and it is argued that the plasticity of the law also reflects the vagueness of basic psychological concepts in these areas.","[{'authorId': '5854464', 'name': 'K.

Although a large body of literature reports positive effects of NF training on behavior and cognitive functions, there are hardly any reports on how participants can successfully learn to gain control over their own brain activity. About one third of people fail to gain significant control over their brain signals even after repeated training sessions. The reasons for this failure are still largely unknown. In this context, we investigated the effects of spontaneous mental strategies on NF performance. Twenty healthy participants performed either a SMR (sensorimotor rhythm, 12–15 Hz) based or a Gamma (40–43 Hz) based NF training over ten sessions. After the first and the last training session, they were asked to write down which mental strategy they have used for self-regulating their EEG. After the first session, all participants reported the use of various types of mental strategies such as visual strategies, concentration, or relaxation. After the last NF training session, four participants of the SMR group reported to employ no specific strategy. These four participants showed linear improvements in NF performance over the ten training sessions. In contrast, participants still reporting the use of specific mental strategies in the last NF session showed no changes in SMR based NF performance over the ten sessions. This effect could not be observed in the Gamma group. The Gamma group showed no prominent changes in Gamma power over the NF training sessions, regardless of the mental strategies used. These results indicate that successful SMR based NF performance is associated with implicit learning mechanisms. Participants stating vivid reports on strategies to control their SMR probably overload cognitive resources, which might be counterproductive in terms of increasing SMR power.","[{'authorId': '1914749', 'name': 'S.

Methods 32 Adults in four LTC homes participated in a pilot implementation project where they viewed VR experiences of popular locations in Canada created especially for this project. Data in this paper are based on multiple viewing experiences (n = 102) over a two-week period. Results VR appeared to be an effective distraction from pain for the participants. Participants of this study found the VR experiences to be enjoyable and were relaxed and happy while viewing them. Most participants were attentive or focused while viewing the VR experiences, and the experiences were found to be a source of reminiscence for some of the participants. Participants related well to others around them during a majority of the experiences and the VR experiences were a point of conversation between the staff and the participants. Conclusion The findings from this pilot implementation reveal that VR shows potential to enhance the physical, emotional, cognitive, and social well-being of older adults living in LTC, including those living with cognitive impairment.","[{'authorId': '3967551', 'name': 'Ferzana Chaze'}, {'authorId': '46564316', 'name': 'L.

Second, the behavioural activation system (BAS) and behavioural inhibition system (BIS) were considered as an explicative factor to verify the effect of a motivational/emotional variable on alpha activity. A total of 19 participants looked at an ample range of facial expressions of emotions (anger, fear, surprise, disgust, happiness, sadness, and neutral) in random order. The results demonstrated that anterior frontal sites were more active than central and parietal sites in response to facial stimuli. Moreover, right and left side responses varied as a function of emotional types, with an increased right frontal activity for negative, aversive emotions vs an increased left response for positive emotion. Finally, whereas higher BIS participants generated more right hemisphere activation for some negative emotions (such as fear, anger, surprise, and disgust), BAS participants were more responsive to positive emotion (happiness) within the left hemisphere. Motivational significance of facial expressions was considered to elucidate cortical differences in participants' responses to emotional types.","[{'authorId': '2409084', 'name': 'M.

Brain activity was measured using func- tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during free viewing of films, and inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) was used to assess similarities in the spatiotemporal responses across viewers' brains during movie watching. Our results demonstrate that some films can exert considerable control over brain activity and eye movements. However, this was not the case for all types of motion picture sequences, and the level of control over viewers' brain activity differed as a function of movie content, editing, and directing style. We pro- pose that ISC may be useful to film studies by providing a quantitative neuro- scientific assessment of the impact of different styles of filmmaking on viewers' brains, and a valuable method for the film industry to better assess its prod- ucts. Finally, we suggest that this method brings together two separate and largely unrelated disciplines, cognitive neuroscience and film studies, and may open the way for a new interdisciplinary field of ""neurocinematic"" studies.","[{'authorId': '1787630', 'name': 'U.

db2e5ba4b0a87baafe8f94a3d9800c2dd496f63c,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a deeply enigmatic psychiatric condition associated with immense suffering worldwide. Efficacious therapies for OCD, like exposure and response prevention (ERP), are sometimes poorly tolerated by patients. As many as 25% of patients refuse to initiate ERP mainly because they are too anxious to follow exposure procedures. Accordingly, we proposed a simple and tolerable (immersive yet indirect) low-cost technique for treating OCD that we call “multisensory stimulation therapy.” This method involves contaminating a rubber hand during the so-called “rubber hand illusion” (RHI) in which tactile sensations may be perceived as arising from a fake hand. Notably, Jalal et al. (2015) showed that such fake hand contamination during the RHI provokes powerful disgust reactions in healthy volunteers. In the current study, we explored the therapeutic potential of this novel approach. OCD patients (n = 29) watched as their hidden real hand was being stroked together with a visible fake hand; either synchronously (inducing the RHI; i.e., the experimental condition; n = 16) or asynchronously (i.e., the control condition; n = 13). After 5 min of tactile stimulation, the rubber hand was contaminated with fake feces, simulating conventional exposure therapy. Intriguingly, results suggested sensory assimilation of contamination sensations into the body image via the RHI: patients undergoing synchronous stimulation did not report greater contamination sensations when the fake hand was initially contaminated relative to asynchronous stroking. But contrary to expectations, they did so after the rubber hand had been contaminated for 5 min, as assessed via disgust facial expressions (a secondary outcome) and in vivo exposure (upon discontinuing the illusion). Further, to our surprise, synchronous and asynchronous stroking induced an equally vivid and fast-emerging illusion, which helps explain why both conditions initially (5 min after initiating tactile stimulation) provoked contamination reactions of equal magnitude. This study is the first to suggest heightened malleability of body image in OCD. Importantly, it may pave the way for a tolerable technique for the treatment of OCD—highly suitable for poorly resourced and emergency settings, including low-income and developing countries with minimal access to high-tech solutions like virtual reality.","[{'authorId': '4545056', 'name': 'Baland Jalal'}, {'authorId': '2500438', 'name': 'R.

Research in the human neurosciences often involves the use of simple and static stimuli lacking many of the potentially important aspects of real world activities and interactions. While this research is valuable, there is a growing interest in the human neurosciences to use cues about target states in the real world via multimodal scenarios that involve visual, semantic, and prosodic information. These scenarios should include dynamic stimuli presented concurrently or serially in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Furthermore, there is growing interest in contextually embedded stimuli that can constrain participant interpretations of cues about a target’s internal states.

dc04ab99da7df24c49c4f5528df89b25a093b561,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are characterized by atypical patterns of behaviors and impairments in social communication. Among the fundamental social impairments in the ASD population are challenges in appropriately recognizing and responding to facial expressions. Traditional intervention approaches often require intensive support and well-trained therapists to address core deficits, with many with ASD having tremendous difficulty accessing such care due to lack of available trained therapists as well as intervention costs. As a result, emerging technology such as virtual reality (VR) has the potential to offer useful technology-enabled intervention systems. In this paper, an innovative VR-based facial emotional expression presentation system was developed that allows monitoring of eye gaze and physiological signals related to emotion identification to explore new efficient therapeutic paradigms. A usability study of this new system involving ten adolescents with ASD and ten typically developing adolescents as a control group was performed. The eye tracking and physiological data were analyzed to determine intragroup and intergroup variations of gaze and physiological patterns. Performance data, eye tracking indices and physiological features indicated that there were differences in the way adolescents with ASD process and recognize emotional faces compared to their typically developing peers. These results will be used in the future for an online adaptive VR-based multimodal social interaction system to improve emotion recognition abilities of individuals with ASD.","[{'authorId': '1784297', 'name': 'Esubalew Bekele'}, {'authorId': '2115546232', 'name': 'Zhi Zheng'}, {'authorId': '1752154', 'name': 'A.

However, confusion exists within the literature about the precise definition of telepresence. Furthermore, there is a need for a plausible and parsimonious model of telepresence. This paper identifies three types of telepresence extant in the literature: simple telepresence, cybernetic telepresence, and experiential telepresence. The third definition is the most interesting. This paper reviews the origins of experiential telepresence and the theoretical approaches commonly used to explain it. One can term these technological approaches, which emphasize the role of control/display technology, and psychological approaches, which identify experiential telepresence with known psychological phenomena. Finally, the paper presents and discusses an integrative approach to telepresence featuring a structured attentional resource model.

dc51de378749fd1aff427f890f20615ce306bce8,"Scientific evidence for the viability of hypnosis as a treatment for pain has flourished over the past two decades (Rainville, Duncan, Price, Carrier and Bushnell, 1997; Montgomery, DuHamel and Redd, 2000; Lang and Rosen, 2002; Patterson and Jensen, 2003). However its widespread use has been limited by factors such as the advanced expertise, time and effort required by clinicians to provide hypnosis, and the cognitive effort required by patients to engage in hypnosis.The theory in developing virtual reality hypnosis was to apply three-dimensional, immersive, virtual reality technology to guide the patient through the same steps used when hypnosis is induced through an interpersonal process. Virtual reality replaces many of the stimuli that the patients have to struggle to imagine via verbal cueing from the therapist. The purpose of this paper is to explore how virtual reality may be useful in delivering hypnosis, and to summarize the scientific literature to date. We will also explore various theoretical and methodological issues that can guide future research.In spite of the encouraging scientific and clinical findings, hypnosis for analgesia is not universally used in medical centres. One reason for the slow acceptance is the extensive provider training required in order for hypnosis to be an effective pain management modality. Training in hypnosis is not commonly offered in medical schools or even psychology graduate curricula. Another reason is that hypnosis requires far more time and effort to administer than an analgesic pill or injection. Hypnosis requires training, skill and patience to deliver in medical centres that are often fast-paced and highly demanding of clinician time. Finally, the attention and cognitive effort required for hypnosis may be more than patients in an acute care setting, who may be under the influence of opiates and benzodiazepines, are able to impart. It is a challenge to make hypnosis a standard part of care in this environment.Over the past 25 years, researchers have been investigating ways to make hypnosis more standardized and accessible. There have been a handful of studies that have looked at the efficacy of using audiotapes to provide the hypnotic intervention (Johnson and Wiese, 1979; Hart, 1980; Block, Ghoneim, Sum Ping and Ali, 1991; Enqvist, Bjorklund, Engman and Jakobsson, 1997; Eberhart, Doring, Holzrichter, Roscher and Seeling, 1998; Perugini, Kirsch, Allen, et al., 1998; Forbes, MacAuley, Chiotakakou-Faliakou, 2000; Ghoneim, Block, Sarasin, Davis and Marchman, 2000). These studies have yielded mixed results. Generally, we can conclude that audio-taped hypnosis is more effective than no treatment at all, but less effective than the presence of a live hypnotherapist. Grant and Nash (1995) were the first to use computer-assisted hypnosis as a behavioural measure to assess hypnotizability. They used a digitized voice that guided subjects through a procedure and tailored software according to the subject's unique responses and reactions. However, it utilized conventional two-dimensional screen technology that required patients to focus their attention on a computer screen, making them vulnerable to any type of distraction that might enter the environment. Further, the two-dimensional technology did not present compelling visual stimuli for capturing the user's attention.","[{'authorId': '7902320', 'name': 'Shelley Wiechman Askay'}, {'authorId': '145902632', 'name': 'D.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

dd08ee72ec20d789df2f8657139d2dc048d5f955,"ABSTRACT Virtual reality (VR) platforms act as a potentially transformative tool in learning and teaching. The aim of this study was to examine pre-service teachers’ (PST) perceptions about VR, inclusive of their beliefs about its capacity to be used as a teaching and learning tool. A case-study, conducted at an urban university in Australia involved a sample of n = 41. Participants’ positive perceptions of VR in their teaching relate to its potential to engage learners, the immersive potential of the platform and the scope of VR to offer students experiences they might otherwise not have with other learning tools. Concerns expressed by PSTs include their relatively low self-efficacy to use VR in their teaching, monitoring-related matters, financial cost and implementing the technology in a safe and supportive way. There was a significant difference in PSTs’ amount of self-efficacy to teach using VR when compared to their overall confidence to use digital technologies. PSTs typically had greater awareness of the immersive and engagement potential of VR and less awareness about its potential to foster and promote collaborative learning. This paper contributes to an emerging discourse regarding the possible applications of VR in educational environments and particularly in relation teacher-educator contexts.","[{'authorId': '153016337', 'name': 'G.

dd13ad3e8c28306812743bf3d4f6691286efd309,"Background Experiencing a traumatic event can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but not every traumatized person develops PTSD. Several protective and risk factors have been identified in civilians and veterans to explain why some individuals develop PTSD and others do not. However, no research has confirmed the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD in deployed German Armed Forces service members after a foreign assignment. Previous studies have identified some protective factors, such as social support, social acknowledgment, specific personal values, and posttraumatic growth, as well as risk factors, like moral injury and emotion regulation. Thus, the aim of the present study is to confirm the relationship between emotion regulation and PTSD and to test for factors that are associated with higher severity of PTSD symptoms in such a sample. Methods A post-hoc secondary analysis was conducted on data collected in a randomized controlled trial. Participants (N = 72) were male active and former military service members that have returned from deployment and were recruited from the German Armed Forces. These participants were separated into two groups according to PTSD diagnosis based on the results of a structured diagnostic interview. Data from evaluation questionnaires administered upon entry into the study were subjected to a cross-sectional analysis. The measures included the severity of PTSD symptoms, clusters of PTSD symptoms, clinical measures, and several measures assessing PTSD-related constructs. Analyses included the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, X2 tests for nominal data, Mann-Whitney U-tests for non-parametric data, and a mediation analysis. Results The results of the mediation analysis revealed that difficulties in emotion regulation were significantly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms, which was mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance but not by moral injury. The analyses showed that the severity of PTSD symptoms and all clusters of PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with most of the measured constructs in expectable directions. Participants in the PTSD group showed significantly higher mean scores on questionnaires measuring constructs that have been associated with PTSD, like emotion regulation and moral injury. They also showed lower mean scores in questionnaires for social support and social acknowledgment as a victim or survivor than participants in the non-PTSD group. Conclusion The present results show that difficulties in emotion regulation are directly associated with the severity of PTSD symptoms in service members of the German Armed Forces. This association is mediated by social acknowledgment and experimental avoidance, but not by moral injury. Thus, future studies should investigate these potentially crucial factors for better understanding of the development and maintenance of PTSD in service members of the German Armed Forces after deployment to create possible treatment adaptions.

However, implementation of this research by practitioners in fields such as urban design or public health has been limited. One reason for this is that it remains unclear what elements of nature and types of participant experience are consistently associated with mental health benefits. As a result, decision-makers who aim to enhance mental health in cities have little guidance about which elements of nature and types of experiences in natural areas may lead to positive mental health outcomes. We reviewed 30 studies with 41 distinct exposures in nature that elicited positive mental health benefits and characterized the elements of nature found at these sites, as well as aspects of participants’ experience. Elements of natural areas considered include: forest, managed grass, and water as dominant land cover types, specific water features (e.g., small ponds, fountains) and built features (e.g., trails, paths). The majority of the studies we reviewed assessed the experiences of individuals (vs. in groups) participating in walks during warmer seasons. Most studies did not describe the “nature of the nature” associated with positive mental health outcomes. We contacted authors and used Google Earth imagery to reconstruct the specific natural elements, landscape typology, and site adjacencies present in past studies. We recommend specific ways researchers could better and more transparently document important elements of nature and participant experience in study design and reporting that will enhance the planning and design relevance of their work.","[{'authorId': '7864081', 'name': 'M.

Theoretical definition, categorization of affective state and the modalities of emotion expression are presented. To achieve this study, an SER system, based on different classifiers and different methods for features extraction, is developed. Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) and modulation spectral (MS) features are extracted from the speech signals and used to train different classifiers. Feature selection (FS) was applied in order to seek for the most relevant feature subset. Several machine learning paradigms were used for the emotion classification task. A recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier is used first to classify seven emotions. Their performances are compared later to multivariate linear regression (MLR) and support vector machines (SVM) techniques, which are widely used in the field of emotion recognition for spoken audio signals. Berlin and Spanish databases are used as the experimental data set. This study shows that for Berlin database all classifiers achieve an accuracy of 83% when a speaker normalization (SN) and a feature selection are applied to the features. For Spanish database, the best accuracy (94 %) is achieved by RNN classifier without SN and with FS.","[{'authorId': '27097538', 'name': 'Leila Kerkeni'}, {'authorId': '2915285', 'name': 'Y.

Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants’ comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. Conclusions Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT.","[{'authorId': '2194363', 'name': 'K.

These shortcomings require extending research methods to effectively focus on embodied resources in the essential design and evaluation processes. To address this issue, we propose a methodological approach that combines multimodal analysis with Participatory Design techniques to include embodied resources in the participatory design processes for Full-Body Interaction. The proposed approach is applied to the iterative design of two Full-Body Interaction Learning Environments. Through the analysis of the outcomes of these case studies, we discuss the affordances multimodal analysis can offer to inform and guide the design process for embodied interaction.","[{'authorId': '1908716', 'name': 'Laura Malinverni'}, {'authorId': '1884378', 'name': 'Marie-Monique Schaper'}, {'authorId': '2844133', 'name': 'N.

Here we present a study testing the feasibility of using highly realistic image-based rendered VR with patients with MCI and dementia. We designed an attentional task to train selective and sustained attention, and we tested a VR and a paper version of this task in a single-session within-subjects design. Results showed that participants with MCI and dementia reported to be highly satisfied and interested in the task, and they reported high feelings of security, low discomfort, anxiety and fatigue. In addition, participants reported a preference for the VR condition compared to the paper condition, even if the task was more difficult. Interestingly, apathetic participants showed a preference for the VR condition stronger than that of non-apathetic participants. These findings suggest that VR-based training can be considered as an interesting tool to improve adherence to cognitive training in elderly people with cognitive impairment.","[{'authorId': '4192721', 'name': 'V.

Accumulating evidence suggests that these signals are combined in areas of premotor, parietal, and cerebellar cortices. However, it remains to be determined whether neuronal populations in these areas integrate hand signals according to basic temporal and spatial congruence principles of multisensory integration. Here, we developed a setup based on advanced 3D video technology that allowed us to manipulate the spatiotemporal relationships of visuotactile (VT) stimuli delivered on a healthy human participant's real hand during fMRI and investigate the ensuing neural and perceptual correlates. Our experiments revealed two novel findings. First, we found responses in premotor, parietal, and cerebellar regions that were dependent upon the spatial and temporal congruence of VT stimuli. This multisensory integration effect required a simultaneous match between the seen and felt postures of the hand, which suggests that congruent visuoproprioceptive signals from the upper limb are essential for successful VT integration. Second, we observed that multisensory conflicts significantly disrupted the default feeling of ownership of the seen real limb, as indexed by complementary subjective, psychophysiological, and BOLD measures. The degree to which self-attribution was impaired could be predicted from the attenuation of neural responses in key multisensory areas. These results elucidate the neural bases of the integration of multisensory hand signals according to basic spatiotemporal principles and demonstrate that the disintegration of these signals leads to “disownership” of the seen real hand.","[{'authorId': '47330634', 'name': 'G.

de938c653735af7d25ddefb0c6503b69b19e10da,"This paper proposes a bio-cultural theory of presence based on four different positions related to the role and structure of presence, as follows. First, presence is a defining feature of self and it is related to the evolution of a key feature of any central nervous system: the embedding of sensory-referred properties into an internal functional space. Without the emergence of the sense of presence it is impossible for the nervous system to experience distal attribution: the referencing of our perception to an external space beyond the limits of the sensory organs themselves. Second, even if the experience of the sense of presence is a unitary feeling, conceptually it can be divided in three different layers, phylogenetically different and strictly related to the three levels of self identified by Damasio. In particular we can make conceptual distinctions between proto presence (self vs. non self), core presence (self vs. present external world), and extended presence (self relative to present external world). Third, given that each layer of presence solves a particular facet of the internal/external world separation, it is characterized by specific properties. Finally, in humans the sense of presence is a direct function of these three layers: the more they are integrated, the more we are present. In the experience of optimal presence, biologically and culturally determined cognitive processes are working in harmony--to focus all levels of the self on a significant situation in the external world, whether this is real or virtual.","[{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

de9b4a6cf4cf7e245037ef634477eacf0f9f9ac2,"ABSTRACT Attention Restoration Theory (ART) predicts exposure to natural environments may lead to improved cognitive performance through restoration of a limited cognitive resource, directed attention. A recent review by Ohly and colleagues (2016) uncovered substantial ambiguity surrounding details of directed attention and how cognitive restoration was tested. Therefore, an updated systematic review was conducted to identify relevant cognitive domains from which to describe elements of directed attention sensitive to the restoration effect. Forty-two articles that tested natural environments or stimuli against a suitable control, and included an objective measure of cognitive performance, had been published since July 2013. Articles were subjected to screening procedures and quality appraisal. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled effect sizes across 8 cognitive domains using data from 49 individual outcome measures. Results showed that working memory, cognitive flexibility, and to a less-reliable degree, attentional control, are improved after exposure to natural environments, with low to moderate effect sizes. Moderator analyses revealed that actual exposures to real environments may enhance the restoration effect within these three domains, relative to virtual exposures; however, this may also be due to differences in the typical lengths of exposure. The effect of a participants’ restoration potential, based upon diagnosis or fatigue-induction, was less clear. A new framework is presented to qualify the involvement of directed attention-related processes, using examples of tasks from the three cognitive domains found to be sensitive to the restoration effect. The review clarifies the description of cognitive processes sensitive to natural environments, using current evidence, while exploring aspects of protocol that appear influential to the strength of the restoration effect.","[{'authorId': '145986968', 'name': 'Matt P.

Then they visualized a second virtual apartment comprised of specific objects and objects shared by the two apartments. Subjects navigated in the virtual apartments in one of the following two conditions: active and passive. Four main episodic memory components were scored from the VR exposures: (1) learning effect; (2) active forgetting effect; (3) strategies at encoding and at retrieval; and (4) false recognitions (FRs). The effect of navigation mode (active vs. passive) on each memory component was examined. Active subjects had better learning and retrieval (recognition hits) performances compared to passive subjects. A beneficial effect of active navigation was also observed on the source-based FR rates. Active subjects made fewer source-based FRs compared to passive subjects.

When others’ status is not superior (similar or inferior), high-PDB consumers are more likely to engage in status consumption than low-PDB consumers. However, when others’ status is superior, high-PDB consumers are less likely to engage in status consumption. Both signaling effectiveness and need for status underlie the effect of PDB on status consumption. Need for status mediates the effect of PDB only when others’ status is not superior, whereas signaling effectiveness mediates the effect of PDB on status consumption when others’ status is superior, similar, or inferior. Compared to low-PDB consumers, high-PDB consumers perceive greater signaling effectiveness when others’ status is inferior or similar, but they perceive less signaling effectiveness, and therefore engage in less status consumption, when others’ status is superior. When status goods are consumed in private, and therefore not effective at signaling status, the interaction of others’ status and PDB is mitigated. This research articulates the nuanced effect of PDB on status consumption depending on others’ status as well as the multiple mechanisms underlying status consumption.","[{'authorId': '31290097', 'name': 'Huachao Gao'}, {'authorId': '4786297', 'name': 'Karen Page Winterich'}, {'authorId': '145140723', 'name': 'Yinlong Zhang'}]",77.0,,79.0,All That Glitters Is Not Gold: How Others' Status Influences the Effect of Power Distance Belief on Status Consumption,2016.0

The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term follow-up of patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia treated according to a standardized protocol. Methods. A consecutive series of 200 patients satisfying the DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia was treated in an out-patient clinic with behavioural methods based on exposure homework. One hundred and thirty-six patients became panic free after 12 sessions of psychotherapy and 132 were available for follow-up. A 2- to 14-year (median = 8 years) follow-up was performed. Survival analysis was employed to characterize the clinical course of patients. Results. Thirty-one of the 132 patients (23%) had a relapse of panic disorder at some time during follow-up. The estimated cumulative percentage of patients remaining in remission was 93·1 after 2 years, 82·4 after 5 years, 78·8 after 7 years and 62·1 after 10 years. Such probabilities increased with younger age, and in the absence of a personality disorder, of high pre-treatment levels of depressed mood, of residual agoraphobic avoidance after exposure, and of concurrent use of benzodiazepines and antidepressant drugs. Conclusions. The findings suggest that exposure treatment can provide lasting relief to the majority of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia. Disappearance of residual and subclinical agoraphobic avoidance, and not simply of panic attacks, should be the aim of exposure therapy.","[{'authorId': '4219687', 'name': 'G.

Post-treatment outcomes of this study were previously published and details of its design can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT02237300). This article focuses on the evolution of symptoms assessed after 6 months of followup in a subgroup of 58 patients from the original study. In this study 64 patients with eating disorders (EDs) (35 with BN and 29 with BED), who still showed active episodes of binge eating by the end of a structured CBT program (first-level treatment), were randomly assigned to one of two second-level treatments (A-CBT or VR-CET). Frequency of binge and purge episodes, and attitudinal features of binge-related EDs (bulimia, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction) were assessed before starting the second-level treatment (n = 64), at the end (n = 64), and at 6-month followup (n = 58). Mixed between-within subject analyses of variance were used to compare outcomes of both second-level treatments over time. Although both treatment conditions showed statistically significant improvements at the end and after 6-month followup, obtained reductions were greater after VR-CET, regarding binge and purge episodes, as well as the decrease of self-reported tendency to engage in overeating episodes. Accordingly, abstinence from binge episodes were higher in VR-CET than A-CBT at followup (70 percent vs. 26 percent, respectively; χ2 = 11.711, p = 0.001). These results provide further support for the use of VR-CET as an effective second-level intervention for BN and BED treatment-resistant patients.","[{'authorId': '1401305461', 'name': 'M.

Yet, the fear based conceptualization fails to consider the rules of modern combat, the culture of combatants, operational stressors and the moral dimension. Recently there is renewed interest in moral distress and moral injury with a focus on guilt, shame, and anger. Accumulating evidence suggests a link between transgression of moral values and symptoms of guilt and shame, anger, suicidal ideation, and PTSD in military servicemen and veterans. Although proper assessment is still in its infancy, there is a need to better understand how moral decisions can affect the mental health of military personnel at any point during their careers, including postrelease. The authors illustrate this with three clinical case reports. They conclude with a call for attention to the relation between the incurrence of moral injurious distress, and the role of guilt and shame as drivers for chronicity of PTSD. Identifying and addressing these issues can contribute to therapy adherence, facilitate successful progression, and contribute to healing and moral repair and reduce overall symptoms of PTSD.","[{'authorId': '143978558', 'name': 'E.

In the present study, we investigated personal space in children with persistent difficulties in the domain of social behavior, such as children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and in children with typical development (TD). The stop-distance paradigm was used to derive estimates of interpersonal distance, before and after a brief interaction with an unfamiliar adult confederate. The results showed that ASD children felt comfortable at a greater distance compared to TD children. Moreover, personal space shrunk after interaction with the confederate in TD children, but it failed to do so in ASD children. These findings reveal that autism deeply affects the regulation of personal space, influencing both its size and flexibility.","[{'authorId': '4316278', 'name': 'E.

A 1-month follow-up assessment of symptoms indicated sustained reductions in anxious and depressive symptoms since baseline measurements. We discuss recommendations on the importance of therapeutic flexibility in treating comorbid conditions and therapist willingness to combine multiple treatment approaches for better treatment outcomes.","[{'authorId': '12307547', 'name': 'Rebecca M.

e043a919ba39edf0798f89246a4407dd9722010e,"Hypnosis has proven clinical utility, yet changes in brain activity underlying the hypnotic state have not yet been fully identified. Previous research suggests that hypnosis is associated with decreased default mode network (DMN) activity and that high hypnotizability is associated with greater functional connectivity between the executive control network (ECN) and the salience network (SN). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate activity and functional connectivity among these three networks in hypnosis. We selected 57 of 545 healthy subjects with very high or low hypnotizability using two hypnotizability scales. All subjects underwent four conditions in the scanner: rest, memory retrieval, and two different hypnosis experiences guided by standard pre-recorded instructions in counterbalanced order. Seeds for the ECN, SN, and DMN were left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), respectively. During hypnosis there was reduced activity in the dACC, increased functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC;ECN) and the insula in the SN, and reduced connectivity between the ECN (DLPFC) and the DMN (PCC). These changes in neural activity underlie the focused attention, enhanced somatic and emotional control, and lack of self-consciousness that characterizes hypnosis.","[{'authorId': '48579730', 'name': 'Heidi Jiang'}, {'authorId': '2150363493', 'name': 'Matthew P.

The goal of this study was to assess brain glucose metabolism and its relationship to dissociation measures and clinical symptoms in DSM-IV depersonalization disorder.


METHOD
Positron emission tomography scans coregistered with magnetic resonance images of eight subjects with depersonalization disorder were compared to those of 24 healthy comparison subjects. The two groups did not differ in age, sex, education, performance on a baseline neuropsychological battery, or performance on a verbal learning task administered during [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. A cortical analysis by individual Brodmann's areas was performed.


RESULTS
Compared to the healthy subjects, subjects with depersonalization disorder showed significantly lower metabolic activity in right Brodmann's areas 22 and 21 of the superior and middle temporal gyri and had significantly higher metabolism in parietal Brodmann's areas 7B and 39 and left occipital Brodmann's area 19. Dissociation and depersonalization scores among the subjects with depersonalization disorder were significantly positively correlated with metabolic activity in area 7B.


CONCLUSIONS
Depersonalization appears to be associated with functional abnormalities along sequential hierarchical areas, secondary and cross-modal, of the sensory cortex (visual, auditory, and somatosensory), as well as areas responsible for an integrated body schema. These findings are in good agreement with the phenomenological conceptualization of depersonalization as a dissociation of perceptions as well as with the subjective symptoms of depersonalization disorder.","[{'authorId': '115685737', 'name': 'D.

e0c8ebf704682131abdce8739896c1b863c632eb,"Background: Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing [EMDR] is an innovative, evidence-based and effective psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]. As with other psychotherapies, the effectiveness of EMDR contrasts with a limited knowledge of its underlying mechanism of action. In its relatively short life as a therapeutic option, EMDR has not been without controversy, in particular regarding the role of the bilateral stimulation as an active component of the therapy. The high prevalence of EMDR in clinical practice and the dramatic increase in EMDR research in recent years, with more than 26 randomized controlled trials published to date, highlight the need for a better understanding of its mechanism of action. Methods: We conducted a thorough systematic search of studies published until January 2018, using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge and Scopus databases that examined the mechanism of action of EMDR or provided conclusions within the framework of current theoretical models of EMDR functioning. Results: Eighty-seven studies were selected for review and classified into three overarching models; (i) psychological models (ii) psychophysiological models and (iii) neurobiological models. The evidence available from each study was analyzed and discussed. Results demonstrated a reasonable empirical support for the working memory hypothesis and for the physiological changes associated with successful EMDR therapy. Recently, more sophisticated structural and functional neuroimaging studies using high resolution structural and temporal techniques are starting to provide preliminary evidence into the neuronal correlates before, during and after EMDR therapy. Discussion: Despite the increasing number of studies that published in recent years, the research into the mechanisms underlying EMDR therapy is still in its infancy. Studies in well-defined clinical and non-clinical populations, larger sample sizes and tighter methodological control are further needed in order to establish firm conclusions.","[{'authorId': '1398008525', 'name': 'R.

e0f9362543791a3fe9c745dc95f725caff0ea9a9,"Although the terms cyberspace and virtual reality have been around for years, virtual reality as an industry is in its infancy. The term virtual reality is credited to Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research; earlier experimenters, like Myron Krueger in the mid-1970s, used phrases like artificial reality. William Gibson coined cyberspace in his 1984 science fiction novel. Neuromancer. Few technologies in recent years have evoked such fiery discussions in the technical community, and fewer still have sparked such passionate involvement of the humanities and the cultural sector. Maybe the humanities community reacts because the VR interaction is so tightly coupled to the human senses. Perhaps the cultural sector clamours for a role in the evolution of VR because the technology is finally interfacing with the human, rather than the human interfacing with the technology. Whatever the reasons, VR is more a convergence of previously disparate disciplines than a whole new branch of technology. It simply takes a fresh look at human interaction. Evolving from user interface design, flight and visual simulation, and telepresence technologies, VR is unique in its emphasis on the experience of the human participant. VR focuses the user's attention on the experience while suspending disbelief about the method of creating it. We feel that neither the devices used nor the level of interactiveness or fidelity determine whether a system is VR. The quality of the experience is crucial. To stimulate creativity and productivity. the virtual experience must be credible. The reality must both react to the human participants in physically and perceptually appropriate ways, and conform to their personal cognitive representations of the microworld in which they are engrossed.

To evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) in the treatment of PTSD, we performed a systematic review of published articles using the following electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and PILOTS. Eligibility criteria included the use of patients diagnosed with PTSD according to DSM-IV, the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the use of virtual reality for performing exposure. 10 articles were selected, seven of which showed that VRET produced statistically significant results in comparison to the waiting list. However, no difference was found between VRET and exposure treatment. Of these 10, four were randomized, two were controlled but not randomized and four were non-controlled. The majority of the articles used head-mounted display virtual reality (VR) equipment and VR systems specific for the population that was being treated. Dropout rates do not seem to be lower than in traditional exposure treatment. However, there are a few limitations. Because this is a new field of research, there are few studies in the literature. There is also a need to standardize the number of sessions used. The randomized studies were analyzed to assess the quality of the methodology, and important deficiencies were noted, such as the non-use of intent-to- treat-analysis and the absence of description of possible concomitant treatments and comorbidities.

The aim was to understand interaction‐related problems, provide possible explanations, and identify factors that limit their applications. Despite promising advancements, there are still issues that researchers in the field fail to explain precisely. The two major problems in stereoscopic viewing are, compared with the real world, objects are perceived to be smaller than they actually are and there are discomfort and visual syndromes. Furthermore, there is general agreement that humans underestimate their egocentric distance in a virtual environment (VE). Our analysis revealed that in the real world, distance estimation is about 94% accurate, but in VE, it is only about 80% accurate. This problem could reduce the efficacy of different sensory motor‐based applications where interaction is important. Experts from human factors, computing, psychology, and others have studied contributing factors such as types of perception/response method, quality of graphics, associated stereoscopic conditions, experience in virtual reality (VR), and distance signals.

Since deficits in emotion recognition are closely related to caregiver burden or social interactions, researchers have fundamental interest in FER performance in patients with dementia. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the performance profiles of six facial emotions (i.e., fear, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, and happiness) and neutral faces measured among Korean healthy control (HCs), and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and FTD. Additionally, the neuroanatomical correlates of facial emotions were investigated. Methods: A total of 110 (33 HC, 32 MCI, 32 AD, 13 FTD) older adult participants were recruited from two different medical centers in metropolitan areas of South Korea. These individuals underwent an FER test that was used to assess the recognition of emotions or absence of emotion (neutral) in 35 facial stimuli. Repeated measures two-way analyses of variance were used to examine the distinct profiles of emotional recognition among the four groups. We also performed brain imaging and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on the participants to examine the associations between FER scores and gray matter volume. Results: The mean score of negative emotion recognition (i.e., fear, anger, disgust, and sadness) clearly discriminated FTD participants from individuals with MCI and AD and HC [F(3,106) = 10.829, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.235], whereas the mean score of positive emotion recognition (i.e., surprise and happiness) did not. A VBM analysis showed negative emotions were correlated with gray matter volume of anterior temporal regions, whereas positive emotions were related to gray matter volume of fronto-parietal regions. Conclusion: Impairment of negative FER in patients with FTD is cross-cultural. The discrete neural correlates of FER indicate that emotional recognition processing is a multi-modal system in the brain. Focusing on the negative emotion recognition is a more effective way to discriminate healthy aging, MCI, and AD from FTD in older Korean adults.","[{'authorId': '11517466', 'name': 'Soowon Park'}, {'authorId': '49782519', 'name': 'Taehoon Kim'}, {'authorId': '32448795', 'name': 'S.

e34f7696d7e8227adec15dc9db75cfabb1f39e98,"Cognitive appraisal theories of emotions suggest that emotions are elicited by evaluations of events and situations and that our beliefs influence the ways we appraise or judge situations that we encounter. Gross and John (2003) theorized cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression as two general forms to regulate emotions. Although teacher emotion has been studied more extensively in the recent decade, Chang (2009b) has argued that there is a need for research into the ways that teachers' implicit beliefs and cognitive processes influence their emotional reactions to the sources of burnout. Particularly, how emotional display rules serve as underlying principles that guide teachers to make decisions either consciously or unconsciously to express or not to express emotions. This study aims to examine the relationships among teachers' beliefs about emotional display rules in the classroom, and the approaches in emotion regulation, and the subsequent feelings of burnout. Survey data was collected from 561 full-time teachers and subjected to hypothesis testing using structural equation modeling. The model provides evidence supporting a pathway between emotion display rules and expressive suppression. These display rules are particularly influential to expressive suppression which also leads to all three dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Further, uses of cognitive reappraisals are found negatively associated with teacher burnout in all three dimensions. Results of the study indicated that teacher education or profession development should be designed to help teachers to detect and reframe their beliefs about display rules and to engage in cognitive reappraisal so that they may effectively manage their day-to-day emotions in the classroom.","[{'authorId': '2451539', 'name': 'Mei-Lin Chang'}]",48.0,,79.0,"Emotion Display Rules, Emotion Regulation, and Teacher Burnout",2020.0

Using such virtual embodiment to manipulate body perception is starting to be extensively investigated and may have clinical implications for conditions that involve altered body image such as chronic pain. Here, we review experimental and clinical studies that have explored the manipulation of an embodied virtual body in immersive virtual reality for both experimental and clinical pain relief.

The pilot study described in this paper, puts an athlete rowing on a stationary rowing machine into a virtual environment. The virtual reality receives movement data from several sensors of the rowing machine and displays those in the head-mounted display. In addition, metrics on technique are derived from the sensor data as well as physiological data. All this is used to investigate if and to which extend VR improves the technical skills of an athlete, during the complex sport of rowing. Furthermore, athletes are given subjective feedback about their performance comparing the standard rowing workout with the workout using VR.

The paper argues that questionnaires should be able to pass a reality test whereby under current conditions the presence scores should be higher for real experiences than for virtual ones. Nevertheless, only the SUS had a marginally higher mean score for the real compared to the virtual, and there was no significant difference at all between the WS mean scores.

While quality standards are in place for the format and organization of online courses, professors often are left wondering what activities contribute to learning engagement for their online students. The research question driving this study was, what activities contribute to learning engagement for online students? To investigate this question, an online survey was conducted in one state university of all students taking an online course during the spring semester. With responses from 417 students and using three standardized scale variables for learning engagement, as well as two open-ended questions, course components related to strong learning engagement were identified and examined. Initial findings indicated a statistically significant moderate correlation of learning engagement with the use of higher-order learning and reflective and integrative learning techniques. Specifically, students who reported being highly engaged connected ideas from other courses, changed their understanding of a topic or concept, found connections between their learning and societal problems, and had fun. A regression model using these variables, along with control variables of student age, gender, and out-of-school work, resulted in an R2 of 0.484, suggesting that almost half of the variance in learning engagement can be explained via this model. Further analysis of the qualitative data identified certain aspects of online discussions and assignments as engaging, such as discussions and interactive assignments that are not merely “fun” from a student perspective but also integrate previous learning and connect to current social issues. This includes prompting students with thought-provoking questions that relate to “real-world” situations and inviting students to share diverse opinions as well as develop personal perspectives.","[{'authorId': '47154190', 'name': 'J.

The current study further evaluated the exposure's effects on a posttreatment graduation flight, with patients accompanied or not by their therapist, and its long-term efficacy (1-year follow-up). Flight-phobic participants completed a brief cognitive preparation and four VR exposure flights conducted in one individual session. Patients were randomly assigned to a graduation flight either alone or with the therapist and other patients. FOF was assessed before and after the treatment session, after the graduation flight, and 12 months later. Fear responses were assessed during VR and graduation flights. Treatment efficacy was reflected in significant FOF reductions, which were maintained over the 12-month follow-up period. Eighty-seven percent and 67% of the assigned patients completed graduation flights accompanied and alone, respectively, but this difference was not significant. However, completion of a graduation flight was a strong predictor for long-term treatment efficacy. A brief 1-session VR treatment effectively reduced FOF for up to one year. Completion of graduation flights may be important for long-term treatment efficacy, but an accompanying therapist presumably is less important. Zusammenfassung Kurzzeit-Expositionstherapie mit virtueller Realität zur Behandlung von Flugangst: Einjahreskatamnese und die Bedeutung von Begleitung beim Abschlussflug Einleitung: Die Effektivität einer Kurzzeit-Expositionstherapie (eine Sitzung) in virtueller Realität (VR) zur Therapie von Flugangst wurde vor kurzem bestätigt (Mühlberger, Wiedemann und Pauli, 2003). Die aktuelle Studie untersucht nun zusätzlich die Effekte der Exposition auf einen Abschlussflug nach der Therapie, der entweder begleitet durch den Therapeuten oder alleine durchgeführt werden sollte, sowie die langfristigen Therapieeffekte (Einjahreskatamnese). Methode: 32 Personen mit Flugphobie absolvierten nach einer kurzen kognitiven Vorbereitung vier VR-Expositionsflüge. Die gesamte Therapie wurde in einer Sitzung durchgeführt. Anschließend wurde nach Zufall entschieden, ob ein Patient den Abschlussflug alleine oder zusammen mit Therapeut und weiteren Patienten durchführen sollte. Die Stärke der Flugangst wurde vor und nach der Therapiesitzung, nach dem Anschlussflug und 12 Monate später erhoben, aktuelle Angstreaktionen während der VR-Expositionsflüge und während des Abschlussflugs. Ergebnisse: Die Effektivität der Therapie zeigte sich in einer signifikanten Verminderung der Flugangst, die über den Katamnesezeitraum von einem Jahr aufrecht erhalten blieb. Den Abschlussflug durchgeführt haben 67% der Patienten, die alleine fliegen sollten, und 87% der Patienten, die mit Therapeut fliegen sollten. Dieser Unterschied ist allerdings nicht signifikant. Die Teilnahme am Anschlussflug erlaubte aber eine Vorhersage des langfristigen Therapieerfolgs. Diskussion: Die Kurzzeit-VR-Expositionstherapie ist zur Behandlung von Flugangst auch langfristig wirksam. Die Teilnahme an einem Anschlussflug ist wohl für den langfristigen Therapieerfolg wichtig, die Begleitung durch einen Therapeuten hat möglicherweise weniger Einfluss. Résumé Traitement en une séance de l'anxiété de l'avion par l'exposition à la réalité virtuelle: catamnèse à 1 an et effets d'accompagnement du vol d'essai L'efficacité d'un traitement bref d'une séance de l'anxiété de l'avion (FOF) par exposition à la réalité virtuelle (VR) a été démontrée par une étude précédente (Mühlberger, Wiedemann, & Pauli, 2003). L’étude actuelle a évalué en plus les effets de l'exposition sur un vol d'essai, avec ou sans accompagnement des patients par leur thérapeute, et l'efficacité à long terme (catamnèse d'un an). Les patients phobiques de l'avion ont parcouru une brève préparation cognitive et 4 vols VR d'exposition en 1 séance individuelle. Les patients étaient attribués au hasard à un vol d'essai soit seuls, soit avec le thérapeute et d'autres patients. FOF était évaluée avant et après la séance de traitement, après le vol d'essai et 12 mois plus tard. Les réponses à la peur étaient évaluées pendant VR et les vols d'essai. L'efficacité du traitement était reflétée par des réductions significatives de FOF qui étaient maintenues au cours de la catamnèse de 12 mois. 87% respectivement 67% des patients attribués ont effectué des vols d'essai avec ou sans accompagnement, mais cette différence n’était pas significative. Par contre, l'accomplissement d'un vol d'essai était un facteur de prédiction de l'efficacité à long terme. Un traitement VR bref d'une séance a réduit de façon efficace FOF pour au moins 1 année. L'accomplissement de vols d'essai peut être important pour l'efficacité du traitement à long terme, alors qu'un thérapeute accompagnant l'est probablement moins. Resumen Exposición de una sesión a la realidad virtual en el tratamiento del miedo a volar: un año de seguimiento y efectos del acompañamiento a la graduación en vuelo (Graduation Flight Accompaniment Effects). La eficacia de una sesión de exposición a la realidad virtual (VR) en el tratamiento del miedo a volar (FOF) se demostró en un estudio anterior (Mühlberger, Wiedemann / Pauli, 2003). El presente estudio siguió evaluando los efectos de la exposición en un vuelo de graduación posterior al tratamiento, con pacientes acompañados o no por su terapeuta y su eficacia a largo plazo (un año de seguimiento). Los participantes fóbicos al vuelo completaron una preparación cognitiva breve y 4 VR vuelos de exposición en una sesión individual. Los pacientes se asignaron al azar a un vuelo de graduación, solos o con el terapeuta y con otros pacientes. FOF se evaluó antes y después de la sesión de tratamiento, después del vuelo de graduación y 12 meses más tarde. Las respuestas al miedo se evaluaron durante la VR y los vuelos de graduación. La eficacia del tratamiento se reflejó en reducciones significativas de FOF, que se mantuvieron por 12 meses de seguimiento. Ochenta y siete porciento y sesenta y siete porciento de los pacientes asignados completaron sus vuelos de graduación acompañados y solos, respectivamente, pero esta diferencia no fue significativa. Sin embargo, el cumplimiento del vuelo de graduación fue un fuerte predictor de la eficacia del tratamiento a largo plazo. Una breve sesión de tratamiento VR redujo el FOF en forma efectiva hasta por un año. El cumplimiento de los vuelos de graduación puede ser importante para la eficacia del tratamiento a largo plazo, pero posiblemente el terapeuta acompañante sea menos importante. Resumo Tratamento de Exposição por Realidade Virtual para o Medo de Voar numa sessão: 1 ano de Seguimento e os efeitos do acompanhamento na concretização do voo. A eficácia do tratamento de exposição breve com 1 sessão de realidade virtual (RV) do medo de voar (MDV) foi demonstrada num estudo anterior study (Mühlberger, Wiedemann, & Pauli, 2003). O presente estudo procura avaliar os efeitos da exposição, na realização de um voo após o tratamento, com pacientes acompanhados ou não pelo seu terapeuta e a sua eficácia a longo prazo (1 ano de follow-up). Pacientes com fobia de voar completaram uma breve preparação cognitiva e 4 exposições de RV realizadas numa sessão individual. Os pacientes foram aleatoriamente distribuídos para a condição da realização do voo a sós ou na presença do terapeuta e outros pacientes. O MDV foi avaliado antes e após a sessão de tratamento, após a realização do voo e após 12 meses. As respostas de medo foram avaliadas durante a RV e a realização dos voos. A eficácia do tratamento reflectiu-se na redução significativa do MDV, que se manteve ao longo dos 12 meses de seguimento. Oitenta e sete porcento e 67% dos pacientes, respectivamente, completaram os voos acompanhados ou a sós, mas esta diferença não foi significativa. Porém, a realização de um voo foi um forte preditor da eficácia do tratamento a longo prazo. Uma breve sessão de tratamento com RV eficientemente reduziu o MDV até um ano. A concretização de um voo poderá ser importante para a eficácia do tratamento a longo prazo, mas a companhia do terapeuta nesse voo parece ser menos importante. Sommario Trattamento (1 seduta) di esposizione alla realtà virtuale per la paura di volare: follow-up ad un anno e effetti che si accompagnano alla cerimonia di volo L'efficacia del trattamento breve (1 seduta) di esposizione alla realtà virtuale (Virtual Reality - VR) per la paura di volare (Fear of Flying - FOF) è stato dimostrato in un precedente studio (Muhlberger, Wiedemann, Pauli, 2003). Questo ulteriore studio ha valutato gli effetti dell'esposizione in una cerimonia di volo dopo il trattamento con pazienti accompagnati o non dal loro terapeuta e la relativa efficacia a lungo termine (follow-up a 1 anno). I partecipanti con la fobia del volo hanno completato una breve preparazione cognitiva e 4 voli di esposizione alla realtà virtuale condotti in una seduta individuale. I pazienti sono stati casualmente assegnati ad una cerimonia di volo o da soli o con il terapeuta e altri pazienti. La FOF è stata valutata prima e dopo la seduta di trattamento, dopo la cerimonia di volo e 12 mesi dopo. Le risposte di paura sono state valutate durante la VR e la cerimonia dei voli. L'efficacia del trattamento era riflessa nelle riduzioni significative della FOF, che erano mantenute dopo il follow-up a 12 mesi. L'87% e il 67% dei pazienti stabiliti ha completato la cerimonia dei voli rispettivamente accompagnato e da solo, ma questa differenza non era significativa. Comunque, il completamento della cerimonia di volo è stato un forte predittore per l'efficacia del trattamento a lungo termine. Un trattamento breve di realtà virtuale (1 seduta) effettivamente ha ridotto la FOF per più di 1 anno. Il completamento della cerimonia dei voli potrebbe essere importante per l'efficacia del trattamento","[{'authorId': '1684604', 'name': 'A.

Also, most studies with SAD participants fail to evaluate social presence, although it may be a more appropriate indicator for virtual social stress scenarios than physical presence. Hence, for the first time, this study sets out to examine the link between social presence, physical presence, and emotional responses to phobogenic virtual social stimuli. A group of n = 12 participants with SAD and n = 12 healthy controls were exposed to three social tasks in an interactive virtual environment (VE). Self-report measures of physical and social presence as well as state anxiety were used alongside heart rate measures to evaluate the virtual experience. Results show significantly higher anxiety levels-both self-report and physiological-in SAD participants than in controls. Also, socially anxious subjects reported to experience more copresence and mutual attention as well as a higher sense of being in the VE than their healthy peers. In sum, social presence experiences may be more predicative of the anxiety response in SAD individuals than physical presence. Especially attentional processes seem to crucially shape the interplay between presence and affective responses.","[{'authorId': '2144008', 'name': 'A.

A total of 224 portrayals were subjected to digital acoustic analysis to obtain profiles of vocal parameters for different emotions. The data suggest that vocal parameters not only index the degree of intensity typical for different emotions but also differentiate valence or quality aspects. The data are also used to test theoretical predictions on vocal patterning based on the component process model of emotion (K.R. Scherer, 1986).

In the present study, the authors (a) examined the within-individual associations among experiential, facial behavioral, and peripheral physiological responses during emotional responding and (b) assessed whether emotion intensity moderates these associations. Experiential, behavioral, and physiological responses were measured second-by-second during a film that induced amusement and sadness. Results indicate that experience and behavior were highly associated but that physiological responses were only modestly associated with experience and behavior. Intensity of amusement experience was associated with greater coherence between behavior and physiological responding; intensity of sadness experience was not.

e5528127eee28e863bb00315c1591effaaea4067,"Virtual reality (VR) can be used in the treatment of gambling disorder to provide emotionally charged contexts (e.g., induce cravings) where patients can practice cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) techniques in the safety of the therapist’s office. This raises practical questions, such as whether the cravings are sufficient to be clinically useful but also manageable enough to remain clinically safe. Pilot data are also needed to test the development of a treatment manual and prepare large randomized control trials. This paper reports on three studies describing (a) cravings induced in VR compared to real gambling and a control game of skill with no money involved (N = 28 frequent gamblers and 36 infrequent gamblers); (b) the usefulness of a treatment protocol with only two CBT sessions using VR (N = 34 pathological gamblers); and (c) the safety of a four-session treatment program of CBT in VR (N = 25 pathological gamblers). Study 1 reveals that immersions in VR can elicit desire and a positive anticipation to gamble in frequent gamblers that are (a) significantly stronger than for infrequent gamblers and for playing a control game of skill and (b) as strong as for gambling on a real video lottery terminal. Study 2 documents the feasibility of integrating VR in CBT, its usefulness in identifying more high-risk situations and dysfunctional thoughts, how inducing cravings during relapse prevention exercises significantly relates to treatment outcome, and the safety of the procedure in terms of cybersickness. Results from Study 3 confirm that, compared to inducing urges to gamble in imagination, using VR does not lead to urges that are stronger, last longer, or feel more out of control. Outcome data and effect sizes are reported for both randomized control pilot trials conducted in inpatient settings. Suggestions for future research are provided, including on increasing the number of VR sessions in the treatment program.","[{'authorId': '144981172', 'name': 'S.

Virtual reality-based rehabilitation therapy is effective in motivating children with CP. This study investigated the effects of treadmill training with virtual reality on gait, balance, muscular strength, and gross motor function in children with CP. Eighteen children with spastic CP were randomly divided into the virtual reality treadmill training (VRTT) group (9 subjects, mean age, 10.2 years) and treadmill training (TT) group (9 subjects, mean age, 9.4 years). The groups performed their respective programs as well as conventional physical therapy 3 times/week for 8 weeks. Muscle strength was assessed using a digitalized manual muscle tester. Gross motor function was assessed using the Gross Motor Functional Measure (GMFM). Balance was assessed using the Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS). Gait speed was assessed using the 10-meter walk test (10MWT), and gait endurance was assessed using the 2-minute walk test (2MWT). After training, gait and balance was improved in the VRTT compared to the TT group (P < 0.05). Muscular strength was significantly greater in the VRTT group than the TT group, except for right hamstring strength. The improvements in GMFM (standing) and PBS scores were greater in the VRTT group than the TT group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the VRTT group showed the higher values of 10MWT and 2MWT compared to the TT group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, VRTT programs are effective for improving gait, balance, muscular strength, and gross motor function in children with CP.","[{'authorId': '72084547', 'name': 'Chunhee Cho'}, {'authorId': '33767865', 'name': 'Wonjeong Hwang'}, {'authorId': '5789208', 'name': 'Sujin Hwang'}, {'authorId': '6561027', 'name': 'Yijung Chung'}]",115.0,,18.0,"Treadmill Training with Virtual Reality Improves Gait, Balance, and Muscle Strength in Children with Cerebral Palsy.",2016.0

e5844fa8b52ae65a873ffe7083b340990a81d600,"Despite an array of evidence-based psychological treatments for patients with a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a majority of patients do not fully benefit from the potential of these therapies. In veterans with PTSD, up to two-thirds retain their diagnosis after psychotherapy and often their disorder is treatment-resistant, which calls for improvement of therapeutic approaches for this population. One of the factors hypothesized to underlie low response in PTSD treatment is high behavioral and cognitive avoidance to traumatic reminders. In the current paper we explore if a combination of personalized virtual reality, multi-sensory input, and walking during exposure can enhance treatment engagement, overcome avoidance, and thereby optimize treatment effectiveness. Virtual reality holds potential to increase presence and in-session attention and to facilitate memory retrieval. Multi-sensory input such as pictures and music can personalize this experience. Evidence for the positive effect of physical activity on fear extinction and associative thinking, as well as embodied cognition theories, provide a rationale for decreased avoidance by literally approaching cues of the traumatic memories. A dual-attention task further facilitates new learning and reconsolidation. These strategies have been combined in an innovative framework for trauma-focused psychotherapy, named Multi-modular Motion-assisted Memory Desensitization and Reconsolidation (3MDR). In this innovative treatment the therapeutic setting is changed from the face-to-face sedentary position to a side-by-side activating context in which patients walk toward trauma-related images in a virtual environment. The framework of 3MDR has been designed as a boost for patients with treatment-resistant PTSD, which is illustrated by three case examples. The intervention is discussed in context of other advancements in treatment for treatment-resistant PTSD. Novel elements of this approach are activation, personalization and empowerment. While developed for veterans with PTSD who do not optimally respond to standardized treatments, this innovative framework holds potential to also be used for other patient populations and earlier stages of treatment for patients with PTSD.","[{'authorId': '41037107', 'name': 'M.

Computational object-vision models, although continually improving, do not yet reach human performance. It is unclear to what extent the internal representations of computational models can explain the IT representation. Here we investigate a wide range of computational model representations (37 in total), testing their categorization performance and their ability to account for the IT representational geometry. The models include well-known neuroscientific object-recognition models (e.g. HMAX, VisNet) along with several models from computer vision (e.g. SIFT, GIST, self-similarity features, and a deep convolutional neural network). We compared the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) of the model representations with the RDMs obtained from human IT (measured with fMRI) and monkey IT (measured with cell recording) for the same set of stimuli (not used in training the models). Better performing models were more similar to IT in that they showed greater clustering of representational patterns by category. In addition, better performing models also more strongly resembled IT in terms of their within-category representational dissimilarities. Representational geometries were significantly correlated between IT and many of the models. However, the categorical clustering observed in IT was largely unexplained by the unsupervised models. The deep convolutional network, which was trained by supervision with over a million category-labeled images, reached the highest categorization performance and also best explained IT, although it did not fully explain the IT data. Combining the features of this model with appropriate weights and adding linear combinations that maximize the margin between animate and inanimate objects and between faces and other objects yielded a representation that fully explained our IT data. Overall, our results suggest that explaining IT requires computational features trained through supervised learning to emphasize the behaviorally important categorical divisions prominently reflected in IT.","[{'authorId': '1399215344', 'name': 'Seyed-Mahdi Khaligh-Razavi'}, {'authorId': '3351205', 'name': 'N.

Research in alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine use disorders have linked coping motives (e.g. using substances to ameliorate negative emotional states) to problematic substance use. We evaluated the link between emotion regulation difficulties (as assessed via the difficulties in emotion regulation scale [DERS]) and motives for drug use (as assessed via the Drug Use Motives Questionnaire) among individuals (n = 68) with opioid use disorders who were in methadone maintenance treatment. We found that the DERS total score was significantly associated with coping motives for use. Nonacceptance of emotional responses was the only DERS domain that offered nonredundant prediction of coping motives. These findings highlight the relevance of specific emotion regulation deficits in motives for illicit drug use among individuals with opioid use disorders and may help inform targeted cognitive-behavioral treatments in this population.","[{'authorId': '7809516', 'name': 'Alexandra K.

The STRESS project envisions a virtual reality-based system to enable such professionals to train their emotion regulation skills. To explore the possibilities for such a system, this article describes an experiment performed to investigate the impact of virtual training on participants' experienced emotional responses in threatening situations. A set of 15 participants were asked to rate the subjective emotional intensity of a set of affective pictures at two different time points, separated by 6 h. The participants were divided into three groups: the first group performed a session of virtual training in between, in which they received a choice- reaction task; the second group performed a session of virtual training, in which they had to apply reappraisal strategies; and a control group, that did not have any training session. The results indicate that the reappraisal- based training caused the participants in that group to give significantly lower ratings for the emotional intensity of the negative pictures, whereas the content-based training resulted in significantly higher ratings compared to the group without training. Moreover, a second experiment, performed with the same participants 6 months later, indicated that these effects are fairly persistent over time, and that they transfer to different pictures with similar characteristics.","[{'authorId': '1726343', 'name': 'Jan Treur'}]",0.0,"{'name': '', 'volume': ''}",26.0,Tibor BosseCharlotte GerritsenJeroen de Man,2014.0
e72eca45e3737b5dd101685830368680ecf98609,"Background New technologies are set to profoundly change the way we understand and manage psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Developments in imaging and biomarkers, along with medical informatics, may well allow for better assessments and interventions in the future. Recent advances in the concept of digital phenotype, which involves using computerized measurement tools to capture the characteristics of a given psychiatric disorder, is one paradigmatic example. Objective The impact of new technologies on health professionals’ practice in OCD care remains to be determined. Recent developments could disrupt not just their clinical practices, but also their beliefs, ethics, and representations, even going so far as to question their professional culture. This study aimed to conduct an extensive review of new technologies in OCD. Methods We conducted the review by looking for titles in the PubMed database up to December 2017 that contained the following terms: [Obsessive] AND [Smartphone] OR [phone] OR [Internet] OR [Device] OR [Wearable] OR [Mobile] OR [Machine learning] OR [Artificial] OR [Biofeedback] OR [Neurofeedback] OR [Momentary] OR [Computerized] OR [Heart rate variability] OR [actigraphy] OR [actimetry] OR [digital] OR [virtual reality] OR [Tele] OR [video]. Results We analyzed 364 articles, of which 62 were included. Our review was divided into 3 parts: prediction, assessment (including diagnosis, screening, and monitoring), and intervention. Conclusions The review showed that the place of connected objects, machine learning, and remote monitoring has yet to be defined in OCD. Smartphone assessment apps and the Web Screening Questionnaire demonstrated good sensitivity and adequate specificity for detecting OCD symptoms when compared with a full-length structured clinical interview. The ecological momentary assessment procedure may also represent a worthy addition to the current suite of assessment tools. In the field of intervention, CBT supported by smartphone, internet, or computer may not be more effective than that delivered by a qualified practitioner, but it is easy to use, well accepted by patients, reproducible, and cost-effective. Finally, new technologies are enabling the development of new therapies, including biofeedback and virtual reality, which focus on the learning of coping skills. For them to be used, these tools must be properly explained and tailored to individual physician and patient profiles.","[{'authorId': '39463641', 'name': 'F.

e7a658788bf57ace558b215e473e5db0abe62e82,"CBT is a first-line treatment for most anxiety disorders and obsessive–compulsive-related disorders. It has also been found to be helpful in those with inadequate response to medications. Despite similarity of certain techniques such as exposure and cognitive restructuring, individual disorders have different CBT models, which have been tested and proven to be effective. For some disorders, such as specific phobia and BFRB, primarily behavioral techniques have been found to be helpful. While graded exposure is helpful in the former, habit reversal is recommended for the later. Individual face-to-face therapy has been the most rigorously tested, but group therapy also has been found effective in many conditions. Self-help therapy, such as internet-based therapy, may be helpful, especially when used with intermittent therapist guidance. Exposure using virtual reality, augmentation with mindfulness, and emotional regulation strategies are exciting and emerging strategies for augmenting the effects of CBT.

The idea of computational thinking and immersive learning is realized by introducing VR technology. Based on the research status in the field of Raman spectroscopy, the contents of 10 Raman spectroscopy courses are redesigned. Through a questionnaire survey, peer review, and interview, the rationality of the course design is evaluated, and based on this, a feedback mechanism is established to ensure the continuous improvement of the course. Eventually, the advantages and disadvantages of the new curriculum are evaluated, and the development direction and limitations of the corresponding teaching model are put forward. According to the research, although 85% of the students said that it is difficult to accept the VR-based course at short notice, 90% and more of the students recognize this new teaching model. They believe that the VR-based course changes their traditional learning habits and helps cultivate self-learning ability.

In total, 56 individuals with ASD aged 14–24 years (Mage = 18.15; SDage = 2.30) completed Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and Autism-Spectrum Quotient – Short. Individuals were grouped into four clusters based on their Emotion Regulation Questionnaire subscale scores. Individuals in the high suppression and low reappraisal group expressed higher depressive symptoms and lower positive well-being when compared with the low suppression and high reappraisal group. Interestingly, individuals who self-reported using both high suppression and reappraisal expressed relatively high positive well-being and low depression symptoms. We suggest that the maladaptive effect of habitual suppression usage may be buffered by the habitual use of reappraisal, and this interaction between adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategy use has clinical implications.","[{'authorId': '11450626', 'name': 'R.

Three sample types of increasing visual complexity are used: UC, grayscale textures, and color textures (CTs). To assess the intraobserver variability, the experiment is repeated after 1 week. Our results show that texture fully determines the responses on the Hard-Soft scale, and plays a role of decreasing weight for the masculine-feminine, heavy- light, and warm-cool scales. Using some 25,000 observer responses, we derive color emotion functions that predict the group-averaged scale responses from the samples’ color and texture parameters. For UC samples, the accuracy of our functions is significantly higher (average R2 ¼ 0.88) than that of previously reported functions applied to our data. The functions derived for CT samples have an accuracy of R2 ¼ 0.80.

Individuals with current or past depression are often smokers who are more nicotine dependent, more likely to suffer from negative mood changes after nicotine withdrawal, and more likely to relapse to smoking after quitting than the general population, which contributes to their higher morbidity and mortality from smoking-related illnesses. It remains unclear what interventions can help them to quit smoking.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, with and without specific mood management components, in smokers with current or past depression.


SEARCH METHODS
In April 2013, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, other reviews, and asked experts for information on trials.

Criteria for including studies in this review were that they had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing smoking cessation interventions in adult smokers with current or past depression. Depression was defined as major depression or depressive symptoms. We included studies where subgroups of participants with depression were identified, either pre-stated or post hoc. The outcome was abstinence from smoking after six months or longer follow-up. We preferred prolonged or continuous abstinence and biochemically validated abstinence where available.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
When possible, we estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) with the Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed-effect model). We also performed subgroup analyses, by length of follow-up, depression measurement, depression group in study, antidepressant use, published or unpublished data, format of intervention, level of behavioural support, additional pharmacotherapy, type of antidepressant medication, and additional nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).


MAIN RESULTS
Forty-nine RCTs were included of which 33 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions with specific mood management components for depression. In smokers with current depression, meta-analysis showed a significant positive effect for adding psychosocial mood management to a standard smoking cessation intervention when compared with standard smoking cessation intervention alone (11 trials, N = 1844, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.92). In smokers with past depression we found a similar effect (13 trials, N = 1496, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.77). Meta-analysis resulted in a positive effect, although not significant, for adding bupropion compared with placebo in smokers with current depression (5 trials, N = 410, RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.27). There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine and paroxetine for smokers with current depression. Bupropion (4 trials, N = 404, RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.18) might significantly increase long-term cessation among smokers with past depression when compared with placebo, but the evidence for bupropion is relatively weak due to the small number of studies and the post hoc subgroups for all the studies. There were not enough trial data to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoxetine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, selegiline, and sertraline in smokers with past depression.Twenty-three of the 49 trials investigated smoking cessation interventions without specific components for depression. There was heterogeneity between the trials which compared psychosocial interventions with standard smoking cessation counselling for both smokers with current and past depression. Therefore, we did not estimate a pooled effect. One trial compared nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo in smokers with current depression and found a positive, although not significant, effect (N = 196, RR 2.64, 95% CI 0.93 to 7.45). Meta-analysis also found a positive, although not significant, effect for NRT versus placebo in smokers with past depression (3 trials, N = 432, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.60). Three trials compared other pharmacotherapy versus placebo and six trials compared other interventions in smokers with current or past depression. Due to heterogeneity between the interventions of the included trials we did not estimate pooled effects.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Evidence suggests that adding a psychosocial mood management component to a standard smoking cessation intervention increases long-term cessation rates in smokers with both current and past depression when compared with the standard intervention alone. Pooled results from four trials suggest that use of bupropion may increase long-term cessation in smokers with past depression. There was no evidence found for the use of bupropion in smokers with current depression. There was not enough evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of the other antidepressants in smokers with current or past depression. There was also not enough evidence to evaluate the group of trials that investigated interventions without specific mood management components for depression, including NRT and psychosocial interventions.","[{'authorId': '38912434', 'name': 'R.

We believe that augmented reality (AR) could also be used to treat some psychological disorders. AR and VR share some advantages over traditional treatments. However, AR gives a greater feeling of presence (the sensation of being there) and reality judgment (judging an experience as real) than VR because the environment and the elements the patient uses to interact with the application are real. Moreover, in AR users see their own hands, feet, and so on, whereas VR only simulates this experience. With these differences in mind, the question arises as to the kinds of psychological treatments AR and VR are most suited for. In our system, patients see their own hands, feet, and so on. They can touch the table that animals are crossing or seeing their feet while the animals are running on the floor. They can also hold a marker with a dead spider or cockroach or pick up a flyswatter, a can of insecticide, or a dustpan.","[{'authorId': '2527287', 'name': 'M. C. J.

Research in psychology has suggested that readers may make good citizens because fiction reading is associated with better social cognition. But does fiction reading causally improve social cognition? Here, we meta-analyze extant published and unpublished experimental data to address this question. Multilevel random-effects meta-analysis of 53 effect sizes from 14 studies demonstrated that it does: compared to nonfiction reading and no reading, fiction reading leads to a small, statistically significant improvement in social-cognitive performance (g = .15–.16). This effect is robust across sensitivity analyses and does not appear to be the result of publication bias. We recommend that in future work, researchers use more robust reading manipulations, assess whether the effects transfer to improved real-world social functioning, and investigate mechanisms.","[{'authorId': '1399113965', 'name': 'D.

ea65e67fdb5152afd234d0f300be1770144e62b9,"The realistic depiction of lifelike virtual humans has been the goal of many movie makers in the last decade. Recently, films such as Tron: Legacy and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have produced highly realistic characters. In the real-time domain, there is also a need to deliver realistic virtual characters, with the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as L.A. Noire™ or Heavy Rain™). There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004]. In this paper, we investigate some of the consequences of choosing realistic or stylized rendering in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating appealing virtual characters. We conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to determine whether render style affects how virtual humans are perceived. Motion capture with synchronized eye-tracked data was used throughout to animate custom-made virtual model replicas of the captured actors.","[{'authorId': '145795454', 'name': 'R.

ea8467e1d26f472a5fc8579d0fc8372149283acc,"Social emotion regulation, which can be understood as the intentional efforts by one person to regulate emotions of another person, is something we encounter and benefit from every day, and becomes especially important when a person is unable to handle an emotion or an emotional event by themselves. A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations. The school environment and the character of the friendly student also have the potential to be adapted for follow-up experiments on additional aspects of social emotion regulation for a variety of contexts.","[{'authorId': '2124332447', 'name': 'Lina Stallmann'}, {'authorId': '39779139', 'name': 'Daniel Dukes'}, {'authorId': '2054039824', 'name': 'Michel Tran'}, {'authorId': '2158785974', 'name': 'Valentin Durand de Gevigney'}, {'authorId': '3090887', 'name': 'D.

Most research in the area of automated emotion recognition is based on facial expressions or speech signals. Although the influence of the emotional state on body movements is undeniable, this source of expression is still underestimated in automatic analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method to recognise seven basic emotional states—namely, happy, sad, surprise, fear, anger, disgust and neutral—utilising body movement. We analyse motion capture data under seven basic emotional states recorded by professional actor/actresses using Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor. We propose a new representation of affective movements, based on sequences of body joints. The proposed algorithm creates a sequential model of affective movement based on low level features inferred from the spacial location and the orientation of joints within the tracked skeleton. In the experimental results, different deep neural networks were employed and compared to recognise the emotional state of the acquired motion sequences. The experimental results conducted in this work show the feasibility of automatic emotion recognition from sequences of body gestures, which can serve as an additional source of information in multimodal emotion recognition.","[{'authorId': '2531522', 'name': 'T.

Methods: A correlative study, in which a cohort of 61 patients was surveyed and a group of 40 healthy, age-matched individuals served as controls. Patients were surveyed as to their QOL, levels of hope and utilization of proactive coping, employment status and degree of functionality. Results: PPS patients had lower total, physical and mental QOL indices compared to controls. Future-oriented coping strategies associated with hope were positively associated with physical and mental QOL in the PPS group, but not in the controls. In a multivariate analysis, hope and employment status predicted higher QOL among those with PPS. Conclusions: Future-oriented coping strategies, particularly hope are distinctively associated with improved QOL benefits in PPS patients. Fostering future-oriented coping related to hope may improve the self-perceived mental and physical status of patients with PPS. Implications for Rehabilitation Coping styles of individuals with post-polio can be conceptualized in terms of positive-optimistic psychological constructs rather than the traditional negative frame of reference. Hope is distinctively associated with improved quality of life among post-polio patients.

Red skin is associated to inflamed, hot and more sensitive skin, while blue is associated to cyanotic, cold skin. We aimed to test whether the color of the skin would alter the heat pain threshold. To this end, we used an immersive virtual environment where we induced embodiment of a virtual arm that was co-located with the real one and seen from a first-person perspective. Virtual reality allowed us to dynamically modify the color of the skin of the virtual arm. In order to test pain threshold, increasing ramps of heat stimulation applied on the participants’ arm were delivered concomitantly with the gradual intensification of different colors on the embodied avatar’s arm. We found that a reddened arm significantly decreased the pain threshold compared with normal and bluish skin. This effect was specific when red was seen on the arm, while seeing red in a spot outside the arm did not decrease pain threshold. These results demonstrate an influence of skin color on pain perception. This top-down modulation of pain through visual input suggests a potential use of embodied virtual bodies for pain therapy.","[{'authorId': '46688435', 'name': 'M.

Therefore, an exploratory study was conducted to examine whether virtual reality (VR) with real-time biofeedback would have potential in training people in an engaging way to develop a new stress-is-enhancing mindset. Materials and Methods: The specific application to improve people's stress mindset that was used in this study is Stressjam. The application was tested on its attractiveness by 111 healthy participants, specifically on their personal involvement through the Personal Involvement Inventory and its usability through the System Usability Scale. In addition to the healthy participants, a group of 64 patients dealing with stress used Stressjam for at least three sessions. The Stress Mindset Measure was used to assess the stress mindset of both groups, at baseline and after finishing their session(s). Results: Stressjam appears to be an application that is user friendly with good user involvement. The healthy participants and the patient sample both had a more positive stress mindset after using the application than at baseline, t(111) = 4.38, P < 0.001, and F(1,63) = 66.57, P < 0.001, respectively.

Specifically, compared with symmetrical logos, asymmetrical logos tend to be more arousing, leading to increased perceptions of excitement. As such, consumers tend to perceive asymmetrical logos as more congruent with brands that have an exciting personality. This can boost consumers’ evaluations and the market’s financial valuations of such brands, a phenomenon referred to as the “visual asymmetry effect.” The studies also show that this interplay between brand personality and logo design occurs only for the personality of excitement and the visual property of asymmetry. These findings add to theories of visual design and branding and offer actionable insights to marketing practitioners.","[{'authorId': '112935472', 'name': 'Jonathan Luffarelli'}, {'authorId': '118528741', 'name': 'Antonios Stamatogiannakis'}, {'authorId': '49424252', 'name': 'Haiyang Yang'}]",80.0,,71.0,The Visual Asymmetry Effect: An Interplay of Logo Design and Brand Personality on Brand Equity,2018.0

ec78f5104221818936ae848c5f11500eb04a25e3,"In the past decade, the use of virtual reality for clinical and research applications has become more widespread. However, the diffusion of this approach is still limited by three main issues: poor usability, lack of technical expertise among clinical professionals, and high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce NeuroVR (http://www.neurovr.org--http://www.neurotiv.org), a cost-free virtual reality platform based on open-source software, that allows non-expert users to adapt the content of a pre-designed virtual environment to meet the specific needs of the clinical or experimental setting. Using the NeuroVR Editor, the user can choose the appropriate psychological stimuli/stressors from a database of objects (both 2D and 3D) and videos, and easily place them into the virtual environment. The edited scene can then be visualized in the NeuroVR Player using either immersive or non-immersive displays. Currently, the NeuroVR library includes different virtual scenes (apartment, office, square, supermarket, park, classroom, etc.), covering two of the most studied clinical applications of VR: specific phobias and eating disorders. The NeuroVR Editor is based on Blender (http://www.blender.org), the open source, cross-platform suite of tools for 3D creation, and is available as a completely free resource. An interesting feature of the NeuroVR Editor is the possibility to add new objects to the database. This feature allows the therapist to enhance the patient's feeling of familiarity and intimacy with the virtual scene, i.e., by using photos or movies of objects/people that are part of the patient's daily life, thereby improving the efficacy of the exposure. The NeuroVR platform runs on standard personal computers with Microsoft Windows; the only requirement for the hardware is related to the graphics card, which must support OpenGL.","[{'authorId': '144059813', 'name': 'G.

Psychological skills training programs teach techniques and strategies to assess, monitor, and adjust thoughts and feelings to cope with stress. VR allows an individual to put these skills to the test through the opportunity to practice coping with their emotional states while immersed in difficult scenarios. Keeping a clear head, ignoring fear when fear isn't useful, learning how to draw on an optimal blend of emotion and reason in times of crisis are all crucial skills for work and life. Affective Control Theory (ACT) proposes that affective strategies that typically strengthen and support performance are skills and that these skills are integral to stress management. Due to its key role in performance, recent research in psychology confirms affect as a crucial variable to consider in interventions in workplace stress.","[{'authorId': '3274087', 'name': 'J.

For instance, health-related research showed that simulated nature environments in VR could reduce arousal and increase valence levels. This study investigates how the amount of possible interactivity influences the presence in nature environments and consequences on arousal and valence. After inducing fear (high arousal and low valence) through a VR-horror game, it was tested how participants recovered if they played a VR-nature game with either no, limited, or extensive interaction. The horror game proved to be a valid stimulus for inducing high arousal and low valence with a successful manipulation check. Igroup presence questionnaire (IPQ) scores showed that more interaction with the virtual environment increases spatial presence. A beneficial effect of experiencing nature can also be concluded. Results from the Self-Assessment Manikin questionnaire (SAM) scores for valence indicate a significant increase in the conditions with extensive and limited interaction compared to the control group. The VR Nature experience did significantly decrease arousal and increase valence compared to the post-horror game ratings. The physiological responses support this finding. These results can increase the effectiveness of health-related VR-applications to elevate mood levels by either implementing plenty of interactions and consequently increasing spatial presence or doing the opposite and leaving out any interactions at all.","[{'authorId': '1390123460', 'name': 'Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons'}, {'authorId': '50201886', 'name': 'R.

ee6206002c6990b4e7347ac7b308f5def7f1cd67,"Affective states classification has become an important part of the Brain-Computer Interface (HCI) study. In recent years, affective computing systems using physiological signals, such as ECG, GSR and EEG has shown very promising results. However, like many other machine learning studies involving physiological signals, the bottle neck is always around the database acquisition and the annotation process. To investigate potential ways to address this small sample problem, this paper introduces a Deep Belief Networks (DBN) based learning system for the EEG-based affective processing system. Through the greedy-layer pretraining using unlabeled data as well as a supervised fine-tuning process, the DBN-based approaches significantly reduced the number of labeled samples required. The DBN methods also acted as an application specific feature selector, by examining the weight vector between the input feature vector and the first invisible layer, we can gain much needed insights on the spatial or spectral locations of the most discriminating features. In this study, DBNs are trained on the narrow-band spectral features extracted from multichannel EEG recordings. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed DBN-based learning system, we carried out an subject-independent affective states classification experiments on the DEAP database to classify 2-dimensional affect states. As a baseline to the proposed DBN approach, the same classification problem was also carried out using support vector machines (SVMs) and one-way ANOVA based feature selection process. The classification results shown that the proposed framework using Deep Belief Networks not only provided better classification performance, but also significantly lower the number of labeled data required to train such machine learning systems.","[{'authorId': '102385352', 'name': 'Haiyan Xu'}, {'authorId': '1705037', 'name': 'K.

Results: Students who participated in the EI training reported an improvement in the evaluation and expression of emotions in relation to the self (own emotions) compared with the control group, immediately after the training, but this difference did not persist at the follow-up (3 months later). Furthermore, EmotivaMente found an increase in the use of cognitive revaluation as a strategy of emotion regulation in the experimental group over time.

Hedonic well-being, however, showed minimal linkage to biomarker assessments. Future research directions building on these initial findings are discussed.","[{'authorId': '3768104', 'name': 'C.

f06f7c8b784e73e1354cf5a2287e4517fa5093ea,"BACKGROUND
Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well-being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up-to-date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder.


OBJECTIVES
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults.


SEARCH METHODS
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross-checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random-effects model throughout.


MAIN RESULTS
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia.None of the studies reported long-term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement).There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short-term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low-quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low-quality evidence).There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short-term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low-quality evidence).There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low-quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short-term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low-quality evidence).There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short-term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short-term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low-quality evidence).There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short-term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short-term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low-quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low-quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer-term, quality-controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes.There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short-term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects.The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies.Future studies should examine the long-term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases.","[{'authorId': '31545503', 'name': 'H.

f16a6d3fd7166e3335de7462e5250cde94cc2a25,"Cortical excitability is assumed to depend on cortical arousal level in an inverted U-shaped fashion: Largest (optimal) excitability is usually associated with medium levels of arousal. It has been proposed that under conditions of low arousal, compensatory effort is exerted if attentional demands persist. People tend to avoid this resource-consuming topdown compensation by creating or selecting environmental conditions that provide sufficient bottomup stimulation. These assumptions were tested in an attention-demanding dual-task situation: We combined a simulated driving task to induce three different arousal levels by varying stimulation (high vs. low vs. self-chosen) with a visual two-stimulus paradigm to assess cortical excitability by the initial contingent negative variation (iCNV) component of the event-related potential. Additionally, we analyzed the oscillatory power of the beta2 band of the electroencephalogram at anterior frontal sites, which is assumed to reflect low-arousal compensatory activity. The iCNV amplitude differed in all three arousal conditions as expected: It was highest in the condition of self-chosen stimulation and lowest in the low- and high-arousal conditions. Additionally, in the low-arousal condition, anterior frontal beta2 power was found to be significantly higher than in the other two conditions and correlated positively with subjective strain. This pattern of results suggests that subjects select medium levels of stimulation which optimize cortical excitability under attentional demand conditions. The elevated fronto-central beta2 power in the low-stimulation condition may indicate the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex in compensating for reduced arousal by topdown stimulation of the noradrenergic arousal system.","[{'authorId': '2057788669', 'name': 'T.

f18205ba66e8ec023cdcd0e707b68c318c5db157,"There is a growing body of evidence that virtual reality (VR) is an effective tool in psychotherapy. Hypnosis is a very effective intervention in pain management, and it can also be applied in virtual reality. Presence is a multi-component construct, related to the efficacy of virtual reality interventions, and, for example, it is believed to be a crucial factor in the virtual reality hypnosis for pain management. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of hypnotic suggestions on virtual reality presence. Our hypothesis is that the presence enhancing suggestions (while the subject is exposed to the virtual environment) will lead to an increase in the level of reported presence in the virtual environment. We tested this hypothesis with an independent measures experimental design, with 30 subjects in the experimental group and 30 subjects in the control group. All subjects were exposed to a virtual environment, while only those in the experimental condition received presence enhancing hypnotic suggestions. The presence was assessed with the Presence and Reality Judgement Questionnaire (Banos et al., 2000). The results of the test show that there are statistically significant differences between the two experimental groups in the case of the “Reality judgement and presence” subscale, t(59)=2.178, p<0.05, with a medium effect size Cohen’s d=0.57. Thus the hypnotic suggestions enhanced the participant’s illusion of going into the virtual world, which was measured on the subscale of „Reality judgement and presence”. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed.","[{'authorId': '40594619', 'name': 'David Opriş'}, {'authorId': '39914597', 'name': 'V.

Through virtual-reality goggles, subjects viewed a man who walked toward them and shifted his neutral gaze either toward (mutual gaze) or away (averted gaze) from them. Robust activity was evoked in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and fusiform gyrus (FFG). For both conditions, STS activity was strongly right lateralized. Mutual gaze evoked greater activity in the STS than did averted gaze, whereas the FFG responded equivalently to mutual and averted gaze. Thus, we show that the STS is involved in processing social information conveyed by shifts in gaze within an overtly social context. This study extends understanding of the role of the STS in social cognition and social perception by demonstrating that it is highly sensitive to the context in which a human action occurs.","[{'authorId': '9765768', 'name': 'K.

The term “ego-strengthening” became part of the clinical hypnosis literature with the publication of John Hartland’s ego-strengthening script in the 1960’s. Since then numerous clinicians have utilized and modified Hartland’s script, and developed other ego-strengthening scripts as well. Research has demonstrated that ego-strengthening suggestions and scripts can enhance treatment effects. Early versions of ego-strengthening suggestions tended to be verbal and authoritarian in nature while later developments added imagery and emphasized projective/evocative scripts with the purpose of accessing internal resources. Currently, in most hypnosis case studies and research articles, some form of ego-strengthening is an important aspect of the treatment plan.","[{'authorId': '48173394', 'name': 'S.

This study aimed to verify the efficacy and safety of the training program. Forty-eight volunteers completed the four-session self-training program over 2 weeks. They were allocated into either low- or high-fear group by the Acrophobia Questionnaire (AQ)-anxiety scores, and then the changes of the built-in variables and AQ-anxiety scores were analyzed between the groups. The safety was assessed using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). The AQ-anxiety scores were significantly decreased after self-training in both groups, and the degree of decrease was significantly greater in the high-fear group than in the low-fear group. Gaze-down percentage and subjective fear rating showed a significant group difference, but HR did not. The SSQ scores were within the acceptable level. These results suggest that the training effect was greater in the high-fear group than in the low-fear group. This mobile program may be safely applicable to self-training for individuals with high scores on the fear of heights by repeated exposure to virtual environments with the embedded feedback system.","[{'authorId': '17720618', 'name': 'Yeon-Ju Hong'}, {'authorId': '5593659', 'name': 'H.

This paper describes the results of principal-components analyses of Presence Questionnaire (PQ) data from 325 participants following exposure to immersive virtual environments. The analyses suggest that a 4-factor model provides the best fit to our data. The factors are Involvement, Adaptation/Immersion, Sensory Fidelity, and Interface Quality. Except for the Adaptation/Immersion factor, these factors corresponded to those identified in a cluster analysis of data from an earlier version of the questionnaire. The existence of an Adaptation/Immersion factor leads us to postulate that immersion is greater for those individuals who rapidly and easily adapt to the virtual environment. The magnitudes of the correlations among the factors indicate moderately strong relationships among the 4 factors. Within these relationships, Sensory Fidelity items seem to be more closely related to Involvement, whereas Interface Quality items appear to be more closely related to Adaptation/Immersion, even though there is a moderately strong relationship between the Involvement and Adaptation/Immersion factors.","[{'authorId': '66831741', 'name': 'B.

They argued that the so-called basic emotions were neither psychologically or biologically ""primitive"" nor ""irreducible building blocks"" for generating the ""great variety of emotional experiences."" In the biosocial theory tradition, researchers have identified multiple noncognitive activators of emotion and demonstrated the usefulness of defining the essential components of emotion as phenomena that do not require cognitive mediators or constituents. In this framework, emotions are seen as basic because their biological and social functions are essential in evolution and adaptation. Particular emotions are called basic because they are assumed to have innate neural substrates, innate and universal expressions, and unique feeling-motivational states. The great variety of emotional experiences is explained as a function of emotion-cognition interactions that result in affective-cognitive structures.","[{'authorId': '38430881', 'name': 'C.

This systematic review aimed to assess whether individual differences in self-control modify the effectiveness of interventions to reduce consumption of these products, and hence their potential to reduce consumption amongst those whose consumption is generally greater. Searches of six databases were supplemented with snowball searches and forward citation tracking. Narrative synthesis summarised findings by: consumption behaviour (alcohol, tobacco, food); psychological processes targeted by the intervention (reflective, non-reflective, or both); and study design (experiment, cohort, or cross-sectional). Of 54 eligible studies, 22 reported no evidence of modification, 18 reported interventions to be less effective in those with low self-control, and 14 reported interventions to be more effective in those with low self-control. This pattern did not differ from chance. Whilst self-control often influenced intervention outcomes, there was no consistent pattern of effects, even when stratifying studies by consumption behaviour, intervention type, or study design. There was a notable absence of evidence regarding interventions that restructure physical or economic environments. In summary, a heterogeneous, low-quality evidence base suggests an inconsistent moderating effect of low self-control on the effectiveness of interventions to change consumption behaviours.","[{'authorId': '5756820', 'name': 'Kaidy Stautz'}, {'authorId': '52173349', 'name': 'Z.

To address the lack of a simple and standardized instrument to assess overall panic disorder severity, the authors developed a scale for the measurement of panic disorder severity.


METHOD
Ten independent evaluators used the seven-item Panic Disorder Severity Scale to assess 186 patients with principal DSM-III-R diagnoses of panic disorder (with no or mild agoraphobia) who were participating in the Multicenter Collaborative Treatment Study of Panic Disorder. In addition, 89 of these patients were reevaluated with the same scale after short-term treatment. A subset of 24 patients underwent two independent assessments to establish interrater reliability. Internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, and sensitivity to change were also determined.


RESULTS
The Panic Disorder Severity Scale was associated with excellent interrater reliability, moderate internal consistency, and favorable levels of validity and sensitivity to change. Individual items showed good convergent and discriminant validity. Analysis suggested a two-factor model fit the data best.


CONCLUSIONS
The Panic Disorder Severity Scale is a simple, efficient way for clinicians to rate severity in patients with established diagnoses of panic disorder. However, further research with more diverse groups of panic disorder patients and with a broader range of convergent and discriminant validity measures is needed.","[{'authorId': '145123851', 'name': 'M.

Interestingly, PMR and VPC activity has been associated with successful episodic retrieval but also with unsuccessful episodic encoding. However, the differential contributions of PMR and VPC to retrieval vs. encoding has never been demonstrated within-subjects and within the same experiment. Here, we directly tested the prediction that PMR and VPC activity should be associated with retrieval success but with encoding failure. Consistent with this prediction, we found across five different fMRI experiments that, during retrieval, activity in these regions is greater for hits than misses, whereas during encoding, it is greater for subsequent misses than hits. We also found that these regions overlap with the ones that show deactivations during conscious rest. Our findings further aid in clarifying the role of the default mode regions in learning and memory.","[{'authorId': '2749675', 'name': 'S. Daselaar'}, {'authorId': '2175233', 'name': 'S.

As collaborative virtual environments become utilized more effectively, it is only natural that interactants will have the ability to touch one another. In the work presented here, we used relatively basic devices to begin to explore the expression of emotion through VIT. In Experiment 1, participants utilized a 2 DOF force-feedback joystick to express seven emotions. We examined various dimensions of the forces generated and subjective ratings of the difficulty of expressing those emotions. In Experiment 2, a separate group of participants attempted to recognize the recordings of emotions generated in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, pairs of participants attempted to communicate the seven emotions using physical handshakes. Results indicated that humans were above chance when recognizing emotions via VIT but not as accurate as people expressing emotions through nonmediated handshakes. We discuss a theoretical framework for understanding emotions expressed through touch as well as the implications of the current findings for the utilization of VIT in human-computer interaction.","[{'authorId': '1737161', 'name': 'J.

Method: This study investigates how children with ADHD rate their behaviors compared to children without ADHD on a new rating scale (the Self-Evaluation Scale for Children). Results: Preliminary results indicate that this rating scale has acceptable reliability and validity. Furthermore, children with ADHD are found to provide useful information about their feelings and behaviors. Compared to children without ADHD, children with ADHD report more disorganized, disruptive, and impulsive behaviors; poorer self-perception; and poorer social and communication skills. They do not report any less interest in school activities nor more anxiety than the children without ADHD. Conclusion: These findings suggest that children with ADHD are more self-aware than previously thought, and this information should inform our clinical and research practice.","[{'authorId': '6570321', 'name': 'E.

Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions.

f5fd33af7c5be2af49ca4b8172e25cde136069fc,"The authors present the design and implementation of an exploratory virtual learning environment that assists children with autism (ASD) in learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills along with improving social-emotional and communication skills. The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students’ varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash™, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent’s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent’s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state. The paper provides exploratory findings of the first 2 years of this 5-year scaling-up research study. The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability. Therefore, findings are reported as changes within subjects instead of across subjects. While these exploratory observations serve as a basis for longer term research on a larger population, this paper focuses less on student learning and more on evolving technology in AIC and supporting students with ASD in STEM environments.","[{'authorId': '2056019735', 'name': 'Charles E.

f63e917638553414526a0cc8550de4ad2d83fe7a,"We introduce the ""exponential linear unit"" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10% classification error for a single crop, single model network.","[{'authorId': '34917892', 'name': 'Djork-Arné Clevert'}, {'authorId': '2465270', 'name': 'Thomas Unterthiner'}, {'authorId': '3308557', 'name': 'S.

This paper outlines a novel approach that builds on a cognitive-motor interaction in a virtual interactive environment. It is based on the theory of memory reconsolidation and the embodiment of cognition. The framework we envision allows the patient to 'step into the past' by using forward motion as an essential ingredient to augment the impact of exposure to traumatic events. The behavioural response of approaching that is the exact opposite from the avoidance usually applied by patients and the enhancement of divergent thinking are the most prominent hypothesized mechanisms of action. This can contribute to strengthening of personal efficacy and self-reflection that is generated by high emotional engagement, as well as a sense of accomplishment and enhanced recovery as illustrated by a clinical case example. We argue that innovations with personalized virtual reality and motion need to be further investigated and implemented in current therapy settings.","[{'authorId': '5762726', 'name': 'M.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of interactivity and game-product congruence on the players’ feelings of presence and their brand attitude in the context of in-game advertising. Specifically, this research illustrates the conditions under which the brand placements in digital games create attention, engagement, subsequent feelings of presence and brand attitude by drawing the insights from the “limited capacity model of attention,” the “vividness effects theory” and the “transportation theory.” 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
A 2 (interactivity: high or low)×2 (game-product congruence: high or low) between-subject measures design is used. In total, 152 students participated in the study. A 2×2 between-subjects multivariate analysis of variance is used to test the hypotheses. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results reveal that for a high game-product congruent game, high interactivity results in greater levels of feelings of presence than a low-interactivity condition. However, for a low game-product congruent game, both high- and low-interactivity conditions result in the same level of presence. Furthermore, the findings also show that for a high game-product congruent game, high interactivity results in more favorable brand attitude than a low-interactivity condition. On the other hand, for a low game-product congruent game, both high- and low-interactivity conditions result in the same level of brand attitude. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
This paper provides implications for theory as well as practice by providing the empirical evidence of the combined effect of game-product congruence and interactivity on feelings of presence and brand attitude from the perspectives of attention, engagement and transportation of experiences in an emerging marketing context like India. The findings are useful for marketing practitioners in terms of effective in-game advertising, designing and execution. Future research can be conducted by exploring the in-game advertising effects of various other variables, such as product-involvement, game-involvement or game-repetition. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This investigation contributes to the literature of non-traditional advertising media, specifically to the area of branded entertainment, like brand placements in digital games by examining and exploring the influence of game-specific factors on the players’ feelings of presence and brand attitudes. Moreover, this paper is one of the first to reveal the real-time roles of game-specific factors in creating gamers’ feelings of presence and brand attitude from the perspectives of attention, engagement and transportation of experience in an emerging market context like India.","[{'authorId': '3453166', 'name': 'Devika Vashisht'}, {'authorId': '2342742', 'name': 'A.

We observed these correlations across diverse instances within each emotion category, as well as across instances from all three categories.

Although research into presence is still at an early stage of development, there is a consensus that presence has multiple determinants. To identify and test which parameters affect presence, a reliable, robust and valid means of measuring presence is required. In this paper, we describe the categories of factors thought to have an impact on presence. Furthermore, we present an overview of various approaches taken to measuring presence, which can be divided into two general categories: subjective measures and objective corroborative measures. Since presence is a subjective experience, the most direct way of assessment is through users' subjective report. This approach has serious limitations however, and should be used judiciously. Objective measures, such as postural, physiological or social responses to media, can be used to corroborate subjective measures, thereby overcoming some of their limitations. At present, the most promising direction for presence measurement is to develop and use an aggregate measure of presence that is comprised of both subjective and objective components, tailored to the specific medium under study.","[{'authorId': '1679478', 'name': 'W.

It is therefore important both theoretically and clinically to examine whether specific components of CBT or their combinations are superior to others in the treatment of panic disorder. Component network meta-analysis (NMA) is an extension of standard NMA that can be used to disentangle the treatment effects of different components included in composite interventions. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central, with supplementary searches of reference lists and clinical trial registries, for all randomized controlled trials comparing different CBT-based psychological therapies for panic disorder with each other or with control interventions. We applied component NMA to disentangle the treatment effects of different components included in these interventions. After reviewing 2526 references, we included 72 studies with 4064 participants. Interoceptive exposure and face-to-face setting were associated with better treatment efficacy and acceptability. Muscle relaxation and virtual-reality exposure were associated with significantly lower efficacy. Components such as breathing retraining and in vivo exposure appeared to improve treatment acceptability while having small effects on efficacy. The comparison of the most v. the least efficacious combination, both of which may be provided as ‘evidence-based CBT,’ yielded an odds ratio for the remission of 7.69 (95% credible interval: 1.75 to 33.33). Effective CBT packages for panic disorder would include face-to-face and interoceptive exposure components, while excluding muscle relaxation and virtual-reality exposure.","[{'authorId': '13916711', 'name': 'A.

Thus, prevention of psychological problems in this population becomes crucial. According to the World Health Organization (1), prevention should also include the promotion and development of the individual’s strengths in order to reduce vulnerability to suffering from mental disorders. In addition, other key elements of prevention are the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of interventions. The information and communication technologies, especially the Internet, have much to offer in terms of the prevention and promotion of positive mental health in adolescents. This paper reviews these fields of research—prevention, positive psychology, Internet, and adolescents—and discusses the potential of positive interventions delivered over the Internet as effective and sustainable health promotion tools. The paper provides a brief description of the systems developed so far and a summary of selected features of the studies detected in the literature review.

A variety of behaviours have been identified as submissive (Buss & Craik, 1986). These are believed to be associated with vulnerability to psychopathology. This paper explores the construct and measurement of submissive behaviours and their association with psychopathology.


DESIGN
Two self-report scales were designed to measure the frequencies of (a) typical submissive behaviours (SBS) and (b) passive/withdrawal and affiliative strategies focused on conflict de-escalation (CDS). The association of these scales with psychopathology was explored in a series of questionnaire studies.


METHODS
Study 1 assessed the SBS using a student sample (N = 332) and a mixed clinical group (N = 136). Of these, 177 students and 66 patients also completed the SCL-90-R. In Studies 2 and 3, the CDS and its association with depressive symptoms were assessed using a student sample (N = 154) and a depressed patient group (N = 60).


RESULTS
The SBS and CDS appeared reliable. There was a positive relationship between the SBS and the SCL-90-R, including interpersonal sensitivity and unexpressed hostility. The passive/withdrawal subscale of the CDS was associated with depressive symptoms. Evidence was obtained for sex differences with the affiliative subscale.


CONCLUSIONS
Some forms of submissive behaviour, especially those associated with passive/withdrawal and inhibition, are associated with a wide range of psychological problems.","[{'authorId': '9722254', 'name': 'S.

Past research provided inconclusive answers: several experiments confirmed this possibility, but several others disagreed. On the other hand, previous studies have shown the important role of VR characteristics, such as realism or co-presence, in evoking other psychological phenomena. However, no study has investigated the interplay between the presence of computer-generated agents and perceived social realism in evoking social facilitation in virtual reality. To this end, the present randomized control study was conducted. The sample consisted of professional firefighters (N = 48), divided into an experimental group with virtual bystanders and a control group without them. Subjects were instructed to perform a rescue procedure in a virtual reality headset. The performance of participants was logged and they completed questionnaires regarding sense of presence in the virtual environment, perceived realism of the environment and perceived co-presence of virtual agents. The obtained results confirmed the role of social realism as a moderator of the occurrence of social facilitation in the presence of computer-generated agents. At the same time, the main effect of facilitation was not confirmed. These results support predictions that the subjective feeling of being in a realistic company of others may be more important in evoking social facilitation than objective facts. Furthermore, the results contribute to the debate regarding the mechanism of social facilitation, suggesting that simple augmentation of the environment with social distractors is not always enough, thus questioning the attentional explanation of the effect. Taken together, our results extend previous findings on social facilitation and open up new possibilities for designing effective virtual environments.","[{'authorId': '11243838', 'name': 'P.

It was predicted that change in the severity of spider phobia according to the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ) would be significantly predicted by change in dysfunctional beliefs toward spiders and self-efficacy, over and above the variance explained by a physiological measure of fear during exposure (heart rate) and presence during the immersion. Participants (N = 59) were randomly assigned to the presentation of visual stimuli only, visual plus tactile stimuli, or visual, tactile plus haptic feedback stimuli. A standard multiple regression was conducted to predict change on the FSQ using the following predictors: beliefs about spiders, beliefs about one's own behavior when facing spiders, perceived self-efficacy, disgust, presence, and heart rate. Only changes in beliefs about spiders and in perceived self-efficacy significantly predicted the reduction in fear of spiders. This result enhances our understanding of the mechanisms involved in exposure conducted in VR. Analyses of variance also show that participants reported statistically significant changes in their clinical condition, with little added value to the addition of tactile and haptic feedback. The advantages of tactile and haptic stimulation are questioned, at least in the context of only one brief exposure session and the equipment used.","[{'authorId': '2074086666', 'name': 'Noémie Tardif'}, {'authorId': '83551037', 'name': 'Charles-Étienne Therrien'}, {'authorId': '144981172', 'name': 'S.

f8bd663a1cf0d48d60bbc075fcd689963c30b94f,"BACKGROUND
Virtual reality immersion has been advocated as a new effective adjunct to drugs for pain control. The attenuation of pain perception and unpleasantness has been attributed to the patient's attention being diverted from the real, external environment through immersion in a virtual environment transmitted by an interactive 3-D software computer program via a VR helmet.


OBJECTIVES
To investigate whether VR immersion can extend the amount of time subjects can tolerate ischemic tourniquet pain.


METHODS
The study group comprised 20 healthy adult volunteers. The pain was induced by an inflated blood pressure cuff during two separate, counterbalanced, randomized experimental conditions for each subject: one with VR and the control without VR exposure. The VR equipment consisted of a standard computer, a lightweight helmet and an interactive software game.


RESULTS
Tolerance time to ischemia was significantly longer for VR conditions than for those without (P < 0.001). Visual Analogue Scale (0-10) ratings were recorded for pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and the time spent thinking about pain. Affective distress ratings of unpleasantness and of time spent thinking about pain were significantly lower during VR as compared with the control condition (P< 0.003 and 0.001 respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
The VR method in pain control was shown to be beneficial. The relatively inexpensive equipment will facilitate the use of VR immersion in clinical situations. Future research is necessary to establish the optimal selection of clinical patients appropriate for VR pain therapy and the type of software required according to age, gender, personality, and cultural factors.","[{'authorId': '4204002', 'name': 'F.

By demonstrating how rating scales are ordinal-level data, we argue the necessity of converting these to equal-interval units to develop a measure that is both qualitatively and quantitatively defensible. This requires that the empirical results and theoretical explanation are questioned and adjusted at each step of the process. In our response to the reviewers, we describe how this approach was used to develop the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ), including its emphasis on examining a continuum of involvement in violent video games.

While mobile technology–based therapy can alleviate wait-lists and scale for increasing demand, few clinical trials exist to support its use for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) care. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of Superpower Glass, an artificial intelligence–driven wearable behavioral intervention for improving social outcomes of children with ASD. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized clinical trial in which participants received the Superpower Glass intervention plus standard of care applied behavioral analysis therapy and control participants received only applied behavioral analysis therapy. Assessments were completed at the Stanford University Medical School, and enrolled participants used the Superpower Glass intervention in their homes. Children aged 6 to 12 years with a formal ASD diagnosis who were currently receiving applied behavioral analysis therapy were included. Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017. The first participant was enrolled on November 1, 2016, and the last appointment was completed on April 11, 2018. Data analysis was conducted between April and October 2018. Interventions The Superpower Glass intervention, deployed via Google Glass (worn by the child) and a smartphone app, promotes facial engagement and emotion recognition by detecting facial expressions and providing reinforcing social cues. Families were asked to conduct 20-minute sessions at home 4 times per week for 6 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures Four socialization measures were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis with a Bonferroni test correction. Results Overall, 71 children (63 boys [89%]; mean [SD] age, 8.38 [2.46] years) diagnosed with ASD were enrolled (40 [56.3%] were randomized to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were randomized to control). Children receiving the intervention showed significant improvements on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale compared with treatment as usual controls (mean [SD] treatment impact, 4.58 [1.62]; P = .005). Positive mean treatment effects were also found for the other 3 primary measures but not to a significance threshold of P = .0125. Conclusions and Relevance The observed 4.58-point average gain on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale is comparable with gains observed with standard of care therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy of a wearable digital intervention to improve social behavior of children with ASD. The intervention reinforces facial engagement and emotion recognition, suggesting either or both could be a mechanism of action driving the observed improvement. This study underscores the potential of digital home therapy to augment the standard of care.

In particular, the role of adjunctive nonpharmacologic analgesic techniques is unclear. The authors report a randomized, controlled study of 21 hospitalized trauma patients to assess the analgesic efficacy of virtual reality hypnosis (VRH)—hypnotic induction and analgesic suggestion delivered by customized virtual reality (VR) hardware/software. Subjective pain ratings were obtained immediately and 8 hours after VRH (used as an adjunct to standard analgesic care) and compared to both adjunctive VR without hypnosis and standard care alone. VRH patients reported less pain intensity and less pain unpleasantness compared to control groups. These preliminary findings suggest that VRH analgesia is a novel technology worthy of further study, both to improve pain management and to increase availability of hypnotic analgesia to populations without access to therapist-provided hypnosis and suggestion.","[{'authorId': '145902632', 'name': 'D.

f976df7e8551a38412cbf826c04982ed365596c4,"Objective: We aim to explore the effectiveness of virtual reality-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy (VRCBT) in the treatment of anxiety and depression in patients with anxiety disorders. We further compare the therapeutic effect of VRCBT with that of standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as well as investigate the long-term efficacy of VRCBT. Methods: As of March 3, 2020, a total of four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus) were retrieved, and two researchers independently conducted literature retrieval and research selection and performed data extraction. Methodological quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool (GRADE). Results: A total of 11 studies were included (n = 626; range, 25.3–43.8), and six randomized controlled trials were quantitatively analyzed. The main outcome was anxiety and depression, and the secondary outcome was the withdrawal rate and long-term effects. Meta-analysis showed that the therapeutic effect of VRCBT on anxiety was better than that of the waiting list group (WLG) (SMD = −0.92; 95% CI: −1.34, −0.50; p = 0.005, I2 = 66%, n = 276), while the therapeutic effect of VRCBT on anxiety was similar to that of standard CBT treatment (SMD = −0.26; 95% CI: −0.50, −0.01; p = 0.77, I2 = 0%, n = 150). We further found that the therapeutic effect of VRCBT on depression was better than that of the WLG (SMD = −1.29; 95% CI: −2.26, −0.32; p = 0.09, I2 = 58%, n = 74), while the effect of VRCBT was similar to that of standard CBT (SMD = −0.30; 95% CI: −0.67, −0.07; p = 0.39, I2 = 1%, n = 116). Of the five studies that reported withdrawal rates of patients during the VRCBT and CBT treatment process, the withdrawal rates of the VRCBT group and CBT group did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.70, 1.48, p > 0.05); only two studies reported the long-term effectiveness of VRCBT in anxiety and depression on patients with anxiety disorders. Conclusion: VRCBT treatment has a specific positive effect on patients with anxiety disorders (anxiety and depression). Compared with standard CBT, similar therapeutic effects can be achieved in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, limited randomized controlled trials were included, requiring that these results be treated with caution.","[{'authorId': '25828443', 'name': 'Jinlong Wu'}, {'authorId': '2116962424', 'name': 'Yi Sun'}, {'authorId': '2162025986', 'name': 'Gongwei Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2118666877', 'name': 'Zhenhui Zhou'}, {'authorId': '50847517', 'name': 'Zhanbing Ren'}]",19.0,,58.0,Virtual Reality-Assisted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021.0

The proposed method, denoted by R2G-STNN, consists of spatial and temporal neural network models with regional to global hierarchical feature learning process to learn discriminative spatial-temporal EEG features. To learn the spatial features, a bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) network is adopted to capture the intrinsic spatial relationships of EEG electrodes within brain region and between brain regions, respectively. Considering that different brain regions play different roles in the EEG emotion recognition, a region-attention layer into the R2G-STNN model is also introduced to learn a set of weights to strengthen or weaken the contributions of brain regions. Based on the spatial feature sequences, BiLSTM is adopted to learn both regional and global spatial-temporal features and the features are fitted into a classifier layer for learning emotion-discriminative features, in which a domain discriminator working corporately with the classifier is used to decrease the domain shift between training and testing data. Finally, to evaluate the proposed method, we conduct both subject-dependent and subject-independent EEG emotion recognition experiments on SEED database, and the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.","[{'authorId': '98177814', 'name': 'Y.

fb1b0fcb131edf73d160ae492b734fe835cbad46,"We propose a framework for building electrophysiological predictors of single-trial motor performance variations, exemplified for SVIPT, a sequential isometric force control task suitable for hand motor rehabilitation after stroke. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 20 subjects with mean age of 53 years was recorded prior to and during 400 trials of SVIPT. They were executed within a single session with the non-dominant left hand, while receiving continuous visual feedback of the produced force trajectories. The behavioral data showed strong trial-by-trial performance variations for five clinically relevant metrics, which accounted for reaction time as well as for the smoothness and precision of the produced force trajectory. 18 out of 20 tested subjects remained after preprocessing and entered offline analysis. Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) was applied on EEG data of a short time interval prior to the start of each SVIPT trial. For 11 subjects, SPoC revealed robust oscillatory EEG subspace components, whose bandpower activity are predictive for the performance of the upcoming trial. Since SPoC may overfit to non-informative subspaces, we propose to apply three selection criteria accounting for the meaningfulness of the features. Across all subjects, the obtained components were spread along the frequency spectrum and showed a variety of spatial activity patterns. Those containing the highest level of predictive information resided in and close to the alpha band. Their spatial patterns resemble topologies reported for visual attention processes as well as those of imagined or executed hand motor tasks. In summary, we identified subject-specific single predictors that explain up to 36% of the performance fluctuations and may serve for enhancing neuroergonomics of motor rehabilitation scenarios.","[{'authorId': '50660759', 'name': 'A.

In this article, we note that VR should be viewed upon as an interactive and sensations arousing instrument, a tool or mediator for communication and regulation of psycho-social processes and presence in terms of social distance. As a symbolic artifact to be assessed and perceived from the viewpoing of aesthetics. The most important emotionally aspects of VR could be pointed out to be a tool allows virtual presence and simultaneously allowing possibilities to regulate the social and psychological distance to others. We acknowledge that emotional and aesthetic factors have too often been given little attention by researchers in studying and learning, especially in VR and simulation based environments. Such emotional aspects are considered on five levels of observation beginning from the individual subconscious/conscious interpersonal level continuing to the social, cultural, cross- and transcultural levels. Emotions and emotional processes may be argued to have a strong impact, from a theoretical perspective, in the ways in which one teaches, the willingness toward the environment and how he or she studies and learns in it. Similarly within regard to issues whether one remembers what was studied or taught and supposedly learned. This work focuses on emotionality, particularly from the viewpoint of avatar based VR collaborative solutions, graphical representations and participants of social simulations, which are used, as shared virtual spaces and mental tools: tools for thinking and mental problem solving. In addition, this work considers emotional mediation through the use of such communication technologies. With the provision of a basis for the ability to empathise, entering into another person's role, emotional reciprocity and as essential factor for generating a shared and trusting or secure enough mutual situations are also discussed from the perspective of one's cognitive and emotional load as well as via situational anxiety and situational pleasure.","[{'authorId': '34201600', 'name': 'M.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity.


METHODS
A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use.


RESULTS
A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale.


CONCLUSION
The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.","[{'authorId': '2069763', 'name': 'R.

However, research also suggests that difficulties can readily arise whereby patients do not immerse in simulated driving scenes. The simulated driving environments are not ""real enough"" to undertake exposure therapy. This sets a limitation to the use of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy as a treatment modality for driving phobia. The aim of this study was to investigate if a clinically acceptable immersion/presence rate of >80% could be achieved for driving phobia subjects in computer generated environments by modifying external factors in the driving environment. Eleven patients referred from the Accident and Emergency Department of a general hospital or from their General Practitioner following a motor vehicle accident, who met DSM-IV criteria for Specific Phobia-driving were exposed to a computer-generated driving environment using computer driving games (London Racer/Midtown Madness). In an attempt to make the driving environments ""real enough,"" external factors were modified by (a) projection of images onto a large screen, (b) viewing the scene through a windscreen, (c) using car seats for both driver and passenger, and (d) increasing vibration sense through use of more powerful subwoofers. Patients undertook a trial session involving driving through computer environments with graded risk of an accident. ""Immersion/presence"" was operationally defined as a subjective rating by the subject that the environment ""feels real,"" together with an increase in subjective units of distress (SUD) ratings of >3 and/or an increase of heart rate of >15 beats per minute (BPM). Ten of 11 (91%) of the driving phobic subjects met the criteria for immersion/presence in the driving environment enabling progression to VR exposure therapy.

fbfac5243e0d98f654eea143afa7003a02bb38dc,"An emotional trauma may induce a cascade of neurobiological events that have long-lasting consequences even altered gene expression. Early abuse and neglect can deregulate the child's developing neurobiological system by reducing its resistance to stressful events, leading to later problems of emotional regulation. Children who have been subjected to physical or emotional abuse tend to pay more attention to signs that contain anger and are hypersensitive to threat. Scar hypothesis and the theories of behavioural sensitization or electrophysiological kindling suggest that emotional traumas may leave traces that persist even after remission of depression, and render individuals vulnerable to the onset of new episodes, even under the influence of only moderate psychosocial stress. Unfavorable early social experiences, such as emotional abuse or institutionalization can affect the structure and function of the prefrontal cortex. Exposure to repeated emotional stressors, even in the absence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses, has been shown to produce increased synapse formation and dendritic growth in basolateral amygdala, dendritic retraction in the hippocampus, and anxiety-like behavior against specific triggers, such as phobia of open spaces. During the narration of an emotionally traumatic event, there is activation of the limbic system, the right amygdale, the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, there is an activation of the anterior insula, which records the physical impact of negative emotions, and the anterior and medial temporal cortex, which are involved in negative emotions. Neuroimaging studies in PTSD patients have found hypoactivity in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate and thalamic areas, indicating the effects of PTSD on executive function, attention and cognitive, memorial, and affective and somatosensory integration. One of the most replicated findings in studies involving PTSD patients is the decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies have also found a negative correlation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activation. A recent meta-analysis revealed structural brain abnormalities associated with PTSD and emotional trauma and suggested that global brain volume reductions can distinguish PTSD from major depression. Neuroimaging studies of successful eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treatment have consistently shown that patients exhibited increased frontal lobe activation. Moving beyond diagnostic boundaries, focusing on the causal interplay between specific traumatic processes and using standardized measures, are useful directions for future research in memory, emotion and emotional trauma.","[{'authorId': '5306765', 'name': 'O.

One important distinction is between emotion, which is episodic, experiential, and contextual, and beliefs about emotion, which are semantic, conceptual, and decontextualized. This distinction is important in understanding the discrepancies that often occur when people are asked to report on feelings they are currently experiencing versus those that they are not currently experiencing.

However, empirical evidence supporting the claim that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and to explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). Results of Study 1 show that over the course of eight weeks participants in both conditions reported feeling empathetic and connected to the homeless at similar rates, however, participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who performed a traditional perspective-taking task. Study 2 compared three different types of perspective-taking tasks with different levels of immersion (traditional vs. desktop computer vs. VR) and a control condition (where participants received fact-driven information about the homeless). Results show that participants who performed any type of perspective-taking task reported feeling more empathetic and connected to the homeless than the participants who only received information. Replicating the results from Study 1, there was no difference in self-report measures for any of the perspective-taking conditions, however, a significantly higher number of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing for the homeless compared to the traditional and less immersive conditions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.","[{'authorId': '144681733', 'name': 'Fernanda Herrera'}, {'authorId': '1737161', 'name': 'J.

This randomized controlled trial examined whether an interactive virtual poverty simulation created in Second Life® would improve nursing students’ empathy with and attributions for people living in poverty, compared to a self-study module. We created a multi-user virtual environment populated with families and individual avatars that represented the demographics contributing to poverty and vulnerability. Participants (N = 51 baccalaureate nursing students) were randomly assigned to either Intervention or Control groups and completed the modified Attitudes toward Poverty Scale pre- and post-intervention. The 2.5-hour simulation was delivered three times over a 1-year period to students in successive community health nursing classes. The investigators conducted post-simulation debriefings following a script. While participants in the virtual poverty simulation developed significantly more favorable attitudes on five questions than the Control group, the total scores did not differ significantly. Whereas students readily learned how to navigate inside Second Life®, faculty facilitators required periodic coaching and guidance to be competent. While poverty simulations, whether virtual or face-to-face, have some ability to transform nursing student attitudes, faculty must incorporate social justice concepts throughout the curriculum to produce lasting change.","[{'authorId': '9854557', 'name': 'N.

However, clip validation is not undertaken regularly. This presents a challenge for research with adolescent and young adult samples who are exposed routinely to high-definition (HD) three-dimensional (3D) stimuli and may not respond to older, validated film clips. Studies with young people inform understanding of emotional development, dysregulated affect, and psychopathology, making it critical to assess whether technological advances improve the study of emotion. In the present study, we examine whether 3D film is more evocative than 2D using a tightly controlled within-subjects design. Participants (n  =  408) viewed clips during a concurrent psychophysiological assessment. Results indicate that both 2D and 3D technology are highly effective tools for emotion elicitation.

We explore the effects of mindfulness training on emotional and attentional measures in Spanish resident intern psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. Method: One hundred and three residents were assigned to an experimental group (n = 60) that completed an 8-week mindfulness training versus a wait-list control group (n = 43). We evaluated emotional variables (sadness, anxiety, and anger, using standard instruments), state of mindfulness (using the Mindfulness Awareness Attention Scale), and attentional control variables using objective measures such as a continuous performance task and the Stroop task before and after mindfulness training. Results: Our study provides data that suggest that mindfulness training significantly improves measures of trait anger and attentional control. Conclusions: Further research is needed to replicate these findings, explore the effects of mindfulness training on other aspects of emotional regulation and cognition, and evaluate the impact of these effects within clinical situations.","[{'authorId': '36168898', 'name': 'B.

(Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.","[{'authorId': '66831741', 'name': 'B.

Theoretically we propose a possible integration of cognitive behavioural theory, neuroscience, embodied cognition and important processes of client change outcomes such as the therapeutic alliance to enhance client outcomes. We draw from evidence of bidirectional effects between embodiment modes of bottom-up (sensory-motor simulations giving rise to important basis of knowledge) and top-down (abstract mental representations of knowledge) processes such as CBT in psychotherapy. The paper first describes the dominance and success of CBT for the treatment of a wide range of clinical disorders. Some limitations of CBT, particularly for depression are also outlined. There is a growing body of evidence for the added value of experiential affect-focused interventions combined with CBT. Evidence for the embodied model of cognition and emotion is reviewed. Advantages of embodiment is highlighted as a complimentary process model to deepen the intensity and valence of affective experience. It is suggested that an integrated embodiment approach with CBT enhances outcomes across a wide range of emotional disorders. A description of our embodiment method integrated with CBT for inducing affective experience, emotional regulation, acceptance of unwanted emotions and emotional mastery is given. Finally, the paper highlights the importance of the therapeutic alliance as a critical component of the change process.

The extent to which PWD could perform four functional activities in the VE was also investigated (e.g., mailing a letter). In addition, physical and psychological well-being of PWD while interacting with the VE was assessed objectively by recording heart rate during the VR sessions and subjectively with discrete questionnaire items and real-time prompts. Symptom profiles associated with simulator sickness were assessed with an adapted version of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. The study found that PWD to some extent experienced presence; perceived that objects were realistic and moved naturally; generally felt in control of the interaction; and demonstrated little difficulty using a joystick for navigation. The study also demonstrated that VR is an appropriate medium for assessing functional behavior within the context of an ecologically valid VE.

fdd69fa6cf66dac5aa393cf0458a7ebf177efbd1,"The effect of multisensory-induced changes on body-ownership and self-awareness using bodily illusions has been well established. More recently, experimental manipulation of bodily illusions have been combined with social cognition tasks to investigate whether changes in body-ownership can in turn change the way we perceive others. For example, experiencing ownership over a dark-skin rubber hand reduces implicit bias against dark-skin groups. Several studies have also shown that processing of skin color and facial features play an important role in judgements of racial typicality and racial categorization independently and in an additive manner. The present study aimed at examining whether using multisensory stimulation to induce feelings of body-ownership over a dark-skin rubber hand would lead to an increase in positive attitudes toward black faces. We here show, that the induced ownership of a body-part of a different skin color affected the participants’ implicit attitudes when processing facial features, in addition to the processing of skin color shown previously. Furthermore, when the levels of pre-existing attitudes toward black people were taken into account, the effect of the rubber hand illusion on the post-stimulation implicit attitudes was only significant for those participants who had a negative initial attitude toward black people, with no significant effects found for those who had positive initial attitudes toward black people.

The aim of this review is to give an insight into the state of the art of the use of VR as an assessment tool and treatment intervention in anxiety and related disorders as posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive–compulsive disorders. Besides an overview into the efficacy of VR, a summary will be given on assumed working mechanisms in virtual reality exposure therapy and how this aligns with current theoretical models. Further, it will be discussed how VR is accepted by patients and research into the reluctance of therapist to use this technology during treatment with focus on the therapeutic alliance and how it may be influenced by the use of VR. Finally, we discuss clinical and future issues as, for example, dissemination into clinical practice and what VR has to offer therapists in future. This not only in adult population but as well in younger patients, as young adolescents VR has a great potential as it connects easily with its playful elements to this population and might be a low threshold step to offer treatment or preventive interventions.","[{'authorId': '4257503', 'name': 'K.

Previous research has suggested that missing out on emotional experiences may affect mental health and impact cognitive abilities. In recent years, there has been growing research interest in designing non-pharmacological interventions to improve the health-related quality of life of older adults. With virtual reality offering endless opportunities for health support, we must consider how virtual reality can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching out-world experiences to older adults to enhance their emotional regulation. Thirty older adults living with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia participated in the study. Affect and emotional behavior were measured. The usability and the sense of presence were also assessed. Finally, we assessed the virtual reality experiences based on physiological responses and eye-tracking data. The results indicated that virtual reality can positively enhance the mental health of this population by eliciting a positive affective state and enhancing their emotional regulation. Overall, this paper raises awareness of the role of virtual reality in emotion elicitation, regulation, and expression and enhances our understanding of the use of virtual reality by older adults living with mild cognitive impairments or mild dementia.","[{'authorId': '25238328', 'name': 'M.

Until recently there was little direct knowledge of brain mechanisms governing generation and control of EDA in humans. However, studies of patients with discrete brain lesions and, more recently, functional imaging techniques have clarified the contribution of brain regions implicated in emotion, attention, and cognition to peripheral EDA responses.

These deficits have been previously linked to problems with social cognition. However, we reasoned that AS/HFA individuals' Theory of Mind deficits also might lead to problems with emotion regulation. To assess emotional functioning in AS/HFA, 27 AS/HFA adults (16 women) and 27 age-, gender-, and education-matched typically developing (TD) participants completed a battery of measures of emotion experience, labeling, and regulation. With respect to emotion experience, individuals with AS/HFA reported higher levels of negative emotions, but similar levels of positive emotions, compared with TD individuals. With respect to emotion labeling, individuals with AS/HFA had greater difficulties identifying and describing their emotions, with approximately two-thirds exceeding the cutoff for alexithymia. With respect to emotion regulation, individuals with AS/HFA used reappraisal less frequently than TD individuals and reported lower levels of reappraisal self-efficacy. Although AS/HFA individuals used suppression more frequently than TD individuals, no difference in suppression self-efficacy was found. It is important to note that these differences in emotion regulation were evident even when controlling for emotion experience and labeling. Implications of these deficits are discussed, and future research directions are proposed.","[{'authorId': '38707445', 'name': 'Andrea C. Samson'}, {'authorId': '48474585', 'name': 'O.

Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism--the mirror-neuron mechanism--that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation.

To be up-to-date, the concept of learning must be understood in the same broad sense, and therefore traditional learning theories must be revised. The theory presented is based on two fundamental assumptions. Firstly, that all learning includes two essentially different types of process, namely an external interaction process between the learner and his or her social, cultural and material environment, and an internal psychological process of acquisition and elaboration in which new impulses are connected with the results of prior learning. Secondly, that all learning includes three dimensions, namely, the cognitive dimension of knowledge and skills, the emotional dimension of feelings and motivation, and the social dimension of communication and co-operation—all of which are embedded in a societally situated context. In addition, the approach specifies four levels of learning and deals with what happens when intended learning does not occur. Inside this framework existing learning theories deal with different aspects. Thus the new theory has been constructed as a sort of umbrella, offering an overview and a structure of the landscape of learning which can be applied in both analysing and planning learning processes, both inside and outside of the educational system. The development of the theory is described in detail in my book, The Three Dimensions of Learning, which has been a bestseller in the Scandinavian countries since 1999, and which has now been published in English (Illeris 2002).","[{'authorId': '66007585', 'name': 'K.

ff3ac9352702bdf355511edaa1e633273d448dba,"Virtual reality (VR) has made its way into mainstream psychological research in the last two decades. This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user’s sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR. Gaps in the current literature and future directions are outlined.","[{'authorId': '1760586', 'name': 'J. Diemer'}, {'authorId': '2711307', 'name': 'G.

Emotional distracters can be particularly disruptive to goal-oriented behavior, but the neural systems through which these detrimental effects are mediated are not known. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effect of emotional and nonemotional distracters on a delayed-response working memory (WM) task. As expected, this task evoked robust activity during the delay period in typical WM regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex). Presentation of emotional distracters during the delay interval evoked strong activity in typical emotional processing regions (amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) while simultaneously evoking relative deactivation of the WM regions and impairing WM performance. These results provide the first direct evidence that the detrimental effect of emotional distracters on ongoing cognitive processes entails the interaction between a dorsal neural system associated with “cold” executive processing and a ventral system associated with “hot” emotional processing.","[{'authorId': '2600862', 'name': 'F.

A traditional music piece was arranged into versions at two pitches, two tempos, and two volumes. For each session, chocolate and bell peppers were presented for consumption under three sound conditions: 1) upper or 2) lower level with respect to each of the three music elements, and 3) silence. Over three sessions, participants evaluated flavor intensity, pleasantness of flavor, texture impression, and overall impression of food samples, in addition to the pleasantness and stimulation evoked by the music stimuli. Results showed that lower-pitched and louder music stimuli increased hedonic impressions of foods compared to their respective counterparts and/or the silent condition. While the effects of music element levels on hedonic impressions differed with the type of food consumed, the participants liked the foods more when music stimuli were perceived as more pleasant and stimulating. Flavor was perceived as more intense when participants were more stimulated by the music samples. Although a specific element of music stimuli was manipulated, perceptions of other elements also varied, leading to large variations in the music-evoked pleasantness and stimulation. In conclusion, the findings provide empirical evidence that hedonic impressions of foods may be influenced by emotions evoked by music selections varying in music element levels, but it should be also noted that the influences were food-dependent and not pronounced.","[{'authorId': '3703184', 'name': 'A.

In one condition, participants passively viewed the pictures, in the other, they performed an active picture categorization task. The processing of erotic compared to romantic images was associated with a decrease in power in the alpha and lower beta band in posterior and anterior sensor clusters between 600-1,000 ms poststimulus. The finding was robust and confirmed across conditions, different quantifications, and independent from baseline activity. Furthermore, key findings regarding explicit task effects as well as ERPs sensitive to emotional arousal were replicated.

The authors mentioned that they did not agree with my notion of immersion: ‘Though the VE equipment is instrumental in enabling immersion, we do not agree with Slater’s view that immersion is an objective description of the VE technology’. On first reading I was happy to take this as simply a difference of terminology which is what it is. I had defined the term immersion to mean the extent to which the actual system delivers a surrounding environment, one which shuts out sensations from the ‘real world’, which accommodates many sensory modalities, has rich representational capability, and so on (described, for example, in Slater & Wilbur, 1997). These are obviously measurable aspects of a VE system. For example, given two VE systems, and other things being equal, if one allows the participant to turn their head in any direction at all and still receive visual information only from within the VE then this is called (in my definition) a more ‘immersive’ system than one where the participant can only see VE visual signals along one fixed direction. Given two systems, if one has a larger field of view than the other, then the first is (in my definition) more immersive than the second. As a last example, if one generates shadows in realtime and the other does not, then again, the first is called (by me) more immersive. These are examples of what I mean by more or less ‘immersion’. Clearly for all of these types of things metrics can be established which are descriptions of the system, and not descriptions of people’s responses to the system. Witmer and Singer, however, define immersion as the person’s response to the VE system. This difference in terminology is unfortunate, but not a matter of any great concern.

Findings revealed that all smiling participants, regardless of whether they were aware of smiling, had lower heart rates during stress recovery than the neutral group did, with a slight advantage for those with Duchenne smiles. Participants in the smiling groups who were not explicitly asked to smile reported less of a decrease in positive affect during a stressful task than did the neutral group. These findings show that there are both physiological and psychological benefits from maintaining positive facial expressions during stress.","[{'authorId': '31022389', 'name': 'Tara L.
