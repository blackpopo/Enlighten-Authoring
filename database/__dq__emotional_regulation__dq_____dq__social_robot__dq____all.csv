This study examined the reading achievement growth of children with language impairments (LI) across the school grades. The authors sought to determine whether children with LI demonstrate a delayed, deficit, or cumulative pattern of reading achievement growth when compared with children with typical language (TL).


METHOD
A group of 225 children with LI and a group of 379 children with TL were identified in kindergarten and were administered multiple measures of word recognition and reading comprehension in 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 10th grades.


RESULTS
Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the constructs of word recognition and reading comprehension were invariant across grades and groups of children with LI and TL. Further analyses indicated that a multiple group latent growth curve analysis was appropriate. This analysis showed that children with LI differed significantly from children with TL in initial level (2nd grade) of word recognition and reading comprehension, but they did not differ significantly in the shape of their growth trajectories.


CONCLUSION
These results are consistent with a deficit model of reading growth in children with LI. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for early identification.","[{'authorId': '5209842', 'name': 'H. Catts'}, {'authorId': '39874208', 'name': 'M.

To answer this question, this study examined whether the skin temperature of a social robot affected users' perceptions of the robot during physical interaction. Results from a between-subjects experiment (warm, intermediate, cool, or no interaction) with a dinosaur robot demonstrated that skin temperature significantly affects users' perceptions and evaluations of a socially interactive robot. Additionally, this study found that social presence had partial mediating effects on several dependent variables. Important implications and limitations for improving human–robot interactions are discussed here.","[{'authorId': '35399006', 'name': 'Eunil Park'}, {'authorId': '77537854', 'name': 'Jaeryoung Lee'}]",41.0,,43.0,I am a warm robot: the effects of temperature in physical human–robot interaction,2013.0

Danach wurde dieser Ansatz im Rahmen eines in Sudafrika durchgefuhrten Workshops weiterentwickelt mit dem Ziel, den Erfahrungen HIV-positiver Menschen zum Ausdruck zu verhelfen, der Stigmatisierung entgegenzuwirken und die Forderung nach der Bereitstellung anti-retroviraler Medikamente zu unterstutzen. Bei einer Ganzkorper-Kartografie werden die Korperumrisse einer Person nachgezogen, um einen lebensgrosen Umriss zu generieren, der innerhalb eines kreativen und reflexiven Prozesses gefullt wird, sodass ein Bild entsteht, das die multiplen Aspekte verkorperlichter Erfahrung reprasentieren soll. Es handelt sich bei Korper-Kartografien um eine qualitative, genauer im Bereich partizipativer Ansatze angesiedelte Methodik, deren Aufgabe es ist, Wissen zu generieren und zu distribuieren. Es bestehen aber nach wie vor Unsicherheiten, wie, von wem und in welchem Kontext die Methode zu nutzen ist.

Although little variation was observed for the R&T/Chase category, sociometrically defined average and rejected boys, compared to popular boys, spent a significant portion of their time in R&T/Rough. This latter form of R&T was, in turn, related to aggression and perspective-taking status for rejected boys; it was related to dominance status for all boys. Additionally, rejected and average boys chose to engage in R&T/Rough with children who were less dominant than they. R&T/Chase was not reliably correlated with other measures. These findings are interpreted as supporting the claim that some children exploit play bouts for their own dominance-exhibition ends.","[{'authorId': '8036452', 'name': 'A.

Six groups of 8 workers were recruited from different areas of the Province of Québec. The workers were males; they had hearing threshold levels equal to or higher than 30 dB averaged over 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz in at least one ear. The recruitment was conducted by occupational health nurses of local community health centers. The workers were invited to a group meeting with their spouses by means of a home interview. Three groups met during 2-hour weekly evening sessions, and three groups during a 1.5-day weekend session. A follow-up was conducted over a period of 3 months ending with an evaluation meeting. Results based on responses to a handicap questionnaire showed that the workers judged their hearing problem as being significantly less severe after their participation in the session. Group interviews showed that, although they were more conscious of their hearing difficulties, they agreed on being much more confident in dealing with them. Different steps were taken towards improving their situation, including disclosure of their hearing impairment to others, making requests to conversational partners to facilitate communication, and acquiring instrumental aids.","[{'authorId': '6216520', 'name': 'Louise Getty'}, {'authorId': '5488170', 'name': 'R.

In this paper, we focus on an underestimated key element related to the crisis/rupture of this meaning-making process with respect to the time perspective. We consider 40 narratives of breast cancer patients at different times of treatment, undergoing chemotherapy and biological therapy. We collected data through writing technique. We performed an interpretative thematic analysis of the data and highlighted specific ways to signify time during the different treatment phases. Our central aspect “the time of illness, the illness of time” demonstrates that the time consumed by illness has the risk of becoming an illness of time, which transcends the end of the illness and absorbs a patient’s past, present, and future, thus saturating all space for thought and meaning. The study suggests that narrative can become a therapeutic and preventive tool for women with breast cancer in a crisis of temporality, and enable the promotion of new semiotic connections and a specific functional resynchronization with the continuity/discontinuity of life. This is useful during the illness and medical treatment and also after the treatment.","[{'authorId': '27805415', 'name': 'M. L. Martino'}, {'authorId': '4774039', 'name': 'M.

 Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) search is a practical technique for playing imperfect information games that are too large to be optimally solved. Although PIMC search has been criticized in the past for its theoretical deficiencies, in practice it has often produced strong results in a variety of domains. In this paper, we set out to resolve this discrepancy. The contributions of the paper are twofold. First, we use synthetic game trees to identify game properties that result in strong or weak performance for PIMC search as compared to an optimal player. Second, we show how these properties can be detected in real games, and demonstrate that they do indeed appear to be good predictors of the strength of PIMC search. Thus, using the tools established in this paper, it should be possible to decide a priori whether PIMC search will be an effective approach to new and unexplored games.

Methods: Four literature databases were searched and data extracted from relevant papers. Results: Eighteen thousand five papers were found and 22 included in the review. The psychological impact of SARS on employees appeared to be associated with occupational role; training/preparedness; high-risk work environments; quarantine; role-related stressors; perceived risk; social support; social rejection/isolation; and impact of SARS on personal or professional life. Conclusions: To minimize the psychological impact of future outbreaks of infectious diseases, healthcare workers should be prepared for the potential psychological impact; employers should encourage a supportive environment in the workplace and ensure that support is in place for those most at risk, for example, those with the most patient contact.","[{'authorId': '6978354', 'name': 'S.

0142c425e17ab9a53e950560823f13619b31b18e,"This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low prob- abilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling. EXPECTED UTILITY THEORY has dominated the analysis of decision making under risk. It has been generally accepted as a normative model of rational choice (24), and widely applied as a descriptive model of economic behavior, e.g. (15, 4). Thus, it is assumed that all reasonable people would wish to obey the axioms of the theory (47, 36), and that most people actually do, most of the time. The present paper describes several classes of choice problems in which preferences systematically violate the axioms of expected utility theory. In the light of these observations we argue that utility theory, as it is commonly interpreted and applied, is not an adequate descriptive model and we propose an alternative account of choice under risk. 2.

The supply of child and adolescent psychiatrists is insufficient for the number of children in need of services and is not anticipated to grow. This calls for novel approaches to mental health care. Telemental health (TMH) offers one approach to increase access. TMH programmes serving young people are developing rapidly and available studies demonstrate that these services are feasible, acceptable, sustainable and likely as effective as in-person services. TMH services are utilized in clinical settings to provide direct care and consultation to primary care providers (PCPs), as well as in non-traditional settings, such as schools, correctional facilities and the home. Delivery of services to young people through TMH requires several adjustments to practice with adults regarding the model of care, cultural values, participating adults, rapport-building, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Additional infrastructure accommodations at the patient site include space and staffing to conduct developmentally appropriate evaluations and treatment planning with parents, other providers, and community services. For TMH to optimally impact young people’s access to mental health care, collaborative models of care are needed to support PCPs as frontline mental health-care providers, thereby effectively expanding the child and adolescent mental health workforce.","[{'authorId': '7757965', 'name': 'Nicole Gloff'}, {'authorId': '6995270', 'name': 'Sean R LeNoue'}, {'authorId': '4857034', 'name': 'D.

We proposed and carried out an experiment with 20 subjects to collect the EEG and eye tracking data to study their reaction to different robot designs and the corresponding preference towards these designs. This study can possibly give us some insights on how people react to the aesthetic designs of different humanoid robot models and the important traits in a humanoid robot design, such as the perceived smartness and friendliness of the robots. Another point of interest is to investigate the most prominent feature of the robot, such as the head, facial features and the chest. The result shows that the head and facial features are the focus. It is also discovered that more attention is paid to the robots that appear to be more appealing.

01896a4b9dd569eb499b04906dd374e3e7812f8f,"Background: Cemeteries workers are deserving of attention because they are exposed to various psychosocial risks: these workers are subject to painful contacts and daily exposed to a work content linked to death experiences and the emotions associated with them. Secondary trauma develops from this continuous contact with others’ suffering; operators working with this type of traumatic content and dynamic could suffer from emotional disorders (Figley, 1995). Therefore, the secondary traumatic stress (STS) is seen as an occupational risk factor (Bride et al., 2004) and cemetery workers are subject to this risk. Studies on this topic have focused on the operators of emergencies, social, and health sectors; little attention has been given to cemetery workers. Aim: The present study considers the relations between the dimensions composing the STS and the psychological and physical symptoms, the perception of exhaustion, and the positive and negative emotions at work in a group of cemetery workers. Moreover, differences among occupational tasks are explored considering the different possibilities of contact with clients and trauma contagion. Methods: The study included a qualitative phase (interviews and focus groups) and subsequently a quantitative phase (self-report questionnaire) and involved 114 participants in a cemetery organization in northern Italy, divided into technicians employees (TE), technicians and specialists of decoration and garden (TS), gravediggers (GR) administrative and front office employees (AFO). Levels of secondary trauma and psychophysical symptoms were assessed, and correlations were calculated in the total sample and for the different job categories of employees. Results: AFO and TS showed the highest levels of STS and psychophysical symptoms, in particular for symptoms related to anxiety, sadness, insomnia, and gastric and musculoskeletal disorders. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of considering the STS among also this category of workers, since they are exposed daily not only with death, but also with suffering people; grief and emotional skills are important to cope with these job characteristics cemetery workers are not trained on this. It is important to monitor symptomatic levels not only to avoid chronicity, but also to provide employees with psychological support and training about secondary trauma and its consequences.","[{'authorId': '143752951', 'name': 'Lara Colombo'}, {'authorId': '4514963', 'name': 'Federica Emanuel'}, {'authorId': '37504585', 'name': 'M.

Our goal in this study was to use an online Delphi technique to see whether it was possible to achieve consensus among professionals on appropriate criteria for identifying children who might benefit from specialist services. We recruited a panel of 59 experts representing ten disciplines (including education, psychology, speech-language therapy/pathology, paediatrics and child psychiatry) from English-speaking countries (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, United Kingdom and USA). The starting point for round 1 was a set of 46 statements based on articles and commentaries in a special issue of a journal focusing on this topic. Panel members rated each statement for both relevance and validity on a seven-point scale, and added free text comments. These responses were synthesised by the first two authors, who then removed, combined or modified items with a view to improving consensus. The resulting set of statements was returned to the panel for a second evaluation (round 2). Consensus (percentage reporting 'agree' or 'strongly agree') was at least 80 percent for 24 of 27 round 2 statements, though many respondents qualified their response with written comments. These were again synthesised by the first two authors. The resulting consensus statement is reported here, with additional summary of relevant evidence, and a concluding commentary on residual disagreements and gaps in the evidence base.","[{'authorId': '144343047', 'name': 'D.

We compared the performance of a group of English-speaking children with G-SLI (mean age: 12;11) with that of two groups of younger typically developing (TD) children, matched on grammar and receptive vocabulary, respectively. All groups were more accurate on subject-extracted relative clauses than object-extracted ones and, crucially, they all showed greater accuracy for sentences with dissimilar number features (i.e., one singular, one plural) on the head noun and the embedded DP.

First, we articulate theoretical and conceptual reasons for the confusion on important issues, such as their conceptualization, labeling, and measurement. Second, we conduct a meta-analysis between current CWB and withdrawal measures. We found that, as measured, CWB and withdrawal are strongly related and have patterns of nomological relationships with common correlates that are nearly identical. The relationship between organizational-target CWB and withdrawal is particularly strong. The results suggest that withdrawal may be best represented as a facet in the hierarchical model of CWB, perhaps even as a facet of organizational-target CWB.

This study investigated how school resources, being schools’ socioeconomic composition, proportion of girls, and proportion of highly educated teachers, and school practices, being schools’ application of well-rounded assessment methods, influenced girls’ and boys’ reading performance differently. We hypothesised that positive effects of school resources would be greater for boys than for girls, and that more frequent use of well-rounded assessment methods would be associated with increased girls’ and decreased boys’ reading performance. Using advanced multilevel analyses of 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data, we found that boys profited more than girls from having a large proportion of girls in school. Contrary to our expectations, girls gained more than boys from a school’s advantaged socioeconomic composition. These gendered effects of school resources were not explained by differences in school learning climate.","[{'authorId': '1396462935', 'name': 'Margriet van Hek'}, {'authorId': '4976187', 'name': 'G.

0255e14dc724372bd4e91eff7e4b159f452719ef,"Although multiple neuroimaging studies suggest that affect labeling (i.e., putting feelings into words) can dampen affect-related responses in the amygdala, the consequences of affect labeling have not been examined in other channels of emotional responding. We conducted four studies examining the effect of affect labeling on self-reported emotional experience. In study one, self-reported distress was lower during affect labeling, compared to passive watching, of negative emotional pictures. Studies two and three added reappraisal and distraction conditions, respectively. Affect labeling showed similar effects on self-reported distress as both of these intentional emotion regulation strategies. In each of the first three studies, however, participant predictions about the effects of affect labeling suggest that unlike reappraisal and distraction, people do not believe affect labeling to be an effective emotion regulation strategy. Even after having the experience of affect labels leading to lower distress, participants still predicted that affect labeling would increase distress in the future. Thus, affect labeling is best described as an incidental emotion regulation process. Finally, study four employed positive emotional pictures and here, affect labeling was associated with diminished self-reported pleasure, relative to passive watching. This suggests that affect labeling tends to dampen affective responses in general, rather than specifically alleviating negative affect.","[{'authorId': '1920154', 'name': 'Matthew D.

Results of multiple regression analyses showed that youths’ perceptions of both maternal and paternal acceptance made independent and significant contributions to variations in youths’ self-reported psychological adjustment. Regression analyses also showed that neither maternal nor paternal punishment by themselves made significant contributions to variations in youths’ adjustment when the influence of perceived maternal and paternal acceptance was controlled.

To do this, the associate must research and analyze the capabilities of the client's competitors. Because all the firms in the client's industry were privately held, very little information on its competitors existed in the public realm. Normal policy at the associate's consulting firm was to call the competitors and, in the course of a conversation, try to get them to reveal competitive intelligence on market positioning, revenue numbers, and profitability ratios. The consulting firm's ethics policy encouraged the associate to reveal his identity and his employer. After hours on the phone, the associate finally reached a marketing manager at one of the client's competitors. As per the firm's policy, the associate revealed his name and the name of his firm. The marketing manager willingly engaged in a conversation about his company and revealed some information that would be valuable to the client. The marketing manager had no idea that this information would be going to one of his competitors (the consulting firm's client). The associate never lied about his identity; he simply did not reveal who his client was because the marketing manager did not ask. . . .","[{'authorId': '1741071347', 'name': 'R.

These studies are guided by the Dynamics of Paternal Influences on Children over the Life Course Model that stipulates the important contribution of parent characteristics, child and context to parenting and children's outcomes. Specifically, three research questions are addressed: (1) How do resident fathers engage with their young children at 24, 36, and 64 months (pre-K)? (2) How do fathers' human and financial resources and depressive symptoms, partner relationship quality and mother–child interactions, and children's characteristics predict the quality of fathers' engagements with their young children? And (3) how do fathers' engagements affect their young children's cognitive, language, and social and emotional outcomes across the three age groups? Educated fathers and fathers whose partners have supportive relationships with their children are more supportive and less intrusive. In contrast to mothers, fathers' supportiveness matters for children's language, cognitive, and language development across ages and emotional regulation at 24 months. On the other hand, maternal intrusiveness is negatively associated with emotional regulation at 24 and pre-K and language development at pre-K. Father intrusiveness had a small negative effect on language development only at pre-K and no effect at all on social emotional regulation. These findings suggest that programs that aim at increasing fathers' education and that promote and encourage fathers' positive parenting will yield large benefits for children.","[{'authorId': '40066280', 'name': 'Natasha J.

This new robot is used in psychomotor therapies for children with Down syndrome (contributing to improve their proprioception, postural balance, and gait) as well as in psychosocial and cognitive therapies for children with autism spectrum disorder. The robot uses, as a novelty, an embedded mini-video projector able to project Serious Games on the floor or tables to make already-established therapies funnier to these children, thus creating a motivating and facilitating effect for both children and therapists. The Serious Games were developed in Python through the library Pygame, considering theoretical bases of behavioral psychology for these children, which are integrated into the robot through the robot operating system (ROS). Encouraging results from the child–robot interaction are shown, according to outcomes obtained from the application of the Goal Attainment Scale. Regarding the Serious Games, they were considered suitable based on both the “Guidelines for Game Design of Serious Games for Children” and the “Evaluation of the Psychological Bases” used during the games’ development. Thus, this pilot study seeks to demonstrate that the use of a robot as a therapeutic tool together with the concept of Serious Games is an innovative and promising tool to help health professionals in conducting therapies with children with autistic spectrum disorder and Down syndrome. Due to health issues imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the sample of children was limited to eight children (one child with typical development, one with Trisomy 21, both female, and six children with ASD, one girl and five boys), from 4 to 9 years of age. For the non-typically developing children, the inclusion criterion was the existence of a conclusive diagnosis and fulfillment of at least 1 year of therapy. The protocol was carried out in an infant psychotherapy room with three video cameras, supervised by a group of researchers and a therapist. The experiments were separated into four steps: The first stage was composed of a robot introduction followed by an approximation between robot and child to establish eye contact and assess proxemics and interaction between child/robot. In the second stage, the robot projected Serious Games on the floor, and emitted verbal commands, seeking to evaluate the child’s susceptibility to perform the proposed tasks. In the third stage, the games were performed for a certain time, with the robot sending messages of positive reinforcement to encourage the child to accomplish the game. Finally, in the fourth stage, the robot finished the games and said goodbye to the child, using messages aiming to build a closer relationship with the child.","[{'authorId': '2146121492', 'name': 'João Antonio Campos Panceri'}, {'authorId': '2146124489', 'name': 'É.

036bbcde14c293c65e57d0eebd5adc6a625c22d9,"Background In February 2020, the Chinese government imposed a complete lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province to contain a spike of COVID-19 cases. Although such measures are effective in preventing the spread of the virus, medical professionals strongly voiced a caveat concerning the pandemic emotional burnout at the individual level. Although the lockdown limited individuals’ interpersonal communication with people in their social networks, it is common that individuals turn to social media to seek and share health information, exchange social support, and express pandemic-generated feelings. Objective Based on a holistic and multilevel perspective, this study examines how pandemic-related emotional exhaustion enacts intrapersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal emotional regulation strategies, and then evaluates the effectiveness of these strategies, with a particular interest in understanding the role of hyperpersonal-level regulation or social media–based regulation. Methods Using an online panel, this study sampled 538 Chinese internet users from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Survey data collection lasted for 12 days from February 7-18, 2020, two weeks after Hubei Province was placed under quarantine. The sample had an average age of 35 (SD 10.65, range 18-78) years, and a majority were married (n=369, 68.6%). Results Using structural equation modeling, this study found that intrapersonal-level (B=0.22; β=.24; P<.001) and interpersonal-level (B=0.35; β=.49; P<.001) emotional regulation strategies were positively associated with individuals’ outcome reappraisal. In contrast with intrapersonal and interpersonal regulations, hyperpersonal (social media–based) regulation strategies, such as disclosing and retweeting negative emotions, were negatively related to the outcome reappraisal (B=–1.00; β=–.80; P<.001). Conclusions Consistent with previous literature, intrapersonal-level regulation (eg, cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness, and self-kindness) and interpersonal-level supportive interaction may generate a buffering effect on emotional exhaustion and promote individuals’ reappraisal toward the stressful situation. However, hyperpersonal-level regulation may exacerbate the experienced negative emotions and impede reappraisal of the pandemic situation. It is speculated that retweeting content that contains pandemic-related stress and anxiety may cause a digital emotion contagion. Individuals who share other people’s negative emotional expressions on social media are likely to be affected by the negative affect contagion. More importantly, the possible benefits of intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulations may be counteracted by social media or hyperpersonal regulation. This suggests the necessity to conduct social media–based health communication interventions to mitigate the social media–wide negative affect contagion if lockdown policies related to highly infectious diseases are initiated.","[{'authorId': '116289410', 'name': 'Ruosi Shao'}, {'authorId': '2046734251', 'name': 'Zhen Shi'}, {'authorId': '2141081792', 'name': 'Di Zhang'}]",17.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research', 'volume': '23'}",67.0,Social Media and Emotional Burnout Regulation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multilevel Approach,2021.0
037d2de7a5b9b2eff680f2622afedd149e745cb3,"People respond to stressful events in different ways, depending on the event and on the regulatory strategies they choose. Coping and emotion regulation theorists have proposed dynamic models in which these two factors, the person and the situation, interact over time to inform adaptation. In practice, however, researchers have tended to assume that particular regulatory strategies are consistently beneficial or maladaptive. We label this assumption the fallacy of uniform efficacy and contrast it with findings from a number of related literatures that have suggested the emergence of a broader but as yet poorly defined construct that we refer to as regulatory flexibility. In this review, we articulate this broader construct and define both its features and limitations. Specifically, we propose a heuristic individual differences framework and review research on three sequential components of flexibility for which propensities and abilities vary: sensitivity to context, availability of a diverse repertoire of regulatory strategies, and responsiveness to feedback. We consider the methodological limitations of research on each component, review questions that future research on flexibility might address, and consider how the components might relate to each other and to broader conceptualizations about stability and change across persons and situations.","[{'authorId': '5188130', 'name': 'G.

03859191c2a717d554803847f13ce58074dc0927,"What would a comprehensive atlas of human emotions include? For 50 years, scientists have sought to map emotion-related experience, expression, physiology, and recognition in terms of the “basic six”—anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Claims about the relationships between these six emotions and prototypical facial configurations have provided the basis for a long-standing debate over the diagnostic value of expression (for review and latest installment in this debate, see Barrett et al., p. 1). Building on recent empirical findings and methodologies, we offer an alternative conceptual and methodological approach that reveals a richer taxonomy of emotion. Dozens of distinct varieties of emotion are reliably distinguished by language, evoked in distinct circumstances, and perceived in distinct expressions of the face, body, and voice. Traditional models—both the basic six and affective-circumplex model (valence and arousal)—capture a fraction of the systematic variability in emotional response. In contrast, emotion-related responses (e.g., the smile of embarrassment, triumphant postures, sympathetic vocalizations, blends of distinct expressions) can be explained by richer models of emotion. Given these developments, we discuss why tests of a basic-six model of emotion are not tests of the diagnostic value of facial expression more generally. Determining the full extent of what facial expressions can tell us, marginally and in conjunction with other behavioral and contextual cues, will require mapping the high-dimensional, continuous space of facial, bodily, and vocal signals onto richly multifaceted experiences using large-scale statistical modeling and machine-learning methods.","[{'authorId': '49531494', 'name': 'Alan S.

In this article, we present a model of thriving through relationships to provide a theoretical foundation for identifying the specific interpersonal processes that underlie the effects of close relationships on thriving. This model highlights two life contexts through which people may potentially thrive (coping successfully with life’s adversities and actively pursuing life opportunities for growth and development), it proposes two relational support functions that are fundamental to the experience of thriving in each life context, and it identifies mediators through which relational support is likely to have long-term effects on thriving. This perspective highlights the need for researchers to take a new look at social support by conceptualizing it as an interpersonal process with a focus on thriving.","[{'authorId': '5146695', 'name': 'B.

Behavioral regulation was assessed using a direct measure called the Head-to-Toes Task, which taps inhibitory control, attention, and working memory, and requires children to perform the opposite of what is instructed verbally. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was utilized because children were nested in 54 classrooms at 2 geographical sites. Results revealed that behavioral regulation significantly and positively predicted fall and spring emergent literacy, vocabulary, and math skills on the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement (all ps<.05). Moreover, growth in behavioral regulation predicted growth in emergent literacy, vocabulary, and math skills over the prekindergarten year (all ps<.05), after controlling for site, child gender, and other background variables.

04292e3c307ad57462d334b52bbfaba5616d2a84,"Researchers recently have suggested that coping flexibility (i.e., an individual’s ability to modify and change coping strategies depending on the context) may be an important way to investigate coping. The availability of numerous coping strategies may be an important precursor to coping flexibility, given that flexibility can only be obtained if an individual is able to access and use different coping strategies. Typically, studies examining the use of coping strategies compute means-based analyses, which assess not only what strategies are used but also how much they are used. Thus, there is limited ability to differentiate between individuals who use a lot of strategies infrequently, and individuals who use only one or two strategies a lot. One way to address this confound is to count the number of strategies that an individual uses without attention to how frequently they use them (i.e., a count-based approach). The present longitudinal study compares a count-based model and a means-based model of coping and adjustment among undergraduates (N = 1132). An autoregressive cross-lagged path analysis revealed that for the count-based approach, using a greater number of positive coping strategies led to more positive adjustment and less suicide ideation over time than using a smaller number of positive coping strategies. Further, engagement in a greater number of negative coping strategies predicted more depressive symptoms and poorer emotion regulation over time. In comparison, the means-based model revealed identical results for negative coping strategies; however, engagement in more frequent positive coping strategies did not predict better positive adjustment over time. Thus, a count-based approach offers a novel way to examine how the number of coping strategies that individuals use can help promote adjustment among university students.","[{'authorId': '5806641', 'name': 'T.

044dcf1893e9a14bd783619fa6a53447f749edb8,"Background. The COVID-19 lockdown could engender disruption to lifestyle behaviors, thus impairing mental wellbeing in the general population. This study investigated whether sociodemographic variables, changes in physical activity, and sleep quality from pre- to during lockdown were predictors of change in mental wellbeing in quarantined older adults. Methods. A 12-week international online survey was launched in 14 languages on 6 April 2020. Forty-one research institutions from Europe, Western-Asia, North-Africa, and the Americas, promoted the survey. The survey was presented in a differential format with questions related to responses “pre” and “during” the lockdown period. Participants responded to the Short Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results. Replies from older adults (aged >55 years, n = 517), mainly from Europe (50.1%), Western-Asia (6.8%), America (30%), and North-Africa (9.3%) were analyzed. The COVID-19 lockdown led to significantly decreased mental wellbeing, sleep quality, and total physical activity energy expenditure levels (all p < 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the change in total PSQI score and total physical activity energy expenditure (F(2, 514) = 66.41 p < 0.001) were significant predictors of the decrease in mental wellbeing from pre- to during lockdown (p < 0.001, R2: 0.20). Conclusion. COVID-19 lockdown deleteriously affected physical activity and sleep patterns. Furthermore, change in the total PSQI score and total physical activity energy expenditure were significant predictors for the decrease in mental wellbeing.","[{'authorId': '47523173', 'name': 'K.

Although there are theoretical and conceptual treatments of othering in the literature, researchers lack sufficient examples of othering practices that influence the interactions between patients and health care providers. The purpose of this study was to explore the interactions between health care providers and South Asian immigrant women to describe othering practices and their effects. Ethnographic methods were used involving in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The analysis entailed identifying uses of othering and exploring the dynamics through which this process took place. Women shared stories of how discriminatory treatment was experienced. The interviews with health care professionals provided examples of how views of South Asian women shaped the way health care services were provided. Three forms of othering were found in informants' descriptions of their problematic health care encounters: essentializing explanations, culturalist explanations, and racializing explanations. Women's stories illustrated ways of coping and managing othering experiences. The analysis also revealed how individual interactions are influenced by the social and institutional contexts that create conditions for othering practices. To foster safe and effective health care interactions, those in power must continue to unmask othering practices and transform health care environments to support truly equitable health care.","[{'authorId': '144412515', 'name': 'Joy L.

This study sought to review the literature on SAR intervention for reducing pediatric distress and pain in medical settings. Methods: Databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Web of Science, Engineering Village, Scopus, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore) were searched from database inception to January 2018 with the aid of a medical librarian. Included studies examined any SAR intervention for reducing pain or improving emotional well-being in children related to physical or psychiatric care, with outcomes assessed by some quantitative measure. Study quality was assessed using the modified Downs and Black checklist (max. score, 28). The review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42016043018). Results: Eight studies met the eligibility criteria and represented 206 children. Of the 2 studies using Wong-Baker’s FACES scale, 1 study claimed to be effective at reducing pain (Cohen d=0.49 to 0.62), while the other appeared effective only when parents and child interacted with SAR together. Distress was evaluated using validated measures in 4 studies, 3 of which showed reduction in distress while one showed no difference. Satisfaction surveys from 4 studies showed that children were interested in using SAR again. Quality scores ranged from 8 to 26. Conclusions: There is limited evidence suggesting that SAR interventions may reduce distress and no clear evidence showing reduction in pain for children in medical settings. Engineers are conducting interventions using SAR in pediatric populations. Health care providers should be engaged in technology research related to children to facilitate testing and improve the effectiveness of these systems.","[{'authorId': '48086790', 'name': 'Margaret J Trost'}, {'authorId': '50843228', 'name': 'Adam R.

The participants were interviewed with the SUDST, the Ministry of Public Health Version 2 (normally ‘V.2’) screening test for risk of substance use, and were clinically diagnosed by their attending psychiatrist. Results: The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for SUDST was 0.79. The scores obtained from the SUDST were in high agreement with the V.2 and clinical diagnosis (p-value<0.001). Factor analysis showed three components of substance use disorder: 1) preoccupation and loss of control, 2) risky/harmful use, and 3) biopsychosocial aspects. Of the total possible score of 11, the cut-off points for identifying severe, moderate, and mild levels of risk were ≥7, 5-6, and 3-4, respectively, with sensitivity=72.7%-96.5% and specificity=61.9%-88.7%. Conclusion: The SUDST had high reliability and validity and could be used to detect patients at risk of substance use disorders.","[{'authorId': '1393737575', 'name': 'S.

To examine age and gender differences in children's perception of injury risk and to evaluate cognitive factors that relate to their appraisal of risk.


METHODS
The participants were 120 children (6 to 10 years of age), who used a series of photographs, which depicted play activities that varied from no to high risk, to appraise injury risk.


RESULTS
Children were able to distinguish varying degrees of injury risk. Boys rated risk as lower than girls, and 6-year-old children identified fewer risk factors and did so more slowly than 10-year-old children. For girls, perceived vulnerability to injury was the best predictor of injury risk ratings, whereas for boys it was judged severity of potential injury.


CONCLUSIONS
Children's appraisal of risk and age and gender differences in related factors highlight important components for injury prevention programs.","[{'authorId': '34586065', 'name': 'L.

In this paper, we present a thorough review of current technologies to detect human emotions. To this end, we explore the different sources from which emotions can be read, along with existing technologies developed to recognize them. We also explore some application domains in which this technology has been applied. This survey has let us identify the strengths and shortcomings of current technology for emotion detection.

The AMRM was formulated by adapting two popular conventional approaches, namely, model-rival method and label-training procedure. In our validation trials, we used a semi-autonomous parrot-inspired robot, called KiliRo, to simulate a set of autonomous behaviors. A proposed robot-assisted therapy using AMRM was pilot tested with nine children with autism spectrum disorder for five consecutive days in a clinical setting. We analyzed the facial expressions of children when they interacted with KiliRo using an automated emotion recognition and classification system, Oxford emotion API (Application Programming Interface). Results provided some indication that the children with autism spectrum disorder appeared attracted and happy to interact with the parrot-inspired robot. Short qualitative interviews with the children’s parents, the pediatrician, and the child psychologist who participated in this pilot study, also acknowledged that the proposed parrot-inspired robot and the AMRM may have some merit in aiding in improving learning and social interaction abilities of children with autism spectrum disorder.","[{'authorId': '3419480', 'name': 'Jaishankar Bharatharaj'}, {'authorId': '98206491', 'name': 'Loulin Huang'}, {'authorId': '1779417', 'name': 'R.

In class, Australian high school students (n = 2637, 12-18 years, 68% female) from 41 schools completed well-validated measures of adverse life experience, emotion regulation, rumination and psychological distress, and were followed up 1 year later (n = 1973, 75% retention rate). Adjusting for age, gender and baseline psychological distress, adverse life experience predicted psychological distress 1 year later. Expressive suppression and rumination were positively associated with psychological distress. Cognitive reappraisal was negatively associated with psychological distress and moderated the relationship between adverse life experience and psychological distress. This relationship was also partially mediated by cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression and rumination. Promoting cognitive reappraisal and minimizing expressive suppression and rumination may be useful strategies to improve mental health for adolescents who have experienced adverse life events. Future research should examine whether adolescents who have experienced adverse life events can be trained in effective emotion regulation strategies and whether this training can prevent development of psychological maladjustment.

This study examined the emotional health of adolescents with and without specific language impairment (SLI).


METHOD
One hundred and thirty-nine adolescents with a history of SLI (15;10 years) and a peer group of 124 adolescents with normal language development (NLD) (15;11 years) participated, who were in their final year of compulsory schooling. The risk of emotional difficulties was assessed using the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) and the Child Manifest Anxiety Scale-R (CMAS-R). Comprehensive language and cognition data were available for all participants (NLD and SLI) concurrently and also longitudinally for those with SLI.


RESULTS
A clear increased risk of emotional health symptoms was found for the SLI group on both self- and parental-report. Girls scored less favourably than boys when groups were combined, but these were due to the effect of the NLD group, with no gender differences found in the SLI group. Direct links with language and cognition were not obvious. Instead, more diffuse factors such as family history of emotional health difficulties may warrant further investigation.


CONCLUSION
There is a marked higher rate of anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents with SLI. However, these do not appear to be a direct result of impoverished communicative experiences.","[{'authorId': '1401137574', 'name': 'G. Conti-Ramsden'}, {'authorId': '15900975', 'name': 'N.

We evaluated a new eight‐session Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT)–informed skills group specifically adapted for individuals with psychosis: the Managing Emotions Group (MEG) in diverse, inner‐city community services. Method A mixed‐method design was utilised to assess the feasibility (acceptability and potential clinical impact) of local delivery of MEG. Uptake, completion (≥50% of sessions), post‐session satisfaction ratings, and thematic analysis of qualitative feedback from 12 completers assessed acceptability. Pre–post‐intervention changes in psychological distress, self‐reported ER difficulties, and adaptive ER skill use assessed potential clinical impact. Results Forty‐eight individuals (81% of attenders) completed the intervention (M age = 43, 54% female) of whom 39 completed pre‐ and post‐group measures. Participants reported high satisfaction and meaningful improvements in understanding and managing emotions, with positive impact on daily life. Self‐reported psychological distress, ER difficulties, and adaptive ER skill use significantly improved, with medium‐to‐large pre‐post effects (d = 0.5–0.7) except lack of emotional clarity (d = 0.3). Conclusions MEG was feasible and acceptable, and a future feasibility randomised controlled trial is warranted. Practitioner points Individuals with psychosis report that support with their emotions is a priority. Brief interventions for emotion regulation difficulties are acceptable to individuals with psychosis and can be feasibly delivered in a local outpatient service. Distress and emotion regulation difficulties and skills improved significantly from pre–post treatment for clients completing the managing emotions group. Further implementation and evaluation are needed to support continued refinement to meet the needs and priorities of individuals with psychosis.","[{'authorId': '39879361', 'name': 'C.

We hypothesized that the promotion focus inclination is to insure hits and insure against errors of omission, whereas the prevention focus inclination is to insure correct rejections and insure against errors of commission. This hypothesis yielded three predictions: (a) when individuals work on a difficult task or have just experienced failure, those in a promotion focus should perform better, and those in a prevention focus should quit more readily; (b) when individuals work on a task where generating any number of alternatives is correct, those in a promotion focus should generate more distinct alternatives, and those in a prevention focus should be more repetitive; and (c) when individuals work on a signal detection task that requires them to decide whether they did or did not detect a signal, those in a promotion focus should have a ""risky"" response bias, and those in a prevention focus should have a ""conservative"" response bias and take more time to respond.

Both relationships were mediated by surface acting at both levels of analysis.

Results revealed that participants in the mindfulness intervention group experienced significantly less emotional exhaustion and more job satisfaction than participants in the control group.

In this research, in order to examine different aspects of self-regulation and their similarities and differences in terms of their relations with other constructs, we focused on both effortful control and executive function and investigated their concurrent associations with socially competent and aggressive behaviours and theory of mind (ToM). The participants were 212 preschool children in Turkey. We assessed executive functions with behavioural measures and effortful control with mother reports. We used six tasks for comprehensive assessment of mental state understanding. Children's social competency and aggressive behaviour were assessed with teacher reports. Structural equation modelling results showed that when age and receptive language were controlled, ToM was significantly associated with social competence but not aggressive behaviour. Both effortful control and executive functions were significantly related to social competency and ToM; the pathways from each self-regulation skill were similar in strength. ToM was linked with social competence, but it did not have a mediating role in the relations of self-regulation with social competence. The findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation for socio-cognitive and social development in the preschool years.

Here, we investigated emotional prosody processing in individuals with ASD and controls with novel, lifelike behavioral and neuroimaging paradigms. Compared to controls, individuals with ASD showed reduced emotional prosody recognition accuracy on a behavioral task. On the neural level, individuals with ASD displayed reduced activity of the STS, insula and amygdala for complex vs basic emotions compared to controls. Moreover, the coupling between the STS and amygdala for complex vs basic emotions was reduced in the ASD group. Finally, groups differed with respect to the relationship between brain activity and behavioral performance. Brain activity during emotional prosody processing was more strongly related to prosody recognition accuracy in ASD participants. In contrast, the coupling between STS and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity predicted behavioral task performance more strongly in the control group. These results provide evidence for aberrant emotional prosody processing of individuals with ASD. They suggest that the differences in the relationship between the neural and behavioral level of individuals with ASD may account for their observed deficits in social communication.","[{'authorId': '6398865', 'name': 'Gabriela Rosenblau'}, {'authorId': '5899061', 'name': 'Dorit Kliemann'}, {'authorId': '9594622', 'name': 'I.

Socio-affective and -cognitive functions enable such representations via creating vicarious affective states in the observer (empathy) or by accumulating abstract, propositional knowledge of another person’s mental state (Theory of Mind). While the empathic sharing of another’s emotions is implemented by those neural networks that also process first-hand emotion, Theory of Mind activates a widespread network that seems to process information independent of its specific modality or content. Crucially, these two routes can function independently as individual differences in the respective capacities and network activations are unrelated and selective impairments in one or the other function occur in psychopathology. However, they may co-activate and co-operate in complex social situations, determining how prosocially interactive behaviour unfolds.","[{'authorId': '2197918', 'name': 'Philipp Kanske'}]",46.0,,73.0,The social mind: disentangling affective and cognitive routes to understanding others,2018.0

High achieving students displayed significantly greater use of 13 categories of self-regulated learning. The students’ membership in their respective achievement group was predicted with 93% accuracy using their reports of self-regulated learning.

The article also reviews research that examined the impact of the interaction between humans and robots with regard to robot appearance and behaviors, and situational factors, such as tasks and roles. Although the current state of research findings is complicated, it appears that even simple gendering of robots by manipulation of voice and name can affect humans’ feelings and behaviors toward robots. These effects vary and are dependent on other factors, including human gender. Future research should focus on gender stereotypes, cultural influences, and robotic applications in various fields. At the same time, we should consider if gendering of robots, for given roles, is really necessary to encourage interactions between humans and robots.","[{'authorId': '1768404', 'name': 'T.

Specifically, we hypothesize that OC mediates the influence of (1) job satisfaction, (2) perceived job characteristics, (3) perceived competitiveness of pay, and (4) perceived job alternatives on turnover intention. Also, perceived job alternatives are modeled as having a direct effect on turnover intention. Analysis provides moderate empirical support for the research model. OC and perceived job alternatives demonstrated distinct effects on turnover intention. In addition, OC mediated the influence of job satisfaction, perceived job characteristics, and perceived competitiveness of pay on turnover intention.

07333fe6d1afbaef762faf444c3d976cef8ab794,"Expressive behaviour is a vital aspect of human interaction. A model for adaptive emotion expression was developed for the Nao robot. The robot has an internal arousal and valence value, which are influenced by the emotional state of its interaction partner and emotional occurrences such as winning a game. It expresses these emotions through its voice, posture, whole body poses, eye colour and gestures. An experiment with 18 children (mean age 9) and two Nao robots was conducted to study the influence of adaptive emotion expression on the interaction behaviour and opinions of children. In a within-subjects design the children played a quiz with both an affective robot using the model for adaptive emotion expression and a non-affective robot without this model. The affective robot reacted to the emotions of the child using the implementation of the model, the emotions of the child were interpreted by a Wizard of Oz. The dependent variables, namely the behaviour and opinions of the children, were measured through video analysis and questionnaires. The results show that children react more expressively and more positively to a robot which adaptively expresses itself than to a robot which does not. The feedback of the children in the questionnaires further suggests that showing emotion through movement is considered a very positive trait for a robot. From their positive reactions we can conclude that children enjoy interacting with a robot which adaptively expresses itself through emotion and gesture more than with a robot which does not do this.

Fear of receiving compassion from others, expressing compassion to others, and being compassionate towards oneself have been identified as potentially important factors in the persistence of depression, stress disorders, and eating disorders. There is good reason to expect that these fears may play a role in anxiety and related difficulties, but there is little available information on the extent to which they are present and associated with symptom severity.


METHODS
This study compared the severity of the three fears of compassion (receiving, expressing to others, and showing to oneself) in those with a principal diagnosis of depression (n = 34), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 27), social anxiety disorder (SAD; n = 91), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, n = 43), and a control sample with no mental health difficulties (n = 212).


RESULTS
Those with depression, OCD, SAD, and GAD exhibited greater fear of receiving compassion and fear of self-compassion than controls, and the differences between anxious and control groups remained significant even when controlling for depressed mood. Whereas fears of compassion did not predict symptom severity over and above depressed mood in people with GAD, fear of receiving compassion uniquely predicted SAD symptom severity, and fear of expressing compassion for others uniquely predicted OCD symptom severity in those high on fear of self-compassion.


CONCLUSIONS
Fear of compassion is higher in those with anxiety and related disorders than non-anxious controls. Although further research is needed, clinicians may benefit from assessing fear of compassion and addressing it in treatment.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
Those with anxiety and related disorders may fear receiving compassion from others or expressing compassion for themselves, even when controlling for depression. It may be informative to assess for fear of compassion and incorporate discussions about these fears into treatment, as these fears may interfere with treatment progress.","[{'authorId': '4825170', 'name': 'Olivia A.

On March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared the state of alarm to limit viral transmission. During such state, citizens must stay confined at home with few justified exceptions. This whole situation drastically changed the life of the population, which can cause a wide range of psychosocial impacts. This study explored the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population (N = 3055) during the first stages of the outbreak in Spain, as well as their anxiety, stress and depression levels. We also examined the extent to which the following variables were associated to participants’ mental health: (1) demographics; (2) degree of concern about the pandemic; (3) environmental conditions during the home confinement, (4) changes in daily life as a consequence of the pandemic; (5) contact with the COVID-19 disease; (6) actual and perceived severity of the crisis; (7) information about the COVID-19, (8) perceived health status and (9) leisure activities conducted within the last 24 h. Our results show that Spanish consider the current COVID-19 health crisis as fairly severe, and the majority felt that the COVID-19 crisis had greatly impacted on their daily life, including changes in their daily routines and cancelation of important activities. About 36% of the participants reported moderate to severe psychological impact, 25% showed mild to severe levels of anxiety, 41% reported depressive symptoms, and 41% felt stressed. Women, young, and those who that lost their job during the health crisis showed the strongest negative psychological symptoms. What worried Spaniards the most was the likelihood of suffering an economic crisis derived from the pandemic. We found factors associated with better mental health, such as being satisfied with the information received about the health crisis, conducting leisure activities, and the perception of being in good health. These findings can be used to design psychological interventions to help coping with COVID-19 pandemic, both in Spain and other countries.","[{'authorId': '1402168933', 'name': 'R.

Change and continuity in behavioral (cooperative-resistant classroom participation) and emotional (school liking-avoidance) engagement were assessed during Grades 1-3 and examined within variable- and person-oriented analyses as antecedents of scholastic progress from Grades 1-8. Findings corroborated the premises that change as well as continuity in early school engagement is predictive of children's long-term scholastic growth. Compared to children who participated cooperatively in classrooms, those who became increasingly resistant across the primary grades displayed lesser scholastic growth. Among children who manifested enduring engagement patterns, those who exhibited a combination of higher behavioral and emotional engagement across the primary grades made greater academic progress than those who displayed lower levels of these two forms of engagement. Overall, the results of this investigation were consistent with the school engagement hypothesis, and extend what is known about the predictive contributions of early school engagement to children's achievement.","[{'authorId': '3353327', 'name': 'G.

What will such relationships look like? To address this question, 90 children (9-, 12-, and 15-year-olds) initially interacted with a humanoid robot, Robovie, in 15-min sessions. Each session ended when an experimenter interrupted Robovie's turn at a game and, against Robovie's stated objections, put Robovie into a closet. Each child was then engaged in a 50-min structural-developmental interview. Results showed that during the interaction sessions, all of the children engaged in physical and verbal social behaviors with Robovie. The interview data showed that the majority of children believed that Robovie had mental states (e.g., was intelligent and had feelings) and was a social being (e.g., could be a friend, offer comfort, and be trusted with secrets). In terms of Robovie's moral standing, children believed that Robovie deserved fair treatment and should not be harmed psychologically but did not believe that Robovie was entitled to its own liberty (Robovie could be bought and sold) or civil rights (in terms of voting rights and deserving compensation for work performed). Developmentally, while more than half the 15-year-olds conceptualized Robovie as a mental, social, and partly moral other, they did so to a lesser degree than the 9- and 12-year-olds. Discussion focuses on how (a) children's social and moral relationships with future personified robots may well be substantial and meaningful and (b) personified robots of the future may emerge as a unique ontological category.","[{'authorId': '144674612', 'name': 'P.

This robot was developed under a human-centered design approach with participatory design practices during two years and involving 142 children as active contributors at all design stages. The main contribution of this work is the development of methods and tools for child-centered robot design. We adapted existing participatory design practices used with adults to fit children’s development stages. We followed the DoubleDiamond Design Process Model and rested the design process of the robot on the following principles: low floor and wide walls, creativity provocations, open-ended playfulness, and disappointment avoidance through abstraction. The final product is a social robot designed for and with children. Our results show that YOLO increases their creativity during play, demonstrating a successful robot design project. We identified several guidelines that made the design process successful: the use of toys as tools, playgrounds as spaces, the emphasis of playfulness for child expression, and child policies as allies for design studies.

Resource gain, in turn, is depicted as of increasing importance in the context of loss. Because resources are also used to prevent resource loss, at each stage of the stress process people are increasingly vulnerable to negative stress sequelae, that if ongoing result in rapid and impactful loss spirals. COR theory is seen as an alternative to appraisal-based stress theories because it relies more centrally on the objective and culturally construed nature of the environment in determining the stress process, rather than the individual’s personal construel. COR theory has been successfully employed in predicting a range of stress outcomes in organisational settings, health contexts, following traumatic stress, and in the face of everyday stressors. Recent advances in understanding the biological, cognitive, and social bases of stress responding are seen as consistent with the original formulation of COR theory, but call for envisioning of COR theory and the stress process within a more collectivist backdrop than was first posited. The role of both resource losses and gains in predicting positive stress outcomes is also considered.

To cope with stress, adolescents may turn to social support figures. The present study tested the extent of main and moderating effects of various sources of social support on the association between stress and sleep. Adolescents (n = 202, meanage 14.6 years, standard deviation = 0.71) reported on academic stress, sleep, and support using questionnaires during a low‐ and high‐stress period, defined by the absence or presence of examinations, respectively. Inquiries were made regarding social support from parents, friends, and class supervisor. During both stress periods, academic stress was associated negatively with sleep quality and positively with sleep reduction. Social support increased sleep quality and lowered sleep reduction. In addition, social support moderated the effects of academic stress on sleep, thus improving sleep quality and lowering sleep reduction. Moderating effects were stronger during a period of high stress. The present study showed that adolescents can benefit from stress moderation through social support by improvements of sleep quality and sleep reduction. Such moderating effects should be taken into account when studying stress and sleep. Implications and recommendations based on these findings are discussed.","[{'authorId': '51172512', 'name': 'F.

To attempt to determine whether group audiologic rehabilitation (AR) content affected psychosocial outcomes.


METHOD
A randomized controlled trial with at least 17 participants per group was completed. The 3 treatment groups included a communication strategies training group, a communication strategies training plus psychosocial exercise group, and an informational lecture plus psychosocial exercise group. Evaluations were conducted preclass, postclass, and 6-months postclass; they included hearing loss-related and generic quality of life scales, and a class evaluation form.


RESULTS
All treatment groups demonstrated short- and long-term improvement on the hearing loss-related quality of life scale. Minimal differences were measured across treatment groups. A significant difference was observed between the lecture plus psychosocial exercise group and the communication strategies training group for 1 hearing loss-related quality of life subscale. Better outcomes were measured for the 2 groups with psychosocial exercises versus the communication strategies training group on 1 generic quality of life subscale. The results for the class evaluation did not discriminate among the treatment groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Class content had only a minimal influence on treatment outcomes. Recommended AR class content includes a mix of interventions including information, training, and psychosocial exercises.","[{'authorId': '6212539', 'name': 'J.

Despite this, there is mounting concern that many developmentally beneficial activities are now seen as dangerous and something to be avoided. However, perceptions of risk are very much subject to cultural interpretation, and the growing risk aversion evident in some developed Western societies, such as Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, is less apparent in other developed countries, notably some of the European and Scandinavian countries. To explore some of these cultural differences, early childhood practitioners from Australia and Norway were interviewed regarding their provision of outdoor play experiences for children and their attitudes towards risk-taking in play. Practitioners from both countries recognised the importance of risky play for children's development and well-being. However, differences in the extent to which children's risky play was supported were evident. Factors associated with the quality of the outdoor environment, regulatory requirements, and a litigious environment were identified as constraining teaching practice for the Australian practitioners. The findings have implications for the development of policy that supports teachers' pedagogical decision-making in providing developmentally challenging play environments for children.","[{'authorId': '47404249', 'name': 'H.

Using a sample of 338 ethnically diverse 5-year-old children, nested path analytic models were conducted to examine bidirectional pathways between children's behaviors and teacher-child relationship quality. Low self-regulation in kindergarten fall, as indexed by inattention and impulsive behaviors, predicted more conflict with teachers in kindergarten spring and this effect persisted into first grade. Conflict and low self-regulation jointly predicted decreases in school engagement which in turn predicted first-grade academic competence.

Based on this research, Pons and colleagues (Pons & Harris, 2002; Pons, Harris & Rosnay, 2004) have proposed the Test of Emotion Comprehension (TEC) which assesses nine domains of emotional understanding, namely the recognition of emotions, based on facial expressions; the comprehension of external emotional causes; impact of desire on emotions; emotions based on beliefs; memory influence on emotions; possibility of emotional regulation; possibility of hiding an emotional state; having mixed emotions; contribution of morality to emotional experiences.

Mean differences results in TEC by gender and by socio-economic status (SES) were analyzed. The results of the TEC’s psychometric analysis were performed in terms of items’ sensitivity and reliability (stability, test-retest).

Although human-robot interaction (HRI) can be quite demanding in terms of cognitive resources, the mental states (MS) of the operators are not yet taken into account by existing systems. As humans are no providential agents, this lack can lead to hazardous situations. The growing number of neurophysiology and machine learning tools now allows for efficient operators’ MS monitoring. Sending feedback on MS in a closed-loop solution is therefore at hand. Involving a consistent automated planning technique to handle such a process could be a significant asset. This perspective article was meant to provide the reader with a synthesis of the significant literature with a view to implementing systems that adapt to the operator’s MS to improve human-robot operations’ safety and performance. First of all, the need for this approach is detailed regarding remote operation, an example of HRI. Then, several MS identified as crucial for this type of HRI are defined, along with relevant electrophysiological markers. A focus is made on prime degraded MS linked to time-on-task and task demands, as well as collateral MS linked to system outputs (i.e., feedback and alarms). Lastly, the principle of symbiotic HRI is detailed and one solution is proposed to include the operator state vector into the system using a mixed-initiative decisional framework to drive such an interaction.","[{'authorId': '20903548', 'name': 'R.

0a45989a9336d89acd973eec34189f63cf7f845d,"INTRODUCTION Student voice, as a means to incorporate the ideas of young people in education, has (re)emerged over the last 20 years (Bovill, 2012; Thiesen & Cook-Sather, 2007). Interest in student voice has burgeoned, especially in countries like the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Fielding (2004) euphorically speaks of a ""new wave"" in student voice initiatives, referring to the reemerging field of student voice in the U.K. that included encouraging students to articulate their views, peer support arrangements, students as researchers, and supporting student leadership. Some authors go so far as to argue that student voice is a movement focusing on ""diversity of practice and the commitment of learners and practitioners to the principles of social justice, democracy, active citizenry and children's rights"" (Czerniawski & Kidd, 2011, p. xxxv). Sinnema and Ludlow (2013), compared the ideas surrounding educational reform in Australia, England, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, finding that student agency and voice are one of the central aspects of a new policy framework in all of these countries. Despite the apparent enthusiasm, examples of students' involvement in curriculum development are rare. Allowing students to have a say can present a multitude of opportunities for participation that will be presented as arguments further on. Student participation can be formal, in which students are invited to participate in the decision-making process within, for example, school councils. It can also be informal, involving students in varied aspects of their education. Examples include the evaluation and hiring of teachers, the selection of foods offered in the cafeteria, policy development to increase safety in the halls, increased number of group assignments by teachers. Regardless of how one goes about it, involving students includes more than simply getting their opinion. Their voice should also have an effect. According to Lundy (2007, p. 933), four elements of student voice can be identified: 1. Space: Children must be given the opportunity to express a view. 2. Voice: Children must be facilitated to express their views. 3. Audience: The view must be listened to. 4. Influence: The view must be acted on, as appropriate. Our particular interest is in the application of the concept of student voice in the process of curriculum design. In a series of case studies we have analyzed how this can be organized in secondary education classes. We found that the involvement of students contributed to the relevance of the curriculum by involving students as stakeholders who articulate their unique perspectives on certain themes. Teachers found this approach inspiring but also demanding (Bron & Veugelers, 2014). In this chapter our focus is on the rationale for including student voice. Why should we put effort in enabling students to participate in curriculum design? We argue that students in secondary education are entitled to participate in the discussion of topics relevant to their learning. A set of five arguments, drawing on both literature and our own work, is presented. Five Rationales for Student Voice Work The following set of arguments draw on two articles in particular, one by Huddleston (2007) and the other by Kirshner and Pozzoboni (2011). Huddleston, of the English Citizenship Foundation, wrote a publication on effective practice in democratic school governance in European schools for the Council of Europe. In this publication, Huddleston explores theoretical perspectives on student participation and introduces three types of what he calls justifications based on the prior research of Rowe in 2003. According to Huddleston, justification for student participation can be normative, educational and instrumental. An example of a normative argument is the right to participate. Children are entitled to express their views on matters that affect them directly such as their education. …","[{'authorId': '98441803', 'name': 'J. Bron'}, {'authorId': '93311413', 'name': 'W.

Although childhood adversities (CAs) are known to be highly co-occurring, most research examines their associations with psychiatric disorders one at a time. However, recent evidence from adult studies suggests that the associations of multiple CAs with psychiatric disorders are nonadditive, arguing for the importance of multivariate analysis of multiple CAs. To our knowledge, no attempt has been made to perform a similar kind of analysis among children or adolescents.


OBJECTIVE
To examine the multivariate associations of 12 CAs with first onset of psychiatric disorders in a national sample of US adolescents.


DESIGN
A US national survey of adolescents (age range, 13-17 years) assessing DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behavior, and substance use disorders and CAs. The CAs include parental loss (death, divorce, and other separations), maltreatment (neglect and physical, sexual, and emotional abuse), and parental maladjustment (violence, criminality, substance abuse, and psychopathology), as well as economic adversity.


SETTING
Dual-frame household-school samples.


PARTICIPANTS
In total, 6483 adolescent-parent pairs.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Lifetime DSM-IV disorders assessed using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.


RESULTS
Overall, exposure to at least 1 CA was reported by 58.3% of adolescents, among whom 59.7% reported multiple CAs. The CAs reflecting maladaptive family functioning were more strongly associated than other CAs with the onset of psychiatric disorders. The best-fitting model included terms for the type and number of CAs and distinguished between maladaptive family functioning and other CAs. The CAs predicted behavior disorders most strongly and fear disorders least strongly. The joint associations of multiple CAs were subadditive. The population-attributable risk proportions across DSM-IV disorder classes ranged from 15.7% for fear disorders to 40.7% for behavior disorders. The CAs were associated with 28.2% of all onsets of psychiatric disorders.


CONCLUSIONS
Childhood adversities are common, highly co-occurring, and strongly associated with the onset of psychiatric disorders among US adolescents. The subadditive multivariate associations of CAs with the onset of psychiatric disorders have implications for targeting interventions to reduce exposure to CAs and to mitigate the harmful effects of CAs to improve population mental health.","[{'authorId': '5145543', 'name': 'K.

One potential factor in the spread of anxiety in response to a pandemic threat is emotion contagion, the finding that emotional experiences can be socially spread through conscious and unconscious pathways. Some individuals are more susceptible to social contagion effects and may be more likely to experience anxiety and other mental health symptoms in response to a pandemic threat. Therefore, we studied the relationship between emotion contagion and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We administered the Emotion Contagion Scale (ESC) along with a measure of anxiety in response to COVID-19 (modified from a previous scale designed to quantify fear of the Swine Flu outbreak) and secondary outcome measures of depression, anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. These measures were completed by a large (n = 603) student sample in the United States. Data were collected in the months of April and May of 2020 when the fear of COVID-19 was widespread. Results revealed that greater susceptibility to emotion contagion was associated with greater concern about the spread of COVID-19, more depression, anxiety, stress, and OCD symptoms. Consumption of media about COVID-19 also predicted anxiety about COVID-19, though results were not moderated by emotion contagion. However, emotion contagion did moderate the relationship between COVID-19-related media consumption and elevated OCD symptoms. Although limited by a cross-sectional design that precludes causal inferences, the present results highlight the need for study of how illness fears may be transmitted socially during a pandemic.","[{'authorId': '3718375', 'name': 'Michael G.

WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Standardized patient (SP) simulation is an internationally recognized learning strategy that has proven effective in enhancing nursing students' competencies necessary for mental health practice. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: A deeper exploration of the process from the perspective of SPs and more particularly drama students, revealed the complexity they need to navigate and the personal vulnerability they are exposed to when creating an authentic learning opportunity for nursing students. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Their vulnerability justifies deeper consideration of support, as well as research on the ethical implications of SP simulation. Nursing students need to be well grounded in therapeutic communication before engaging with mental health users. This should include opportunities to question personal frames of reference that could hinder therapeutic engagement with diverse others. In future, the drama students can be involved in scenario development to enhance the authenticity of simulations.


ABSTRACT
Introduction The effectiveness of Standardized patient (SP) simulation in enhancing students' mental health nursing competencies is well published. Nevertheless, the believable and accurate portrayal of a patient with a mental health issue during SP simulation is complex. Though vital to the creation of safe authentic learning experiences, the perspectives of SPs and particularly of drama students involved in SP simulation are unknown. Aim The aim of this paper is therefore to explore and describe the experiences of 11 drama students engaged in mental health simulations for nursing students. Method A qualitative approach was taken and data were gathered using various techniques. Findings The content analysis revealed that these SPs negotiated three roles during this interdisciplinary learning experience, namely of a facilitator of learning, a drama student and the person within. Discussion The study provided valuable insight into the world of an SP, including the complexities they navigate and the vulnerability they experience. Implications for Practice Nurse educators are alerted to SP's need for support and the necessity of establishing good interpersonal skills before nursing students enter the practice setting. Involvement of SPs in scenario development could enhance the authenticity of future simulations.

To date, explanations for the underprediction of girls' GPAs by standardized tests have focused on gender differences favoring boys on such tests. The authors' investigation suggests an additional explanation: Girls are more self-disciplined, and this advantage is more relevant to report card grades than to achievement or aptitude tests. Eighth-grade girls at an urban magnet school were more self-disciplined than their male counterparts according to delay of gratification measures and self-report, teacher, and parent ratings. Whereas girls earned higher grades in all courses, they did only marginally better on an achievement test and worse on an IQ test. Mediation analyses suggested girls earned higher GPAs at least in part because they were more self-disciplined.","[{'authorId': '5720574', 'name': 'A.

Still, scholars have rightfully questioned its predictive role for several outcomes, including turnover intention as the two have been found to be virtually unrelated. In line with calls for more complex research on the predictive role of perceived job autonomy on employee outcomes, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the relationship between perceived job autonomy and turnover intention may be prone to contextual influences. Two cross-sectional surveys among 680 Norwegian employees from different public service organizations showed that the relationship between perceived job autonomy and turnover intention was moderated by perceived supervisor support. In support of our hypothesis, the form of the moderations revealed that perceived job autonomy was negatively related to turnover intention only for employees reporting high levels of perceived supervisor support.

The data were collected by means of individual and group interviews at three Finnish higher education institutes, including two universities and one university of applied sciences. The interviews involved 63 persons in charge of management, development and teaching at these institutes. As a result of the qualitative data analysis, we distinguished four models to represent the development of generic skills, which we named (1) Specialist Model, (2) Science-based Renewal Model, (3) Project-based Integrative Model, and (4) Model of Networked Culture. These models serve as analytical tools that help higher education institutes to examine their existing practices and to develop new ones.","[{'authorId': '3424470', 'name': 'Päivikki Jääskelä'}, {'authorId': '98804369', 'name': 'S.

The aim of this paper is to explore children’s (N = 50) own perspectives and perceptions of risky situations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and images were used as prompts. Children aged five to six years were asked to identify and discuss five risky activities based on Sandseter’s categorization of risky outdoor play. Responses indicated as risk causes were situational aspects of the contexts, the age of the actor and natural hazards. The presence/absence of others seemed to have an impact on identifying risky vs riskier conditions, and physical harm was recorded as a negative outcome. Such findings reveal that causal strength, probabilistic inference, future reasoning, and linguistic capacity are connected with children’s reasoning of risk; in this direction, pedagogical activities on risk could be implemented from the ‘safe’ early childhood classroom.","[{'authorId': '69024271', 'name': 'Z.

The concept of developmental cascade has been introduced in this context to describe lawful processes by which antecedent conditions may be related with varying probabilities to specified outcomes. These are understood as processes by which function at one level or in one domain of behavior affect the organization of competency in later developing domains of general adaptation. Here we propose a developmental sequence by which the developing child acquires regulative capacities that are key to adjustment to a society that demands considerable control of emotional and cognitive functions early in life. We report empirical evidence showing that the acquisition of regulative capacities may be understood as a cascade of shifts in control parameters induced by the progressive integration of biological, transactional, and socioaffective systems over development. We conclude by suggesting how the developmental process may be accessed for effective intervention in populations deemed “at risk” for later problems of psychosocial adjustment.","[{'authorId': '48740993', 'name': 'M.

Method: We examined which aspects of ED are most relevant to ADHD in 180 young adolescents (75% boys), as well as whether ED differs across ADHD subtypes or comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) status. We also examined the association between ED and aggression, rule-breaking, and social impairment. Results: Young adolescent females and males with ADHD exhibited various manifestations of ED, including behavioral dyscontrol in the presence of strong emotions and inflexibility/slow return to emotional baseline. ED did not differ as a function of ADHD subtype or comorbid ODD. Three aspects of ED, namely, low threshold for emotional excitability/impatience, behavioral dyscontrol in the face of strong emotions, and inflexibility/slow return to baseline, predicted three of six measured indices of parent- and self-reported social impairment, above and beyond comorbid ODD. Conclusions: ED is associated with ADHD among young adolescents, does not differ based on ADHD subtype or ODD status, and is associated with social impairment.","[{'authorId': '6228211', 'name': 'N.

Our goal in this paper is to bring these hidden practices to light and offer guidelines for how HCI researchers can usefully engage in what we term 'autobiographical design'---design research drawing on extensive, genuine usage by those creating or building a system.

This study examined the role of cool and hot EF in teacher reported aggression, differentiating between reactive and proactive as well as physical and relational aggression. Children (N = 106) completed laboratory tasks measuring cool (inhibition, planning, working memory) and hot EF (affective decision-making, delay of gratification). Cool, but not hot, EF significantly contributed to understanding of childhood aggression. Inhibition was a central predictor of childhood aggression. Planning and working memory, in contrast, were significant independent predictors of proactive relational aggression only. Added to this, prosocial behaviour moderated the relationship between working memory and reactive relational aggression.

Objectives In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarize key features of available evidence on robot-interventions for children and young people on the autism spectrum aged up to 18 years old, as well as consider their efficacy for specific domains of learning. Data sources PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. Grey literature was also searched using PsycExtra, OpenGrey, British Library EThOS, and the British Library Catalogue. Databases were searched from inception until April (6th) 2021. Synthesis methods Searches undertaken across seven databases yielded 2145 articles. Forty studies met our review inclusion criteria of which 17 were randomized control trials. The methodological quality of studies was conducted with the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. A narrative synthesis summarised the findings. A meta-analysis was conducted with 12 RCTs. Results Most interventions used humanoid (67%) robotic platforms, were predominantly based in clinics (37%) followed home, schools and laboratory (17% respectively) environments and targeted at improving social and communication skills (77%). Focusing on the most common outcomes, a random effects meta-analysis of RCTs showed that robot-mediated interventions significantly improved social functioning (g = 0.35 [95%CI 0.09 to 0.61; k = 7). By contrast, robots did not improve emotional (g = 0.63 [95%CI -1.43 to 2.69]; k = 2) or motor outcomes (g = -0.10 [95%CI -1.08 to 0.89]; k = 3), but the numbers of trials were very small. Meta-regression revealed that age accounted for almost one-third of the variance in effect sizes, with greater benefits being found in younger children. Conclusions Overall, our findings support the use of robot-mediated interventions for autistic children and youth, and we propose several recommendations for future research to aid learning and enhance implementation in everyday settings.

Experiment 1 tested a group of adults diagnosed with AS/HFA (n = 19) who used the software at home for 10–15 weeks. Participants were tested on recognition of faces and voices at three different levels of generalization. A matched control group of adults with AS/HFA (n = 22) were assessed without any intervention. In addition, a third group of general population controls (n = 24) was tested. Experiment 2 repeated the design of Experiment 1 with a group of adults with AS/HFA who used the software at home and met in a group with a tutor on a weekly basis. They were matched to a control group of adults with AS/HFA attending social skills training and to a general population control group (n = 13 for all three groups). In both experiments the intervention group improved significantly more than the control group on close, but not distant, generalization tasks. Verbal IQ had significant effects in Experiment 2. Using Mind Reading for a relatively short period of time allows users to learn to recognize a variety of complex emotions and mental states.

0e37bf583e94349fc1ed9969335616e4220985f2,"Introduction Classrooms are complex societies where students and teachers live and interact with each other. Teachers are the leaders of these societies and the way they exercise their leadership abilities greatly affect the quality of interactions that take place between teachers and students as well as the interactions that take place between and among the students themselves. These interactions, both social and instructional, have a great impact on the academic and social growth of the students assigned to a given teacher's classroom. Educational scholars have suggested for decades that the group dynamics of a classroom needs to be analyzed in order to fully understand how teachers best function in their role and how students best learn (Bracey, 2009a; Pianta, 2006; Eisner, 1984; Schlechty, 1976; Lortie, 1975; Jackson, 1968; Waller, 1961). Bracey (2009b) noted that educational research should focus on the way teachers and students interact and how teachers structure learning environments to promote these interactions. Research that focuses on how the average student or average teacher functions on an isolated task misses the significance of understanding how teachers and students interact in the learning environment and how the internal relationships in a classroom impact both student and teacher behavior. The purpose of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis in order to determine what life is like for students and teachers in classrooms where teachers have been categorized as strong by their principals vis-a-vis those classrooms where teachers have been categorized as needs improvement by the same principals. Specifically, the relationship existing between student and teacher interactions and student and teacher time-on-task was analyzed. The reported findings have significant implications for teacher educators who are guiding pre-service and in-service teachers in their development of productive learning environments. Review of Literature Teachers have varied opinions regarding what they believe are effective techniques for managing children's behavior in a classroom setting. In fact, classroom management may be the most discussed topic among teachers at all grade levels and career stages. A number of studies suggest that a direct link exists between teachers' ability to manage classroom behavior and their students' learning. For example, Baugous and Bendery (2000) suggested students are on task more in classrooms that have fewer management problems; it has been reported that such management problems tend to distract both teachers and students making it difficult for either to focus on learning experiences (Clough, Smassal, & Clough, 1994). Prater (1992) reported, the optimal teaching and learning environment is one where the teacher puts an emphasis on preventing management disruptions because such an environment will likely increase student time-on-task and, of course, learning. Finally, Rimm-Kaufmann, La Paro, Downer, and Pianta (2005) found that high classroom quality was most consistently related to a low number of management problems. Additionally, management problems can affect the amount and quality of interactions in the classroom. It has been reported that teachers are less apt to have positive interactions with behaviorally challenging students and even avoid contact with these students as stress levels increase (Abidin & Kmetz, 1997). Schlechty's classic work (1976) described a similar type of teacher behavior as retreating; that is, the teacher failed to react when students' violated previously written or stated rules for conduct. The Research Project Recently, the authors conducted a study to examine life in two distinctly different types of classrooms: those with teachers categorized as strong and those categorized as needs improvement. It is important to note that, during the data collection phase of this project, the researchers had no knowledge as to how the teachers had been categorized. …","[{'authorId': '113851474', 'name': 'Nancy J.

While perceived organizational politics was associated with all outcomes, psychological capital had a significant relationship with job satisfaction and supervisor-rated performance only. As hypothesized, the negative relationship of perceived organizational politics with job satisfaction and supervisor-rated performance was weaker when psychological capital was high.

In most systems, this is achieved using facial expressions, gestures, locomotion, and tone of voice. In this paper, we propose a new expressive nonverbal channel for social robots in the form of a texture-changing skin. Our approach is inspired by biological systems, which frequently display their internal states through skin texture change. We present two designs for soft fluidic Texture Units (TU): goosebumps and spikes, and a design for an interleaved TU array that can function as an expressive social robot skin. We discuss fabrication, actuation, and control considerations, as well as a framework for mapping emotional states to texture changes. We exemplify the design in a social robot which has both a screen-projected face and the proposed texture-changing expressive skin.","[{'authorId': '49994805', 'name': 'Yuhan Hu'}, {'authorId': '2152619635', 'name': 'Zhengnan Zhao'}, {'authorId': '51116718', 'name': 'A.

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being and health-compromising behaviors of adolescents (12–18 years) previously referred for mental health services. Data were collected (pre-pandemic n = 3712; pandemic n = 3197) from mental health agencies across Ontario, Canada using the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health assessment. Our findings revealed no increased incidence of witnessing domestic violence nor experiencing physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Further, there were no increases in the risk of self-harm and suicide, anxiety, or depression among our sample of clinically referred youth. Finally, results demonstrated no increase in problematic videogaming/internet use, disordered eating, or alcohol intoxication, and a decrease in cannabis use. Our findings add to the growing body of knowledge as to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and youth. Further, findings underscore the importance of understanding the nuanced impact of the pandemic on various subgroups of children, youth, and families and highlight the need for continued monitoring of outcomes for these children and youth.","[{'authorId': '49330852', 'name': 'S.

We also explore correlations between these design and use characteristics and factors cited as having an effect on user perceptions and acceptance of robots, such as religious beliefs and media exposure. Our research suggests that culturally variable attitudes and preferences toward robots are not simply reducible to these factors, rather they relate to more specific social dynamics and norms. In conclusion, we discuss potential design and research implications of culturally variable and universally accepted user preferences regarding robots.

Yet the ways in which we conceptualise work, leisure and well-being are in flux, reflecting, in part, the changing societal, economic and community contexts in which work and leisure take place. This paper first discusses the contested nature of work and leisure in relation to well-being, and then considers current evidence concerning the ways in which work and leisure are experienced in contemporary society. The emerging issues are then discussed drawing on two international studies which indicate the increasingly global nature of these concerns. The pervasiveness of the trend towards intensification of work, reducing time and energy for other activities, and the gendered impact of this trend are evident in both studies. Many commentators have noted the negative effects of current working patterns on well-being.

A drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of two nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFI) and nonnormed (FI) fit indexes. CFI avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for Bentler and Bonett's (1980) normed fit index (NFI). FI is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's non-normed fit index (NNFI) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFI. Asymptotically, CFI, FI, NFI, and a new index developed by Bollen are equivalent measures of comparative fit, whereas NNFI measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes.","[{'authorId': '2405956', 'name': 'P. Bentler'}]",22054.0,,26.0,Comparative fit indexes in structural models.,1990.0

Increasing prevalence of electronic health records (EHRs) offers a unique opportunity to build machine learning algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions that drive adverse events. In this study, we investigated hospitalizations’ data to study drug interactions with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) that result in drug-induced liver injury (DILI). We propose a logistic regression based machine learning algorithm that unearths several known interactions from an EHR dataset of about 400,000 hospitalization. Our proposed modeling framework is successful in detecting 87.5% of the positive controls, which are defined by drugs known to interact with diclofenac causing an increased risk of DILI, and correctly ranks aggregate risk of DILI for eight commonly prescribed NSAIDs. We found that our modeling framework is particularly successful in inferring associations of drug-drug interactions from relatively small EHR datasets. Furthermore, we have identified a novel and potentially hepatotoxic interaction that might occur during concomitant use of meloxicam and esomeprazole, which are commonly prescribed together to allay NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Empirically, we validate our approach against prior methods for signal detection on EHR datasets, in which our proposed approach outperforms all the compared methods across most metrics, such as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).","[{'authorId': '28341105', 'name': 'Arghya Datta'}, {'authorId': '89622224', 'name': 'Noah R.

The intervention included 12 sessions, lasted 1 month and used low-cost materials. Seventy-five children took part in the study. The results indicate that the children who attended the intervention outperformed controls in simple and more complex EF tasks. Specifically, these children exhibited increased abilities to delay gratification, to control on-going responses, to process and update information, and to manage high cognitive conflict.

In this exploratory study, we asked whether similar benefits are observed when a robot engages in dialogic reading with preschoolers. Given the established effectiveness of active reading, we also asked whether this effectiveness was critically dependent on the expressive characteristics of the robot. For approximately half the children, the robot’s active reading was expressive; the robot’s voice included a wide range of intonation and emotion (Expressive). For the remaining children, the robot read and conversed with a flat voice, which sounded similar to a classic text-to-speech engine and had little dynamic range (Flat). The robot’s movements were kept constant across conditions. We performed a verification study using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to confirm that the Expressive robot was viewed as significantly more expressive, more emotional, and less passive than the Flat robot. We invited 45 preschoolers with an average age of 5 years who were either English Language Learners (ELL), bilingual, or native English speakers to engage in the reading task with the robot. The robot narrated a story from a picture book, using active reading techniques and including a set of target vocabulary words in the narration. Children were post-tested on the vocabulary words and were also asked to retell the story to a puppet. A subset of 34 children performed a second story retelling 4–6 weeks later. Children reported liking and learning from the robot a similar amount in the Expressive and Flat conditions. However, as compared to children in the Flat condition, children in the Expressive condition were more concentrated and engaged as indexed by their facial expressions; they emulated the robot’s story more in their story retells; and they told longer stories during their delayed retelling. Furthermore, children who responded to the robot’s active reading questions were more likely to correctly identify the target vocabulary words in the Expressive condition than in the Flat condition. Taken together, these results suggest that children may benefit more from the expressive robot than from the flat robot.","[{'authorId': '19226999', 'name': 'Jacqueline M.

For this purpose, we built a small creature-like robot, Keepon, which was carefully designed to get autistic and non-autistic children involved in playful interaction. We observed how autistic children (2-4 years old) interacted with Keepon without any experimental setting or instructions in a playroom at a day-care center for children with special needs. From the longitudinal observation for a year and a half (totally, over 500 child-sessions), we found that Keepon's simple appearance and predictable responses gave the autistic children a playful and relaxed mood, in which they spontaneously engaged in dyadic play with Keepon, which would then expand into interpersonal communication where Keepon worked as the pivot of triadic play with adults or other children. Each child showed a different style and a different unfolding of interaction over time, which tell us a ""story"" of his or her personality and developmental profile, which would not be explained thoroughly by a diagnostic label like ""autism"".","[{'authorId': '1808353', 'name': 'H.

To investigate functional neural plasticity underlying the augmentation of empathy and to test the counteracting potential of compassion, one group of participants was first trained in empathic resonance and subsequently in compassion. In response to videos depicting human suffering, empathy training, but not memory training (control group), increased negative affect and brain activations in anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex-brain regions previously associated with empathy for pain. In contrast, subsequent compassion training could reverse the increase in negative effect and, in contrast, augment self-reports of positive affect. In addition, compassion training increased activations in a non-overlapping brain network spanning ventral striatum, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. We conclude that training compassion may reflect a new coping strategy to overcome empathic distress and strengthen resilience.","[{'authorId': '6431209', 'name': 'O.

Though much research has examined conditions that increase individuals’ tendencies to trust others, we know very little about the circumstances under which individuals are likely to make more accurate trust decisions (i.e., neither misplace their trust nor refrain from trusting when doing so would have been beneficial), especially when they must do so rapidly and in the absence of an exchange history. Put simply, we have little understanding of what drives the accuracy of swift trust judgments. Building on relevant literatures, we propose that short episodes of prior interpersonal contact with a partner can increase the accuracy of swift trust decisions. Across two experimental studies, we demonstrate that brief interpersonal contact leads trustors to both (a) become more accurate in their trust decisions; and (b) engage in other-focused perspective taking, which mediates the effect of interpersonal contact on trust accuracy. We then show that it is specifically because of verbal cues, rather than visual cues, that brief interpersonal contact enables other-focused perspective taking, and in turn, trust accuracy (Study 3). We contribute to the literature on trust by examining trust accuracy (rather than mere trust levels), identifying the significant role of brief interpersonal contact, and revealing other-focused perspective taking as a key mechanism in accurate swift trust decisions.","[{'authorId': '1835034', 'name': 'Oliver Schilke'}, {'authorId': '12047493', 'name': 'Laura Huang'}]",41.0,,143.0,Worthy of Swift Trust?

Results Thirty-four studies were included. Significant main effects were found for high-frequency HRV (P = 0.0008; Hedges' g =–0.98, 95% CI −1.56 to −0.41, k = 29) and RMSSD (P<0.0001; g =–0.91, 95% CI −1.19 to −0.62, k = 24), indicating lower vagal activity in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy controls.

The present case study was done on an adult learner of German and analyzed her accounts of experiencing boredom throughout a whole semester, 13 sessions in length. The trajectory of boredom throughout the course showed that the beginning of the course was the most boring though the learner continued to experience boredom until the end of the semester. Among the theoretical explanations of boredom, under-stimulation, low perceived control over tasks and attention deficit were found to be the most dominant until the end of the course. Among the nontheoretical explanations of boredom, user-unfriendly requirements of online learning prevailed mostly in the beginning of the course until the middle but they were found to be less influential in the end of the course. The process tracing approach showed to be effective in unpacking the black box of the causal mechanisms involved in the boredom experienced in the online L3 learning. Suggestions were made on how to make an online language course less boring and more communicative, which seems essential today due to the unrivaled use of online education during the pandemic.","[{'authorId': '70075457', 'name': 'Elham Yazdanmehr'}, {'authorId': '147457295', 'name': 'Majid Elahi Shirvan'}, {'authorId': '118495682', 'name': 'Khatereh Saghafi'}]",29.0,,55.0,A process tracing study of the dynamic patterns of boredom in an online L3 course of German during COVID‐19 pandemic,2021.0

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between factors: guilt, shame, self-compassion, and parents' psychological adjustment to their child's burn injury.


Methods
Participants were 91 parents and primary caregivers (63 mothers, 25 fathers, 3 other) of 71 children recruited on the ward or at outpatient clinics during the first 8 weeks following their child's burn injury. In 20 cases, both parents participated, while for 51 children only one parent participated. Participants completed questionnaires which assessed adjustment (symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress syndrome [PTSS]) as well as guilt, shame, and self-compassion.


Results
Multilevel analysis indicated that feelings of guilt and shame were associated with poorer adjustment in parents, while parents who rated high in self-compassion reported fewer symptoms of depression and PTSS. Guilt and shame showed a differing pattern of effects with shame explaining more variance for anxiety and depression. Length of hospitalization predicted PTSS; however, the remaining injury factors (size of burn, requiring a skin graft) were unrelated to parental adjustment.


Conclusions
Health-care professionals should pay close attention to families' subjective injury experiences. Screening for psychological distress should be offered to all families regardless of the size and severity of the burn injury.","[{'authorId': '2030118284', 'name': 'L.

Unlike solutions that classify emotions, with a single sign, the architecture proposed in this article will merge four sources of information about emotions into one. For this inference to be closer to a human being, a Fuzzy System Mamdani was used to infer the user’s personalities, and a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) was used to infer the robot’s personality. The hypothesis tested in this work was based on the Mehrabian studies and in addition to three experts in psychologists.

To this end, we conducted a long-term field study implementing an adaptive robotic tutor to support students with exam preparation over three sessions during one semester. In a mixed design, we compared the effect of an adaptive tutor to a control condition across all learning sessions. With the aim to benefit not only motivation but also academic success and the learning experience in general, we draw from research in adaptive tutoring, social robots in education, as well as our own prior work in this field. Our results show that opting in for the robotic tutoring is beneficial for students. We found significant subjective knowledge gain and increases in intrinsic motivation regarding the content of the course in general. Finally, participation resulted in a significantly better exam grade compared to students not participating. However, the extended adaptivity of the robotic tutor in the experimental condition did not seem to enhance learning, as we found no significant differences compared to a non-adaptive version of the robot.","[{'authorId': '151110885', 'name': 'Melissa Donnermann'}, {'authorId': '11715171', 'name': 'Philipp Schaper'}, {'authorId': '2117313647', 'name': 'Birgit Lugrin'}]",7.0,,37.0,Social Robots in Applied Settings: A Long-Term Study on Adaptive Robotic Tutors in Higher Education,2022.0

To study affective plasticity in healthy adults, we measured functional neural and subjective responses to witnessing the distress of others in a newly developed task (Socio-affective Video Task). Participants' initial empathic responses to the task were accompanied by negative affect and activations in the anterior insula and anterior medial cingulate cortex--a core neural network underlying empathy for pain. Whereas participants reacted with negative affect before training, compassion training increased positive affective experiences, even in response to witnessing others in distress.

Using partial least squares, we sought to specify interrelations among all theory-based components of social–emotional learning (SEL), and their ability to predict later classroom adjustment and academic readiness in a modelling context. Consequently, self-regulation, emotion knowledge, social problem solving, and social–emotional behaviour were assessed via direct assessment and observation for 101 preschoolers; teachers provided information on classroom adjustment through kindergarten and academic readiness in kindergarten. Our final outer (measurement) model showed robust latent variables for SEL components. Regarding the inner (structural) model, latent variables showed expected predictive relations among SEL components, and with later classroom adjustment and academic readiness: preschoolers’ executive control predicted aspects of their social cognition (i.e., emotion knowledge and social problem solving) and emotionally negative/aggressive behaviour, and emotion knowledge predicted their emotionally regulated/prosocial behaviour. Further, most SEL components directly and/or indirectly predicted teachers’ evaluations of later classroom adjustment and kindergarten academic readiness. Our findings extend our understanding of SEL during preschool, suggesting that early assessment and monitoring is possible using these instruments, and potentially aiding the development of programmes to maximize children’ sS EL in the service of early school success.

Findings reveal that emotional displays were recognised at rates higher than predicted by chance; however, members of each cultural group were more accurate in recognising the displays communicated by a member of their own cultural group than a member of the other cultural group. Moreover, the evaluation of error matrices indicates that both culture groups relied on similar mechanism when recognising emotional displays from the voice.

12b38d3de3c1e7bf936a8f3496fe792d28ecf7a8,"One intriguing feature of the human communication system is the interactional infrastructure it builds on. In both dyadic and multi-person interactions, conversation is highly structured and organized according to set principles (Sacks et al., 1974). Human adult interaction is characterized by a mechanism of exchange based on alternating (and relatively short) bursts of information. In the majority of cases, only one person tends to speak at a time and each contribution usually receives a response. What is remarkable is the precise timing of these sequential contributions, resulting in gaps between speaking turns averaging around just 200 ms (Stivers et al., 2009). From psycholinguistic experiments, we know that the time it takes to produce even simple one-word-utterances (min. 600 ms, Indefrey and Levelt, 2004) by far exceeds this average gap duration, hinting at the complexity of the cognitive processes that must be involved (Levinson, 2013). 
 
While the behavioral principles governing turn-taking in interaction have been researched for some decades—primarily by scholars of conversation analysis—the cognitive underpinnings of the human turn-taking system have long remained elusive. Recently, psycholinguists have begun to explore the cognitive and neural processes that allow us to deal effectively with the immensely complex task of taking turns on time. Amongst other things, this has highlighted the anticipatory, predictive processes that must be at work, as well as the different layers of processing allowing production planning and comprehension to take place simultaneously (de Ruiter et al., 2006; Magyari and de Ruiter; Bogels et al., 2015). These insights mesh well with the conversation analytic literature that has illuminated the interactional environments in which individual turns are embedded: their sequential organization and the use of conventionalized linguistic constructions allow for the projection of upcoming talk, as well as for the recognition of points of possible completions in the turn which make transition to the next speaker relevant (Sacks et al., 1974; Ford and Thompson, 1996; Schegloff, 2007). The articles in this Research Topic bring together these as yet largely independent lines of research to elucidate our understanding of turn-taking from multiple perspectives and aim to foster future synergies. 
 
In addition to exploring the adult psycholinguistic machinery and its workings, researchers have begun to wonder how and when the required cognitive and social processes mature in children, as well as how they compare to those in other species. Levinson (2006) proposed that human beings are inherently social and interactive in orientation. He argues that an “interaction engine” may lie at the heart of children's early predisposition for turn-taking. Likewise, this particular human capacity might explain the strong cultural universals in the structure of human interaction as well as the striking commonalities and differences in communication systems brought about by the course of evolution. 
 
The present Research Topic provides a collection of experimental and observational empirical studies using qualitative and quantitative approaches, complemented by articles offering reviews, opinions, and models. They aim to inform the reader about the most recent advances in our endeavor of unraveling the workings of the human turn-taking system in communicative interaction.

In early typical language development, children understand words before they are able to use them in speech. Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) generally show impairments in both the comprehension and the production of language. However, the relative degree of delay or impairment in each of these sub-domains may also be atypical and remains less well-understood.


AIMS
Relative delay in receptive and expressive language skills was examined within a large sample of preschoolers with autism. Children's language abilities varied from pre-verbal to fluent speech.


METHOD & PROCEDURES
Scores on one direct clinician assessment and two parent-report measures of language were obtained for 152 preschoolers with core autism.


OUTCOMES & RESULTS
As expected, on average, the language ability of the children with autism was lower than typical age norms, albeit with substantial individual variability. On all three language measures, receptive ability was relatively more impaired than expressive ability. Higher non-verbal ability was associated with such an atypical language profile.


CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS
Recognition of the marked receptive language impairment relative to expressive language, found to affect at least one-third of preschoolers with autism in this sample, has important implications for interacting with these children and for informing appropriate targets in language and communication intervention.","[{'authorId': '3751828', 'name': 'K.

The results show that surface acting in customer service encounters is positively, and deep acting is negatively, related to ego depletion. Employees’ ego depletion, in turn, is positively associated with their interpersonally harmful behavior toward coworkers. Hence, ego depletion appears as a mediating variable that translates the implications of distinct emotional labor strategies into coworker harming. Moreover, emotion regulation self-efficacy moderates the role of surface acting. The positive indirect relationship between surface acting and coworker harming, via ego depletion, is buffered among employees with higher emotion regulation self-efficacy. These findings shed new light on the complex and far-reaching consequences of emotional labor.

This study compared the effectiveness of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalization with standard psychiatric care for patients with borderline personality disorder.


METHOD
Thirty-eight patients with borderline personality disorder, diagnosed according to standardized criteria, were allocated either to a partially hospitalized group or to a standard psychiatric care (control) group in a randomized controlled design. Treatment, which included individual and group psychoanalytic psychotherapy, was for a maximum of 18 months. Outcome measures included the frequency of suicide attempts and acts of self-harm, the number and duration of inpatient admissions, the use of psychotropic medication, and self-report measures of depression, anxiety, general symptom distress, interpersonal function, and social adjustment. Data analysis used repeated measures analysis of covariance and nonparametric tests of trend.


RESULTS
Patients who were partially hospitalized showed a statistically significant decrease on all measures in contrast to the control group, which showed limited change or deterioration over the same period. An improvement in depressive symptoms, a decrease in suicidal and self-mutilatory acts, reduced inpatient days, and better social and interpersonal function began at 6 months and continued until the end of treatment at 18 months.


CONCLUSIONS
Psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalization is superior to standard psychiatric care for patients with borderline personality disorder.

142fd6328a1869deacbec00678d77a3250a67b2f,"Robots have massively been introduced in children’s lives, showing promising effects on education and learning. Parallel to this, children’s creative levels show a decline related to different factors, including the standardized teaching and learning dynamics present in traditional school systems. This work aims to investigate if the activities with robots already present in schools affect children’s creativity levels. To study this, we compared creative levels of children across three study conditions: (1) Experimental condition 1: Children performed STEM activities in school by learning how to program robots; (2) Experimental condition 2: Children performed STEAM activities by learning how to design robots; (3) Control condition: Children engaged in a music class. We applied the Test for Creative Thinking-Drawing Production (TCT-DP), a validated test that measures creative potential, before and after the intervention. Our results showed that the creativity levels of children increased from pre- to post-testing, revealing the effect of all intervention groups in potentiating creativity. Additionally, results showed that creative levels were significantly higher in the control condition. This result was expected since this condition consisted of an artistic musical intervention where creativity is foreseen to be stimulated. When analyzing the effects of the interventions on the two dimensions of TCT-DP (i.e., adaptiveness and innovativeness), results showed that both the control and the programming condition stimulated innovativeness.

This study examines historical risk factors (experiences and exposures that occurred prior to college) for penetrative sexual assault (PSA) victimization since entering college. Methods A cross-sectional study, including an online population-based quantitiative survey with undergraduate students was conducted in spring 2016. Bivariate analyses and multivariable regressions examined risk and protective factors associated with ever experiencing PSA since entering college. Concurrently-collected in-depth ethnographic interviews with 151 students were reviewed for information related to factors identified in the survey. Results In bivariate analyses, multiple historical factors were significantly associated with PSA in college including adverse childhood experiences and having experienced unwanted sexual contact before college (for women) and initiation of alcohol, marijuana, and sexual behaviors before age 18. Significant independent risk factors for college PSA included female gender, experiencing unwanted sexual contact before college, first oral sex before age 18, and “hooking up” (e.g., causual sex or sex outside a committed partnership) in high school. Receipt of school-based sex education promoting refusal skills before age 18 was an independent protective factor; abstinence-only instruction was not. In the ethnographic interviews, students reported variable experiences with sex education before college; many reported it was awkward and poorly delivered. Conclusions Multiple experiences and exposures prior to college influenced the risk of penetrative sexual assault in college. Pre-college comprehensive sexuality education, including skills-based training in refusing unwanted sex, may be an effective strategy for preventing sexual assault in college. Sexual assault prevention needs to begin earlier; successful prevention before college should complement prevention efforts once students enter college.","[{'authorId': '4903340', 'name': 'J.

 This paper describes a social robotic game player that is able to successfully play a team card game called Sueca. The question we will address in this paper is: how can we build a social robot player that is able to balance its ability to play the card game with natural and social behaviours towards its partner and its opponents. The first challenge we faced concerned the development of a competent artificial player for a hidden information game, whose time constraint is the average human decision time. To accomplish this requirement, the Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) algorithm was used. Further, we have performed an analysis of this algorithm's possible parametrizations for games trees that cannot be fully explored in a reasonable amount of time with a MinMax search. Additionally, given the nature of the Sueca game, such robotic player must master the social interactions both as a partner and as an opponent. To do that, an emotional agent framework (FAtiMA) was used to build the emotional and social behaviours of the robot. At each moment, the robot not only plays competitively but also appraises the situation and responds emotionally in a natural manner. To test the approach, we conducted a user study and compared the levels of trust participants attributed to the robots and to human partners. Results have shown that the robot team exhibited a winning rate of 60%. Concerning the social aspects, the results also showed that human players increased their trust in the robot as their game partners (similar to the way to the trust levels change towards human partners).

An exploratory descriptive case study was conducted with the Pepper robot and older adults with dementia using high-tech digital cameras to document significant communication proceedings that occurred during the activities. Data were collected in December 2020. The application program for an intentional conversation using Pepper was jointly developed by Tanioka’s team and the Xing Company, allowing Pepper’s words and head movements to be remotely controlled. The analysis of the results revealed four development issues, namely, (1) accurate sensing behavior for “listening” to voices appropriately and accurately interacting with subjects; (2) inefficiency in “listening” and “gaze” activities; (3) fidelity of behavioral responses; and (4) deficiency in natural language processing AI development, i.e., the ability to respond actively to situations that were not pre-programmed by the developer. Conversational engagements between the Pepper robot and patients with dementia illustrated a practical usage of technologies with artificial intelligence and natural language processing.

In all, 3470 UK residents responded to an online survey on their preferred ways of describing autism and their rationale for such preferences. The results clearly show that people use many terms to describe autism. The most highly endorsed terms were ‘autism’ and ‘on the autism spectrum’, and to a lesser extent, ‘autism spectrum disorder’, for which there was consensus across community groups. The groups disagreed, however, on the use of several terms. The term ‘autistic’ was endorsed by a large percentage of autistic adults, family members/friends and parents but by considerably fewer professionals; ‘person with autism’ was endorsed by almost half of professionals but by fewer autistic adults and parents. Qualitative analysis of an open-ended question revealed the reasons underlying respondents’ preferences.

Prospective evidence on psychological outcomes for children with specific language impairments (SLI) is accumulating. To date, there has been no attempt to summarise what this evidence says about the strength of link between SLI and later child and adolescent emotional and behavioural (EB) outcomes.


METHODS
We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis (following PRISMA guidelines and involving a literature search to June 2012 of seven databases, including MEDLINE and PsychAPA) of prospective, cohort studies of children with SLI and typical language development (TLD) reporting on the incidence and severity of EB problems later in childhood or adolescence.


RESULTS
Nineteen follow-up reports of eight cohorts with 553 SLI children and 1533 TLD controls were identified. Initial assessment was at 3-8.8 years of age and follow-up duration from 2 to 12 years. Pooled across comparable studies, SLI children were about two times more likely to show disorder levels of overall internalising problems, overall externalising and ADHD problems than TLD children. Compared with the average TLD child (50 percentile), at follow-up, the symptom severity of the average SLI child was at the 72 percentile (95% CI 65-79 percentile) on internalising symptoms, the 69 percentile (95% CI 63-74 percentile) on externalising symptoms and the 60 percentile (95% CI 52-68 percentile) on AHDH severity. The findings about risk to specific mental disorders and the severity of specific problems were inconclusive.


CONCLUSIONS
Relative to typical children, SLI children experience clinically important increases in the severity of diverse emotional, behavioural and ADHD symptoms and more frequently show a clinical level of these problems. The small number of studies included in pooled analysis and methodological heterogeneity reduce the precision and generalisability of the findings. Most studies do not account for initial levels of EB problems.","[{'authorId': '7221451', 'name': 'Shaun Goh Kok Yew'}, {'authorId': '1402262677', 'name': 'R.

The purpose of this study is to examine social conflicts with co-workers (SCCWs) as a predictor of job satisfaction with co-workers (JSCWs) on a daily basis. Moreover, dispositional emotion regulation (ER) was suggested to moderate the within-person relationship between daily conflicts at work and JSCWs. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Ninety-eight employees from German civil service agencies completed surveys across five consecutive work days. Dispositional variables and controls were assessed in a general survey which was completed before the start of the daily surveys. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Hierarchical linear modeling showed that SCCWs at noon were significantly related to employees’ JSCWs in the evening and that dispositional ER moderated this relationship, indicating that people with high abilities of ER reported higher levels of job satisfaction with their co-workers than people with low abilities of ER after experiencing SCCWs.

Cross-sectional and experimental knowledge highlight the contribution of various health-promoting behaviors, such as physical activity, regular sleep, and healthy nutrition to mental and physical health. Beyond these well-studied lifestyle behaviors, music listening and perceived respect in social interactions are just recently proposed everyday life experiences, which may act as health-promoting factors.


PURPOSE
This study tested the simultaneous contribution of several health-promoting behaviors and factors and examined listening to music and positive social interaction by means of perceived respect as new potentially preventive and health-promoting behaviors and factors using an ambulatory assessment design.


METHODS
Seventy-seven young healthy adults (38 women, 23.9 ± 4.5 years) completed surveys on their psychological state (i.e., mood, stress, and fatigue) five times a day for four consecutive days. A saliva sample was collected with each data entry to explore the physiological stress markers salivary cortisol, alpha-amylase, and flow rate as further outcome variables. As predictors, perceived respect, self-reported physical activity, the sleep's restfulness, daily coffee, alcohol, vegetable/fruit consumption, and music listening behavior were recorded.


RESULTS
Overall, restful sleep, mean daily perceived respect, and listening to music were most clearly associated with more positive psychological states, that is, better mood and lower fatigue and perceived stress. Associations with daily alcohol, coffee, and vegetable/fruit consumption appeared rather minor. While perceived respect scores were associated with lower daily cortisol output, coffee consumption was positively related to daily cortisol and alpha-amylase. Self-reported physical activity was unrelated to either outcome measure.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings provide important insights regarding potential resources of health (i.e., music and respect), their covariation, and which psycho-physiological mechanisms may underlie the links between health factors and well-being. Findings also have implications for the development of interventions aiming to increase resilience and foster health. Here, strategies for improving sleep quality, the use of music, and approaches that emphasize mutual respect and appreciation appear useful additions.","[{'authorId': '145390718', 'name': 'J.

170ce0d842b800bea81f7b1a26770233d8f39bf9,"Methamphetamine (MA) abusers commonly exhibit socially problematic behaviors, such as diminished empathy, decreased emotional regulation and interpersonal violence, which may be attributable to alterations in emotional experience. However, few studies have used functional MRI to examine directly the emotional experience of threatening or fearful non‐face images in MA abusers. In this study, we investigated possible differences in neural correlates of negative emotional experiences between abstinent MA abusers and healthy subjects using complex visual scenes depicting fear or threat derived from the International Affective Picture System. In within‐group analyses, healthy subjects and MA abusers activated a similarly distributed cortical network, prominently including the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal cortex. In between‐group analyses, however, MA abusers showed a reduced activation in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and insula, and increased activation in the fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, relative to healthy subjects. Hypoactivation of the insula in MA abusers relative to healthy subjects suggests that the ability to have an emotional response to threatening scenes and empathy for another's pain could be compromised in MA abusers. Hyperactivity in the fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex in MA abusers relative to healthy subjects indicates that threatening and fearful images from the International Affective Picture System may remind MA abusers of episodic memory related to similar experiences. Therefore, functional impairment of these neural networks in MA abusers may contribute to altered emotional experience in social interactions, which could lead to increased negative mood and stress in interpersonal communication.

The authors provide a brief overview over prominent theories of self-control, identifying implicit assumptions surrounding the effects of self-control that warrant empirical testing. They report the results of a meta-analysis of 102 studies (total N = 32,648) investigating the behavioral effects of self-control using the Self-Control Scale, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and the Low Self-Control Scale. A small to medium positive effect of self-control on behavior was found for the three scales. Only the Self-Control Scale allowed for a fine-grained analysis of conceptual moderators of the self-control behavior relation. Specifically, self-control (measured by the Self-Control Scale) related similarly to the performance of desired behaviors and the inhibition of undesired behaviors, but its effects varied dramatically across life domains (e.g., achievement, adjustment). In addition, the associations between self-control and behavior were significantly stronger for automatic (as compared to controlled) behavior and for imagined (as compared to actual) behavior.","[{'authorId': '4538808', 'name': 'D.

The distance of the political behavior was further found to moderate this relationship, with distant politics having little effect on the frequency–evaluation relationship, but politics with nearby impact yielding more negative evaluations as frequency increased. For positive conceptualizations of perceived politics, results revealed that respondents evaluated this form of politics more favorably the more it occurred. Further, positive political behavior was reported to be less desirable when its impact was believed to be at a distance rather than being felt by respondents personally.

School readiness, conceptualized as three components including emotional self-regulation, social competence, and family/school involvement, as well as absence of conduct problems play a key role in young children's future interpersonal adjustment and academic success. Unfortunately, exposure to multiple poverty-related risks increases the odds that children will demonstrate increased emotional dysregulation, fewer social skills, less teacher/parent involvement and more conduct problems. Consequently intervention offered to socio-economically disadvantaged populations that includes a social and emotional school curriculum and trains teachers in effective classroom management skills and in promotion of parent-school involvement would seem to be a strategic strategy for improving young children's school readiness, leading to later academic success and prevention of the development of conduct disorders.


METHODS
This randomized trial evaluated the Incredible Years (IY) Teacher Classroom Management and Child Social and Emotion curriculum (Dinosaur School) as a universal prevention program for children enrolled in Head Start, kindergarten, or first grade classrooms in schools selected because of high rates of poverty. Trained teachers offered the Dinosaur School curriculum to all their students in bi-weekly lessons throughout the year. They sent home weekly dinosaur homework to encourage parents' involvement. Part of the curriculum involved promotion of lesson objectives through the teachers' continual use of positive classroom management skills focused on building social competence and emotional self-regulation skills as well as decreasing conduct problems. Matched pairs of schools were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions.


RESULTS
Results from multi-level models on a total of 153 teachers and 1,768 students are presented. Children and teachers were observed in the classrooms by blinded observers at the beginning and the end of the school year. Results indicated that intervention teachers used more positive classroom management strategies and their students showed more social competence and emotional self-regulation and fewer conduct problems than control teachers and students. Intervention teachers reported more involvement with parents than control teachers. Satisfaction with the program was very high regardless of grade levels.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings provide support for the efficacy of this universal preventive curriculum for enhancing school protective factors and reducing child and classroom risk factors faced by socio-economically disadvantaged children.","[{'authorId': '1401771574', 'name': 'C.

In Study 1, we used a survey method with a sample of college students (N = 232) and found that social media addiction was negatively associated with the students' mental health and academic performance and that the relation between social media addiction and mental health was mediated by self-esteem. In Study 2, we developed and tested a two-stage self-help intervention program. We recruited a sample of college students (N = 38) who met criteria for social media addiction to receive the intervention. Results showed that the intervention was effective in reducing the students’ social media addiction and improving their mental health and academic efficiency.

198633da04b17331398c2c9423725c435b1265f1,"In spring 2020, COVID-19 and the ensuing social distancing and stay-at-home orders instigated abrupt changes to employment and educational infrastructure, leading to uncertainty, concern, and stress among United States college students. The media consumption patterns of this and other social groups across the globe were affected, with early evidence suggesting viewers were seeking both pandemic-themed media and reassuring, familiar content. A general increase in media consumption, and increased consumption of specific types of content, may have been due to media use for coping strategies. This paper examines the relationship between the stress and anxiety of university students and their strategic use of media for coping during initial social distancing periods in March-April 2020 using data from a cross-sectional survey. We examine links between specific types of media use with psychological well-being concepts, and examine the moderating roles of traits (hope, optimism, and resilience) as buffers against negative relationships between stress and anxiety and psychological well-being. Our findings indicate that stress was linked to more hedonic and less eudaimonic media use, as well as more avoidant and escapist media-based coping. Anxiety, on the other hand, was linked to more media use in general, specifically more eudaimonic media use and a full range of media-based coping strategies. In turn, escapist media was linked to negative affect, while reframing media and eudaimonic media were linked to positive affect. Avoidant coping was tied to poorer mental health, and humor coping was tied to better mental health. Hedonic and need-satisfying media use were linked to more flourishing. Hope, optimism, and resilience were all predictive of media use, with the latter two traits moderating responses to stress and anxiety. The findings give a nuanced portrait of college students’ media use during a pandemic-induced shutdown, showing that media use is closely intertwined with well-being in both adaptive and maladaptive patterns.","[{'authorId': '40616070', 'name': 'A.

1993bd174ebcffaff036724b1182627afdfff129,"BACKGROUND
Self-regulation (SR) is central to developmental psychopathology, but progress has been impeded by varying terminology and meanings across fields and literatures.


METHODS
The present review attempts to move that discussion forward by noting key sources of prior confusion such as measurement-concept confounding, and then arguing the following major points.


RESULTS
First, the field needs a domain-general construct of SR that encompasses SR of action, emotion, and cognition and involves both top-down and bottom-up regulatory processes. This does not assume a shared core process across emotion, action, and cognition, but is intended to provide clarity on the extent of various claims about kinds of SR. Second, top-down aspects of SR need to be integrated. These include (a) basic processes that develop early and address immediate conflict signals, such as cognitive control and effortful control (EC), and (b) complex cognition and strategies for addressing future conflict, represented by the regulatory application of complex aspects of executive functioning. Executive function (EF) and cognitive control are not identical to SR because they can be used for other activities, but account for top-down aspects of SR at the cognitive level. Third, impulsivity, risk-taking, and disinhibition are distinct although overlapping; a taxonomy of the kinds of breakdowns of SR associated with psychopathology requires their differentiation. Fourth, different aspects of the SR universe can be organized hierarchically in relation to granularity, development, and time. Low-level components assemble into high-level components. This hierarchical perspective is consistent across literatures.


CONCLUSIONS
It is hoped that the framework outlined here will facilitate integration and cross-talk among investigators working from different perspectives, and facilitate individual differences research on how SR relates to developmental psychopathology.","[{'authorId': '2456142', 'name': 'J.

The present research aims to assess the feasibility of conducting an RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a social skills intervention using Kinesics and Synchronisation in Personal Assistant Robotics (Kaspar) with children with ASD. Methods and analysis Forty children will be recruited. Inclusion criteria are the following: aged 5–10 years, confirmed ASD diagnosis, IQ over 70, English-language comprehension, a carer who can complete questionnaires in English and no current participation in a private social communication intervention. Children will be randomised to receive an intervention with a therapist and Kaspar, or with the therapist only. They will receive two familiarisation sessions and six treatment sessions for 8 weeks. They will be assessed at baseline, and at 10 and 22 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate whether the predetermined feasibility criteria for a full-scale trial are met. The potential primary outcome measures for a full-scale trial are the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Social Skills Improvement System. We will conduct a preliminary economic analysis. After the study has ended, a sample of 20 participants and their families will be invited to participate in semistructured interviews to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the study’s methods and intervention. Ethics and dissemination Parents/carers will provide informed consent, and children will give assent, where appropriate. Care will be taken to avoid pressure or coercion to participate. Aftercare is available from the recruiting NHS Trust, and a phased withdrawal protocol will be followed if children become excessively attached to the robot. The results of the study will be disseminated to academic audiences and non-academic stakeholders, for example, families of children with ASD, support groups, clinicians and charities.

1a8b5b08dc5b84aad84442cd7df42573582f9c9a,"We analyze studies on socio-emotional regulation in collaborative learning. The features and advantages of collaborative learning are described. We consider The role of academic emotions in the learning process. The emotional background plays an important role in the learning process in general and collaborative learning in particular. Students often experience problems in the emotional sphere during learning process, for the solution of which they use the strategy of “emotion suppression”. In this context, social-emotional interaction plays an important role in the learning process. Positive social and emotional interaction contributes to increased motivation, harmonious functioning of the group and greater involvement in the learning process. Negative socio-emotional interaction creates difficulties for the process of group learning and is realized in directive forms of social regulation. The N.G. Lobczowski’s model describes the process of formation and regulation of emotions in the process of collaborative learning. According to this model, emotion formation spans the first four stages (context, stimulus event, appraisal, and emotional response) leading to the regulation. An important aspect of the socio-emotional interaction is the socio-emotional discourse. To create positive social and emotional conditions for learning, it is important to show interest in other members of the group, express social responsiveness, positively assess the progress in completing the task and the actions of group members, and express mutual support between participants. Solving problems and conflicts between group members is necessary to maintain a sense of cohesion among group members. The solution of the problems associated with the socio-emotional interaction requires the socio-emotional regulation, that is, responding to the manifestation of emotions in the group, solving the problems of the group and supporting positive interaction between group members. Students can apply behavioral, interpersonal, cognitive, motivational and motivational-cognitive socioemotional regulation strategies.","[{'authorId': '2176125686', 'name': 'Antonina S.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that depression vulnerability is related to difficulties with emotion regulation by comparing recovered-depressed and never-depressed participants (N = 73). In the first phase, participants completed questionnaires assessing their typical use of emotion regulation strategies. In the second phase, sad mood was induced using a film clip, and the degree to which participants reported to have spontaneously used suppression versus reappraisal to regulate their emotions was assessed. In the third phase, participants received either suppression or reappraisal instructions prior to watching a second sadness-inducing film. As predicted, suppression was found to be ineffective for down-regulating negative emotions, and recovered-depressed participants reported to have spontaneously used this strategy during the first sadness-inducing film more often than controls. However, the groups did not differ regarding the effects of induced suppression versus reappraisal on negative mood.

1b3f25f8c0fc413a0cb4b5bde8f3c602c3be352b,"Abstract. Affective disorders, specifically Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorders, show high prevalence, relapse rates, and a high likelihood to develop a chronic course. For the past two decades, research has investigated the neural correlates of emotion processing and emotion regulation in patients with affective disorders. Putative underlying causal mechanisms of dysregulated affect have been informed by knowledge from the intersection of neuroimaging and clinical psychology. More recent investigations also consider processing the role of mostly negative, self-blaming social emotions, which have been linked to treatment resistance and, hence, provide a prolific target for intervention. Several psychotherapeutic treatment approaches already focus on emotion, and here specific knowledge about the mechanisms underlying persistent changes in affect bears the potential to improve the treatment of affective disorders. In this narrative review, we delineate why and how our insights into the neural correlates of emotion processing and regulation can be applied to the treatment of patients with affective disorders.","[{'authorId': '49875383', 'name': 'K.

The designer's task of shaping technology is fundamentally concerned with the creation of form. Form is the total expression of a product, including physical shape, materials, and behavioral qualities. In creating form, design balances the needs of people, the capabilities of technology, and the context of use to support an activity or action. In this paper we present The Hug, a conceptual design exploration of form for a robotic product that facilitates intimate communication across distance. We discuss the role of form in constructing meaningful relationships through The Hug and other robotic products.","[{'authorId': '143903307', 'name': 'C.

A battery of tests assessing short-term memory (STM), sustained attention, executive functions (EFs), reading and math skills were administered. Significant deficits in EFs and STM were restricted to the groups of students displaying inattention symptoms and were only marginally elevated among students showing hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms alone, in comparison to their non-symptomatic peers. A similar pattern of group differences was observed on tests assessing word- and text-level reading skills. Impaired performance on sustained attention tasks was less evident. Among students who manifested inattention symptoms, those who also showed impaired reading skills presented more severe EFs deficits than typically achieving students. Results demonstrated a close link between EFs, other than inhibition and set-shifting, everyday symptoms of inattention, and achievement in math and word-level reading skills.","[{'authorId': '36423452', 'name': 'S.

1bde26b36d252f02095146dcdafecb5de27daa09,"Over the past few years, volunteerism in the U.S. has declined from an estimated 50% of U.S. adults collectively logging volunteer hours equivalent to five million fulltime jobs (Meier and Stutzer, 2008) to a recent low of only 25% of Americans engaged in volunteer work (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014). The driving force behind many charitable groups is the blood, sweat, and tears of a sizeable volunteer base. For example, the American Red Cross has approximately 400,000 U.S. volunteers comprising 94% of its humanitarian workforce (American Red Cross, 2014) and saw donations of 5.7 million units of blood during the 2013 fiscal year (American Red Cross, 2013). In that same fiscal year, Habitat For Humanity depended upon 309,687 volunteer worker-hours to complete approximately 12,673 home construction projects for economically disadvantaged persons in Africa and the Middle East alone (Habitat for Humanity International, 2013). Twenty-five thousand Make-a-Wish volunteers across America each spent an average of 12 hours granting 14,000 wishes last year (Make-A-Wish[R] Foundation of America, 2014). The personal sacrifices of time, energy, and resources by these volunteers are a critical component in the success of the charitable or service organizations they choose to support. However, limited research has examined the job attitudes of volunteers, many of whom play distinct and important roles within organizations. An understanding of how some particular characteristics of both volunteers and organizations influence job attitudes that are critical to retaining reliable, productive volunteers is important. In two studies using data from independent samples collected from two different volunteer organizations an examination of the interactive effects of volunteers' work engagement and their perceptions of organizational politics on job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions is conducted using an adaptation of Chacon et al.'s (2007) Volunteer Duration of Service Model. Volunteer work is much different from voluntary group membership and involves the giving of one's time and effort without the expectation of direct financial compensation (Thoits and Hewitt, 2001). The purpose of volunteer work is to better a community or a specific subset of a community which is in need (Wilson and Musick, 1997). Thus, volunteer work is a planned long-term form of social participation that promotes good citizenship and a sense of community, both of which facilitate social action for the common good (Omoto and Malsch, 2005; Penner, 2002; Snyder and Omoto, 2008). Even though volunteers earn no direct financial compensation for their time and effort, they often enjoy higher levels of life satisfaction (Meier and Stutzer, 2008), better self-esteem and physical health, an increased sense of control, as well as lower levels of depression (Thoits and Hewitt, 2001). Over time, many people report a change in their self-concept as they grow to see their role in life not only as that of an employee, spouse, or sibling, but also as that of a volunteer, which further perpetuates longevity in the volunteer role (Callero, 1985; Callero et al., 1987; Grube and Piliavin, 2000). This change in self-concept is an important outcome and can be examined under the lens of social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner, 1979), which suggests that individuals think of themselves as psychologically linked to groups of which they are members. Being a full-fledged active volunteer member of an organization of which one is proud and in which one finds respect from other members fosters discretionary behaviors (Tyler and Blader, 2001) upon which volunteer service organizations are so heavily dependent. Managing volunteers is an ongoing struggle for organizations that are often faced with also managing paid employees. Despite volunteers being unpaid, their roles in these organizations are not unlike those of paid employees in that they perform activities that require effort, time, and responsible behavior inside the organization (Vecina et al. …","[{'authorId': '145204203', 'name': 'B.

In previous theoretical studies, researchers have suggested that there are universal, prototypical facial expressions specific to basic emotions. However, the results of some empirical studies that tested the production of emotional facial expressions based on particular scenarios only partially supported the theoretical predictions. In addition, all of the previous studies were conducted in Western cultures. We investigated Japanese laypeople (n = 65) to provide further empirical evidence regarding the production of emotional facial expressions. The participants produced facial expressions for six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) in specific scenarios. Under the baseline condition, the participants imitated photographs of prototypical facial expressions. The produced facial expressions were automatically coded using FaceReader in terms of the intensities of emotions and facial action units. In contrast to the photograph condition, where all target emotions were shown clearly, the scenario condition elicited the target emotions clearly only for happy and surprised expressions. The photograph and scenario conditions yielded different profiles for the intensities of emotions and facial action units associated with all of the facial expressions tested. These results provide partial support for the theory of universal, prototypical facial expressions for basic emotions but suggest the possibility that the theory may need to be modified based on empirical evidence.","[{'authorId': '46581944', 'name': 'W.

In this paper, we present the outcomes of a study in which we explored 60 children's (aged 8-14) perceptions of social robots using ten fictional scenarios. From data analysis, we elicited four major themes that become the pillars of a model that represent children's perception of social robots (agency, comprehension, socioemotional features, and physicality). The model shows the complex and often paradoxical nature of children's acceptance (hope) and rejection (fear) of social robots in their lives. Our outcome provides the foundations of a new responsible approach in analyzing and designing social robots for children using hopes and fear as a lens.","[{'authorId': '1797180', 'name': 'Elisa Rubegni'}, {'authorId': '1908716', 'name': 'Laura Malinverni'}, {'authorId': '145964520', 'name': 'Jason C.

In this article I review the methodological and conceptual advances in recent moderator variable research. I then report the results of a number of empirical analyses of three newly proposed idiographic moderator variables: scalability, metatraits, and construct similarity, as well as the ipsatized variance index. The results of these analyses indicate that moderator effect sizes in personality can be expected to correspond to a correlation of about .10. I then consider two recent prescriptions, (a) aggregating trait-specific moderators into general ones, and (b) evaluating joint (e.g., triple interaction) moderator effects. Following these prescriptions did not increase the size of the moderator effects in these data. I conclude that moderator effects in personality will be small, and will thus be most reliably detected in very large samples with predictors that are strongly related to the criteria. Even small moderator effects can be important and interesting in the context of theory disconfirmation. However, moderator variables generally will not serve to transform weak relations among personality variables into strong ones.","[{'authorId': '2163170814', 'name': 'William F.

Effective training will therefore require the social signals produced by a robot to be contingent with people's knowledge and expectations of social cognition and behaviour. Designing recognisable facial expressions is an important part of this challenge; ensuring interactions are more believable and motivating. This design process requires - amongst other factors - consideration of how culture and native language affects social signal processing. In this experiment participants offered a full-bodied robot (named 'Alyx') food items to which Alyx reacted autonomously, producing either an approving or disapproving expression. Participant's responded to these expressions (i.e. the robots social signals) by indicating whether Alyx liked or disliked the food. Task performance was examined both quantitatively (response time and accuracy) and qualitatively (participant's reactionary expressions). The results revealed significant cultural differences, as non-native English speakers were less accurate at interpreting expressions, but also a similar response trend between these groups. Qualitative analysis supported the notion that Alyx's expressions were not universally understood. These findings are discussed in the context of social skills training.","[{'authorId': '35148616', 'name': 'Peter E.

The threat posed by COVID-19 continues and clinicians, administrators, and families need to know the life conditions associated with more psychological problems to modify them and minimize their effect on mental health. The goal was to study the life conditions of adolescents during lockdown and their association with psychological problems. A total of 226 parents of 117 girls and 109 boys (mean age: 13.9; Standard deviation: 0.28) from the community that were participants in a longitudinal study answered an online questionnaire about life conditions during lockdown and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Stepwise regression analyses controlling by previous reports of SDQ were performed. Conduct, peer, prosocial, and total problems scores increased after lockdown. After adjusting for previous measures of psychopathology, worse adolescents’ mental health during COVID-19 lockdown was associated with unhealthy activities, worsening of the relationships with others, and dysfunctional parenting style. It seems important to mitigate psychological stress in a situation of isolation due to a state of emergency by keeping the adolescent active and maintaining their daily habits and routines in a non-conflictive atmosphere and give support to parents.","[{'authorId': '5365955', 'name': 'L.

This paper aims to test the effects of perception of organizational politics (POPS) on work outcomes–work engagement, innovative work behaviour and turnover intention. Mediating role of work engagement and the moderating role of locus of control (LOC) on perceived organizational politics–outcome (innovative work behaviour and turnover intention) relationship was investigated. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Data were gathered from a sample of 302 full-time managerial employees in India. Results suggest that perceived organizational politics is significantly related to intention to quit and innovative work behaviour, and this relationship is partially mediated by work engagement. LOC moderates the organizational politics–work outcomes (work engagement and innovative work behaviour) relationship. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The current research demonstrates that availability of a work environment, where there are unfair decisions, nepotism and favoritism, is an impediment to engagement, innovative work behaviour and retention of managers. It behooves of top management therefore focusing on reducing POPS and subsequent deficits in motivation by providing clear feedback regarding which behaviours their organization desires. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
The study focused on POPS as reported by the employees and not on actual political behaviours. As the study did not cover all sectors, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
The study extended the current research stream of perceived organizational politics research to one of the underrepresented developing Asian countries, India. The study also contributes in terms of its sample characteristics. Managerial employees working across different sectors, served as the setting of our empirical study.","[{'authorId': '47298080', 'name': 'Upasna A.

In Study 2, goal pursuit and achievement mediated the relation between patience and well-being. Participants rated 10 personal goals on 15 dimensions of goal pursuit (e.g. patience enacted, difficulty, achievement satisfaction, effort). Patience facilitated goal pursuit and satisfaction especially in the face of obstacles. In Study 3, participants took part in a training program designed to increase trait patience. The program led to increased patience, decreased depression, and increased positive affect relative to a control condition, suggesting that patience may be modifiable.","[{'authorId': '10735300', 'name': 'Sarah A.

Different strategies may be adopted to achieve successful emotion regulation, ranging from attentional control (e.g., distraction) to cognitive change (e.g., reappraisal). However, there is only scarce evidence comparing the different regulation strategies with respect to their neural mechanisms and their effects on emotional experience. We, therefore, directly compared reappraisal and distraction in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with emotional pictures. In the distraction condition participants performed an arithmetic task, while they reinterpreted the emotional situation during reappraisal to downregulate emotional intensity. Both strategies were successful in reducing subjective emotional state ratings and lowered activity in the bilateral amygdala. Direct contrasts, however, showed a stronger decrease in amygdala activity for distraction when compared with reappraisal. While both strategies relied on common control areas in the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex was selectively activated for reappraisal. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate and large clusters in the parietal cortex were active in the distraction condition. Functional connectivity patterns of the amygdala activation confirmed the roles of these specific activations for the 2 emotion regulation strategies.","[{'authorId': '2197918', 'name': 'Philipp Kanske'}, {'authorId': '39587811', 'name': 'J.

To address this gap, this paper presents the initial results of a descriptive review of 38 peer-reviewed papers on this topic. Qualitative analysis revealed four opportunity themes where interactive technologies appear to provide unique benefits. The analysis also revealed three challenge themes where design guidance, particularly around emotion representation, is ambiguous or underspecified.

Methods for creating future multimodal emotional data for robot interactions were studied in this case study of a 40-year-old male patient with disorganized schizophrenia without comorbidities. The qualitative data included heart rate variability (HRV), video-audio recordings, and field notes. HRV, Haar cascade classifier (HCC), and Empath API© were evaluated during conversations between the patient and robot. Two expert nurses and one psychiatrist evaluated facial expressions. The research hypothesis questioned whether HRV, HCC, and Empath API© are useful for creating future multimodal emotional data about robot–patient interactions. The HRV analysis showed persistent sympathetic dominance, matching the human–robot conversational situation. The result of HCC was in agreement with that of human observation, in the case of rough consensus. In the case of observed results disagreed upon by experts, the HCC result was also different. However, emotional assessments by experts using Empath API© were also found to be inconsistent. We believe that with further investigation, a clearer identification of methods for multimodal emotional data for robot interactions can be achieved for patients with schizophrenia.","[{'authorId': '9311083', 'name': 'K.

In this contribution we address the topic of healthcare robots and privacy. We use actor network theory (ANT) to shed light on the privacy implications of healthcare robots from a specific theoretical point of view. ANT is a descriptive, constructivist approach that takes into account the agency of objects, concepts and ideas as well as the relationality of technology and the social. It has been applied to complex technological innovations, such as ehealth systems. We use some of the main concepts of ANT—actants, translations, tokens/quasiobjects, punctualization, obligatory passage point—to “map” the privacy ecosystem in robotic healthcare technology, thereby analyzing the complex interplay of robots and humans in that context. Altogether, our contribution shows that ANT is a fruitful lens through which to study the interaction between humans and (social) robots because of its richness of useful concepts, its balanced perspective which evades both technology-determinism and social-determinism, and its openness towards new connected technology.","[{'authorId': '6889723', 'name': 'C.

Research has demonstrated that among professional caregivers, compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout (BO), and compassion fatigue (CF) are important factors contributing to professional quality of life. The current research aims to provide normative information regarding the factors contributing to professional quality of life among those who interact with survivors of trauma. The Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) Scale is a widely used measure of CS, BO, and CF. The most recent iteration of the ProQOL manual provides normative data to assist in the interpretation of scores. However, a review of the literature reporting raw scores on the ProQOL suggests that mean scores and cutoff scores for the 25th and 75th percentiles may be misleading. Method: A review of 30 studies (total sample size of 5,612) was conducted and normative values are presented. Results: The mean (standard deviation) level of CS, CF, and BO were 37.7 (6.5), 16.7 (5.7), and 22.8 (5.4), respectively. Conclusions: Values gathered from the literature review tend to align well with one another and suggest that within a given sample, CS scores tend to be higher than BO scores, and BO scores tend to be slightly higher than CF scores.","[{'authorId': '39351416', 'name': 'Gabriel M.

In their first year of postgraduate training, interns commonly work shifts that are longer than 24 hours. Extended-duration work shifts are associated with increased risks of automobile crash, particularly during a commute from work. Interns may be at risk for other occupation-related injuries.


OBJECTIVE
To assess the relationship between extended work duration and rates of percutaneous injuries in a diverse population of interns in the United States.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
National prospective cohort study of 2737 of the estimated 18,447 interns in US postgraduate residency programs from July 2002 through May 2003. Each month, comprehensive Web-based surveys that asked about work schedules and the occurrence of percutaneous injuries in the previous month were sent to all participants. Case-crossover within-subjects analyses were performed.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Comparisons of rates of percutaneous injuries during day work (6:30 am to 5:30 pm) after working overnight (extended work) vs day work that was not preceded by working overnight (nonextended work). We also compared injuries during the nighttime (11:30 pm to 7:30 am) vs the daytime (7:30 am to 3:30 pm).


RESULTS
From a total of 17,003 monthly surveys, 498 percutaneous injuries were reported (0.029/intern-month). In 448 injuries, at least 1 contributing factor was reported. Lapse in concentration and fatigue were the 2 most commonly reported contributing factors (64% and 31% of injuries, respectively). Percutaneous injuries were more frequent during extended work compared with nonextended work (1.31/1000 opportunities vs 0.76/1000 opportunities, respectively; odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-1.78). Extended work injuries occurred after a mean of 29.1 consecutive work hours; nonextended work injuries occurred after a mean of 6.1 consecutive work hours. Injuries were more frequent during the nighttime than during the daytime (1.48/1000 opportunities vs 0.70/1000 opportunities, respectively; OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.98-2.11).


CONCLUSION
Extended work duration and night work were associated with an increased risk of percutaneous injuries in this study population of physicians during their first year of clinical training.","[{'authorId': '2236026213', 'name': 'Najib Ayas'}, {'authorId': '5137082', 'name': 'L.

For example, to establish the time of a personal or family event, a Himba may refer to the epoch of the disarming or the epoch of the locust invasion as readily as we refer to 1917 or 1923. Such a chronological system is naturally of interest to the student of African history, for it is a key to the events that are considered important by the Himba themselves. But beyond this, a system of ordered epochs is also of value for demographic and other sociological studies in which the ages of individuals are important for, while the Himba, like most non-literate peoples, do not enumerate the years of their lives or the years that have passed since crucial events, many are able to provide the names of the epochs of their birth, marriage, childrens' births, and so forth. It remains, then, for the investigator merely to correlate the epochal names with our numbered years in order to determine, with a fair degree of approximation, individuals' current ages and their ages at their life crises -- data which are important for certain kinds of detailed sociological research. In essence this procedure is simple enough, but establishing a sufficiently accurate correlation between the Himba epochs and the numbered years has proved to be a difficult task and one requiring a variety of approaches. The nature of the Himba epochal chronology and the method employed for correlating it with the years of the Christian calendar are the subjects of this paper.","[{'authorId': '2165433023', 'name': 'Gordon D.

Material and methods A sample of high school Italian students (n = 996; M = 240, F = 756) was examined using a self-report survey concerning sociodemographic characteristics, cigarette smoking, alcohol and substance use, perceived academic performance, activities, and behaviors (Internet use, gambling, and physical exercising). The Internet Addiction Test, the South Oaks Gambling Screen-revised Adolescent, and the Exercise Addiction Inventory-Short Form were administered to identify problematic behaviors. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale for Adolescent, the Snaith–Hamilton Pleasure Scale, the Dissociative Experience Scale for Adolescent, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale were used to investigate psychopathological dimensions. Results Frequent alcohol intake and lifetime substances consumption were more common among males. The occurrence of other addictive behaviors was 22.1% for problematic Internet use (M = F), 9.7% for at-risk/problematic gambling (M > F), and 6.2% for maladaptive physical exercise (M = F). We also found an association between substance-/non-substance-related addictive behaviors and psychopathological dimensions. Addictive behaviors were more frequent among students reporting poor school performance. Conclusion Our study showed a relevant prevalence of addictive behaviors in a sample of Italian high school students, with specific gender differences. We underlined the cooccurrence of substance and non-substance-related addictive behaviors, and their association with worse school performance. Dissociative proneness, anhedonia, alexithymia, and impulsivity were associated with addictive behaviors in adolescents and might represent vulnerability factors for the development of psychiatric disorders in adulthood. A better understanding of psychopathological features associated with addictive behaviors might be useful for the prevention/early intervention.","[{'authorId': '79562347', 'name': 'M.

In this study of 259 therapists, time spent with counseling trauma victims was the best predictor of trauma scores. Although participants generally believed in the usefulness of recommended coping strategies including leisure activities, self-care activities and supervision, these beliefs did not translate into time devoted to engaging in the activities. Most importantly, there was no association between time devoted to coping strategies and traumatic stress scores.

To discover the true nature of approach-avoidance motivation, psychologists need to move beyond this hedonic principle to the principles that underlie the different ways that it operates. One such principle is regulatory focus, which distinguishes self-regulation with a promotion focus (accomplishments and aspirations) from self-regulation with a prevention focus (safety and responsibilities). This principle is used to reconsider the fundamental nature of approach-avoidance, expectancy-value relations, and emotional and evaluative sensitivities. Both types of regulatory focus are applied to phenomena that have been treated in terms of either promotion (e.g., well-being) or prevention (e.g., cognitive dissonance). Then, regulatory focus is distinguished from regulatory anticipation and regulatory reference, 2 other principles underlying the different ways that people approach pleasure and avoid pain.","[{'authorId': '2259978159', 'name': 'E.

On 31 January 2020, a new type of coronavirus was first confirmed in Italy and spread rapidly across the country leading to a national lockdown. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the impact of the public health emergency due to COVID-19 on individual's mental health among 299 Italian adults after a month of home isolation due to COVID-19.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study design. Adults of the general population were invited to a voluntary online health survey.


METHODS
Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to examine diverse psycho-social and stressful contextual factors associated with symptoms of psychopathology.


RESULTS
Results indicated that females reported higher symptoms of depression, anxiety and circadian rhythm dysregulation, than males. Age and the capacity to adapt to a new environment and to cope with illness were negatively associated with all symptoms of psychopathology. Conversely, engaging in verbally aggressive behaviours and having experienced stressful events related to COVID-19 were positively related to psychopathological symptoms. Finally, social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and substance use during the past months was related to circadian rhythm dysregulation.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings of this study raise particular concern about psychological well-being considering the negative associations between stressful events during the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms of psychological distress, and perceived social support. These results have possible significant clinical implications.","[{'authorId': '134693682', 'name': 'Simone Amendola'}, {'authorId': '8864699', 'name': 'Valentina Spensieri'}, {'authorId': '4181210', 'name': 'M.

To assess disordered online social networking use via modified diagnostic criteria for substance dependence, and to examine its association with difficulties with emotion regulation and substance use.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional survey study targeting undergraduate students. Associations between disordered online social networking use, internet addiction, deficits in emotion regulation and alcohol use problems were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses of covariance.


SETTING
A large University in the Northeastern United States.


PARTICIPANTS
Undergraduate students (n = 253, 62.8% female, 60.9% white, age mean = 19.68, standard deviation = 2.85), largely representative of the target population. The response rate was 100%.


MEASUREMENTS
Disordered online social networking use, determined via modified measures of alcohol abuse and dependence, including DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale and the Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilt, Eye-opener (CAGE) screen, along with the Young Internet Addiction Test, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II, White Bear Suppression Inventory and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale.


FINDINGS
Disordered online social networking use was present in 9.7% [n = 23; 95% confidence interval (5.9, 13.4)] of the sample surveyed, and significantly and positively associated with scores on the Young Internet Addiction Test (P < 0.001), greater difficulties with emotion regulation (P = 0.003) and problem drinking (P = 0.03).


CONCLUSIONS
The use of online social networking sites is potentially addictive. Modified measures of substance abuse and dependence are suitable in assessing disordered online social networking use. Disordered online social networking use seems to arise as part of a cluster of symptoms of poor emotion regulation skills and heightened susceptibility to both substance and non-substance addiction.","[{'authorId': '2743232', 'name': 'J.

Using a sample of 411 responses to a two-wave questionnaire survey generated from six cities in China, we find that external employability positively influenced turnover intention, but internal employability negatively influenced turnover intention. The results also indicate that POS had a positive moderating effect only on the relationship between external employability and turnover intention. Furthermore, for employees with disengaged career orientation, external employability exerts a strong impact on turnover intention. This study adds to the limited research empirically linking employability and turnover intention, whereas the findings can be used by HRM practitioners to factor in organizational support and career orientation initiatives that improve the retention of employees with high external employability.","[{'authorId': '103775459', 'name': 'Yevhen Baranchenko'}, {'authorId': '2149182709', 'name': 'Yizhong Xie'}, {'authorId': '49290480', 'name': 'Zhibin Lin'}, {'authorId': '40116076', 'name': 'M.

These relationships were primarily due to individual differences within classrooms rather than average classroom differences. Children also wrote projective stories about an ambiguous classroom scene. Ratings of these stories indicated that, within children's fantasy, origin-like behavior of students was associated with autonomy-oriented teachers and low aggression. Self-report and projective methods converged, particularly for children whose self-reported perceptions were extreme.

209d1ecc421633c1a9f8a28c2bfa30110bcfe008,"BACKGROUND
Child sexual abuse is a significant problem that requires an effective means of prevention.


OBJECTIVES
To assess: if school-based programmes are effective in improving knowledge about sexual abuse and self-protective behaviours; whether participation results in an increase in disclosure of sexual abuse and/or produces any harm; knowledge retention and the effect of programme type or setting.


SEARCH STRATEGY
Electronic searches of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts and other databases using MESH headings and text words specific for child sexual assault and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted in August 2006.


SELECTION CRITERIA
RCTs or quasi-RCTs of school-based interventions to prevent child sexual abuse compared with another intervention or no intervention.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Meta-analyses and sensitivity analysis, using two imputed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (0.1, 0.2), were used for four outcomes: protective behaviours, questionnaire-based knowledge, vignette-based knowledge and disclosure of abuse. Meta-analysis was not possible for retention of knowledge, likelihood of harm, or effect of programme type and setting.


MAIN RESULTS
Fifteen trials measuring knowledge and behaviour change as a result of school-based child sexual abuse intervention programmes were included. Over half the studies in each initial meta-analysis contained unit of analysis errors. For behaviour change, two studies had data suitable for meta-analysis; results favoured intervention (OR 6.76, 95% CI 1.44, 31.84) with moderate heterogeneity (I(2)=56.0%) and did not change significantly when adjustments using intraclass coefficients were made. Nine studies were included in a meta-analysis evaluating questionnaire-based knowledge. An increase in knowledge was found (SMD 0.59; 0.44, 0.74, heterogeneity (I2=66.4%). When adjusted for an ICC of 0.1 and 0.2 the results were SMD 0.6 (0.45, 0.75) and 0.57 (0.44, 0.71) respectively. Heterogeneity decreased with increasing ICC. A meta-analysis of four studies evaluating vignette-based knowledge favoured intervention (SMD 0.37 (0.18, 0.55)) with low heterogeneity (I(2)=0.0%) and no significant change when ICC adjustments were made. Meta-analysis of between-group differences of reported disclosures did not show a statistically significant difference.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Studies evaluated in this review report significant improvements in knowledge measures and protective behaviours. Results might have differed had the true ICCs from studies been available or cluster-adjusted results been available. Several studies reported harms, suggesting a need to monitor the impact of similar interventions. Retention of knowledge should be measured beyond 3-12 months. Further investigation of the best forms of presentation and optimal age of programme delivery is required.","[{'authorId': '5768133', 'name': 'K. Zwi'}, {'authorId': '3951965', 'name': 'S.

Women report using most emotion regulation strategies more than men do, and emotion regulation strategies are similarly related to psychopathology in women and men. More rumination in women compared to men partially accounts for greater depression and anxiety in women compared to men, while a greater tendency to use alcohol to cope partially accounts for more alcohol misuse in men compared to women.

Although mobile phones and web-based communication are ubiquitous, touch—a communication modality that conveys powerful messages—is inexistent in modern communications media. This paper describes a tele-touch device that transfers affective touch to another person through the internet. Commands for vibration, warmth, and tickle were sent over the internet to a haptic device at the subjects’ forearm. With a heart rate (HR) monitor and a galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor, the physiological effect of the tele-touch device was evaluated as the subjects watched an emotionally-laden movie. We compared these to one group of subjects who were touched by their spouse or girlfriend and to subjects of a control group where no touch was provided. Results show that the HR of the subjects with the tele-touch device was not significantly different from those subjects who were touched by their loved ones. These results were in contrast to the subjects who were not provided with any form of touch. On the other hand, the GSR results revealed that all the three touch conditions were different from one another.","[{'authorId': '3154763', 'name': 'J.

Expanding early childhood education and child care enrollments, better scientific knowledge about early childhood development, and decisions about public spending, necessitate careful consideration of which assessment tools to use, as well as why and when to use them. More specifically, the disconnection between the importance of social and emotional domains of development, and their status within educational programming and assessment, has long been lamented. The last several years have, however, witnessed a blossoming of attention to these areas during early childhood, as crucial for both concurrent and later well-being and mental health, as well as learning and academic success. Teachers view children's ""readiness to learn"" and ""teachability"" as marked by positive emotional expressiveness, enthusiasm, and ability to regulate emotions and behaviors. Based on these assertions, I suggest a battery of preschool social–emotional outcome measures, tapping several constructs central to emotional and social competence theory, specifically emotional expression, emotion regulation, emotion knowledge, social problem solving, and positive and negative social behavior.","[{'authorId': '40099467', 'name': 'S.

219b7e3de72be02bf7d5219d653d5a85fd1d94a8,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder typically assessed and diagnosed through observational analysis of behavior. Assessment exclusively based on behavioral observation sessions requires a lot of time for the diagnosis. In recent years, there is a growing need to make assessment processes more motivating and capable to provide objective measures of the disorder. New evidence showed that motor abnormalities may underpin the disorder and provide a computational marker to enhance assessment and diagnostic processes. Thus, a measure of motor patterns could provide a means to assess young children with autism and a new starting point for rehabilitation treatments. In this study, we propose to use a software tool that through a smart tablet device and touch screen sensor technologies could be able to capture detailed information about children’s motor patterns. We compared movement trajectories of autistic children and typically developing children, with the aim to identify autism motor signatures analyzing their coordinates of movements. We used a smart tablet device to record coordinates of dragging movements carried out by 60 children (30 autistic children and 30 typically developing children) during a cognitive task. Machine learning analysis of children’s motor patterns identified autism with 93% accuracy, demonstrating that autism can be computationally identified. The analysis of the features that most affect the prediction reveals and describes the differences between the groups, confirming that motor abnormalities are a core feature of autism.","[{'authorId': '117771125', 'name': 'Roberta Simeoli'}, {'authorId': '32302973', 'name': 'Nicola Milano'}, {'authorId': '34838813', 'name': 'Angelo Rega'}, {'authorId': '1716365', 'name': 'D.

However, enthusiasm for this topic continues to outstrip conceptual clarity, and there remains considerable uncertainty as to what is even meant by “emotion regulation.” The goal of this review is to examine the current status and future prospects of this rapidly growing field. In the first section, I define emotion and emotion regulation and distinguish both from related constructs. In the second section, I use the process model of emotion regulation to selectively review evidence that different regulation strategies have different consequences. In the third section, I introduce the extended process model of emotion regulation; this model considers emotion regulation to be one type of valuation, and distinguishes three emotion regulation stages (identification, selection, implementation). In the final section, I consider five key growth points for the field of emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

21a120ae1dfd5e2b2aee868aab94f03b40462475,"Can robots help children be more creative? In this work, we posit social robots as creativity support tools for children in collaborative interactions. Children learn creative expressions and behaviors through social interactions with others during playful and collaborative tasks, and socially emulate their peers’ and teachers’ creativity. Social robots have a unique ability to engage in social and emotional interactions with children that can be leveraged to foster creative expression. We focus on two types of social interactions: creativity demonstration, where the robot exhibits creative behaviors, and creativity scaffolding, where the robot poses challenges, suggests ideas, provides positive reinforcement, and asks questions to scaffold children’s creativity. We situate our research in three playful and collaborative tasks - the Droodle Creativity game (that affords verbal creativity), the MagicDraw game (that affords figural creativity), and the WeDo construction task (that affords constructional creativity), that children play with Jibo, a social robot. To evaluate the efficacy of the robot’s social behaviors in enhancing creative behavior and expression in children, we ran three randomized controlled trials with 169 children in the 5–10 yr old age group. In the first two tasks, the robot exhibited creativity demonstration behaviors. We found that children who interacted with the robot exhibiting high verbal creativity in the Droodle game and high figural creativity in the MagicDraw game also exhibited significantly higher creativity than a control group of participants who interacted with a robot that did not express creativity (p < 0.05*). In the WeDo construction task, children who interacted with the robot that expressed creative scaffolding behaviors (asking reflective questions, generating ideas and challenges, and providing positive reinforcement) demonstrated higher creativity than participants in the control group by expressing a greater number of ideas, more original ideas, and more varied use of available materials (p < 0.05*). We found that both creativity demonstration and creativity scaffolding can be leveraged as social mechanisms for eliciting creativity in children using a social robot. From our findings, we suggest design guidelines for pedagogical tools and social agent interactions to better support children’s creativity.","[{'authorId': '51134075', 'name': 'Safinah Ali'}, {'authorId': '2008007778', 'name': 'Nisha Devasia'}, {'authorId': '2756001', 'name': 'Hae Won Park'}, {'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

We designed a gaze cue for Geminoid-a highly humanlike android-and Robovie-a robot with stylized, abstract humanlike features-that allowed the robots to “leak” information on what they might have in mind. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we asked participants to play a game of guessing with either of the robots and evaluated how the gaze cue affected participants' task performance. We found that the gaze cue did, in fact, lead to better performance, from which we infer that the cue led to attributions of mental states and intentionality.

The extended model was strongly supported for all four organizations at all three points of measurement, accounting for 40%--60% of the variance in usefulness perceptions and 34%--52% of the variance in usage intentions.

How well can members of distinct cultures recognize (or ""decode"") each other's emotion expressions? The question of cultural universality versus specificity in emotional expression has been a hot topic of debate for more than half a century, but, despite a sizeable amount of empirical research produced to date, no convincing answers have emerged. We suggest that this unsatisfactory state of affairs is due largely to a lack of concern with the precise mechanisms involved in emotion expression and perception, and propose to use a modified Brunswikian lens model as an appropriate framework for research in this area. On this basis we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature and point to research paradigms that are likely to provide the evidence required to resolve the debate on universality vs. cultural specificity of emotional expression. Applying this fresh perspective, our analysis reveals that, given the paucity of pertinent data, no firm conclusions can be drawn on actual expression (encoding) patterns across cultures (although there appear to be more similarities than differences), but that there is compelling evidence for intercultural continuity in decoding, or recognition, ability. We also note a growing body of research on the notion of ingroup advantage due to expression ""dialects,"" above and beyond the general encoding or decoding patterns. We furthermore suggest that these empirical patterns could be explained by both universality in the underlying mechanisms and cultural specificity in the input to, and the regulation of, these expression and perception mechanisms. Overall, more evidence is needed, both to further elucidate these mechanisms and to inventory the patterns of cultural effects. We strongly recommend using more solid conceptual and theoretical perspectives, as well as more ecologically valid approaches, in designing future studies in emotion expression and perception research.","[{'authorId': '2462740', 'name': 'K.

Background: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes. Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r̄ = +0.26, with an experimental effect size of d̄ = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role. Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors. Application: The findings provide quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors influencing HRI trust. Specifically, the current summary provides effect size estimates that are useful in establishing design and training guidelines with reference to robot-related factors of HRI trust. Furthermore, results indicate that improper trust calibration may be mitigated by the manipulation of robot design.

Aim: To study the effectiveness of psycho-motivational training program in improving social skills and emotional regulation in patients with schizophrenia. Design: A quasi-experimental design (pre/posttest single group type) was used. Sample: A purposive sample of sixty patients with schizophrenia participated in this study. Setting: the study was carried out in El kasr El Ainy Psychiatric and Addiction hospital. Tools for data collection were: Sociodemographic and Medical data sheet, Observable Social Cognition Rating Scale was aimed to investigate the construction of social cognition; Toronto Alexithymia Scale was used to assess the difficulty of recognizing and describing emotions; Brief Negative Symptom Scale was used for measuring social withdrawal, emotional withdrawal or diminished emotional range, avolition, alogia, and anhedonia; and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was used to measure respondents’ tendency to regulate their emotions. The program consisted of 14 sessions. Results: The study results showed that there were highly statistically significant differences between the observable social cognition, identifying and describing emotions, self-evaluation of negative symptoms, and emotion regulation through before, after, and follow-up implementation of the program. Conclusion: The findings revealed that psycho-motivational training for patients with schizophrenia had a great positive effect on improving social skills, and emotional recognition . As well as the training program was effective in improving negative symptoms among patients with schizophrenia. Recommendation: The study recommended that the essential need for increment empowered psychiatric mental health nurses and other team members with psychoeducation and training programs to help patients acquire social skills and control inappropriate emotions for engaging in adaptive relationships with others in the modern hospitals’ environment.","[{'authorId': '1422504774', 'name': 'Saida El-Azzab'}, {'authorId': '2115268489', 'name': 'Shimaa Ali'}, {'authorId': '1753036855', 'name': 'Basma H.

My investigation of these processes has prompted the development of several social cognitive models: a triadic model that synthesized covert, behavioral, and environmental sources of personal feedback, a multilevel model of training that begins with observational learning and proceeds sequentially to self-regulation, and a cyclical phase model that depicts the interaction of metacognitive and motivational processes during efforts to learn. Empirical support for each of these models is discussed, including its implications for formal and informal forms of instruction. This self-regulation research has revealed that students who set superior goals proactively, monitor their learning intentionally, use strategies effectively, and respond to personal feedback adaptively not only attain mastery more quickly, but also are more motivated to sustain their efforts to learn.

Male patients meeting criteria for comorbid IA (n = 71) were compared with a matched control group of male patients treated for alcohol addiction without addictive Internet use (n = 58). The SCL-90-R, the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder were used to assess associated psychiatric symptoms and further comorbid disorders. Comorbid IA was associated with higher levels of psychosocial symptoms, especially depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and interpersonal sensitivity. Moreover, the patients with IA more frequently met criteria for additional mental disorders. They display higher rates of psychiatric symptoms, especially depression, and might be in need of additional therapeutic treatment. In rehabilitation centers, a regular screening for IA is recommended to identify patients with this (non–substance-related) addiction and supply them with additional disorder-specific treatment.","[{'authorId': '2076720928', 'name': 'K.

To examine the association between early childhood speech and language disorders and young adult psychiatric disorders.


METHOD
In a longitudinal community study conducted in the Ottawa-Carleton region of Ontario, Canada, interviewers administered structured psychiatric interviews to age 19 participants who were originally identified as speech-impaired only, language-impaired, or nonimpaired at age 5. The first stage of the study took place in 1982 when participants were 5 years old, and the latest stage of the study took place between 1995 and 1997 when participants had a mean age of 19 years. This report examines the association between early childhood speech/language status and young adult psychiatric outcome.


RESULTS
Children with early language impairment had significantly higher rates of anxiety disorder in young adulthood compared with nonimpaired children. The majority of participants with anxiety disorders had a diagnosis of social phobia. Trends were found toward associations between language impairment and overall and antisocial personality disorder rates. Males from the language-impaired group had significantly higher rates of antisocial personality disorder compared with males from the control group. Age of onset and comorbidity did not differ by speech/language status. The majority of participants with a disorder had more than one.


CONCLUSIONS
Results support the association between early childhood speech and language functioning and young adult psychiatric disorder over a 14-year period. This association underscores the importance of effective and early interventions.","[{'authorId': '4244466', 'name': 'J. Beitchman'}, {'authorId': '2230492763', 'name': 'B.

Analysis showed that the scenarios could elicit play as expected (young children did more functional play and older children did more pretend play). However, children presented less pretend play with the robot than they did without the robot.

Whether it is a bird raising an alarm, a whale calling to potential partners, a dog responding to human commands, a parent reading a story with a child, or a business-person accessing stock prices using \emph{Siri}, vocalisation provides a valuable communication channel through which behaviour may be coordinated and controlled, and information may be distributed and acquired. Indeed, the ubiquity of vocal interaction has led to research across an extremely diverse array of fields, from assessing animal welfare, to understanding the precursors of human language, to developing voice-based human-machine interaction. Opportunities for cross-fertilisation between these fields abound; for example, using artificial cognitive agents to investigate contemporary theories of language grounding, using machine learning to analyse different habitats or adding vocal expressivity to the next generation of language-enabled autonomous social agents.

To understand the role of patients' attributions under the attribution theory framework (locus, controllability, stability) in nurses' performance of surface or deep acting, as they unfold in interactions with different patients.


BACKGROUND
Regulation of emotions at work, or emotional labour, has been conceptualized in terms of two main strategies: surface acting and deep acting. Most prior research tested for between-subject variation in the search for the factors evoking these strategies in nurses, assuming them to be trait-like characteristics. Only scant research has examined how nurses modify their emotional labour strategies in different patient-nurse encounters.


DESIGN
A nested cross-sectional design (patients within nurses).


METHODS
Data were collected during 2011-2012 through validated questionnaires from the nursing staff (N = 41) of two paediatric hospital wards and their randomly selected patients (N = 239). Questionnaires were administered to nurses multiple times after encounters with different patients. Analyses were conducted using mixed effects models.


RESULTS
In accordance with attribution theory, different combinations of locus, controllability and stability attributions were related to the choice of surface or deep acting. Nurses' perceptions of patients' controllability were associated positively with surface acting and negatively with deep acting. Interaction terms of stability and locus and of controllability and stability, were distinctively associated with deep and surface acting.

A total of 644 higher education students participated in the study. To test the questionnaire’s structural validity and generalizability across cultures and educational levels, confirmatory factor and cross validation analyses were carried out. Besides, to test its predictive validity, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out. Results showed that the data fit the model well, that the scales of the questionnaire have adequate reliability, and that negative selfregulation of stress and avoidance-oriented self-regulation related negatively and significantly to academic performance.

In a 2 (negative trigger: taskdirected vs. personal attack) x 2 (repair: yes vs. no) between subjects experiment (N=57 teams, 114 participants), we studied the effect of a robot intervention on affect, perceptions of conflict, perceptions of team members’ contributions, and team performance during a problem-solving task. Specifically, the robot either intervened by repairing a task-directed or personal attack by a confederate or did not intervene. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the robot’s repair interventions increased the groups’ awareness of conflict after the occurrence of a personal attack thereby acting against the groups’ tendency to suppress the conflict. These findings suggest that repair heightened awareness of a normative violation. Overall, our results provide support for the idea that robots can aid team functioning by regulating core team processes such as conflict.

This said, the book’s critique of early intervention practice may go too far in ignoring the potential benefits that can accrue from timely support and intervention. The authors’ definition of “early intervention”, in this context, is age-based, limited to early years. It would be interesting to see this defined more broadly, for example, as in the provision of rapid (early) support for families when there is a specific identified need or concern. While well researched, some of the book’s assertions are based on broad, sweeping empirical claims that are not supported by independent sources for verification. It’s possible that some of these claims are “common knowledge” in the UK context, but they may not be known elsewhere. The book has an activist flavour and in many cases uses emotive language to convey its arguments, which may appeal to some readers but not to others. Overall, the writing style is very readable and the book provides a critical lens to an area of practice that often goes unquestioned. The book would especially appeal to professionals working in family support services, social policy makers, and teachers and students of social policy. The case studies would be particularly useful in a learning context, as would the “alternative visions” presented in Chapter eight, which provide a useful springboard for further debate and discussion about individual risk versus social harm.","[{'authorId': '143897045', 'name': 'P.

We find convergent evidence that emotional expressions influence observers' affective reactions, inferential processes, and behaviors across various domains, including close relationships, group decision making, customer service, negotiation, and leadership. Affective reactions and inferential processes mediate the effects of emotional expressions on observers' behaviors, and the relative potency of these mediators depends on the observers' information processing and the perceived appropriateness of the emotional expressions. The social effects of emotions are similar across expressive modalities (face, voice, body, text, symbols). We discuss the findings in relation to emotional contagion, emotional intelligence, emotion regulation, emotions as social information (EASI) theory, and the functionality of emotions in engendering social influence. Finally, we identify gaps in our current understanding of the topic and call for interdisciplinary collaboration and methodological diversification.

The primary components of the model, namely cognitive representations, emotional representations, and coping responses, were examined. Design: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. The data were analysed using an established thematic analysis procedure. Study sample: Twenty-five adults with mild-moderate hearing loss from the UK and nine hearing healthcare professionals from the UK, USA, and Canada were recruited via maximum variation sampling. Results: Cognitive representations: Most participants described their hearing loss as having negative connotations and consequences, although they were not particularly concerned about the progression or controllability/curability of the condition. Opinions differed regarding the benefits of understanding the causes of one’s hearing loss in detail. Emotional representations: negative emotions dominated, although some experienced positive emotions or muted emotions. Coping responses: engaged coping (e.g. hearing aids, communication tactics) and disengaged coping (e.g. withdrawal from situations, withdrawal within situations): both had perceived advantages and disadvantages. Conclusions: This novel application of the self-regulatory model demonstrates that it can be used to capture the key psychosocial experiences (i.e. perceptions, emotions, and coping responses) of adults with mild-moderate hearing loss within a single, unifying framework.","[{'authorId': '37580585', 'name': 'E.

25ee841d4d6b93c84b3020874b38d2cbae3f7d6e,"Infant attachment is theorized to lay the foundation of emotion regulation across the life span. However, testing this proposition requires prospective designs examining whether attachment assessed in infancy predicts emotion regulation strategies observed in adult relationships. Using unique data from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation, we examined whether infant attachment assessed at 12 and 18 months in the Strange Situation were associated with attachment-relevant emotion regulation strategies coded from video-recorded conflict discussions with romantic partners at ages 20, 23, 26, and/or 35. The current research first integrated the developmental and emotion regulation literatures to identify three specific attachment-relevant emotion regulation strategies. Balanced-regulation involves being open, approach-orientated, and engaging in collaborative problem-solving. Hypo-regulation involves suppressing emotions, disengaging from close others, and engaging in superficial problem-solving. Hyper-regulation involves exaggerating emotional expressions, ruminating, and being self-focused in processing issues. Compared to stable secure infants (secure at 12 and 18 months), stable insecure infants (insecure at 12 and 18 months) displayed worse balanced-regulation and greater hypo-regulation strategies, and unstable insecure infants (insecure at 12 or 18 months) displayed greater hyper-regulation strategies, in relationship-threatening situations 20-35 years later. Conceptually replicating these results, greater friendship insecurity at age 16 predicted worse balanced-regulation and greater hypo- and hyper-regulation strategies during relationship-threatening situations in adulthood. These findings highlight that infant attachment insecurity is associated with distinct emotion regulation strategies in adulthood 20-35 years later.

The type and intensity of a job search did, however, depend on employees' perception of various labor market opportunities.

Although task conflict is widely believed to be beneficial whereas relationship conflict is destructive, evidence overall does not support this conclusion. This study develops the idea that the emotion regulation abilities of team members affect how they manage task and relationship conflict, both as individuals and as a team. Findings from a field study involving 39 teams support the argument that individuals skilled in emotion regulation can take advantage of task conflict to perform effectively and limit the negative impact of relationship conflict. Groups that have individuals highly skilled in emotion regulation were also found to make good use of team conflict. Results suggest that emotion regulation skills contribute to the effective management of task conflict and relationship conflict at both individual and group levels.

To examine whether changes in cognitive reappraisal self-efficacy (CR-SE) mediate the effects of individually administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (I-CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) on severity of social anxiety symptoms.


METHOD
A randomized controlled trial in which 75 adult patients (21-55 years of age; 53% male; 57% Caucasian) with a principal diagnosis of generalized SAD were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of I-CBT (n = 38) or a wait-list control (WL) group (n = 37). All patients completed self-report inventories measuring CR-SE and social anxiety symptoms at baseline and post-I-CBT/post-WL, and I-CBT completers were also assessed at 1-year posttreatment.


RESULTS
Compared with WL, I-CBT resulted in greater increases in CR-SE and greater decreases in social anxiety. Increases in CR-SE during I-CBT mediated the effect of I-CBT on social anxiety. Gains achieved by patients receiving I-CBT were maintained 1-year posttreatment, and I-CBT-related increases in CR-SE were also associated with reduction in social anxiety at the 1-year follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
Increasing CR-SE may be an important mechanism by which I-CBT for SAD produces both immediate and long-term reductions in social anxiety.","[{'authorId': '1810531', 'name': 'P.

The role and purpose of SROs in the educational setting have evolved over time, often without formalized policies or guidelines. Increasingly, SROs have been called upon to deal with school discipline issues, which has inadvertently increased the likelihood of student contact with the juvenile justice system, and promoted the school-to-prison pipeline. This has impacted minorities and students with disabilities, especially those with emotional behavioral disorders, who are disproportionately at risk of exposure to adjudication. The purpose of this review is to examine the availability and nature of current state legislation and Department of Education (DOE) recommendations regarding the use and training of SROs.

Single-blind randomized controlled trial with 2 groups of patients aged 18-65 with SSDs on partial hospitalization. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 16 group sessions with MOSST or conventional SST, both in addition to standard care, over 4 months, with a 6-month follow-up. Psychosocial functioning, metacognition, and symptom outcomes were measured by blind assessors. Statistical analyses used mixed models to estimate treatment effects in each postrandomization time point. Thirty-six patients were randomly assigned to the MOSST group and 33 patients to the conventional SST group. Between-group differences were significant in favor of MOSST on Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) and Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) total scores at post-treatment and follow-up. Concerning PSP subscales, there were significant between-group differences in favor of MOSST at follow-up on socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Metacognition only improved following MOSST group. For people with SDDs, MOSST appears to have short- and long-term beneficial effects on social functioning and symptoms.

The traditional moral dilemma is though a classical and established paradigm for studying moral decision, however, still has been widely criticized for its unrealistic scenarios and lack of effective indicators to quantify utilitarian and deontological response, which strongly affect the accurate interpretation of moral decision-making. To overcome the shortcomings of traditional moral dilemma paradigm, the CNI model of moral decision-making uses multinomial modeling to quantify the individual sensitivity regarding consequences and moral norms, and general behavioral preference, and therefore can more clearly identify the factors that affect moral decision-making. Future research should focus on further factors that affect moral decision-making, the ecological validity of moral scenarios, and cross-cultural generalisability to optimize the CNI model, and the investigation of the underlying psychological mechanism of moral decision-making.","[{'authorId': '2117101073', 'name': 'Kepeng Xu'}, {'authorId': '2037718622', 'name': 'Lingqian Yang'}, {'authorId': '2109164088', 'name': 'Jiahong Wu'}, {'authorId': '2053313398', 'name': 'Hong Xue'}, {'authorId': '2108021964', 'name': 'Shuyue Zhang'}]",1.0,,45.0,Application of the CNI model in the studies of moral decision,2020.0

The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population and among health care professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors, and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{'authorId': '143878050', 'name': 'L.

In this review, we used the process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 1998) to organize the existing literature on positive interventions and to advance theory by clarifying the mechanisms underlying their effectiveness. We have proposed that positive emotions can be increased both in the short- and longer-term through 5 families of emotion regulation strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation), showing how these emotion regulation strategies can be applied before, during, and after positive emotional events. Regarding short-term increases in positive emotions, our review found that attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation strategies have received the most empirical support, whereas more work is needed to establish the effectiveness of situation selection and situation modification strategies. Regarding longer-term increases in positive emotions, strategies such as situation selection during an event and attentional deployment before, during, and after an event have received strong empirical support and are at the center of many positive interventions. However, more work is needed to establish the specific benefits of the other strategies, especially situation modification. We argue that our emotion regulation framework clarifies existing interventions and points the way for new interventions that might be used to increase positive emotions in both nonclinical and clinical populations.","[{'authorId': '2360887', 'name': 'J.

For social robots to provide long-term added value to people's lives, it is of major importance to stress the need for positive user experience UX of such robots. The human-centered view emphasizes various aspects that emerge in the interaction between humans and robots. However, a positive UX does not appear by itself but has to be designed for and evaluated systematically. In this paper, the focus is on the role and relevance of UX in human-robot interaction HRI and four trends concerning the role and relevance of UX related to socially interactive robots are identified, and three challenges related to its evaluation are also presented. It is argued that current research efforts and directions are not sufficient in HRI research, and that future research needs to further address interdisciplinary research in order to achieve long-term success of socially interactive robots.","[{'authorId': '1748753', 'name': 'Beatrice Alenljung'}, {'authorId': '32185154', 'name': 'J.

With an implicit assumption that social and adaptive behaviour is desirable, it is therefore of interest to determine precisely how these aspects of behaviour may be exploited in robots to support children in their learning. In this paper, we explore this issue by evaluating the effect of a social robot tutoring strategy with children learning about prime numbers. It is shown that the tutoring strategy itself leads to improvement, but that the presence of a robot employing this strategy amplifies this effect, resulting in significant learning. However, it was also found that children interacting with a robot using social and adaptive behaviours in addition to the teaching strategy did not learn a significant amount. These results indicate that while the presence of a physical robot leads to improved learning, caution is required when applying social behaviour to a robot in a tutoring context.

The present study examined the psychometric properties of a measure of behavioral self-regulation called the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders (HTKS) by assessing construct validity, including relations to EF measures, and predictive validity to academic achievement growth between prekindergarten and kindergarten. In the fall and spring of prekindergarten and kindergarten, 208 children (51% enrolled in Head Start) were assessed on the HTKS, measures of cognitive flexibility, working memory (WM), and inhibitory control, and measures of emergent literacy, mathematics, and vocabulary. For construct validity, the HTKS was significantly related to cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control in prekindergarten and kindergarten. For predictive validity in prekindergarten, a random effects model indicated that the HTKS significantly predicted growth in mathematics, whereas a cognitive flexibility task significantly predicted growth in mathematics and vocabulary. In kindergarten, the HTKS was the only measure to significantly predict growth in all academic outcomes. An alternative conservative analytical approach, a fixed effects analysis (FEA) model, also indicated that growth in both the HTKS and measures of EF significantly predicted growth in mathematics over four time points between prekindergarten and kindergarten. Results demonstrate that the HTKS involves cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control, and is substantively implicated in early achievement, with the strongest relations found for growth in achievement during kindergarten and associations with emergent mathematics.","[{'authorId': '144704408', 'name': 'Megan M.

This distinction fits comfortably with folk theories, which view emotions as passions that arise unbidden and then must be controlled. But is it really helpful to distinguish between emotion generation and emotion regulation? In this article, we begin by offering working definitions of emotion generation and emotion regulation. We argue that in some circumstances, the distinction between emotion generation and emotion regulation is indeed useful. We point both to citation patterns, which indicate that researchers from across a number of sub-areas within psychology are making this distinction, and to empirical studies, which indicate the utility of this distinction in many different research contexts. We then consider five ways in which the distinction between emotion generation and emotion regulation can be problematic. We suggest that it is time to move beyond debates about whether this distinction is useful to a more specific consideration of when and in what ways this distinction is useful, and in this spirit, we offer recommendations for future research.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Data stemmed from a national student health survey from 2018 for higher education in Norway (the SHoT study), which invited all 162,512 fulltime students in Norway. A total of 50,054 students (69.1% women) aged 18–35 years were included, yielding a response rate of 30.8%. Sleep parameters, reported separately for weekdays and weekends, included calculations of bedtime, rise time, sleep duration, sleep‐onset latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep need and sleep deficit. Insomnia was defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edn) criteria. For the trend analysis, we used one item measuring difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, over three time points (2010, 2014 and 2018). The results from 2018 showed large weekday–weekend differences across most sleep parameters. Both male and female students obtained a mean sleep duration in the lower end of the normal range on weekdays (7:24 hr), but met their own sleep need and sleep recommendations at weekends (8:25 hr). The overall prevalence of insomnia was 34.2% in women and 22.2% in men. There was a substantial increase in sleep problems from 2010 (22.6%) to 2018 (30.5%), which was especially pronounced in women. We conclude that sleep problems are both prevalent and increasing among students.

Women with breast cancer may experience many symptoms resulting from the primary disease and/or treatment of the disease. It is very important the overall symptom experience from the patients' perspective is captured and understood by health professionals. The question developed was 'What is the symptom experience of women with breast cancer from time of diagnosis to completion of treatment'. The meta-synthesis process as developed by Sandelowski and Barroso was used to collect and analyse the data. The overarching idea emerging from this meta-synthesis is that the symptoms experience for women with breast cancer has effects on the very 'self' of the individual. Emerging is women's need to consider the existential issues that they face while simultaneously dealing with a multitude of physical and psychological symptoms. This meta-synthesis develops a new, integrated, and more complete interpretation of findings on the symptom experience of women with breast cancer.

The evaluation used both quantitative and qualitative methods, including informal discussions with staff and participants, observation, participant and teacher questionnaires, and school attendance and behavioural incident records. Pre- and postintervention data were collected on self-esteem, school attendance, antisocial behaviour, and levels of cooperation and collaboration. Students participating in DRUMBEAT increased their scores over a range of social indicators that act to increase connection with the school community. The results support the underlying program theory, that combining the therapeutic potential of musical expression with basic cognitive–behavioural therapy can be used successfully to deliver a range of social learning outcomes, including emotional control, improved relationships and increased self-esteem.

The Trauma Screening Questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory‐Short Form were utilized. Factors associated with trauma, burnout, and posttraumatic growth were analysed using logistic and multiple regressions. In total, 12 596 completed the survey, and 52.3% worked in COVID‐19 designated hospitals. At the survey’s conclusion in April, 13.3% reported trauma (Trauma ≥ 6), there were moderate degrees of emotional exhaustion, and 4,949 (39.3%) experienced posttraumatic growth. Traumatic response and emotional exhaustion were greater among (i) women (odds ratio [OR]: 1.48, 95% CI 1.12–1.97 P = 0.006; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.09–1.54, P = 0.003), (ii) critical care units (OR: 1.20, 95% CI 1.06–1.35, P = 0.004; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.23, 95% CI 1.12–1.33, P < 0.001) (iii) COVID‐19 designated hospital (OR: 1.24, 95% CI 1.11–1.38; P < 0.001; emotional exhaustion OR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.17–1.36; P < 0.001) and (iv) COVID‐19‐related departments (OR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04–1.29, P = 0.006, emotional exhaustion only). To date, this is the first large‐scale study to report the rates of trauma and burnout for nurses during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The study indicates that nurses who identified as women, working in ICUs, COVID‐19 designated hospitals, and departments involved with treating COVID‐19 patients had higher scores in mental health outcomes. Future research can focus on the factors the study has identified that could lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies for adverse health outcomes and better use of resources to promote positive outcomes.","[{'authorId': '4184334', 'name': 'Ruey Chen'}, {'authorId': '2118134359', 'name': 'Chao Sun'}, {'authorId': '2115851058', 'name': 'Jianjun Chen'}, {'authorId': '1931645615', 'name': 'Hsiu-Ju Jen'}, {'authorId': '148375716', 'name': 'X.

It examines a bidirectional model of cognition-emotion interaction in the development of self-regulation in which top-down executive control of thought and behavior develops in reciprocal and interactive relation to bottom-up influences of emotion and stress reactivity. The bidirectional model is examined within the context of innovative preschool interventions designed to promote school readiness by promoting the development of self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '6520193', 'name': 'A.

Identified publications were initially screened by title and abstract, and the full texts of remaining publications were then subsequently screened. Eligibility criteria Publications were included if they were journal articles, conference proceedings or conference proceedings published as monographs that described the conceptualisation, development, testing or evaluation of social robots for use with children with any mental or physical health condition or disability. Publications on autism exclusively, robots for use with children without identified health conditions, physically assistive or mechanical robots, non-physical hardware robots and surgical robots were excluded. Results Seventy-three publications were included in the review, of which 50 included user studies with a range of samples. Most were feasibility studies with small sample sizes, suggesting that the robots were generally accepted. At least 26 different robots were used, with many of these still in development. The most commonly used robot was NAO. The evidence quality was low, with only one randomised controlled trial and a limited number of experimental designs.

2cca63d18cabc4d6b6e9ef555223b2e160e29c8b,"The concept of employee turnover intention has been of great concern to corporations due to the severe cost implications it has on the bottom line of businesses. Interestingly, research has established appropriate leadership behaviours as effective means of mitigating the consequences of this phenomenon. Most of these studies were however done outside Ghana, with emphasis on transformational leadership and other styles of leadership. Given the fact that Ghana has high rate of unemployment, it was imperative to examine how the bivariate relationship in the leadership literature would be altered by alternative jobs. This paper therefore examined the influence of transactional leadership behaviours on employees’ turnover intention with the moderating effect of alternative job opportunity in the Ghanaian banking industry. A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational survey design was adopted for the study. Also, a multi-stage sampling approach was employed in selecting the three hundred and five (305) employees who completed the survey instrument. Correlational and hierarchical regression procedures were used to test the hypotheses. Even though transactional leadership was found not to statistically mitigate employees’ voluntary turnover intention, the availability of alternative job opportunities was found to moderate the transactional leadership-turnover intention nexus. Within the Ghanaian banking industry, leadership behaviours that do not focus more on the needs of subordinates as a critical part of task accomplishment will not be appreciated by employees and this stimulates their intention to quit their jobs for other lucrative offers.

Thus, standardized assessments are needed to facilitate identification of these symptoms. Many tools have been developed, but most are based on observer ratings. Self-evaluation can provide an additional outcome measure and allow patients to be more engaged in their treatment. The aim of this study was to present a novel tool, Self-evaluation of Negative Symptoms (SNS), and demonstrate its validity. Forty-nine patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders according to DSM-5 were evaluated. Cronbach's coefficient (α = 0.867) showed good internal consistency. Factor analysis extracted 2 factors (apathy and emotional) that accounted for 75.2% of the variance. The SNS significantly correlated with the Scale of Assessment of Negative Symptoms (r= 0.628) and the Clinician Global Impression on the severity of negative symptoms (r= 0.599), supporting good convergent validity. SNS scores did not correlate with level of insight (r= 0.008), Parkinsonism (r= 0.175) or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive subscores (r= 0.253), which indicates good discriminant validity. The intrasubject reliability of the SNS revealed excellent intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC = 0.942). Taken together, the results show that the SNS has good psychometric properties and satisfactory acceptance by patients. The study also demonstrates the ability of patients with schizophrenia to accurately report their own experiences. Self-assessments of negative symptoms should be more widely employed in clinical practice because they may allow patients with schizophrenia to develop appropriate coping strategies.","[{'authorId': '4179221', 'name': 'S.

2d1d97304285d3706f201b6f39f48fd65fdac513,"Agreement is a morphosyntactic dependency which is sensitive to the hierarchical structure of the clause and is constrained by the structural distance that separates the elements involved in this relation. In this paper we present two experiments, providing new evidence that Italian-speaking children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), as well as Typically Developing (TD) children, are sensitive to the same hierarchical and locality factors that characterise agreement in adult grammars. This sensitivity holds even though DLD children show accrued difficulties in more complex agreement configurations. In the first experiment, a forced-choice task was used to establish whether children are more affected in the computation of S-V agreement when an element intervenes hierarchically or linearly in the agreement relation: DLD children are more subject to attraction errors when the attractor intervenes hierarchically, indicating that DLD children discriminate between hierarchical and linear configurations. The second experiment, also conducted through a forced-choice task, shows that the computation of agreement in DLD children is more 'fragile' than in TD children (and also in children with a primary impairment in the phonological domain), in that it is more sensitive to the factors of complexity identified in Moscati and Rizzi's (2014) typology of agreement configurations. To capture the agreement pattern found in DLD children, we put forth a novel hypothesis: the Fragile Computation of Agreement Hypothesis. Its main tenet is that DLD children make use of the same grammatical operations employed by their peers, as demonstrated in Experiment 1, but difficulties increase as a function of the complexity of the agreement configuration.","[{'authorId': '22488207', 'name': 'V.

Drawing from the Job Demands–Resources model, in this enquiry we explored the moderating role of two contextual resources (i.e., trust in top management, history of change) and formal communication in the relationship between perceived organizational politics and commitment to change. Data were collected from 2543 employees of 84 companies representing a wide variety of industry sectors. In a first survey we collected data about the work context. Two weeks after the first survey, in a second survey we captured data on people's commitment to change. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was used to analyse the multilevel character of the data. Consonant with our hypotheses, the findings indicate that the negative relationship between perceived organizational politics and commitment to change is moderated by “trust in top management”, “history of change”, and “formal communication”.

Based on the reviewed literature, it was expected that job satisfaction, affective commitment, and perceived job security would moderate this relationship. Using a sample of working individuals from different occupations and sectors (N = 721), it was found that employees who perceived themselves as highly employable were more likely to have turnover intentions when their affective commitment was low and perceived job security was high; and the relationship was negative for employees with shorter tenures. Understanding the conditions under which perceived employability is associated with turnover intentions may help organizations design human resource policies that allow them to retain an educated and competent workforce.","[{'authorId': '8506337', 'name': 'Yalcin Acikgoz'}, {'authorId': '3225523', 'name': 'H.

Students in the competent SRL profile demonstrated the highest levels of academic self-concept, motivation, attitude, and the lowest level of test anxiety and best academic performance. Multinomial logistic regression analysis also indicated that learning experience factors (teaching quality, clear goals and standards, appropriate assessment and workload) were significant predictors of SRL profile membership.

However, the neural basis of emotional instability due to sleep debt has yet to be elucidated. This study investigated changes in emotional responses that are elicited by the simulation of short-term sleep loss and the brain regions responsible for these changes. Subjects and Methods Fourteen healthy adult men aged 24.1±3.3 years (range, 20–32 years) participated in a within-subject crossover study consisting of 5-day sessions of both sleep debt (4 h for time in bed) and sleep control (8 h for time in bed). On the last day of each session, participants underwent polysomnography and completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Profile of Mood States questionnaires. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted while performing an emotional face viewing task. Results Restricted sleep over the 5-day period increased the activity of the left amygdala in response to the facial expression of fear, whereas a happy facial expression did not change the activity. Restricted sleep also resulted in a significant decrease in the functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) in proportion to the degree of sleep debt (as indicated by the percentage of slow wave sleep and δ wave power). This decrease was significantly correlated with activation of the left amygdala and deterioration of subjective mood state. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that continuous and accumulating sleep debt that can be experienced in everyday life can downregulate the functional suppression of the amygdala by the vACC and consequently enhance the response of the amygdala to negative emotional stimuli. Such functional alteration in emotional control may, in part, be attributed to the neural basis of emotional instability during sleep debt.","[{'authorId': '1873955', 'name': 'Y.

These measures involved the comprehension and production of words and sentences in formal and spontaneous speaking activities as well as measures of verbal memory and auditory temporal perceptual ability. One set of tasks was administered in a standard face-to-face setting and the other set was given over the telephone. Multivariate and univariate tests indicated that the adults with a history of specific language impairment performed more poorly on all tasks administered. A discriminant analysis of the two sets of measures indicated that four measures in each set identified language-impaired individuals with 97% accuracy for the face-to-face battery and 95% accuracy for the telephone battery.

Pain appraisal (ratings of pain severity) and pain tolerance (submersion time) were recorded and examined in relation to humor indicators (number of laughs/smiles during each video and child ratings of how funny the video was). Whereas humor indicators were not significantly associated with pain appraisal or tolerance, the group demonstrated significantly greater pain tolerance while viewing funny videos than when viewing the videos immediately before or after the cold-water task.

The link between the interpersonal stressor of workplace mistreatment and objective measures of performance is often overlooked in organizational research. In order to fill this research gap, we examined the unique and combined effects of two sources of incivility (customer and coworker) on objective sales performance and withdrawal behaviors (absenteeism and tardiness). We hypothesized that coworker and customer incivility would interact to predict reduced performance and increased withdrawal, using the conservation of resources model to support our hypotheses. We surveyed 120 bank tellers regarding experienced incivility and obtained performance and withdrawal data spanning a period of several months following the survey. The data indicated that coworker and customer incivility did interact to predict decreased sales performance and increased absenteeism, supporting the majority of our proposed hypotheses.

The item content of hearing loss assessment tools should seek to capture the impact of hearing loss on everyday life, but to date no one has synthesized the range of hearing loss complaints from the perspectives of the person with hearing loss and their communication partner. The current review aims to synthesize the evidence on person with hearing loss- and communication partner-reported complaints of hearing loss. Searches were conducted in Cos Conference Papers Index, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica Database, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify publications from May 1982 to August 2015. A manual search of four relevant journals updated the search to May 2017. Of the 9,516 titles identified, 78 records (comprising 20,306 participants) met inclusion criteria and were taken through to data collection. Data were analyzed using meta-ethnography to form domains representing the person with hearing loss- and communication partner-reported complaints of hearing loss as reported in research. Domains and subdomains mutual to both perspectives are related to “Auditory” (listening, communicating, and speaking), “Social” (relationships, isolation, social life, occupational, and interventions), and “Self” (effort and fatigue, emotions, identity, and stigma). Our framework contributes fundamental new knowledge and a unique resource that enables researchers and clinicians to consider the broader impacts of hearing loss. Our findings can also be used to guide questions during diagnostic assessment and to evaluate existing measures of hearing loss.","[{'authorId': '7595387', 'name': 'Venessa Vas'}, {'authorId': '3772067', 'name': 'M.

An intensive package of risky-play activities was administered over a three-month period to two classes (four- and six-year-olds) and two age-matched classes served as controls. Before and after the intervention period, quantitative and qualitative aspects of risk competence were evaluated in all children by: (1) a change detection paradigm; (2) teacher ratings; and (3) independent observer's qualitative ratings. The results showed that risk perception and competence in young children can be improved through an intensive offer of risky-play activities at school.

A theoretical review of metacognitive research is presented, differentiating the existing research studies on control and the cognitive regulation from the research work that examines metacognition in the educational field. This article also reflects on the state of the metacognitive measurement and the difficulties to capture the metacognitive magnitude and scale as it relates to the capability to transfer these concepts to the educational world. It discusses viable ways to achieve a better development of the autonomy of the apprentices, being reflected in a ""learning to learn"" action that transcends the school environment and projects to all facets of meaningful learning.

The article attempts to understand the concept of emotional intelligence (EI) in higher education teachers and how it can be incorporated in effective teaching as emotional intelligence competencies (EIC) for superior performance. The technique of structural equation modelling (SEM) has been applied to validate and propose a model for EI-based teaching competencies and their relation with the core competencies. It was statistically proven that EIC have a strong impact on attitude of teachers which in turns contribute highest towards superior performance.

The average corrected intercorrelation matrix for the sample of studies showed that the CSM illness cognition dimensions of consequences, control/cure, identity and timeline followed a logical pattern supporting their construct and discriminant validity across illness types. A content analysis classified coping strategies into seven distinctive categories and health outcomes into six categories. Examining the average corrected correlation coefficients across the studies revealed that perceptions of a strong illness identity were significantly and positively related to the use of coping strategies of avoidance and emotion expression. In addition, perceived controllability of the illness was significantly associated with cognitive reappraisal, expressing emotions and problem-focused coping strategies. Perceptions of the illness as highly symptomatic, having a chronic timeline and serious consequences was significantly correlated with avoidance and expressing emotions coping strategies. Further, perceptions that the illness was curable/controllable was significantly and positively related to the adaptive outcomes of psychological well-being, social functioning and vitality and negatively related to psychological distress and disease state. Conversely, illness consequences, timeline and identity exhibited significant, negative relationships with psychological well being, role and social functioning and vitality.

Owing to accessibility, affordability, and scalability, an increasing number of digital health interventions (DHIs) have been developed and incorporated into MH treatment. Studies have shown the potential of DHIs to improve MH outcomes. However, the modes of delivery used to engage CYP in digital MH interventions may differ, with implications for the extent to which findings pertain to the level of engagement with the DHI. Knowledge of the various modalities could aid in the development of interventions that are acceptable and feasible. Objective This review aimed to (1) identify modes of delivery used in CYP digital MH interventions, (2) explore influencing factors to usage and implementation, and (3) investigate ways in which the interventions have been evaluated and whether CYP engage in DHIs. Methods A literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), and PsycINFO databases using 3 key concepts “child and adolescent mental health,” “digital intervention,” and “engagement.” Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed using rigorous inclusion criteria and screening by at least two reviewers. The selected articles were assessed for quality using the mixed methods appraisal tool, and data were extracted to address the review aims. Data aggregation and synthesis were conducted and presented as descriptive numerical summaries and a narrative synthesis, respectively. Results This study identified 6 modes of delivery from 83 articles and 71 interventions for engaging CYP: (1) websites, (2) games and computer-assisted programs, (3) apps, (4) robots and digital devices, (5) virtual reality, and (6) mobile text messaging. Overall, 2 themes emerged highlighting intervention-specific and person-specific barriers and facilitators to CYP’s engagement. These themes encompassed factors such as suitability, usability, and acceptability of the DHIs and motivation, capability, and opportunity for the CYP using DHIs. The literature highlighted that CYP prefer DHIs with features such as videos, limited text, ability to personalize, ability to connect with others, and options to receive text message reminders. The findings of this review suggest a high average retention rate of 79% in studies involving various DHIs. Conclusions The development of DHIs is increasing and may be of interest to CYP, particularly in the area of MH treatment. With continuous technological advancements, it is important to know which modalities may increase engagement and help CYP who are facing MH problems. This review identified the existing modalities and highlighted the influencing factors from the perspective of CYP. This knowledge provides information that can be used to design and evaluate new interventions and offers important theoretical insights into how and why CYP engage in DHIs.","[{'authorId': '1633553090', 'name': 'Shaun Liverpool'}, {'authorId': '65973448', 'name': 'C.

Yet little longitudinal research has evaluated whether there are different trajectories of self-regulation development across children. This study investigates the development of behavioral self-regulation between the ages of 3 and 7 years, with a direct focus on possible heterogeneity in the developmental trajectories, and a set of potential indicators that distinguish unique behavioral self-regulation trajectories. Across 3 diverse samples, 1,386 children were assessed on behavioral self-regulation from preschool through first grade. Results indicated that majority of children develop self-regulation rapidly during early childhood, and that children follow 3 distinct developmental patterns of growth. These 3 trajectories were distinguishable based on timing of rapid gains, as well as child gender, early language skills, and maternal education levels. Findings highlight early developmental differences in how self-regulation unfolds, with implications for offering individualized support across children.

303d5c4bd2de7d02f53f43b33ec92f50c91e67bd,"Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term (~5 min), and ultra-short-term (<5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from ~2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.","[{'authorId': '39186474', 'name': 'F.

This paper draws on information gathered from carers and adults with a disability living in a rural area in New South Wales (NSW), Australia to determine the extent to which people living in rural areas may receive a person-centred therapy service. Methods: As part of a larger study in rural NSW into the delivery of therapy services, focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 78 carers and 10 adults with a disability. Data were analysed using constant comparison and thematic analysis. Results: Three related themes emerged: (i) travelling to access therapy; (ii) waiting a long time to get therapy; and (iii) limited access to therapy past early childhood. The themes overlaid the problems of recruiting and retaining sufficient therapists to work in rural areas. Conclusions: Community-based rehabilitation principles offer possibilities for increasing person-centred therapy services. We propose a person-centred and place-based approach that builds on existing service delivery models in the region and involves four inter-related strategies aimed at reducing travel and waiting times and with applicability across the life course. Implications for Rehabilitation Therapy service delivery in rural and remote areas requires: Place-based and person centred strategies to build local capacity in communities. Responsive outreach programs working with individuals and local communities. Recognition of the need to support families who must travel to access remotely located specialist services. Innovative use of technology to supplement and enhance service delivery.","[{'authorId': '145984868', 'name': 'A.

In particular, peer interaction, especially with more advanced peers, can enhance preschool children's language growth. In this paper, we explore one factor that may modulate children's language learning with a peer-like social robot: rapport. We explore connections between preschool children's learning, rapport, and emulation of the robot's language during a storytelling intervention. We performed a long-term field study in a preschool with 17 children aged 4–6 years. Children played a storytelling game with a social robot for 8 sessions over two months. For some children, the robot matched the level of its stories to the children's language ability, acting as a slightly more advanced peer (Matched condition); for the others, the robot did not match the story level (Unmatched condition). We examined children's use of target vocabulary words and key phrases used by the robot, children's emulation of the robot's stories during their own storytelling, and children's language style matching (LSM—a measure of overlap in function word use and speaking style associated with rapport and relationship) to see whether they mirrored the robot more over time. We found that not only did children emulate the robot more over time, but also, children who emulated more of the robot's phrases during storytelling scored higher on the vocabulary posttest. Children with higher LSM scores were more likely to emulate the robot's content words in their stories. Furthermore, the robot's personalization in the Matched condition led to increases in both children's emulation and their LSM scores. Together, these results suggest first, that interacting with a more advanced peer is beneficial for children, and second, that children's emulation of the robot's language may be related to their rapport and their learning. This is the first study to empirically support that rapport may be a modulating factor in children's peer learning, and furthermore, that a social robot can serve as an effective intervention for language development by leveraging this insight.","[{'authorId': '2716110', 'name': 'J.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on the emotional regulation and loneliness of divorced women in Iran, a culture with strong honor values that condemn post-divorce relationships for women leading to increased levels of loneliness and social exclusion in divorced Iranian women. The present study was carried out using a pretest-posttest control group study design. The research sample consisted of 30 divorced women who were randomly assigned to experimental (vs. control) groups. In order to evaluate the variables of interest, the emotional regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and UCLA Loneliness Scale were used. Divorced women in the experimental group were treated using ACT techniques in eight sessions, each lasting 90 minutes. Results of analysis of covariance showed a significant increase in the adaptive emotional regulation of divorced women in the experimental group after the intervention. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the loneliness of divorced women who received the ACT intervention.

Several studies using student samples have provided validation for the ERQ, although the only article (Wiltink et al., 2011) that evaluated the ERQ in a community sample was unable to replicate the original factor structure. Before using the ERQ in non-student samples, it is important to validate the scale in a sample broadly representative of the adult population and to determine the influence of demographic variables. The current study examined the psychometric properties of the ERQ in 2 community samples (Australia, N = 550; United Kingdom, N = 483; 17-95 years of age) using confirmatory analysis. The original ERQ factor structure was not supported by either the Australian or United Kingdom samples. However, with the removal of 1 item, a strong model fit was obtained for both samples (9-item ERQ [ERQ-9]). Using measurement invariance tests, the revised ERQ-9 was found to be equivalent across the samples and demographics (age, gender, and education). Gender, depression, anxiety, and stress were the only factors that were significantly associated with reappraisal and suppression use. Overall, the ERQ-9 provides better fit of the data than the 10-item ERQ.

The research results show that the ATYIs’ moral choice is influenced by psychological factors, and that, with the improvement of the psychological quality of the ATYIs, their moral judgement ability will be greatly enhanced, leading to better moral choices.","[{'authorId': '2156642548', 'name': 'Bo Liu'}, {'authorId': '32392415', 'name': 'Li-Shu Luo'}, {'authorId': '144718633', 'name': 'Qianyin Xiao'}]",3.0,,24.0,Determination and Correlation Analysis of Moral Choice Influencing Factors among Ant Tribe Young Intellectuals Based on Cognitive Neuroscience,2018.0

This paper explores a naturalistic scenario in which children play chess with the iCat, a robot companion. A person-independent, Bayesian approach to detect the user's engagement with the iCat robot is presented. Our framework models both causes and effects of engagement: features related to the user's non-verbal behaviour, the task and the companion's affective reactions are identified to predict the children's level of engagement. An experiment was carried out to train and validate our model. Results show that our approach based on multimodal integration of task and social interaction-based features outperforms those based solely on non-verbal behaviour or contextual information (94.79 % vs. 93.75 % and 78.13 %).","[{'authorId': '39540970', 'name': 'Ginevra Castellano'}, {'authorId': '11845717', 'name': 'André Pereira'}, {'authorId': '39799707', 'name': 'Iolanda Leite'}, {'authorId': '145136631', 'name': 'Ana Paiva'}, {'authorId': '2803283', 'name': 'P.

This might contribute considerably to the development of social cognition and interaction difficulties. The characteristics of the voice recognition deficit in ASD are unknown. Here, we used a comprehensive behavioral test battery to systematically investigate voice processing in high‐functioning ASD (n = 16) and typically developed pair‐wise matched controls (n = 16). The ASD group had particular difficulties with discriminating, learning, and recognizing unfamiliar voices, while recognizing famous voices was relatively intact. Tests on acoustic processing abilities showed that the ASD group had a specific deficit in vocal pitch perception that was dissociable from otherwise intact acoustic processing (i.e., musical pitch, musical, and vocal timbre perception). Our results allow a characterization of the voice recognition deficit in ASD: The findings indicate that in high‐functioning ASD, the difficulty to recognize voices is particularly pronounced for learning novel voices and the recognition of unfamiliar peoples’ voices. This pattern might be indicative of difficulties with integrating the acoustic characteristics of the voice into a coherent percept—a function that has been previously associated with voice‐selective regions in the posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus of the human brain.

We consider it important to develop methods to measure humans’ attitudes and emotions that may prevent them from interaction with communication robots, as indices to study short-term and long-term interaction between humans and communication robots. This study is aimed at exploring the influence of negative attitudes toward robots, focusing on applications of communication robots to daily-life services. First, a scale of negative attitudes toward robots consisting of three subordinate scales, “negative attitudes toward situations of interaction with robots,” “negative attitudes toward the social influence of robots,” and “negative attitudes toward emotions in interaction with robots,” was developed based on a data sample comprising of 263 Japanese university students. This scale was administered to 240 Japanese university students to confirm its validity and reliability. In this paper, we report on the results of analyses of these data samples. Moreover, we discuss some future problems including a comparison of attitudes toward robots between nations.","[{'authorId': '1768404', 'name': 'T.

Research has also demonstrated strong associations between addictive use of technology and comorbid psychiatric disorders. In the present study, 23,533 adults (mean age 35.8 years, ranging from 16 to 88 years) participated in an online cross-sectional survey examining whether demographic variables, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and depression could explain variance in addictive use (i.e., compulsive and excessive use associated with negative outcomes) of two types of modern online technologies: social media and video games. Correlations between symptoms of addictive technology use and mental disorder symptoms were all positive and significant, including the weak interrelationship between the two addictive technological behaviors. Age appeared to be inversely related to the addictive use of these technologies. Being male was significantly associated with addictive use of video games, whereas being female was significantly associated with addictive use of social media. Being single was positively related to both addictive social networking and video gaming. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that demographic factors explained between 11 and 12% of the variance in addictive technology use. The mental health variables explained between 7 and 15% of the variance. The study significantly adds to our understanding of mental health symptoms and their role in addictive use of modern technology, and suggests that the concept of Internet use disorder (i.e., ""Internet addiction"") as a unified construct is not warranted.","[{'authorId': '1752620605', 'name': 'Cecilie Schou Andreassen'}, {'authorId': '144949833', 'name': 'J.

When social work students are mindful in the classroom, meaning they are present without internal or external filters, they are better able to regulate emotions and are more open to diverse perspectives. Teaching social work students to become mindful can improve self-care and is also the first step toward developing empathy. As such, mindful practice can help enhance practice skills, especially those related to tuning in to clients. This paper describes the elements of a mindful classroom, introduces a framework for teaching mindful practice, and presents the results of a research study that examined learning outcomes associated with this framework. Graduate students participated in a 16-week course that focused on enhancing self-care and professional development via the use of formal and informal mindful practice strategies. The Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Scale was administered before and after the course to assess changes in students' use of mindfulness skills. Four skill areas were tested: acting with awareness, observing, accepting without judgment, and describing; results indicate that students significantly increased their use of mindfulness in the first three areas.","[{'authorId': '118359581', 'name': 'Maria Napoli'}, {'authorId': '4622327', 'name': 'R.

The direct, or proximal, etiology of low performance is lack of MLE.

In addition, about 2 million years ago, (pre-)humans began to evolve a range of cognitive competencies for reasoning, reflection, anticipating, imagining, mentalizing, and creating a socially contextualized sense of self. These new competencies can cause major difficulties in the organization of (older) motivation and emotional systems. CFT suggests that our evolved brain is therefore potentially problematic because of its basic 'design,' being easily triggered into destructive behaviours and mental health problems (called 'tricky brain'). However, mammals and especially humans have also evolved motives and emotions for affiliative, caring and altruistic behaviour that can organize our brain in such a way as to significantly offset our destructive potentials. CFT therefore highlights the importance of developing people's capacity to (mindfully) access, tolerate, and direct affiliative motives and emotions, for themselves and others, and cultivate inner compassion as a way for organizing our human 'tricky brain' in prosocial and mentally healthy ways.","[{'authorId': '145962984', 'name': 'P.

We examined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation. We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months. METHODS Of 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS. RESULTS Of 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS. Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period. At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%). Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%). Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss.

Teachers play a crucial role in students’ development of SRL. When focusing on teachers’ professional competences in SRL, their experiences as self-regulated learners and their competences as agents of SRL are important. At present, an integrative and holistic framework that combines these two important aspects of SRL with regard to teachers’ professional competences in SRL is absent. First, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for teachers’ professional competences and instructional practices in SRL that integrates teachers’ competences as self-regulated learners with their competences as agents of SRL. This integrative approach allows for differentiated analyses of particular aspects of competences and creates the possibility to deeply understand the reasons why teachers do or do not promote SRL in classrooms. In the second part of this paper, the interplay of teachers’ professional competences as self-regulated learners and agents of SRL, with their intention to implement SRL in classes and their self-reported SRL teaching practices, is examined using data provided by 106 in-service teachers from primary and secondary schools. We assessed teachers’ professional knowledge about SRL (i.e., content knowledge about SRL [CK-SRL] and pedagogical content knowledge about SRL [PCK-SRL]) with two different knowledge tests. Teachers’ beliefs (i.e., implicit theories about SRL and beliefs about promoting SRL) and their motivations (i.e., self-concept about one’s SRL and self-efficacy to promote SRL) were assessed with self-report measures. We found that teachers had small to average amounts of CK-SRL and PCK-SRL. Teachers reported positive beliefs about and motivation toward SRL. Most importantly, the results highlight the significance of differentiating between teachers’ competences as self-regulated learners and as agents of SRL when examining teachers’ implementation of SRL. The findings provide support for particular aspects of the integrative approach outlined in the theoretical framework and suggest that this approach can be the basis for further research exploring the interplay of teachers’ competences as self-regulated learners and as agents of SRL in more detail, particularly with regard to how aspects of teachers’ competences in SRL impact their SRL instruction in classes and students’ SRL development.","[{'authorId': '118234290', 'name': 'Yves Karlen'}, {'authorId': '2073841602', 'name': 'S.

Because most grammatical morphemes appear to be associated with functional categories such as Determiner (Det), Comple? mentizer (Comp), and Inflection (Infl), these extraordinary deficits in gram? matical morphology might be attributable to a pronounced delay in the acquisition of these categories or to an underlying grammar that lacks them. In this article, we examined the status of the functional categories Det, Comp, and Infl in the grammar of one child with SLI seen at four ages: 3;9,4;3, 4;5, and 5;2. The results were consistent with an interpretation of a slowly developing grammar with elements from functional categories especially late in emergence and protracted in development.","[{'authorId': '48740656', 'name': 'J.

Here, we show that human participants spontaneously match facial expressions of an android physically present in the room with them. This mimicry occurs even though these participants find the android unsettling and are fully aware that it lacks intentionality. Interestingly, a video of that same android elicits weaker mimicry reactions, occurring only in participants who find the android “humanlike.” These findings suggest that spontaneous mimicry depends on the salience of humanlike features highlighted by face-to-face contact, emphasizing the role of presence in human-robot interaction. Further, the findings suggest that mimicry of androids can dissociate from knowledge of artificiality and experienced emotional unease. These findings have implications for theoretical debates about the mechanisms of imitation. They also inform creation of future robots that effectively build rapport and engagement with their human users.","[{'authorId': '3092566', 'name': 'Galit Hofree'}, {'authorId': '12114845', 'name': 'P.

Empathy Map is an important tool for most of interface projects. However, the tool's components related to ""Listen"", ""Think and Feel"", ""See"", and ""Say"" may be problematic for autistic users with low/medium degree of functioning, therefore requiring adaptation. This is due to cognitive impairment and limitations caused by this disorder on verbal communication. To address these issues, this work presents the initial proposal of EmpathyAut which is based on the traditional Empathy Map model, but has sections that are more compatible with the reality of autistic people.

This ability is required for imitation, perspective-taking, theory of mind and empathy; and disruption to this ability may contribute to the symptoms of clinical and sub-clinical conditions, including autism spectrum disorder and mirror-touch synaesthesia. Moving beyond correlational approaches, a recent intervention study demonstrated that training participants to control representations of the self and others improves their ability to control imitative behaviour, and to take another's visual perspective. However, it is unclear whether these effects apply to other areas of social interaction, such as the ability to empathize with others. We report original data showing that participants trained to increase self–other control in the motor domain demonstrated increased empathic corticospinal responses (Experiment 1) and self-reported empathy (Experiment 2), as well as an increased ability to control imitation.

We investigated how much self-compassion mediated the association between perceived social support and emotional self-regulation in psychological well-being of breast cancer sufferers. Method : A cross-sectional study design was used. Participants were recruited from three oncology departments in Zanjan, Iran. Data was collected from breast cancer patients (n = 300). Participants completed self-report measures, the short Ryff scale Psychological Well-being (RSPWB), Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess association among the study variables and multivariable regression analysis was used to assess linear relationships among predictor variables (emotional self-regulation, perceived social support and self-compassion) and criterion variable (psychological well-being). Bootstrapping analyses were used to test the significance on indirect effects. Results: Bootstrapping analyses revealed significant indirect effects of perceived social support (β = 0.055, SE = 0.45, P = 0.049, 0.95 CI: LL = 0.0092, UL = 0.1345) and emotional self-regulation (β = 0.079, SE = 0.079, P = 0.004, 0.95 CI: LL = -0.0331, UL = -0.1358) on psychological well-being through self-compassion.

35b99d3f2c893aaf7d710023de37223819a7eeb0,"Proneness to self-blaming moral emotions such as shame and guilt is increased in major depressive disorder (MDD), and may play an important role in vulnerability even after symptoms have subsided. Social psychologists have argued that shame-proneness is relevant for depression vulnerability and is distinct from guilt. Shame depends on the imagined critical perception of others, whereas guilt results from one’s own judgement. The neuroanatomy of shame in MDD is unknown. Using fMRI, we compared 21 participants with MDD remitted from symptoms with no current co-morbid axis-I disorders, and 18 control participants with no personal or family history of MDD. The MDD group exhibited higher activation of the right amygdala and posterior insula for shame relative to guilt (SPM8). This neural difference was observed despite equal levels of rated negative emotional valence and frequencies of induced shame and guilt experience across groups. These same results were found in the medication-free MDD subgroup (N = 15). Increased amygdala and posterior insula activations, known to be related to sensory perception of emotional stimuli, distinguish shame from guilt responses in remitted MDD. People with MDD thus exhibit changes in the neural response to shame after symptoms have subsided. This supports the hypothesis that shame and guilt play at least partly distinct roles in vulnerability to MDD. Shame-induction may be a more sensitive probe of residual amygdala hypersensitivity in MDD compared with facial emotion-evoked responses previously found to normalize on remission.","[{'authorId': '48348916', 'name': 'E.

Executive functioning (EF) and emotion dysregulation are among the proposed transdiagnostic mechanisms that such interventions are proposed to target. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of mindfulness meditation training on EF and emotion dysregulation in a sample of female adolescents with elevations in attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms against a waitlist control condition. Method This study adopted a mixed 2 (treatment group, waitlist control group) × 2 (pre‐test, post‐test) design. Adolescent females (13–15 years old) exhibiting elevations in ADHD symptoms according to multiple informants were randomly assigned to a mindfulness treatment group (n = 15) or a waitlist control group (n = 15). Results Among EF laboratory tasks, planning and inhibition were higher in the treatment group relative to the control group with large effect sizes at post‐treatment. The treatment group also exhibited lower scores in self‐reported emotion dysregulation (total, nonacceptance of emotional responses, and impulse control difficulties) in comparison to the waitlist control group with large effect sizes at post‐treatment. Within group pre‐test and post‐test comparisons indicated improvement on particular facets of EF and emotion dysregulation only for the treatment group. Conclusions Mindfulness meditation training improved particular facets of EF and emotion dysregulation in adolescent females with elevations in ADHD symptoms. Treatment development efforts should target clinical populations that exhibit difficulties in these transdiagnostic mechanisms.","[{'authorId': '27738444', 'name': 'B.

To address this, we describe how these artistic practices arose from earlier fashion movements and we engaged six leading creative practitioners in a structured and iterative dialogue. Analysis of our adapted Delphi survey suggests that core to Art Digital Jewellery is very individualised design processes and creating artefacts which are highly personal in terms of their form, their materials, their narratives and their interactivity.

We review the aspects of the response styles theory that have been well-supported, including evidence that rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of experimental studies show positive distractions relieve depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression, including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm. We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation strategies. Finally, we highlight recent research on the distinction between rumination and more adaptive forms of self-reflection, on basic cognitive deficits or biases in rumination, on its neural and genetic correlates, and on possible interventions to combat rumination.","[{'authorId': '1398876599', 'name': 'S.

This will generate interactions between humans and robots that may have positive or negative effects on the users. In order to minimize the negative effects and increase robot persuasiveness, robots should behave in an appropriate manner by adapting to their users. How to achieve this adaptation remains a challenge. We propose the usage of the Regulatory Focus Theory, user physiological state, and game-performance information in order to detect user stress and adapt the behavior of the robot. We present a longitudinal experiment conducted with 35 participants in a game-like scenario. The robot was trained for adapting to the regulatory focus of the users and decreasing their stress while they were playing the game. For this reason, we trained the robot with 12 participants with Chronic Promotion State and with 12 participants with Chronic Prevention State. We used a Q-Learning algorithm based on the Regulatory Focus of the participants, user stress, and task performance. The model obtained was tested with 2 groups (6 and 5 participants, respectively) according to their Chronic Regulatory Focus. Results show that our system was able to generate a robot behavior capable of increasing robot persuasiveness and reducing user stress, which is of great importance for social robots.","[{'authorId': '1405177298', 'name': 'Arturo Cruz-Maya'}, {'authorId': '1738469', 'name': 'A.

Areas of reading, mathematics, and written language each include tests of basic skills, fluency, and application. Academic knowledge includes tests of science, social studies, and humanities. The test authors note that the WJ IV ACH can be used to assist with determining an individual’s academic strengths and weaknesses, diagnosing specific abilities and disabilities, and educational planning (Schrank et al., 2014a). When used in conjunction with the WJ IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ IV COG; Schrank, McGrew, & Mather, 2014) and the WJ IV Tests of Oral Language (WJ IV OL; Schrank, Mather, & McGrew, 2014b), it can also be used to evaluate variations between an individual’s achievement and cognitive and linguistic abilities. Interpretation of WJ IV test batteries is based on the Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities (see Schneider & McGrew, 2012). The WJ IV ACH was published by Riverside in 2014; the previous version, the WJ III Tests of Achievement (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001), was published in 2001. There are seven new tests in the WJ IV ACH; however, it no longer includes tests of oral language abilities as these are now published separately. Examiners should have knowledge of exact WJ IV ACH administration and scoring procedures; graduate-level training in educational and psychological assessment is recommended (Schrank et al., 2014a). The test may be administered to individuals from age 2 to over 90 years.

We used a daily diary methodology with multilevel modelling data analyses (n = 187) to examine the influence of three emotion regulation strategies (mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression) on the experience of daily negative and positive affect. Our results suggested that daily mindfulness was associated with lower negative and higher positive affect whereas the converse pattern was found for daily emotion suppression; cognitive reappraisal was related to daily positive, but not negative affect. When daily mindfulness, suppression and reappraisal were included in the same models, these strategies predicted unique variance in emotional well-being. Random slope analyses revealed substantial variability in the utility of these strategies. Indeed the presumably “adaptive” cognitive reappraisal strategy seemed to confer no benefit to the regulation of negative affect in approximately half the sample. Additional analyses revealed that age moderates the effect of cognitive reappraisal on daily negative affect: Higher use of reappraisal was associated with more negative affect for adolescents (aged 17 to 19) but became associated with less negative affect with increasing age. We interpret these results in line with a contextual view of emotion regulation where no strategy is inherently “good” or “bad”.","[{'authorId': '143712173', 'name': 'R.

A total of 18 patients, aged 6-16, and 18 parents participated in the study. The study explored whether the use of robotic animals as companion animals could reduce pain and emotional anxiety in patients and their parents. The study identified when robot-assisted therapy was most effective (alone or together with parent). The study hypothesized that engaging in robot-assisted therapy together would enhance parents' perspective taking, thereby triggering strong empathic resonance and parental modeling to bolster the children's coping skills. The robotic companion was more successful in decreasing pain and negative emotional traits when children and parents were engaged together with the robotic companion. The parent's ability to acknowledge the patient's pain accurately through robot-assisted therapy seemed to reduce pain and emotional anxiety.","[{'authorId': '3289974', 'name': 'Sandra Y.

Today’s main challenge is achieving a more natural and human interaction with these systems. Integrating emotional models into social robotics is necessary to accomplish this goal. This paper presents an emotional model whose design has been supervised by psychologists, and its implementation on a social robot. Based on social psychology, this dimensional model has six dimensions with twelve emotions. Fuzzy logic has been selected for defining: (i) how the input stimuli affect the emotions and (ii) how the emotions affect the responses generated by the robot. The most significant contribution of this work is that the proposed methodology, which allows engineers to easily adapt the robot personality designed by a team of psychologists. It also allows expert psychologists to define the rules that relate the inputs and outputs to the emotions, even without technical knowledge. This methodology has been developed and validated on a personal assistant robot. It consists of three input stimuli, (i) the battery level, (ii) the brightness of the room, and (iii) the touch of caresses. In a simplified implementation of the general model, these inputs affect two emotions that generate an externalized emotional response through the robot’s heartbeat, facial expression, and tail movement. The three experiments performed verify the correct functioning of the emotional model developed, demonstrating that stimuli, independently or jointly, generate changes in emotions that, in turn, affect the robot’s responses.","[{'authorId': '2210935372', 'name': 'Gema Fernández-Blanco Martín'}, {'authorId': '7826011', 'name': 'F.

Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric.

Clarifying the nature of sleep conditions and the factors that influence such is necessary to enrich the base of knowledge available to the clinical nursing profession and encourage effective nursing interventions in older populations. Purposes of this study were to describe sleep quality and identify the personal, depression and social network determinants of sleep quality among older people living independently. A cross-sectional research design was used, and 187 persons 65 years of age or older were recruited using two-stage random sampling from communities in Taipei City, Taiwan. All subjects were informed by the researchers and were asked to provide personal (demographic data, lifestyle behavior), depression, social network (perceived the relationships with and support from family, relatives/friends), and sleep quality (Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, C-PSQI) information. Findings revealed that 25.7% of subjects were “poor sleepers” (attaining C-PSQI global scores > 5). The study identified significant relationships between three personal variables (alcohol consumption, educational level, and depressive tendencies), one social variable (relationships with relatives/friends) and sleep quality. Depression tendency, relationships with relatives/friends, college and above educational level, and habitual alcohol consumption accounted for 46.1% of sleep quality variance. Findings enrich the knowledge base by highlighting specific personal, depression and social network factors that could help nurses to assess sleep conditions more comprehensively. Nurses caring for older people should consider depression and social network factors (particularly the relationships with relatives/friends may play a discriminating role) as important determinants of sleep quality.","[{'authorId': '36107277', 'name': 'Ke-Wu Yao'}, {'authorId': '50443236', 'name': 'Shu Yu'}, {'authorId': '6688612', 'name': 'Shun-Ping Cheng'}, {'authorId': '15406798', 'name': 'I.

Current privacy legislation in major jurisdictions requires organisations to disclose information about their data collection process and obtain user’s consent prior to collecting privacy sensitive information. In this study, we consider a privacy-sensitive design of a data collection system for face identification. We deployed a face enrolment system on a humanoid robot with human-like gesturing and speech. We compared it with an equivalent system, in terms of capability and interactive process, on a screen-based interactive kiosk. In our previous contribution, we investigated the effects that embodiment has on users’ privacy considerations. We found that an embodied humanoid robot is capable of collecting more private information from users in comparison to a disembodied interactive kiosk. However, this effect was statistically significant only when the two compared systems were using a transparent interface, i.e. an interface communicating to users the privacy policies for data processing and storage. Thus, in this work, we aim to further investigate the effects of transparency on users’ privacy considerations and their experience with robot applications. We found that when comparing a non-transparent vs. transparent interface within the same system (i.e. on an embodied robot or on a disembodied kiosk) transparency does not lead to significant effects on users’ privacy considerations. However, we found that transparency leads to a significantly better user experience for both systems. Therefore, our overall analyses suggest that both the interactive robot and the interactive kiosk are capable of enhancing the user experience by providing transparent information to users, which is required by privacy legislation. However, an interactive kiosk providing transparent information elicits significantly more privacy concerns in users as compared to the robot supplying the very same transparent information. This exploratory study provides conclusions that provide valuable insights for designing robot applications dealing with users privacy and it discusses the related legal implications, concluding with recommendations for privacy policymakers.","[{'authorId': '50407019', 'name': 'Jonathan Vitale'}, {'authorId': '28950433', 'name': 'Meg Tonkin'}, {'authorId': '36177753', 'name': 'S.

Reflecting the sociodemographics of the military, those who are younger, single, not living with family, have fewer years of work experience, lower education, and lower income are at increased risk for psychological distress, alcohol/drug misuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or anxiety as a result of their perceived risk of infection. Effect sizes for post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were considered small (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI = -0.23 to 0.47), moderate (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24-0.51), and small (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI = -0.09 to 0.25), respectively; however, only the effect size for depressive symptoms was statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
Deployed service members may return with clinically significant problems, the most notable of which is depression. Delivering resilience training and fostering altruistic acceptance may protect service members from developing mental health disorders.","[{'authorId': '30213603', 'name': 'Kartavya J.

Although Social Stories™ often target reduction of problem behavior, there is limited research evaluating function-based Social Stories™ based on the results of experimental functional analyses. This study used a brief functional analysis to assist in developing a Social Story™ that matched the function of the target behavior for two boys with autism. The differential effects of a Social Story™ that matched the function of the behavior, a Social Story™ that did not match the function of the behavior, and a Social Story™ that described baseline were compared in an alternating treatments design. Results indicated that (a) the function-based Social Story™ plus functional communication training (FCT) was effective in decreasing target problem behavior and increasing target mands for both participants, (b) both participants selected the function-based Social Story™ during treatment preference evaluations, and (c) both participants maintained low levels of target problem behavior and maintained target mands when the Social Stories™ were removed.","[{'authorId': '2085309414', 'name': 'Heather M.

Social development is broadly defined to include externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems, prosocial behaviour and social competence. It concludes that there are clear links between specific dimensions of temperament and particular aspects of social development. Examples include the association of negative reactivity with externalizing behaviour problems, inhibition with internalizing behaviour problems, and attention regulation with school functioning. Theoretical and methodological issues to be confronted in future research are identified, including the need to investigate further the interactions between temperament and social context. Analysis of patterns of change in temperament, in relation to physiological changes and to such factors as parenting and socio-cultural expectations of children, promise to refine our understanding of how temperament works in context. Some practical implications which can be drawn from the research are also discussed.","[{'authorId': '46353184', 'name': 'A. Sanson'}, {'authorId': '2077299', 'name': 'S.

Design: The I-ACE was offered to adult clients seeking help for the first time and effects were measured for participants using self-report questionnaires: the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (goal attainment), the Hearing Handicap Questionnaire (hearing disability), and the International Outcome Inventory – Alternative Interventions (outcomes) immediately after programme completion and 3 months later. Participants also provided qualitative feedback about I-ACE. Study sample: Twenty-three participants completed I-ACE, with 22 completing all self-report questionnaires and 23 participants providing qualitative feedback. Results: The participants reported positive outcomes and goal attainment, but no change in hearing disability post-programme. The effects were maintained 3 months later. Qualitative feedback indicated that I-ACE supported participants in recognising and increasing awareness of their hearing difficulties and in developing potential solutions to these difficulties. Participants also enjoyed the opportunity to involve communication partners. Conclusion: I-ACE is an appropriate option for adults with hearing impairment who wish to become more aware of their hearing difficulties and how to solve them.","[{'authorId': '3744955', 'name': 'L.

Participants play the well-known children's game “rock-paper-scissors” against a robot that either plays fairly, or that cheats in one of two ways. In the “verbal cheat” condition, the robot announces the wrong outcome on several rounds which it loses, declaring itself the winner. In the “action cheat” condition, the robot changes its gesture after seeing its opponent's play.

39b2f6362495f76e83a0c156934a12caeb4682e9,"The existent literature on attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is enormous, and books that adequately take on the review of its full scope are few. This newly released revision represents a significant update and expansion from its previous edition that, along with prior iterations, has served as just such a comprehensive primer. Broadly, this reference documents the state of the science regarding the nature of ADHDandmethods for assessment of and intervention with affected children, adolescents, and adults. The book is rich in its coverage of etiological theory and the impact that ADHD has on individuals across domains and development. The two most notable changes in this edition are the breadth of topics addressed and the wider panel of contributors that Barkley enlists to lend their related expertise (52, as compared to 21 in the prior edition). Mirroring the field, greater emphasis is notably put on: (a) increasingly supported core dysfunctions associated with ADHD (e.g., emotional dysregulation, executive dysfunction); (b) the manifestation, assessment, and treatment of ADHD in the adult population; (c) and novel and refined means and targets of intervention (e.g., in social skills training, dietary management, executive functioning training, driving risk intervention, couples counseling). Barkley also takes the opportunity to delineate the case for recognizing a distinct disorder of attention, namely concentration deficit disorder, which has largely been researched as sluggish cognitive tempo in the past. The diverse chapters in the book find similarity in their effective empirical and critical approach and a format of concluding with a useful “key clinical points” section. In fact, many (e.g., social skills training for youth, driving risk intervention for teens, cognitive-behavioral therapies for adults) read like a sort of “how to” guide that while necessarily lacking detailed session-to-session protocols, provide critical guidance for clinicians and researchers alike. Another potentially helpful feature of the book is that chapters are more narrowly focused, such that a reader with interests in a specific topic will have to search less for appropriate information. This is especially true with regards to topics related to adult ADHD, which now is focused on in 11 chapters where previously there were just four. While it may be unfair to single out specific topics within this compendium that are particularly meritorious, several highlights include (a) Amori Mikami’s case for new social skills training approaches that focus on parents and teachers instead of children themselves, (b) Mary Solanto’s focused treatment of executive dysfunction in adults with ADHD, (c) Laura Knouse’s excellent review of cognitive-behavioral approaches to treating ADHD in adults, and (d) Barkley’s own reviews of the history and potential etiological underpinnings of the disorder. Overall, we conclude that this reference is a musthave for practitioners, researchers, and graduate students with a professional interest in ADHD, incorporating approximately the last decade’s advances to its previous editions comprehensive treatment of the history and nature of this disorder. We predict that you will find yourself reaching for it time and time again, and greatly appreciate having its wealth of information at your fingertips.","[{'authorId': '5233778', 'name': 'W.

We present the process of content creation and co‐design of LEGO therapy for children with autism spectrum disorders performed by a humanoid robot. The co‐creation takes place across the disciplines of autism therapy, and behavioural robotics, and applies methods from design and human–robot interaction, in order to connect state‐of‐the‐art developments in these disciplines. We designed, carried out and analyzed a pilot and final experiment, in which a robot mediated LEGO therapy between pairs of children was mediated by a robot over the course of 10 to 12 sessions. The impact of the training on the children was then analysed from a clinical and human–robot interaction perspective. Our major findings are as follows: first, game‐based robot scenarios in which the game continues over the sessions opened possibilities for long‐term interventions using robots and led to a significant increase in social initiations during the intervention in natural settings; and second, including dyadic interactions between robot and child within triadic games with robots has positive effects on the children's engagement and on creating learning moments that comply with the chosen therapy framework.","[{'authorId': '145741020', 'name': 'E.

This framework was tested on two different databases, one with emotional speech produced by actors and one with spontaneous emotional speech from a Wizard-of-Oz setting.

One of the most popular deep neural networks is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It take this name from mathematical linear operation between matrixes called convolution. CNN have multiple layers; including convolutional layer, non-linearity layer, pooling layer and fully-connected layer. The convolutional and fully-connected layers have parameters but pooling and non-linearity layers don't have parameters. The CNN has an excellent performance in machine learning problems.

Research design: Feasibility study involving single case experimental design with two participants. Methods and procedures: TBI Express is an established program for improving social interactions between people with TBI and their CPs. To improve access to the program, we developed a modified version called TBIconneCT that can be delivered via videoconferencing. Two participants with TBI and their CPs completed TBIconneCT training. Outcome measures included exchange structure analysis of conversation samples, blinded ratings of conversation samples and self-report measures. Main outcomes and results: The study indicated positive change on blinded ratings of conversation and self-reported measures for both participants. Exchange structure analysis conducted on session-by-session data did not demonstrate treatment effects due to variability during baseline. Conclusion: This study indicated potential for using telehealth to provide social communication skills training to people with TBI and their families. The study findings provide a foundation for a phase one clinical trial which will compare in-person with videoconferencing delivery of TBIconneCT.","[{'authorId': '8264733', 'name': 'R.

3bf10a7bd9b86b0e9f841484da942a8728cd5463,"The increasing prominence of standardized testing to assess student learning motivated the current investigation. We propose that standardized achievement test scores assess competencies determined more by intelligence than by self-control, whereas report card grades assess competencies determined more by self-control than by intelligence. In particular, we suggest that intelligence helps students learn and solve problems independent of formal instruction, whereas self-control helps students study, complete homework, and behave positively in the classroom. Two longitudinal, prospective studies of middle school students support predictions from this model. In both samples, IQ predicted changes in standardized achievement test scores over time better than did self-control, whereas self-control predicted changes in report card grades over time better than did IQ. As expected, the effect of self-control on changes in report card grades was mediated in Study 2 by teacher ratings of homework completion and classroom conduct. In a third study, ratings of middle school teachers about the content and purpose of standardized achievement tests and report card grades were consistent with the proposed model. Implications for pedagogy and public policy are discussed.","[{'authorId': '5720574', 'name': 'A. Duckworth'}, {'authorId': '46558326', 'name': 'P.

Empathy levels in social work students are not well-researched, especially in comparison with students in other helping professions. This cross-sectional study explored the relationship between empathy, self-esteem, and work engagement in 472 undergraduate and graduate students in the helping professions. Comparisons between BSW, MSW, and nursing students found overall high levels of affective empathy. Graduate MSW and nursing students scored higher than BSW students on most empathy constructs, self-esteem, work engagement, and had more work and volunteer experiences. A hierarchical multiple regression model was used to assess predictors of comprehensive empathy. Significant predictors of comprehensive empathy, as measured by the Empathy Assessment Index, included volunteer experience, work engagement, and affective empathy. Demographic variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, and years of work were non-significant predictors. Different constructs of empathy emerged, and implications of how empathy is relevant to social work practice are discussed with recommendations for social work education.","[{'authorId': '40463256', 'name': 'Elizabeth J.

This study aimed to identify the relationship between sleep quality due to abuse in mobile cell-phones and engagement in social networks. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 380 undergraduate students selected by proportional stratified sampling in Qom, Iran in 2015. Data were collected by two statndard questionnaire including Cell-Phone Over-Use Scale (COS) and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire beside the status of usage in cell-phone social networks. T-test, chi-square, Pearson correlation coefficient and multivariate logistic regression were used in data analysis. Results: The mean age of participants was 21.8 ±3.2 yr, 69.1% were female, and 11.7% were married. The mean of COS and sleep quality scores were 48.18 ±17.5 and 5.38 ±2.31, respectively. The prevalence of over-use of cell phone was 10.7% (CI 0.95; 8.8%, 12.6%) and the prevalence of poor sleep quality was 61.7% (CI 0.95; 57.1%, 66.3%). The mean of all aspects and total score of sleep quality showed a direct significant association by cell-phone addiction score except sleep duration score that was inversely. Based on multivariate analysis affected to cell-phone addiction, being male gender and studying in general physician level are the most important predictors of poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Over use of internet and social networks via smart phones is related to poor sleep quality and quantity. Predefined sport programs, educational, cultural, and interesting entertainment are the essential needs for all medical students. These interventions are more important especially for male students who have longer educational.","[{'authorId': '6678315', 'name': 'A.

3d0cecd0125ee7a0d36c5a47bd6b717d50ad78ee,"Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning. Significant advances in our understanding of children's cognitive and social development have occurred over the last three decades. Particularly with regard to those skills critical for academic success, research has revealed that multiple, interacting factors in the child, home, school, and larger sociocultural context all contribute to children's literacy, numeracy, language and social skills starting early in life and continuing throughout the school years (Morrison, Bachman & Connor, 2005). One factor, self-regulation, has surfaced recently as a crucial skill which uniquely predicts children's early school success. Poor self-regulation has been linked to high rates of expulsion, most dramatically in preschool classrooms (Gilliam & Shahar, 2006). Self-regulation refers to a complex of acquired, intentional skills involved in controlling, directing, and planning one's cognitions, emotions, and behavior (Schunk & Zimmerman, 1997). In investigations beyond the classroom, scientists from a broad range of perspectives have converged on the centrality of successful self-regulation as a marker of adaptive development. Findings demonstrate, at an emerging level of specificity, how biological and neurological processes interact with psychological and experiential factors to determine how children regulate themselves in a given setting. Biological factors such as temperament, or an individual's predisposed reactivity and regulation of reactions to stimuli, underpin these additive and interactive processes. Self-regulation also develops through early experiences and social interactions, where caregivers and other significant individuals structure and shape children's In this chapter, we examine self-regulation and its role in academic development, focusing on the transition to formal schooling. We posit that adaptive development depends upon children's ability to manage their reactions and specifically, their task-related behaviors in the school context. Moreover, successfully self-regulating depends upon environmental influences Self-regulation and academic achievement in the transition to school 3 and interactions with others as well as child factors and predispositions. We focus on the construct of behavioral self-regulation, which is closely aligned with executive function, and which we define as the execution and manifestation of cognitive processes in overt behavior. Remembering and using information, attending to and understanding what others are saying, directing motor actions, and persisting toward goals are all indicators of adaptive behavioral Our goals in the chapter are to examine behavioral regulation in the context of early childhood and the transition to school, elucidating how children's skills contribute to achievement. First, we demonstrate links between behavioral regulation and academic achievement prior to formal schooling and throughout elementary …","[{'authorId': '2250135897', 'name': 'Frederick J.

Alcohol was the most commonly used psychoactive substance (73%) identified. More than 30% changed their drinking habits because of the pandemic, with 16% actually drinking less, whilst 14% did so more. The former group was significantly younger than the latter. Amongst the stress-related coping strategies, it was found that current alcohol drinkers were significantly less able to find anything positive about the pandemic situation (positive reframing) and were mentally less able to cope.

Aim: To estimate the prevalence, socio-demographic correlates and treatment gap of mental morbidity in a representative population of India. Methods: NMHS was conducted across 12 Indian states where trained field investigators completed 34,802 interviews using tablet-assisted personal interviews. Eligible study subjects (18+ years) in households were selected by a multi-stage, stratified, random cluster sampling technique. Mental morbidity was assessed using MINI 6. Three-tier data monitoring system was adopted for quality assurance. Weighted and specific prevalence estimates were derived (current and lifetime) for different mental disorders. Mental morbidity was defined as those disorders as per the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Diagnostic Criteria for Research (ICD-10 DCR). Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to examine risk for mental morbidity by different socio-demographic factors. Survey was approved by central and state-level institutional ethical committees. Results: The weighted lifetime prevalence of ‘any mental morbidity’ was estimated at 13.67% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 13.61, 13.73) and current prevalence was 10.56% (95% CI = 10.51, 10.61). Mental and behavioural problems due to psychoactive substance use (F10–F19; 22.44%), mood disorders (F30–F39; 5.61%) and neurotic and stress-related disorders (F40–F48; 3.70%) were the most commonly prevalent mental morbidity in India. The overall prevalence was estimated to be higher among males, middle-aged individuals, in urban-metros, among less educated and in households with lower income. Treatment gap for overall mental morbidity was 84.5%. Conclusion: NMHS is the largest reported survey of mental morbidity in India. Survey estimated that nearly 150 million individuals suffer from one or the other mental morbidity in India. This information is to be used for planning, delivery and evaluating mental health programming in the country.","[{'authorId': '14642178', 'name': 'M. Gautham'}, {'authorId': '3872217', 'name': 'G.

Views of self-regulated learning that do not include this core self-referential system have difficulty explaining human failures to self-regulate, especially when such efforts are known metacognitively to be helpful. To explain students' self-regulation failures as well as their successes in naturalistic settings, educational psychologists need to expand their views of self-regulation beyond metacognitive trait, ability, or stage formulations and begin treating it as a complex interactive process involving social, motivational, and behavioral components. Such a perspective reveals not only the complexity of self-regulation b...","[{'authorId': '12321217', 'name': 'B.

Results of our analysis of 143 study coefficients and a total sample size of 1.932 suggest that overall sleep deprivation strongly impairs human functioning. Moreover, we found that mood is more affected by sleep deprivation than either cognitive or motor performance and that partial sleep deprivation has a more profound effect on functioning than either long-term or short-term sleep deprivation. In general, these results indicate that the effects of sleep deprivation may be underestimated in some narrative reviews, particularly those concerning the effects of partial sleep deprivation.","[{'authorId': '31913042', 'name': 'J.

We construct comparable scales using two validated instruments for the measurement of child behaviour and identify two dimensions of socio-emotional skills: ‘internalising’ and ‘externalising’. Using recent methodological advances in factor analysis, we establish comparability in the inequality of these early skills across cohorts, but not in their average level. We document for the first time that inequality in socio-emotional skills has increased across cohorts, especially for boys and at the bottom of the distribution. We also formally decompose the sources of the increase in inequality and find that compositional changes explain half of the rise in inequality in externalising skills. On the other hand, the increase in inequality in internalising skills seems entirely driven by changes in returns to background characteristics. Lastly, we document that socio-emotional skills measured at an earlier age than in most of the existing literature are significant predictors of health and health behaviours. Our results show the importance of formally testing comparability of measurements to study skills differences across groups, and in general point to the role of inequalities in the early years for the accumulation of health and human capital across the life course.","[{'authorId': '1410225160', 'name': 'Giacomo Mason'}, {'authorId': '145052284', 'name': 'G.

Unfortunately, currently not all the robots are accessible for all users. This is due to the different characteristics of users, as users with visual, hearing, motor or cognitive disabilities were not considered during the design, implementation or interaction phase, causing accessibility barriers to users who have limitations. This research presents a proposal for accessibility guidelines for human-robot interaction (HRI). The guidelines have been evaluated by seventeen HRI designers and/or developers. A questionnaire of nine five-point Likert Scale questions and 6 open-ended questions was developed to evaluate the proposed guidelines for developers and designers, in terms of four main factors: usability, social acceptance, user experience and social impact. The questions act as indicators for each factor. The majority (15 of 17 participants) agreed that the guidelines are helpful for them to design and implement accessible robot interfaces and applications. Some of them had considered some ad hoc guidelines in their design practice, but none of them showed awareness of or had applied all the proposed guidelines in their design practice, 72% of the proposed guidelines have been applied by less than or equal to 8 participants for each guideline. Moreover, 16 of 17 participants would use the proposed guidelines in their future robot designs or evaluation. The participants recommended the importance of aligning the proposed guidelines with safety requirements, environment of interaction (indoor or outdoor), cost and users’ expectations.","[{'authorId': '51039296', 'name': 'Malak Qbilat'}, {'authorId': '2087839460', 'name': 'Ana Iglesias'}, {'authorId': '2301161', 'name': 'Tony Belpaeme'}]",11.0,,23.0,A Proposal of Accessibility Guidelines for Human-Robot Interaction,2021.0

To develop a comprehensive model of nursing turnover intention by examining the effects of job demands, job resources, personal demands and personal resources on burnout and work engagement and subsequently on the intention to leave the organization and profession.


BACKGROUND
The ageing population and a growing prevalence of multimorbidity are placing increasing strain on an ageing nursing workforce. Solutions that address the anticipated nursing shortage should focus on reducing burnout and enhancing the engagement of Registered Nurses (RNs) to improve retention.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional survey design.


METHOD
Data were collected in 2014-2015 via an e-survey from 2,876 RNs working in New Zealand. Data were analysed with structural equation modelling.


RESULTS
Higher engagement results in lower intention to leave the organization and profession. Burnout has significant effects on intentions to leave through lower engagement. While most of the demands and resources' variables (except professional development) have effects on intentions to leave, greater workload and greater work-life interference result in higher burnout and are the strongest predictors of intentions to leave. Greater emotional demands (challenges) and greater self-efficacy also have strong effects in lowering intentions to leave through higher engagement.


CONCLUSIONS
Employee burnout and work engagement play an important role in transmitting the impacts of job demands, job resources, personal demands and personal resources into RN intention to leave the organization and profession. Work-life interference and high workloads are major threats to nursing retention while challenge demands and higher levels of self-efficacy support better retention.","[{'authorId': '46968265', 'name': 'Willoughby Moloney'}, {'authorId': '144642451', 'name': 'P.

However, the emotional bonds between humans and SR can raise an SR accessing/inferring profoundly private information, e.g., emotional states. Therefore, in what concerns privacy, SR may be a liability. Clarifying the ownership of data collected by robots is an issue of concern in the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires ’privacy-by-design’.

Alexithymia is a risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been associated with diminished treatment response. Neuroimaging studies have revealed structural aberrations of the anterior cingulate cortex and the fusiform gyrus in healthy controls with high levels of alexithymia. The present study tried to corroborate and extend these results to patients with MDD compared with healthy controls.


Methods
We investigated the relationship between alexithymia, depression and grey matter volume in 63 patients with MDD (mean age ± standard deviation = 42.43 yr ± 11.91; 33 female) and 46 healthy controls (45.35 yr ± 8.37; 22 female). We assessed alexithymia using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. We conducted an alexithymia × group analysis of covariance; we used a region-of-interest approach, including the fusiform gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex, and conducted whole brain analysis using voxelbased morphometry.


Results
Our analysis revealed a significant alexithymia × group interaction in the fusiform gyrus (left, pFWE = 0.031; right, pFWE = 0.010). Higher alexithymia scores were associated with decreased grey matter volume in patients with MDD (pFWE = 0.009), but with increased grey matter volume of the fusiform gyrus in healthy controls (pFWE = 0.044). We found no significant main effects in the region-of-interest analysis.


Limitations
Owing to the naturalistic nature of our study, patients with MDD and healthy controls differed significantly in their alexithymia scores.


Conclusion
Our results showed the fusiform gyrus as a correlate of alexithymia. We also found differences related to alexithymia between patients with MDD and healthy controls in the fusiform gyrus. Our study encourages research related to the transition from risk to MDD in people with alexithymia.","[{'authorId': '49875383', 'name': 'K. Förster'}, {'authorId': '26891522', 'name': 'V.

For example, the role of affective interactions is still unclear. This paper presents an ethnographic study conducted in an elementary school where 40 children interacted with a social robot capable of recognising and responding empathically to some of the children's affective states. The findings suggest that the robot's empathic behaviour affected positively how children perceived the robot. However, the empathic behaviours should be selected carefully, under the risk of having the opposite effect. The target application scenario and the particular preferences of children seem to influence the “degree of empathy” that social robots should be endowed with.","[{'authorId': '39799707', 'name': 'Iolanda Leite'}, {'authorId': '39540970', 'name': 'Ginevra Castellano'}, {'authorId': '11845717', 'name': 'André Pereira'}, {'authorId': '145813496', 'name': 'C.

40484e1b49f62a6788ae80fd2ecc9dfe45e8875b,"Robots are increasingly being developed as assistants for household, education, therapy, and care settings. Such robots need social skills to interact warmly and effectively with their users, as well as adaptive behavior to maintain user interest. While complex emotion models exist for chat bots and virtual agents, autonomous physical robots often lack a dynamic internal affective state, instead display-ing brief, fixed emotion routines to promote or discourage specific user actions. We address this need by creating a mathematical emotion model that can easily be implemented in a social robot to enable it to react intelligently to external stimuli. The robot’s affective state is modeled as a second-order dynamic system analogous to a mass connected to ground by a parallel spring and damper. The present position of this imaginary mass shows the robot’s valence, which we visualize as the height of its displayed smile (positive) or frown (negative). Associating positive and negative stimuli with appropri-ately oriented and sized force pulses applied to the mass enables the robot to respond to social touch and other inputs with a valence that evolves over a longer timescale, capturing essential features of approach-avoidance theory. By adjusting the parameters of this emotion model, one can modify three main aspects of the robot’s personality, which we term disposition, stoicism, and calmness.","[{'authorId': '35500438', 'name': 'R.

The purpose of this study was to identify teachers’ and students’ perspectives of co-teaching and the efficacy of this teaching approach. Forty-five co-teachers and 58 students with disabilities (N = 103), all of whom were new to co-taught classrooms during the 2004 through 2005 school year, participated in this study. Data were collected from surveys, observations, and records review. Significant differences in student academic and behavioral performances were found in comparisons between the year before co-teaching and the year of co-teaching. Students with disabilities and their teachers also reported positive perspectives about co-teaching. Based on these preliminary results, co-teaching appears to be an effective instructional delivery option for meeting the needs of students with disabilities in general education classrooms.","[{'authorId': '121345294', 'name': 'Qilei Hang'}, {'authorId': '14797337', 'name': 'Karen Rabren'}]",166.0,,30.0,An Examination of Co-Teaching,2009.0

However, scant attention has been paid to the developmental course of self-initiated regulation of behavior. This article summarizes the literature devoted to early forms of control and highlights the different philosophical orientations in the literature. Then, focusing on the period from early infancy to the beginning of the preschool years, the author proposes an ontogenetic perspective tracing the kinds of modulation or control the child is capable of along the way. The developmental sequence of monitoring behaviors that is proposed calls attention to contributions made by the growth of cognitive skills. The role of mediators (e.g., caregivers) is also discussed. During the second year of life, children increasingly demonstrate signs of selfhood and autonomy. This growing sense of identity, coupled with the ability to recall the dictates of caregivers, leads to a new dimension in behavior. Children begin to appraise the requirements of social and nonsocial situations and to monitor their own behavior accordingly. Slowly and precariously they move toward self-regulation, an achievement that Flavell (1977) descibes as being ""one of the really central and significant cognitive-developmental hallmarks of the early childhood period"" (p. 64).","[{'authorId': '82348618', 'name': 'C.

A distinction is made here between knowing as such and coming to know, with the focus on the latter. It is argued that the process of coming to know can be edifying: through the challenges of engaging over time with disciplines and their embedded standards, worthwhile dispositions and qualities may develop, the worthwhileness arising through the formation of ‘epistemic virtues’. Examples of such dispositions and qualities are identified, with differences between dispositions, on the one hand, and qualities, on the other hand, being observed. Educational implications of understanding the nurturing of student being in this way are sketched, with a set of 10 principles offered for curricula and pedagogy.

This would make life easier and can be used in vast applications involving areas such as education, medicine etc. Human emotions can be recognized by several approaches such as gesture, facial images, physiological signals and neuro imaging methods. Most of the researchers have developed user dependent emotion recognition system and achieved maximum classification rate. Very few researchers have tried to develop a user independent system and obtained lower classification rate. Efficient emotion stimulus method, larger data samples and intelligent signal processing techniques are essential for improving the classification rate of the user independent system. In this paper, we present a review on emotion recognition using physiological signals. The various theories on emotion, emotion recognition methodology and the current advancements in emotion research are discussed in subsequent topics. This would provide an insight on the current state of research and its challenges on emotion recognition using physiological signals, so that research can be advanced to obtain better recognition.","[{'authorId': '3098017', 'name': 'S.

Children were tested in preschool (M age = 4 years, 6 months) on a battery of cognitive measures, and mathematics and reading outcomes (from standardized, norm-referenced school-based assessments) were taken on entry to primary school, and at the end of the first and third year of primary school. Growth curve analyses examined predictors of math and reading achievement across the duration of the study and revealed that better digit span and executive function skills provided children with an immediate head start in math and reading that they maintained throughout the first three years of primary school. Visual-spatial short-term memory span was found to be a predictor specifically of math ability. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that visual short-term and working memory were found to specifically predict math achievement at each time point, while executive function skills predicted learning in general rather than learning in one specific domain.

Managing risk is particularly an issue for mothers, who, despite societal changes, tend to retain overall responsibility for the care of children. This paper explores the meanings mothers attach to risk and how this influences their children’s outdoor play. It also extends the scope of much existing literature by including children’s own perspectives on risk in outdoor play. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 12 mothers who had children aged between 9 and 11 years old who attended a north-east school. Two focus groups were also held, each with six of the children. Findings are analysed in relation to mother and child constructions of risk; mothers and children as risk managers; and negotiating mothering choices. The paper pays particular attention to the way in which mothers’ decisions were framed within risk cultures and dominant views of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ mothering.","[{'authorId': '8438716', 'name': 'L.

41af89f958d6d1dd6431d3412fdf74dd136ed093,"Emotion regulation and quality of attachment are closely linked. It has been proposed here that one influence on individual differences in emotion regulation may be a child's attachment history. Individuals characterized by the flexible ability to accept and integrate both positive and negative emotions are generally securely attached; on the other hand, individuals characterized by either limited or heightened negative affect are more likely to be insecurely attached. While acknowledging the role of infant temperament, I have focused on the role of social factors in examining the link between emotion regulation and attachment. The approach to emotion regulation taken here--that emotion regulation is adaptive in helping a child attain her goals--is esentially a functionalist approach (Bretherton et al., 1986; Campos et al., 1983), consistent with earlier views of emotions as important regulators of interpersonal relationships (Charlesworth, 1982; Izard, 1977). It has been proposed that patterns of emotion regulation serve an important function for the infant: the function of maintaining the relationship with the attachment figure. Emotion regulation has been described as serving this function in two ways. First, the function of maintaining the relationship is thought to be served when infant emotion regulation contributes to the infant's more generalized regulation of the attachment system in response to experiences with the caregiver. Infants who have experienced rejection (insecure/avoidant infants) are thought to minimize negative affect in order to avoid the risk of further rejection. Infants whose mothers have been relatively unavailable or inconsistently available (insecure/ambivalent infants) are thought to maximize negative affect in order to increase the likelihood of gaining the attention of a frequently unavailable caregiver. Both these patterns of emotion regulation help ensure that the child will remain close to the parent and thereby be protected. Second, the function of maintaining the attachment relationship is thought to be served when the infant signals to the parent that she will cooperate in helping maintain the parent's own state of mind in relation to attachment. The minimizing of negative affect of the avoidant infant signals that the infant will not seek caregiving that would interfere with the parent's dismissal of attachment. The heightened negative emotionality of the ambivalent infant signals to the parent that the infant needs her and thus helps maintain a state of mind in which attachment is emphasized. The approach to emotion regulation presented here is congruent with much work examining the socialization of emotions (Lewis & Saarni, 1985; Thompson, 1990).","[{'authorId': '35669149', 'name': 'J.

41d050fc07f185d92b281dc4a251c8faf843a613,"ABSTRACT The concept of wicked problems has served as an inspiration for research in a variety of research fields but has also contributed to conceptual confusion through the various ways in which it has been defined and used. In this special issue, a number of ontological, theoretical and methodological issues are discussed. First, while its use as a buzzword has undermined precise conceptual definition, recent work goes beyond the wicked versus tame dichotomy and conceptualizes wickedness as a matter of degree, differentiates between dimensions of wickedness and emphasizes the relational character of problem definitions. Second, new and existing governance approaches have often been unproblematically proposed as ways to solve wicked problems, while only imperfect solutions, partial solutions or small wins are achievable in practice. Third, the concept of wicked problems has had little direct impact on policy theories, and while some argue that the analysis of wicked problems should be mainstreamed in public policy thinking, others propose to reject the concept and rely on existing policy theories. Fourth, as a concept used in policy practice, wicked problems tend to provoke either paralysis or an overestimation of what policy can do about wicked problems. Possible ways forward include (1) leaving the concept behind; (2) using the wicked problems literature as knowledge base to understand when and why policy and governance approaches fail; and (3) developing dimensions of wicked problems (i.e. conflict, complexity and uncertainty) into more analytically precise research tools and linking them with more closely with contemporary policy science developments.","[{'authorId': '78582228', 'name': 'C.

Therefore, once entered to a medical college, only those students can pass with good grades, attain the degree, and enter in the field as qualified doctors who indulge in serious studious activities. Thus, the medical colleges trigger a lot of stress and anxiety for the students which eventually influences their emotions and emotion related abilities. Objectives: To explore the relationship of anxiety and emotional regulation among undergraduate medical students of Federal Medical and Dental College. Study Design: Descriptive research design. Setting:  Federal Medical and Dental College, Islamabad. Period:  6 months. Method: A sample comprising 300 medical students was selected from Federal Medical and Dental College. Consensus sampling was used for data collection. Relationship of anxiety and emotional regulation was analyzed using Beck Anxiety Inventory by Aaron Beck (BAI) (1988), Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (Gross & John, 2003). Results: The results show that there exists a substantial positive relationship between anxiety, expressive suppression and emotion regulation and noteworthy negative association between anxiety and cognitive reappraisal. Anxiety and emotional regulation are significantly related with gender. Females have higher anxiety as compared to males and female medical students use more expressive suppression emotion regulation strategy as compared to male medical students.

In addition, this review highlights two core-processing distinctions that can be neurocognitively identified across all of these domains. The distinction between automatic versus controlled processes has long been important to social psychological theory and can be dissociated in the neural regions contributing to social cognition. Alternatively, the differentiation between internally-focused processes that focus on one's own or another's mental interior and externally-focused processes that focus on one's own or another's visible features and actions is a new distinction.

Whereas it is known that humans can perceive affect in voice, movement, music and even as little as point light displays, it is not clear how humans develop this skill. Is it innate? If not, how does this emotional intelligence develop in infants? The MEI robot develops these skills through vocal input and perceptual mapping of vocal features to other modalities. We base MEI's development on the idea that motherese is used as a way to associate dynamic vocal contours to facial emotion from an early age. MEI uses these dynamic contours to both understand and express multimodal emotions using a unified model called SIRE (Speed, Intensity, irRegularity, and Extent). Offline experiments with MEI support its cross-modal generalization ability: a model trained with voice data can recognize happiness, sadness, and fear in a completely different modality-human gait. User evaluations of the MEI robot speaking, gesturing and walking show that it can reliably express multimodal happiness and sadness using only the voice-trained model as a basis.","[{'authorId': '46261444', 'name': 'Angelica Lim'}, {'authorId': '1775800', 'name': 'HIroshi G.

Individual differences in children's understanding of false-belief and emotion were associated with differences in language ability and with certain aspects of family background, in particular, parental occupational class and mothers' education. The number of siblings that children had did not relate to their social cognition. Individual differences in false-belief and emotion understanding were correlated, but these domains did not contribute to each other independently of age, language ability, and family background.

42e1b4c2b60baed1ee771a08946e2f430e0a6f15,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in the generation and regulation of emotion. However, we lack an integrative framework for understanding how different emotion-related functions are organized across the entire expanse of the PFC, as prior reviews have generally focused on specific emotional processes (e.g., decision making) or specific anatomical regions (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex). Additionally, psychological theories and neuroscientific investigations have proceeded largely independently because of the lack of a common framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, lesion, and structural connectivity studies on the emotion-related functions of 8 subregions spanning the entire PFC. We introduce the appraisal-by-content model, which provides a new framework for integrating the diverse range of empirical findings. Within this framework, appraisal serves as a unifying principle for understanding the PFC’s role in emotion, while relative content-specialization serves as a differentiating principle for understanding the role of each subregion. A synthesis of data from affective, social, and cognitive neuroscience studies suggests that different PFC subregions are preferentially involved in assigning value to specific types of inputs: exteroceptive sensations, episodic memories and imagined future events, viscero-sensory signals, viscero-motor signals, actions, others’ mental states (e.g., intentions), self-related information, and ongoing emotions. We discuss the implications of this integrative framework for understanding emotion regulation, value-based decision making, emotional salience, and refining theoretical models of emotion. This framework provides a unified understanding of how emotional processes are organized across PFC subregions and generates new hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying adaptive and maladaptive emotional functioning.","[{'authorId': '4296355', 'name': 'Matthew L.

We review findings suggesting that snakes remain special stimuli for humans. Intense snake fear is prevalent in both humans and other primates. Humans and monkeys learn snake fear more easily than fear of most other stimuli through direct or vicarious conditioning. Neither the elicitation nor the conditioning of snake fear in humans requires that snakes be consciously perceived; rather, both processes can occur with masked stimuli. Humans tend to perceive illusory correlations between snakes and aversive stimuli, and their attention is automatically captured by snakes in complex visual displays. Together, these and other findings delineate an evolved fear module in the brain. This module is selectively and automatically activated by once-threatening stimuli, is relatively encapsulated from cognition, and derives from specialized neural circuitry.","[{'authorId': '2276310', 'name': 'A.

The present study investigated children's risk perceptions and appraisals in the context of common outdoor physical play activities. Risk perceptions and appraisal of four- and five-year olds were assessed using a pictorial risk appraisal measure and through individual semi-structured interviews examining children's decision-making. Sensation seeking and risk-taking behaviour were assessed using self- and parent-report measures. Results revealed that the children were able to identify injury risk behaviours however differentiating the severity of the potential injury was less accurate. Furthermore, the children appeared to use these judgements in their play to inform their behaviour whilst using playground equipment. Whilst they actively sought out those activities that offered challenge and excitement, they were aware of their abilities and showed caution in engaging in activities that were beyond their current capabilities. The results have implications for the provision of calculated risk-taking in outdoor play and for adult responses to the risk-taking behaviour of children.","[{'authorId': '47404249', 'name': 'H.

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.","[{'authorId': '19560809', 'name': 'Natacha Rouaix'}, {'authorId': '1422471008', 'name': 'Laure Retru-Chavastel'}, {'authorId': '2012138', 'name': 'A.

Design: The study was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial with two arms. The intervention group (RLO+, n = 103) received the RLOs plus standard clinical service including hearing aid(s) and counseling, and the waitlist control group (RLO−, n = 100) received standard clinical service only. The effectiveness of the RLOs was assessed 6-weeks posthearing aid fitting. Seven RLOs (total duration 1 hr) were developed using a participatory, community of practice approach involving hearing aid users and audiologists. RLOs included video clips, illustrations, animations, photos, sounds and testimonials, and all were subtitled. RLOs were delivered through DVD for TV (50.6%) and PC (15.2%), or via the internet (32.9%). Results: RLO take-up was 78%. Adherence overall was at least 67%, and 97% in those who attended the 6-week follow-up. Half the participants watched the RLOs two or more times, suggesting self-management of their hearing loss, hearing aids, and communication. The RLOs were rated as highly useful and the majority of participants agreed the RLOs were enjoyable, improved their confidence and were preferable to written information. Postfitting, there was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome measure, overall hearing aid use. However, there was significantly greater hearing aid use in the RLO+ group for suboptimal users. Furthermore, the RLO+ group had significantly better knowledge of practical and psychosocial issues, and significantly better practical hearing aid skills than the RLO− group. Conclusions: The RLOs were shown to be beneficial to first-time hearing aid users across a range of quantitative and qualitative measures. This study provides evidence to suggest that the RLOs may provide valuable learning and educational support for first-time hearing aid users and could be used to supplement clinical rehabilitation practice.","[{'authorId': '3261707', 'name': 'M.

Body Image Questionnaires (BIQ) is a questionnaire that specifically assesses the impact of self-appearance, especially in the hair appearance, on the individual self-esteem and the influences in life. In clinical practice, measuring the association of premature canities to the quality of life and understanding how a patient’s life is affected by premature canities can be helpful in determining the most appropriate and better management for the patients. Aim: To evaluate the association between premature canities and quality of life Methods: This is a cross-sectional analytic method, with BIQ to assess the quality of life.

Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, as well as randomized clinical trials, are included. Special attention is given to physical conditions, including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease and sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, studies relating physical activity to depression and other mood states are reviewed. The studies include diverse ethnic populations, including men and women, as well as several age groups (e.g. adolescents, middle-aged and older adults). Recent findings Results of the studies continue to support a growing literature suggesting that exercise, physical activity and physical-activity interventions have beneficial effects across several physical and mental-health outcomes. Generally, participants engaging in regular physical activity display more desirable health outcomes across a variety of physical conditions. Similarly, participants in randomized clinical trials of physical-activity interventions show better health outcomes, including better general and health-related quality of life, better functional capacity and better mood states. Summary The studies have several implications for clinical practice and research. Most work suggests that exercise and physical activity are associated with better quality of life and health outcomes. Therefore, assessment and promotion of exercise and physical activity may be beneficial in achieving desired benefits across several populations. Several limitations were noted, particularly in research involving randomized clinical trials. These trials tend to involve limited sample sizes with short follow-up periods, thus limiting the clinical implications of the benefits associated with physical activity.

The schools workpackage carried out a systematic review of reviews of work on mental health in schools from which it identified evidence-based interventions and programmes and extracted the general principles from evidence-based work. A systematic search of the literature uncovered 52 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of mental health in schools. The interventions identified by the reviews had a wide range of beneficial effects on children, families and communities and on a range of mental health, social, emotional and educational outcomes. The effect sizes associated with most interventions were generally small to moderate in statistical terms, but large in terms of real-world impacts. The effects associated with interventions were variable and their effectiveness could not always be relied on. The characteristics of more effective interventions included: teaching skills, focusing on positive mental health; balancing universal and targeted approaches; starting early with the youngest children and continuing with older ones; operating for a lengthy period of time and embedding work within a multi-modal/whole-school approach which included such features as changes to the curriculum including teaching skills and linking with academic learning, improving school ethos, teacher education, liaison with parents, parenting education, community involvement and coordinated work with outside agencies. Interventions were only effective if they were completely and accurately implemented: this applied particularly to whole-school interventions which could be ineffective if not implemented with clarity, intensity and fidelity. The implications for policy and practice around mental health in schools are discussed, including the suggestion of some rebalancing of priorities and emphases.","[{'authorId': '6133530', 'name': 'K.

While facial expressions can be a voluntary reaction, the change of temperature in the body is often not. Thus, a facial expression may not always be consistent with the emotional state that is expressed by the body temperature. This article aims to study the human perception of the emotional expression and the emotional state of a robot that simultaneously uses its face and body temperature. To this end, a robot, named TherMoody, which has the capability to change its body temperature from 10–55℃, was used. Then, 25 combinations (5x5: one facial expression and one thermal expression for anger, joy, fear, sadness, and neutral state) were evaluated by 15 participants. Thermal expressions were designed based on the metaphors of emotions related to temperature. The results show people tend to base their judgment of the robot’s emotional expression exclusively in its facial expression, regardless of the change of its body temperature. However, there are combinations where the thermal expression predominates over the facial expression when judging the robot’s emotional state. Thus, these combinations may produce the perception that the robot’s emotional expression is, in fact, genuine, simulated, masked, or neutralized.","[{'authorId': '36840494', 'name': 'Denis Peña'}, {'authorId': '2820127', 'name': 'F.

We subsequently evaluated the forms with data from 1,189 participants. In mid/high-income and White samples, the CBQ short and very short forms demonstrated both satisfactory internal consistency and criterion validity, and exhibited longitudinal stability and cross-informant agreement comparable to that of the standard CBQ. Internal consistency was somewhat lower among African American and low-income samples for some scales. Very short form scales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency for all samples, and confirmatory factor analyses indicated marginal fit of the very short form items to a three-factor model.","[{'authorId': '34563658', 'name': 'S.

4565cf720b3f6cdeeabe0b11ea3586a3ae702d1a,"In their paper, ""Towards a Theory of Emotional Communication,"" Anne Bartsch and Susanne Hübner outline a model of emotional communication where emotional communication is conceptualized as a process of mutual influence between the emotions of communication partners. To elaborate this general notion further, four working definitions of emotional communication are introduced, each of which is based on a different theory of emotions. In the second part of the paper, an integrative framework is proposed that reconciles the four working definitions and their underlying theories of emotion. According to this framework, emotional communication comprises three interrelated levels of complexity: 1) innate stimulus-response-patterns, 2) associative schemata, and 3) symbolic meaning. Finally, Bartsch and Hübner discuss how emotional communication can be described in terms of general communication theory, and conclude that the three complexity levels are heterogeneous with regard to definitional issues in general communication theory. Hence, emotional communication cannot be subsumed under a single theory of communication. Taken separately, however, each complexity level of emotional communication can be related meaningfully to approaches in general communication theory. Anne Bartsch and Susanne Hübner, ""Towards a Theory of Emotional Communication"" page 2 of 8 CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture 7.4 (2005):  Anne BARTSCH and Susanne HÜBNER Towards a Theory of Emotional Communication Over the past two decades, emotions have become a rapidly growing field of research and theorizing in disciplines as different as cognitive, social, and developmental psychology, anthropology, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and others. One of the central themes that emerged from the joint efforts of emotion research is that emotions are not just private inner experiences, but inherently social and communicative phenomena. In this paper, we explore the following: If emotions are inherently social and communicative, is it also true that communication is inherently emotional? To date, communication has mainly been conceptualized as a process of exchange, mutual influence, co-orientation, normative control, etc., of cognitive information processing. But what if we think of communication as a process of exchange, mutual influence, co-orientation, and normative control of emotions? We do not propose, however, that this view with focus on emotion would exclude the cognitive approach; rather, we explore the role of emotions and their specific contribution to the process of communication. Further, we outline a model of emotional communication where the objective of the model is to integrate recent developments in emotion research into a communication-theoretical framework (see Bartsch and Hübner). What exactly do we mean by ""emotional communication""? The basic idea of the theoretical framework we propose is that people do not only communicate in order to exchange information, but also in order to exchange emotions. In other words, emotional communication is conceptualized as a process of mutual influence between the emotions of communication partners. To elaborate this general concept of emotional communication further, we propose four working definitions, each based on a different theory of emotion. The first working definition is based on neuroscience models, the second on appraisal theories, the third is based on the prototype approach, and the fourth on social constructivist theories of emotion. The four emotion theories mentioned are chosen because each provides us with an explicit and detailed account of the processes that give rise to emotions. For, if we know the processes that give rise to emotions, we may be able to explain how these processes are influenced by similar processes in other people. Neuroscience models of emotion assume that emotions are caused by specialized brain systems (see, e.g., LeDoux; Panksepp; Damasio). Basically, emotional brain systems have two functions: First, they analyze the emotional meaning of stimuli. This is accomplished by associative paring of stimulus features with innate emotion elicitors. Interestingly, emotion expressions of others seem to count among these innate emotion elicitors. Emotional brain systems are involved in the processing of expression of others critically. Second, emotional brain systems control a variety of emotional responses such as hormone release, activation of the autonomic nervous system, vocal, facial, and motor expression, allocation of cognitive resources to the situation that elicits emotion, etc. Taken together, these functional properties of emotional brain systems lead to the following conclusion: If the same brain systems that give rise to emotions are also involved in the expression of emotions and in the processing of expressions of others, emotion expression will then lead to an activation of similar brain systems in communication partners. Thus, on the basis of neuroscience models of emotion, emotional communication can be defined as a process of reciprocal activation of emotional brain systems. Appraisal theories of emotion describe the processes that give rise to emotions at a quite different level of analysis. According to appraisal theories emotions are elicited by cognitive appraisals (see, e.g., Lazarus; Scherer; Smith and Ellswort; Ortony, Clore, and Collins; Frijda). Appraisal criteria relevant to emotion include novelty, valence, goal conductiveness, certainty vs. uncertainty of outcomes, self vs. other's agency, coping potential, and normative evaluation. Each emotion is caused by a specific pattern of appraisals. Emotion expression is, therefore, assumed to carry detailed information about cognitive appraisals. Some appraisal theorists even believe that emotion expressions are composed of several muscle movements, each of which signals a different appraisal component. For example, according to Klaus R. Scherer, the appraisal information conveyed by emotion expression can be used by communication partners in two ways: The appraisals of others can be used to resolve ambiguities in one's own Anne Bartsch and Susanne Hübner, ""Towards a Theory of Emotional Communication"" page 3 of 8 CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture 7.4 (2005):  appraisal of the situation and appraisals can be used to infer the motives and the likely behavior of others (which are often relevant to one's own appraisal of the situation). To summarize, emotion expression carries appraisal information that is likely to affect the appraisals of others, and consequently does affect their emotions. Thus, on the basis of appraisal theories, emotional communication can be defined as a process of information exchange about cognitive appraisals. The prototype approach was developed originally as a theory of natural language concepts and it was applied to emotions by Shaver and his colleagues (see Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, O'Connor; Fischer, Shaver, Carnochan). The prototype approach assumes that knowledge about emotions is represented in the form of nonverbal emotion scripts. Emotional scripts include knowledge about typical eliciting situations, typical reactions, and self-control procedures. These emotion prototypes have two closely related functions: They structure the personal experience of emotions and they are used to understand the emotions of others. This double function of emotional scripts in emotion elicitation and emotion perception leads to the following conclusion: If the same knowledge structures are activated when experiencing an emotion and when observing emotions in others, the vicarious experience of an emotion must then have essential features that correspond to the personal experience of an emotion. The person who experiences an emotion vicariously may be aware that the emotion actually ""belongs"" to someone else, but nevertheless she/he will experience an emotion. Thus, on the basis of the prototype approach, emotional communication can be defined as a process of reciprocal activation of emotional scripts. Next, social constructivist theories of emotion also assume that emotion concepts play a causal role in emotion elicitation (see, e.g., Averill; Harré; Shweder; Lutz; on [radical] constructivism, see Riegler ). Social constructivists, however, believe that emotional knowledge is represented in a purely symbolic manner. According to this view, the meaning of emotion words is constituted by a set of rules that specify the kinds of persons, situations, and actions to which the emotion word applies. The rules that govern the use of emotion words and other symbolic expressions are thought to be equivalent to the social norms concerning emotions. In turn, this means that if a person finds herself/himself in a situation to which a specific emotion word applies, this person has both the moral right and the moral obligation to experience the emotion and to behave accordingly. Therefore, emotions can be considered as social roles (see, e.g., Averill). As with social roles in general, the individual is not free to self-ascribe emotions at will. The self-ascription of emotions must not only rely on culturally determined emotion rules and in order to become a fact of socially shared reality, emotional roles must be authorized and reciprocated by complementary role behavior of others. The implications of this theory for the concept of emotional communication are straight forward: If emotions do exist only as a fact of socially shared reality, the existence of an emotion in the heads of other people is then as constitutive to the emotion as its existence in the head of the person having the emotion. Thus, on the basis of social constructivist theories of emotion, emotional communication can be defined as a process of symbolic negotiation of emotions. To summarize, the four emotion theories introduced above clearly support the assumption that the emotions of communication partn","[{'authorId': '143851531', 'name': 'Anne Bartsch'}, {'authorId': '92977524', 'name': 'Susanne Hübner'}]",18.0,,14.0,Towards a Theory of Emotional Communication,2005.0

Six HCD approaches – participatory design, ethnography, the lead user approach, contextual design, codesign and empathic design – are discussed in order to argue that these different approaches are different ways to cope with the two tensions. In addition, several examples from practice are provided to illustrate these tensions.

In the future, robots are envisioned to assist people with a wide range of activities such as domestic chores, helping elders to live independently longer, serving a therapeutic role to help children with autism, assisting people undergoing physical rehabilitation and much more. Many of these activities shall require robots to learn new tasks, skills and individual preferences while ‘on the job’ from people with little expertise in the underlying technology.

A systematic review of literature yielded 41 original studies, analyzing data from a total of 8,256 workers. Meta-analysis indicated that associations between job burnout and STS were strong (weighted r = .69). Studies applying measures developed within the compassion fatigue framework (one of the conceptualizations of job burnout and STS) showed significantly stronger relationships between job burnout and STS, indicating a substantial overlap between measures (weighted r = .74; 55% of shared variance). Research applying other frameworks and measures of job burnout (i.e., stressing the role of emotional exhaustion) and STS (i.e., focusing on symptoms resembling posttraumatic stress disorder or a cognitive shift specific for vicarious trauma) showed weaker, although still substantial associations (weighted r = .58; 34% of shared variance). Significantly stronger associations between job burnout and STS were found for: (a) studies conducted in the United States compared to other countries; (b) studies using English-language versions of the questionnaires compared to other-language versions, and (c) research in predominantly female samples. The results suggest that, due to high correlations between job burnout and STS, there is a substantial likelihood that a professional exposed to secondary trauma would report similar levels of job burnout and STS, particularly if job burnout and STS were measured within the framework of compassion fatigue.","[{'authorId': '6291588', 'name': 'R.

(a) The fear module is preferentially activated in aversive contexts by stimuli that are fear relevant in an evolutionary perspective. (b) Its activation to such stimuli is automatic. (c) It is relatively impenetrable to cognitive control. (d) It originates in a dedicated neural circuitry, centered on the amygdala. Evidence supporting these propositions is reviewed from conditioning studies, both in humans and in monkeys; illusory correlation studies; studies using unreportable stimuli; and studies from animal neuroscience. The fear module is assumed to mediate an emotional level of fear learning that is relatively independent and dissociable from cognitive learning of stimulus relationships.","[{'authorId': '2276310', 'name': 'A.

We conducted a qualitative case study to explore early childhood educators’ views on, and engagement with, risk-taking in professional practice. Through thematic analysis of interviews with 55 educators in three high quality early childhood education services, we show that, for the educators in the study, risk-taking was a valuable aspect of professional practice driven by three main motivations: professional growth and development; developing children as competent and empowered individuals; and advocacy and activism. We also show that educators’ risk-taking was enacted under five broad themes: providing opportunities for children to take risks; trusting children; doing things that are new; expressing ideas and beliefs; and including curriculum content that may be considered controversial, complex and inappropriate for children. We conclude that for educators in the study, risk-taking was enacted as courageous, ethically and morally driven praxis in pursuit of high quality ECE for the benefit of both individuals and society.","[{'authorId': '119175609', 'name': 'Mandy Cooke'}, {'authorId': '66890783', 'name': 'F.

This study analyzes the role of teacher demographics (gender, race, grade level, and years of experience) on their perceptions of specifically defined challenging behaviors. After conducting a comprehensive review of the literature, nine categories of challenging behaviors in schools and classrooms were created. Using these definitions, this study analyzed 800 surveys of kindergarten through twelfth grade teachers in five districts of one state to measure their perceptions of these nine categories of challenging behavior. Teachers were also surveyed for demographic data to investigate response patterns for different challenging behaviors. Analyses indicated that ‘Off-task’ was the most prevalent and problematic challenging behavior and ‘Isolation/No social interaction’ was the least prevalent and problematic challenging behavior. Statistically significant differences in ratings were noted according to gender, grade level and years teaching.

A series of population‐based and epidemiological studies have identified specific stressors and individual‐level variables that are predictive of substance use and abuse. Preclinical research also shows that stress exposure enhances drug self‐administration and reinstates drug seeking in drug‐experienced animals. The deleterious effects of early life stress, child maltreatment, and accumulated adversity on alterations in the corticotropin releasing factor and hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis (CRF/HPA), the extrahypothalamic CRF, the autonomic arousal, and the central noradrenergic systems are also presented. The effects of these alterations on the corticostriatal‐limbic motivational, learning, and adaptation systems that include mesolimbic dopamine, glutamate, and gamma‐amino‐butyric acid (GABA) pathways are discussed as the underlying pathophysiology associated with stress‐related risk of addiction. The effects of regular and chronic drug use on alterations in these stress and motivational systems are also reviewed, with specific attention to the impact of these adaptations on stress regulation, impulse control, and perpetuation of compulsive drug seeking and relapse susceptibility. Finally, research gaps in furthering our understanding of the association between stress and addiction are presented, with the hope that addressing these unanswered questions will significantly influence new prevention and treatment strategies to address vulnerability to addiction.","[{'authorId': '38578297', 'name': 'R.

Eighteen social work students took part in a five-scenario Objective Structured Clinical Examination adapted for social work consisting of a 15-minute interview followed by a 15-minute reflective dialogue following structured questions designed to elicit dimensions of meta-competence. Ninety reflections were transcribed and analyzed revealing variation in students' ability to conceptualize practice, to intentionally use self, and to learn from reviewing their practice. Also, each meta-competence was found to be grounded in a similar structure, that of a continuum with reflections ranging from in-depth, rich, textured discussions to those that are more superficial, scant, and concrete. Variation in students' ability to conceptualize practice and use diversity concepts was found, related to students' emotional reactions. Some students described becoming emotionally ‘dysregulated’ and therefore unable to use knowledge in practice. Implications include the importance of articulating the inter-relationships and links between concepts and practice when teaching and assisting students to develop emotional self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '152494785', 'name': 'M.

To conduct a placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of a universal school-based depression prevention program.


METHOD
Three hundred ninety-two students age 13 to 15 from two schools were randomized to intervention (RAP-Kiwi) and placebo programs run by teachers. RAP-Kiwi was an 11-session manual-based program derived from cognitive-behavioral therapy. The placebo was similar but with cognitive components removed. Outcomes were self-rated depression scales, the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS), and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Follow-up was to 18 months. Analysis was done on an intent-to-treat basis.


RESULTS
Immediately after the intervention, depression scores were reduced significantly more by RAP-Kiwi than by placebo, with a mean difference in change from baseline between groups of 1.5 on BDI-II (CI > 0.38, p =.01) and 2.24 on RADS (CI > 0.22, p =.04). Categorical analysis confirmed significant clinical benefit with an absolute risk reduction of 3% (95% CI, 1-11%, McNemar chi, p =.03), with the ""number needed to treat"" for short-term benefit of 33. Group differences in depression scores averaged across time to 18 months were significant on RADS but not on BDI-II. Retention rates were 91% at 6 months and 72% at 18 months.


CONCLUSIONS
The RAP-Kiwi program is a potentially effective public health measure. Confirmation of effectiveness measuring episodes of depressive illness and broader measures of adjustment is warranted.","[{'authorId': '2908079', 'name': 'S.

We posit that home robots will raise privacy problems of three basic types: (1) data privacy problems; (2) boundary management problems; and (3) social/relational problems. Technological design can ward off, if not fully prevent, a number of these harms. We propose five principles for home robots and privacy design: data minimization, purpose specifications, use limitations, honest anthropomorphism, and dynamic feedback and participation. We review current research into privacy-sensitive robotics, evaluating what technological solutions are feasible and where the harder problems lie. We close by contemplating legal frameworks that might encourage the implementation of such design, while also recognizing the potential costs of regulation at these early stages of the technology.","[{'authorId': '39223052', 'name': 'M.

47de1ea7b697ea8910ae7e47146cdf66aa4dd357,"Background: Previous studies demonstrating an association between alexithymia and depression have led to the proposal that alexithymia may be a state-dependent phenomenon rather than a stable and enduring personality trait. Several longitudinal studies have provided support for a trait view of alexithymia, but most of these studies evaluated absolute stability only (i.e., the extent to which alexithymia scores change over time) and did not examine the relative stability of alexithymia (i.e., the extent to which relative differences among individuals remain the same over time) in the context of changes in illness symptomatology. The present study evaluated both absolute stability and relative stability of alexithymia in depressed patients who experienced a marked reduction in the severity of depressive symptoms. Methods: Forty-six psychiatric outpatients with major depression were assessed for alexithymia and depression with the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at the start of treatment (baseline) and after 14 weeks of treatment (follow-up) with antidepressant medication. Paired t tests and correlational analyses were performed to evaluate absolute stability and relative stability in alexithymia. Hierarchical regression analyses were then used to assess the degree to which the relative stability in alexithymia scores was related to the severity of depressive symptoms, and the degree to which changes in alexithymia scores could be attributed to changes in depression scores. Results: Alexithymia scores changed significantly from baseline to follow-up, indicating a general lack of absolute stability. There was, however, strong evidence of relative stability, as alexithymia scores at baseline correlated significantly with alexithymia scores at follow-up and were also a significant predictor of follow-up alexithymia scores, after partialling the effects of depression severity. Conclusions: Although alexithymia scores may change in the presence of large changes in the severity of depressive symptoms, the finding of relative stability of alexithymia supports the view that this construct is a stable personality trait rather a state-dependent phenomenon.","[{'authorId': '2500494', 'name': 'O.

Fourteen studies were conducted with community samples of pathological gamblers while six studies with clinical samples of disordered gamblers. All studies assessed alexithymia with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale while gambling problems were assessed mostly with the South Oaks Gambling Screen. Alexithymic features were significantly more prevalent in pathological gamblers both at the community and clinical levels, increased symptom severity, and showed interactive mechanisms with personality, psychiatric, and cognitive factors. Alexithymia is likely to associate with gambling as a coping behavior to increase emotional arousal and avoid negative emotions, according to the affect dysregulation model.

In this qualitative study, we identify staff opposed to SWPBIS among staff in 36 schools across 9 districts in western Washington. Nonsupportive staff (n = 44) are compared to supportive staff (n = 1,166) on demographic variables. Then, open-ended statements provided by nonsupportive staff are coded and analyzed to identify themes and develop an understanding of concerns about the SWPBIS initiative in their schools.

In Italy, only one study has examined the IAT factor validity, and a comprehensive investigation of its psychometric characteristics is so far lacking. The purpose of this study was to perform a psychometric analysis of the Italian IAT. A total of 840 students (Mage=18.65 years, SD=3.85 years; 59% female) were recruited. Pertaining to scale dimensionality, the best-fit measurement model includes two factors: ""Emotional and cognitive preoccupations with the Internet and social consequences"" and ""Loss of control and interference with daily duties"" (χ(2)/df=3.38; comparative fit index=0.88; Tucker-Lewis Index=0.87; root mean square error of approximation=0.07), which together explained 45.59% of the variance. Internal consistency Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.83 to 0.86. Convergent validity was demonstrated, with significant correlations between IAT and Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale 2 scores. The Italian version of the IAT was found to have good psychometric properties and a two-factorial structure. Identification of the IAT dimensions may help to define the construct better and develop intervention strategies.","[{'authorId': '145958251', 'name': 'G.

Two measurements were applied: The Conners Comprehensive Behaviour Rating Scales and the Emotion Regulation Checklist. The study results revealed a statistically significant inverse correlation between male and female first grade students’ academic difficulties and their ability to regulate emotions. The weaker the ability of first grade students to organize their emotions, the greater the likelihood of facing academic difficulties. The results also indicated the presence of apparent differences in the correlation coefficients attributed to gender in favour of male students, as emotion regulation impacted academic difficulties in male students to a higher degree than the impact in female students. Finally, the results suggested a predictive relationship between students’ emotion regulation skills and level of academic difficulties.","[{'authorId': '116509465', 'name': 'J.

Resource theories of occupational stress argue that employees' personal and environmental resources protect them from too much distress or strain during stressful work experiences. We examined four resources (emotional stability, previous experience, low drain on pre-existing resources, and workgroup quality) available to soldiers at the beginning of a stressful 3-month training experience as predictors of the trajectories of their strains over that period of time. Based on conservation of resources theory and the job demands–resources model, we predicted that the trends of strains would be more favorable (would increase more slowly or decline more quickly) if participants started the training with greater resources. The resources, primarily emotional stability and lack of pre-existing resource drain, tended to be negatively related to strains, consistent with the idea that they can reduce strains. Significant interactions predicting trends were found predicting two of the three strains (post-traumatic stress symptoms and depression, but not reports of physical health). Contrary to expectations, however, the three resources that significantly predicted trends over time (emotional stability, previous experience, and low pre-existing resource drain) were associated with worsening rather than improving strains.

It used the Korean nationwide National Health Insurance Service claims database. SSDD patients who had at least one visit to Korea’s primary, secondary, or tertiary referral hospitals with a diagnosis of SSDD, according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), were identified as SSDD cases if coded as F20-F29. Data were analyzed using frequency statistics. Results showed that the 12-month prevalence rate of SSDD increased steadily from 0.40% in 2008 to 0.45% in 2017. Analysis of the three-year cumulative prevalence rate of SSDD showed an increase from 0.51% in 2011 to 0.54% in 2017. In 2017, the five-year cumulative prevalence rate was 0.61%, and the 10-year cumulative prevalence rate was 0.75%. The hospital admission rate among SSDD patients decreased from 2008 (30.04%) to 2017 (28.53%). The incidence of SSDD was 0.05% and no yearly change was observed. The proportion of SSDD inpatients whose first hospital visit resulted in immediate hospitalization was 22.4% in 2017. Epidemiological indicators such as prevalence, incidence, and hospitalization rate play an important role in planning social and financial resource allocation. Therefore, efforts to produce more accurate epidemiological indicators are very important and this study’s findings could have a significant social impact.","[{'authorId': '83929005', 'name': 'Yoon-Sun Jung'}, {'authorId': '49170314', 'name': 'Young-Eun Kim'}, {'authorId': '52318936', 'name': 'D.

497af213d4d4e54ec4a6fce7367334b9f27c4cb9,The objectives were to study the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of drug abuse among young adults aged 16-21 from upper socio-economic strata. The survey was conducted to identify certain psychosocial risk factors such as coping skills independence/self-confidence family communication peer relationships and motivational factors for drug abuse among adolescents. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire with thirty-four close-ended questions plus two open ended questions. Data was collected from different educational institutions located in Defence and Clifton areas of Karachi Pakistan. Researchers of this study collected the data and verbal consent was obtained from the participants. A total of 300 students were interviewed. 192 were males and 108 females. 51% of students were studying at school level and 47% at college level. 34% reported drug abuse out of which 21% were males and 13% were females. 52% reported cigarette smoking out of which 33% were male and 19% females. 17% of drug abusers parents were divorced or separated. 31% reported their best friends consume drugs out of which 22% were drug abusers themselves. A total of 35% of students reported their parents’ indulgence in alcohol/ drug abuse. Among students who themselves abuse drugs 63% reported their parent’s indulgence in drugs. The most common drugs taken by students were Alcohol Ecstasy and Hashih i.e. 37.9%. Highly significant positive correlations existed between drug abuse with parents’ marital status as divorced or separated (p=.290). Significant differences (p < 0.001) were observed between abusers and non-abusers on sub-scales of coping skill selfcontrol parental relations and peer relations. Highly significant negative correlations existed for high score on subscales of coping skill (-.344) self-control (-.332) peer relations (-.277) and parental relations (-.357) for drug abuse. There is a need for population-based studies to determine other correlates of drug abuse among young adults in Pakistan.

However, little attention has been given to the potential role of self‐kindness specifically, especially in the context of mindful presence and available social support, in buffering distress. Method Structural equation modelling was used to test a theoretically based model of how these factors relate to each other and psychological distress. Participants were 592 Australian university students. Results Results confirmed our hypotheses, showing that: (a) receiving social support is important to the capacity for self‐kindness both directly and indirectly through the ability to “be present,” and (b) the relationship between social support and psychological distress is partially mediated by the practices of self‐kindness and being present. The model of social support, being present, and self‐kindness accounted for half the variance in psychological distress. With the addition of stressors, a regression model explained a total of 62% of the variance. Conclusions These findings have implications for understanding the construct of self‐kindness and its role in the development of interventions to improve student success.","[{'authorId': '4709623', 'name': 'H.

 Objective: Improving education level was evidenced to decrease the risk of schizophrenia, but whether this strength of education role depends on gender is not. This study aimed to investigate whether there is sex difference in the association between education and schizophrenia in Chinese adults. Methods: Data was obtained from the Second China National Sample Survey on Disability in 2006, and restricted our analysis to 1,909,205 participants aged 18 years or older, which covered 31 provinces (administrative districts) in China. Schizophrenia was ascertained according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Logistics regression models was fitted to examine the combined effect of sex and education on schizophrenia. Results: The prevalence of schizophrenia in female groups was higher than in male groups, with 0.44% (95% CI : 0.42%, 0.45%) and 0.36% (95% CI : 0.35%, 0.37%), respectively. There is a statistical significant difference that more females experienced severe or extreme difficulty in understanding and communicating. However, more males suffered from severe or extreme difficulty in the function of daily activities and participation in society. The combined effect of education and schizophrenia was statistically significant ( OR =1.05, 95%CI =1.02, 1.08), indicating that, as the level of education level increased, schizophrenia risk of females decreased faster than the risk of males. Conclusions: This study showed that additional years of education reduce the risk of schizophrenia for both men and women while also closing the gender gap between them. As education elevated, the risk of schizophrenia decreased more for women than for men. The findings indicated that improving education level may have an effect on reducing gender gaps in schizophrenia in China.

Variance in performance that persists when situational variables are held constant suggests that individual dif erences play an important role in determining whether children thrive or fail in school. In this chapter, we review research on individual dif erences in selfregulation and their relation to school success. Historically, research on individual dif erences that bear on school success has focused on general intelligence. A century of empirical evidence has now unequivocally established that intelligence, dei ned as the “ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt ef ectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking thought” (Neisser et al., 1996 , p. 77) has a monotonic, positive relationship with school success (Gottfredson, 2004; Kuncel, Ones, & Sackett, 2010 ; Lubinski, 2009 ). In contrast, the relation between school success and temperamental dif erences among children has only recently attracted serious attention from researchers. Temperament is typically dei ned as “constitutionally based individual dif erences in reactivity and self-regulation, in the domains of af ect, activity, and attention” (Rothbart & Bates, 2006 , p. 100). While assumed to have a substantial genetic basis, temperament is also inl uenced by experience and demonstrates both stability and change over time. h is chapter focuses on self-regulation because it is the dimension of temperament most reliably related to school success. We address several related questions: What is the relation between self-regulation and both educational attainment (e.g., years of education, high school completion) and Chapter 10 Self-Regulation and School Success Angela Lee Duckworth University of Pennsylvania Stephanie M.

Does self-regulation also predict job performance, health, and other dimensions of success in life? Finally, what progress has been made in deliberately cultivating self-regulatory competence in children? Naming, Defining, and Measuring Self-Regulation We dei ne self-regulation as the voluntary control of attentional, emotional, and behavioral impulses in the service of personally valued goals and standards. By specifying that goals and standards are personally valued, we do not mean that they are necessarily seli sh. On the contrary, self-regulation is required to adhere to goals and standards that are altruistic in nature (e.g., sharing a prize rather than keeping it all for oneself) as well as those that are not (e.g., receiving a larger treat for oneself rather than a smaller one). For clarity’s sake, we point out that we use the term “self-regulation” interchangeably with the terms self-control, self-discipline, and willpower – and suggest that the terms impulsiveness and impulsivity connote dei cits in self-regulatory competence. Of particular relevance to this chapter, we consider selfregulation to be coextensive with ef ortful control, a well-recognized aspect of temperament in children that has been dei ned as “the ability to inhibit a dominant response to perform a subdominant response, to detect errors, and to engage in planning” (Rothbart & Rueda, 2005 , p. 169). Crucially, in situations that tax self-regulation, at least two mutually exclusive responses are possible, and the weaker (i.e., subdominant) response is preferred to the stronger (i.e., dominant) impulse. While self-regulation is most certainly multi-dimensional in the sense of involving more than one distinct psychological process (Duckworth & Kern, 2011 ; Whiteside & Lynam, 2001 ; Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 2005 ), we suggest it is nevertheless a coherent higher-order construct (de Ridder, Lensvelt-Mulders, Finkenauer, Stok, & Baumeister, 2012; Heatherton & Wagner, 2011 ) and a proi table target of study alongside its component processes. In taxonomies of childhood temperament, self-regulation is typically distinguished from two factors that are more reactive and less voluntary in nature: negative emotionality (shyness, fear, sadness, etc.) and surgency (activity level, sensation seeking, positive emotion) (Rothbart & Rueda, 2005 ). h e location of self-regulation in omnibus taxonomies of adult personality is debatable (Revelle, 1997 ). At present, the most widely accepted organization for adult personality distinguishes i ve families of traits (the Big Five): Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Extraversion, Emotional Stability, and Openness to Experience. Many psychologists consider self-regulation Duckworth and Carlson 210 to be identical – or nearly so – with Big Five Conscientiousness (Caspi & Shiner, 2006 ; Moi tt et al., 2011). Others have proposed that self-regulation relates to other Big Five factors as well. For instance, Whiteside and Lynam ( 2001 ) suggest that the tendency to think and plan before acting and the regulation of behavior in the face of frustration are both aspects of Big Five Conscientiousness, whereas the regulation of urgent, negative emotions corresponds to Big Five Emotional Stability, and the tendency to have strong impulses toward risky, exciting activities (which makes selfregulation more dii cult) relates to Big Five Extraversion. Additionally, in children, the regulation of impulses in the context of interactions with peers and adults has clear conceptual links to Big Five Agreeableness (Tsukayama, Duckworth, & Kim, 2011 ). Executive functioning overlaps conceptually with the temperament trait of ef ortful control, though the scientii c investigation of these two constructs tends to be segregated, with neuroscientists primarily interested in executive functioning and temperament researchers primarily concerned with ef ortful control (Rothbart & Rueda, 2005 ). Rueda, Posner, and Rothbart ( 2005 ) have argued that executive function (and in particular, the executive attention network, which monitors and resolves conl ict between other brain networks) and ef ortful control are concepts representing dif erent methodological approaches to studying self-regulation of behavior (see also Checa, Rodriguez-Bailon, & Rueda, 2008 ). Children who do better on direct tasks of executive function tend to be rated signii cantly higher in ef ortful control by their parents (Chang & Burns, 2005 ; Gerardi-Caulton, 2000 ; Gonzalez, Fuentes, Carranza, & Estevez, 2001 ; Rothbart, Ellis, Rueda, & Posner, 2003 ; Simonds, 2007 ). However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that in general, correlations between individual executive function tasks and questionnaire measures of self-control are small in size (e.g., r = .14 with informant-report ratings; Duckworth & Kern, 2011 ). Even when batteries of executive function tasks are used to improve reliability and validity (Carlson, Faja, & Beck, in press ), associates with informant ratings are only moderate in magnitude, suggesting that executive function is not the only contributing factor to self-controlled behavior. Historical Interest in Self-Regulation and School Success h e idea that self-regulation plays an important role in the classroom is not new. In a series of lectures addressed to Boston schoolteachers, William James ( 1899 ) stated that in “schoolroom work” there is inevitably “a large Self-Regulation and School Success 211 mass of material that must be dull and unexciting” (pp. 104–105). Further, “there is unquestionably a great native variety among individuals in the type of their attention. Some of us are naturally scatter-brained, and others follow easily a train of connected thoughts without temptation to swerve aside to other subjects” (p. 112). It follows, James argued, that a dispositional advantage in the capacity for sustained attention is tremendously benei cial in the classroom. Improbably, pioneers of intelligence testing were among the i rst to recognize the importance of self-regulation to academic performance. Binet and Simon ( 1916 ), architect of the i rst modern intelligence test, noted that performance in school: admits of other things than intelligence; to succeed in his studies, one must have qualities which depend on attention, will, and character; for example a certain docility, a regularity of habits, and especially continuity of ef ort . A child, even if intelligent, will learn little in class if he never listens, if he spends his time in playing tricks, in giggling, in playing truant. (p. 254, italics added) David Wechsler ( 1943 ), who several decades later helped usher intelligence testing into widespread clinical and educational practice, made similar observations about the unfortunate neglect of “non-intellective” factors which, in conjunction with general intelligence, determine intelligent behavior: When our scales measure the non-intellective as well as the intellectual factors in intelligence, they will more nearly measure what in actual life corresponds to intelligent behavior. Under these circumstances they might not be so ei cient in selecting individuals likely to succeed in Latin and geometry, but they should do a much better job in selecting those destined ","[{'authorId': '5720574', 'name': 'A.

The bioecological model is an evolving theoretical system for the scientific study of human development over time. The model presented in this chapter represents major theoretical innovations from the 1983 chapter in both form and content. The new model is not a paradigm shift, but rather represents a transition from a focus on the environment to a focus on proximal processes as engines of development. We begin with the defining properties of the model, which involves four principal components (process, person, context, and time), and the dynamic, interactive relationships among them. We then turn to the research designs required for testing the model. In doing so, we not only present the next stage in the evolution of an ecological theory of human development, but we also document the requirements for conducting developmental research in the discovery mode. We conclude with a look to the future—and what the bioecological model means for the future development of our species.

Major Professors: Eugene H. Spa↵ord and Mikhail J. Atallah. As the convergence between our physical and digital worlds continue at a rapid pace, securing our digital information is vital to our prosperity. Most current typical computer systems are unwittingly helpful to attackers through their predictable responses. In everyday security, deception plays a prominent role in our lives and digital security is no di↵erent. The use of deception has been a cornerstone technique in many successful computer breaches. Phishing, social engineering, and drive-bydownloads are some prime examples. The work in this dissertation is structured to enhance the security of computer systems by using means of deception and deceit. Deception-based security mechanisms focus on altering adversaries’ perception of computer systems in a way that can confuse them and waste their time and resources. These techniques exploit adversaries’ biases and present them with a plausible alternative to the truth bringing a number of unique advantages to computer security. In addition, deception has been widely used in many areas of computing for decades and security is no di↵erent. However, deception has only been used haphazardly in computer security. In this dissertation we present a framework where deception can be planned and integrated into computer defenses. We posit how the well-known Kerckho↵s’s principle has been misinterpreted to drive the security community away from deception-based mechanisms.

It also aims at exploring the gender difference among the variables of study. 
Methodology: This cross section study was conducted at National Institute of Psychology, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan from January to August 2018. Using purposive convenience sampling data were collected from 200 patients of AV. SAA was assessed through social appearance anxiety scale, PD was measured through Kessler psychological distress scale and DRQoL was measured through Dermatology Life Quality Index. 
Results: There was significant positive relationship among SAA, PD and DRQoL (as high scores on Dermatology Life Quality Index indicate impaired quality of life). SAA positively predicted DRQoL and accounted for 58% of variance in it. Females scored significantly higher on SAA and DRQoL where as non-significant gender differences were found on PD. 
Conclusion: Acne vulgaris produces SAA and PD as a consequence of which DRQoL of individuals is impaired.","[{'authorId': '1664192439', 'name': 'FatimaZakir'}, {'authorId': '145935350', 'name': 'Saira Khan'}, {'authorId': '15518163', 'name': 'N.

The concept of shared representations suggests that during empathy, we co-represent another person's affect by engaging brain and bodily functions underpinning the first-hand experience of the emotion we are empathizing with. This possible grounding of empathy in our own emotional experiences explains the necessity for self–other distinction, which is the capacity to correctly distinguish between our own affective representations and those related to the other. In spite of the importance of these two components in empathy, several aspects still remain controversial. This paper addresses some of them and focuses on (i) the distinction between shared activations versus representations, raising the question what shared representations entail in terms of the underlying neural mechanisms, (ii) the possible mechanisms behind self–other distinction in the cognitive and the affective domains, and whether they have distinct neural underpinnings and (iii) the consequences associated with a selective impairment of one of the two components, thereby addressing their importance in mental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, psychopathy and alexithymia.","[{'authorId': '2304832', 'name': 'C.

There has been little research into the association of shame and other self-conscious emotions in bipolar disorder, although there is evidence linking shame to various psychopathologies.


OBJECTIVES
This research investigates the levels of shame in individuals with bipolar disorder.


DESIGN AND METHODS
A cross-sectional design was used to compare 24 individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder to a clinical control group of 18 individuals with unipolar depression, and 23 age-matched non-psychiatric controls on measures of mood (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] and Self Report Manic Inventory [SRMI]) and of self-conscious emotions (Internalized Shame Scale and Test of Self-Conscious Affect).


RESULTS
Higher levels of trait shame and lower guilt-proneness were found in the bipolar group. Higher levels of shame-proneness were found in the unipolar group in comparison to the bipolar and control groups. BDI scores positively correlated with trait shame and shame-proneness, and accounted for a large proportion of the variance in these scores. SRMI scores positively correlated with trait (internalized) shame and negatively correlated with guilt-proneness.


CONCLUSIONS
There was evidence for the presence of shame within bipolar disorder, but this differed to the evidence for shame in individuals with unipolar depression. Clinical implications are discussed. ","[{'authorId': '47711991', 'name': 'J. Highfield'}, {'authorId': '145992368', 'name': 'Dominic Markham'}, {'authorId': '47973875', 'name': 'M.

This article selectively reviews and compares the EC and EF literature. The review indicates considerable similarities and overlaps in the definitions, core components, and measurement of EC and EF. Differences between the 2 literatures seem to primarily reflect differences in research focus as influenced by each field’s “tradition” rather than “real” differences in EC and EF as developmental constructs. Thus, developing an integrated theory of self-regulation encompassing the EC and EF perspectives is critical for reducing overlap and confusion in future research. The article provides a number of recommendations on how to integrate the theory and methodology of EC and EF in future research for (a) the components and organization of self-regulation, (b) the relation of self-regulation to children’s adaptive functions, (c) the neurological basis of self-regulation and its development, and (d) the development and evaluation of interventions targeting children’s self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '2218929589', 'name': 'Qing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2110910035', 'name': 'Stephen H Chen'}, {'authorId': '47478537', 'name': 'Alexandra Main'}]",358.0,,107.0,Commonalities and Differences in the Research on Children’s Effortful Control and Executive Function: A Call for an Integrated Model of Self‐Regulation,2012.0

The ADFL framework is mainly composed of three branches: expression disentangling branch ADFL-d, neutral expression branch ADFL-n and residual expression branch ADFL-r. The ADFL-d and ADFL-n aim to extract the expressive component and neutral component, respectively. The ADFL-r extracts the residual expression by calculating the difference between feature maps of ADFL-d and ADFL-n, and uses the residual expression feature for expression classification.

Stigmatization can strongly affect the social integration of children and adolescents with developmental and behavioral disorders. The goal of the study was to investigate negative and positive labeling of speech-language impaired children as perceived by their parents. We analyzed 386 parental questionnaires on stigmatization by and support from other children, family members and other adults. Half of the parents reported stigmatization of their child. They perceived negative labeling and exclusion most frequently in the child's peer group, but also among family members. Support was more common than negative labeling, however. There was a strong positive relationship between negative labeling and behavioral problems. Parents of children with developmental and behavioral disorders often perceive stigmatization of their child. Therefore, in counseling such families child and adolescent psychiatrists should address this issue adequately and recommend appropriate coping strategies.

4e0cd4c0679ceb44998618f57c02719caafb201e,"Prior work in affect-aware educational robots has often relied on a common belief that the relationship between student affect and learning is independent of agent behaviors (child’s/robot’s) or unidirectional (positive/negative but not both) throughout the entire student-robot interaction. We argue that the student affect-learning relationship should be interpreted in two contexts: (1) social learning paradigm and (2) sub-events within child-robot interaction. In our paper, we examine two different social learning paradigms where children interact with a robot that acts either as a tutor or a tutee. Sub-events within child-robot interaction are defined as task-related events occurring in specific phases of an interaction (e.g., when the child/robot gets a wrong answer). We examine sub-events at a macro level (entire interaction) and a micro level (within specific sub-events). In this paper, we provide an in-depth correlation analysis of children’s facial affect and vocabulary learning. We found that children’s affective displays became more predictive of their vocabulary learning when children interacted with a tutee robot who did not scaffold their learning. Additionally, children’s affect displayed during micro-level events was more predictive of their learning than during macro-level events. Last, we found that the affect-learning relationship is not unidirectional, but rather is modulated by context, i.e., several affective states facilitated student learning when displayed in some sub-events but inhibited learning when displayed in others. These findings indicate that both social learning paradigm and sub-events within interaction modulate student affect-learning relationship.

Specific questions addressed in this paper are whether children express signs of social engagement as a reaction to such events, and if so, in what way. The second question is whether these reactions differ between different types of social events, and finally, whether such reactions disappear or change over time. Our analysis indicates that children indeed show behaviors that indicate social engagement using a range of communicative channels. While gaze towards the robot's face is the most common indication for all types of social events, verbal expressions and nods are especially common for questions, and smiles are most common after positive feedback. Although social responses in general decrease slightly over time, they are still observable after three sessions with the robot.","[{'authorId': '3205653', 'name': 'Sofia Serholt'}, {'authorId': '2431058', 'name': 'W.

This review examined the impact of therapist attachment style on therapeutic alliance and outcomes.


METHODS
Systematic search procedures yielded 11 studies for inclusion that measured associations between therapist attachment style and alliance and/or outcome.


RESULTS
There is some preliminary evidence that therapist attachment style and interactions between therapist and client attachment style contribute to alliance and therapy outcomes. However, methodological weaknesses and heterogeneity across studies highlight the need for more rigorously designed research in this area.


CONCLUSIONS
There is sufficient evidence to suggest that therapists need to pay attention to the influence of their own attachment style in therapeutic processes and that there is merit in pursing this area of research further. The review is important in highlighting key design issues to consider in future studies. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.


KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE
Therapist attachment style has the potential to influence therapeutic alliance and client outcome. Improvements in therapeutic practice might be achieved if therapists have greater knowledge of their own attachment styles and how these interact with their clients' attachment styles to influence the psychotherapy relationship and outcomes. From the outset of their careers, therapists should receive training and supervision to enhance the awareness of their individual attachment experiences and how these play out during the therapeutic process.","[{'authorId': '40582442', 'name': 'Amy Degnan'}, {'authorId': '1456469293', 'name': 'Annily Seymour-Hyde'}, {'authorId': '50722533', 'name': 'A.

This study investigates further the factors contributing to limited QUIL by examining the effects of input frequency and word type (nouns vs. verbs). In addition, immediate versus long-term memory was examined for possible problems with storage mechanisms. Subjects were 30 5-year-old SLI children with receptive and expressive language deficits and two comparison groups of normally developing children: 30 MLU-equivalent and 30 CA-equivalent. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions in which they viewed video story presentations in which targeted words were embedded. The conditions varied by number of word presentations, 0, 3, or 10. The 0 condition was a control condition in which familiar words were presented. Children's word comprehension was tested immediately following viewing and again several days later. The findings confirm a strong frequency effect, but one that is influenced by group status, word type, and retention demands. There is evidence of a robust representational mapping ability for SLI, which is at the same time modulated by a minimum input constraint and apparent problems with storage into long-term memory.","[{'authorId': '2250180011', 'name': 'Mabel L.

5006d69a14a12e0ab627df3ae57cad9dae333ede,"Spoken interactions between a human user and an artificial device (such as a social robot) have attracted much attention in recent decades (Lison and Meena, 2014; Oracle, 2020). Shifting from automation robots in the industrial domain, social robots are expected to be used in social domains, such as the service industry, education, healthcare, and entertainment (Bartneck et al., 2020, p.163). According to Darling (2016)’s definition, a social robot is “a physically embodied, autonomous agent that communicates and interacts with humans on an emotional level”. Many features play important roles in interactions with a social robot, such as people’s experience with technology products, expectations of social robots, interactional environments and other features such as a social robot’s appearance, voice and behaviours. In this last regard, affordance design affects how people perceive a social robot and how such perception affects their behaviours and experiences. The term “affordance” was invented by ecological psychologist Gibson (1977), who proposed that our perception of what it is possible to do with objects is shaped by their form. Affordance indicates what users see and can do with an object in a given situation; it is about perceptual action possibilities in an environment (Matei, 2020). A strong tendency in social robot affordance design is to make human-robot interaction (HRI) resemble human-human interaction (HHI). It is hoped in many studies that robots designed with anthropomorphic appearances and human-like cognitive behaviours can enable humans to interact with them in similar ways as they would interact with other humans, even to develop social bonds (Leite et al., 2013; Kahn et al., 2015; Koyama et al., 2017; Ligthart et al., 2018). However, there are concerns about this approach. In fact, speech-based artificial agents’ conversational interaction with human users is far from natural, and the language used tends to be formulaic (Moore et al., 2016). One of the reasons behind this is a significant change in the applications of spoken human-agent interaction (HAI) along the evolution of spoken language technology applications (Moore, 2017a). Compared with “command and control systems” of the 1970s and contemporary smartphone-based “personal assistants”, social robots are expected to be used in more dynamic and open environments. This implies that users’ expectations, demands and ways to interact with spoken agents differ OPEN ACCESS","[{'authorId': '16323386', 'name': 'Guanyu Huang'}, {'authorId': '145914568', 'name': 'Roger K.

508e75ab4b16abe288230156e5b88428ce446c2f,"Background Many adolescents in special education are affected by anxiety in addition to their behavioral problems. Anxiety leads to substantial long-term problems and may underlie disruptive behaviors in the classroom as a result of the individual’s inability to tolerate anxiety-provoking situations. Thus, interventions in special needs schools that help adolescents cope with anxiety and, in turn, diminish disruptive classroom behaviors are needed. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a virtual reality biofeedback game, DEEP, on daily levels of state-anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a clinical sample. In addition, the study also aimed to examine the duration of the calm or relaxed state after playing DEEP. Methods A total of 8 adolescents attending a special secondary school for students with behavioral and psychiatric problems participated in a single-case experimental ABAB study. Over a 4-week period, participants completed 6 DEEP sessions. In addition, momentary assessments (ie, 3 times a day) of self-reported state-anxiety and teacher-reported classroom behavior were collected throughout all A and B phases. Results From analyzing the individual profiles, it was found that 6 participants showed reductions in anxiety, and 5 participants showed reductions in disruptive classroom behaviors after the introduction of DEEP. On a group level, results showed a small but significant reduction of anxiety (d=–0.29) and a small, nonsignificant reduction of disruptive classroom behavior (d=−0.16) on days when participants played DEEP. Moreover, it was found that the calm or relaxed state of participants after playing DEEP lasted for about 2 hours on average. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of the game, DEEP, as an intervention for anxiety and disruptive classroom behavior in a special school setting. Future research is needed to fully optimize and personalize DEEP as an intervention for the heterogeneous special school population.","[{'authorId': '1589467497', 'name': 'Rineke Bossenbroek'}, {'authorId': '5712457', 'name': 'A.

Participants: 1040 college students (60.0% females), ranging in age from 16 to 26 (mean = 20.32; SD = 1.43). Methods: Participants completed a survey assessing their SSQ, PIU, and other covariates. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to test association between SSQ and PIU. Results: Around 46.8% of the sample reported poor SSQ, 17.3% was diagnosed with Internet addiction, and 64.3% were Internet overusers. Poor sleepers had 2.03 times greater odds (95%CI: 1.41-2.91) of being Internet overusers, and 3.25 greater odds (95%CI: 2.05-5.17) of being Internet addicts. Conclusions: Poor SSQ was strongly associated with elevated odds of PIU over and above the contributions of poor psychological functioning, substance use, and physical activity. Programs aimed at enhancing SSQ among college students should take reducing PIU into perspective.","[{'authorId': '2155616525', 'name': 'Qian Wang'}, {'authorId': '2108241128', 'name': 'Yujie Liu'}, {'authorId': '2118639790', 'name': 'Baohong Wang'}, {'authorId': '2052144966', 'name': 'Yang An'}, {'authorId': '2359832', 'name': 'Hongya Wang'}, {'authorId': '1699573232', 'name': 'Yaya Zhang'}, {'authorId': '8644807', 'name': 'Komi Mati'}]",16.0,,80.0,Problematic internet use and subjective sleep quality among college students in China: Results from a pilot study,2020.0

Moreover, theoretical models and preliminary empirical results suggest that difficulty in regulating emotional states might be involved in GD. However, literature describing clinical and theoretical aspects of emotional dysregulation among pathological gamblers (PGs) shows a lack of systematic description. Objectives We aimed to provide, within an exhaustive theoretical framework of emotion regulation (ER) processing, empirical evidence supporting a conceptual model of GD as an ER affliction. Methods We commented on empirical evidence on the relationship between ER and GD in the light of two main conceptual models of emotion (dys)regulation. Results The results suggest there are actual deficits of ER processing among PGs, manifesting themselves through different ways and in different steps of the ER timeline. In addition, dysregulation of positive emotions may play a central role in GD. From a clinical point of view, we pointed out that deficits in ER might be multiple in nature and an assessment for GD should be accurate to identify the specific components accounting for the development and maintenance of the disorder. It should also orientate the clinician in selecting therapeutic objectives. Conclusions The nature of emotional states that are difficult to regulate might account for the GD severity and indicate the subtype of PGs the patient belongs to. Treatment programs should be tailored on the specificity of PGs.","[{'authorId': '35358443', 'name': 'G. Rogier'}, {'authorId': '5635016', 'name': 'P.

Now, the design of autonomous devices that work in real therapeutic environments has become a plausible reality. Affective human-robot interaction requires a robot to analyze the emotional state of the human interlocutor and interpret emotional responses that can be used, not merely in the interaction but, for example, to provoke desired therapeutic responses. It is, therefore, necessary to broaden experimental techniques into more realistic paradigms, where the capacity of emotion estimation can be completely explored. This exploratory paper proposes a realistic experimental paradigm in which the robot employs a dramatic story to evoke emotions in the users, and tests previously self-designed methodologies to be able to make estimates of the users’ emotional state in real-time. Regardless of the multiple impediments and restrictions, and all the aspects that could still be improved, this paper can outline the feasibility of the proposed methodology in realistic scenarios.","[{'authorId': '1404358552', 'name': 'Mikel Val-Calvo'}, {'authorId': '1404358549', 'name': 'J.

The current study examined the anxiety level of twenty-six oneto fouryear-old children and their mothers at three times 1) before the first day of school, 2) during separation from their mother on the first day of school, and 3) after home from their first day of school. Maternal report was used to assess child and mother anxiety levels (Likert scale 01 0) and child level of attachment to a familiar inanimate object. No differences in anxiety levels were found among attached children who brought their attachment object with them on their first day of school, attached children without their objects, and unattached children with or without a familiar object. Children's anxiety did differ among the assessment times, verifying that separation from their mothers on first day of school is a low arousal situation. Mother's anxiety was not positively related to children's anxiety. Future studies might further explore an observed trend of children attached to inanimate objects displaying less anxiety than their unattached counterparts across school-related transitions. Attachment Object Effects on Children's Anxiety During School-Related Transitions Parents usually attempt to protect their children from discomfort. Unfortunately, discomfort cannot be avoided in everyday life. In psychology, many theories have been devised to address how humans cope with discomfort or anxiety, how it can be avoided, and what steps or stages of development may be involved. ""Anxiety"" is defined as ""most generally, a vague, unpleasant emotional state with qualities of apprehension, dread, distress and uneasiness"" (Reber, 1995). The grand theories (e.g., cognitive theory, learning theory, sociocultural theory, and psychoanalytic theory) and the minitheories (e.g., attachment theory, exchange theory, activity theory, and ethological theory) have been devised in an attempt to identify and define ways to avoid anxiety throughout the lifespan (Berger, 1998). Attachment & Attachment Theory Mini theories such as the Attachment Theory may be examined in order to identify and define ways to avoid anxiety. Such theories provide a closer look at minute details that may be lost in a grand theory. Attachment Theory is used to examine the relationship between a child and parent or caregiver, usually measuring behavior (e.g., anxiety) during first separations, novel situations, or strange situations considered low to moderately stressful (Ainsworth, 1985; Berger, 1958; Buckley, 1986). The term ""attachment theory"" is attributed to John Bowlby who in the 1950s attempted to described the development of a child's attachment to his mother more adequately than had been proposed prior, by combining and elaborating on views that he favored (Bowlby, 1958). Mary Ainsworth (1985), once a member of Bowlby's research team, went on to become one of the architects of the study of attachment theory. She describes","[{'authorId': '144574486', 'name': 'L. M.

Method: Twenty-four adults and eight adolescents with ADHD enrolled in a feasibility study of an 8-week mindfulness training program. Results: The majority of participants completed the training and reported high satisfaction with the training. Pre—post improvements in self-reported ADHD symptoms and test performance on tasks measuring attention and cognitive inhibition were noted. Improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms were also observed. Conclusion: Mindfulness training is a feasible intervention in a subset of ADHD adults and adolescents and may improve behavioral and neurocognitive impairments.

The purpose of this paper is to examine how a cognitive process, transcendence, moderates the relationship between perceptions of organizational politics (POPs) and several work outcomes. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Participants across two studies (Study 1: 187 student-recruited working adults; Study 2: 158 information technology employees) provided a demographically diverse sample for the analyses. Key variables were transcendence, POPs, job satisfaction, job tension, emotional exhaustion, work effort, and frustration. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Results corroborated the hypotheses and supported the authors’ argument that POPs lacked influence on work outcomes when individuals possessed high levels of transcendence. Specifically, high levels of transcendence attenuated the decreases in job satisfaction and work effort associated with POPs. Additionally, transcendence acted as an antidote to several workplace ills by weakening the increases in job tension, emotional exhaustion, and frustration usually associated with POPs. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
This study found that transcendence, an individual-level cognitive style, can improve work outcomes for employees in workplaces where POPs exist. Future studies should use longitudinal data to study how changes in POPs over time affect individuals’ reported levels of transcendence. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
Although it is impossible to eliminate politics in organizations, antidotes like transcendence can improve individuals’ responses to POPs.

On the contrary, there are very few works exploiting ICT to study the mechanisms that trigger the behavioral patterns during the specialized sessions of treatment focused on social interaction stimulation. From the study of the literature it emerges that the behavioral outcomes are qualitatively evaluated by the therapists making this way impossible to assess, in a consistent manner, the worth of the supplied ASD treatments that should be based on quantitative metric not available for this purpose yet. Moreover, the rare attempts to use a methodological approach are limited to the study of one (of at least a couple) of the several behavioral cues involved. In order to fill this gap, in this paper a technological framework able to analyze and integrate multiple visual cues in order to capture the behavioral trend along an ASD treatment is introduced. It is based on an algorithmic pipeline involving face detection, landmark extraction, gaze estimation, head pose estimation and facial expression recognition and it has been used to detect behavioral features during the interaction among different children, affected by ASD, and a humanoid robot. Experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed framework in the specific application context with respect to leading approaches in the literature, providing a reliable pathway to automatically build a quantitative report that could help therapists to better achieve either ASD diagnosis or assessment tasks.","[{'authorId': '134382334', 'name': 'Marco Del Coco'}, {'authorId': '46296411', 'name': 'M.

In a replication and extension framework, four studies (N = 193) examined whether individuals with social anxiety (HSAs) are impaired in using cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Self-reports and lab-based tasks of suppression and reappraisal were utilised among individuals with high and low levels of social anxiety. A meta-analysis of these studies indicated that, compared to controls, HSAs reported less frequent and effective use of reappraisal and more frequent and effective use of suppression. Counter to most models and our hypotheses, HSAs were more successful than controls in lab-based reappraisal of shame-arousing pictures as measured by subjective ratings, but not by event-related potentials. HSAs were less successful than controls in lab-based suppression of shame-arousing pictures as measured by subjective ratings, but not by event-related potentials. The results held even when participants were under social stress (impromptu speech anticipation). Overall, subjective reports of HSAs reveal strong deficits in emotion regulation whereas lab-based measures provided less conclusive evidence of such deficits. These results suggest that individuals with social anxiety experience difficulties implementing their reappraisal abilities in daily life.","[{'authorId': '5881290', 'name': 'Yogev Kivity'}, {'authorId': '49909273', 'name': 'J.

I AN ERA OF CONSTANT DISTRACTIONS in the form of portable phones, CD players, computers, and televisions for even young children, it is hardly surprising to discover that many students have not learned to self-regulate their academic studying very well. Consider the case of Tracy, a high school student who is infatuated with MTV. An important mid-term math exam is two weeks away, and she has begun to study while listening to popular music “to relax her.” Tracy has not set any study goals for herself—instead she simply tells herself to do as well as she can on the test. She uses no specific learning strategies for condensing and memorizing important material and does not plan out her study time, so she ends up cramming for a few hours before the test. She has only vague self-evaluative standards and cannot gauge her academic preparation accurately. Tracy attributes her learning difficulties to an inherent lack of mathematical ability and is very defensive about her poor study methods. However, she does not ask for help from others because she is afraid of “looking stupid,” or seek out supplementary materials from the library because she “already has too much to learn.” She finds studying to be anxiety-provoking, has little self-confidence in achieving success, and sees little intrinsic value in acquiring mathematical skill. Self-regulation researchers have sought to understand students like Tracy and to provide help in developing key processes that she lacks, such as goal setting, time management, learning strategies, self-evaluation, self-attributions, seeking help or information, and important self-motivational beliefs, such as self-efficacy and intrinsic task interest. In recent years, there have been exciting discoveries regarding the nature, origins, and development of how students regulate their own learning processes (Zimmerman & Schunk, 2001). Although these studies have clearly revealed how self-regulatory processes lead to success in school, few teachers currently prepare students to learn on their own. In this article, I discuss students’ self-regulation as a way to compensate for their individual differences in learning, define the essential qualities of academic self-regulation, describe the structure and function of self-regulatory processes, and, finally, give an overview of methods for guiding students to learn on their own.","[{'authorId': '12321217', 'name': 'B.

Social robots have the potential to support autistic school children with their wellbeing. This research reveals how a co-design approach with autistic children and their teachers was undertaken. Focus groups with autistic children and teachers collaboratively identified user requirements for the social robot and robot behaviours within the school ecosystem in order to improve student wellbeing. The results reveal the importance of including autistic children in the co-design process to ensure their voices are heard and also that the role of the robot is appropriate and targeted to the users’ needs and requirements. Autistic children and their teachers report multiple potential benefits for social robots supporting emotional wellbeing in the school. Autistic children were supportive of the introduction of a social robot in their school, mostly expressing positive attitudes towards the robot.

We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of sequential floating forward search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.","[{'authorId': '1719389', 'name': 'Rosalind W.

539feb147ea839d83da9724c80a5ec30a683fb09,"OBJECTIVE
Neuropsychological deficits and emotion dysregulation are present in symptomatic and euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. However, there is little evidence on how cognitive functioning is influenced by emotion, what the neural correlates of emotional distraction effects are, and whether such deficits are a consequence or a precursor of the disorder. The authors used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate these questions.


METHOD
fMRI was used first to localize the neural network specific to a certain cognitive task (mental arithmetic) and then to test the effect of emotional distractors on this network. Euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder (N=22), two populations at high risk for developing the disorder (unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder [N=17]), and healthy participants with hypomanic personality traits [N=22]) were tested, along with three age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy comparison groups (N=22, N=17, N=24, respectively).


RESULTS
There were no differences in performance or activation in the task network for mental arithmetic. However, while all participants exhibited slower responses when emotional distractors were present, this response slowing was greatly enlarged in bipolar patients. Similarly, task-related activation was generally increased under emotional distraction; however, bipolar patients exhibited a further increase in right parietal activation that correlated positively with the response slowing effect.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that emotional dysregulation leads to exacerbated neuropsychological deficits in bipolar patients, as evidenced by behavioral slowing and task-related hyperactivation. The lack of such a deficit in high-risk populations suggests that it occurs only after disease onset, rather than representing a vulnerability marker.","[{'authorId': '2197918', 'name': 'Philipp Kanske'}, {'authorId': '39587811', 'name': 'J.

Job resources (e.g., autonomy, social support, or reward) but also personal resources (such as emotion regulation strategies) might reduce job stress and support well-being. Following this, the present study focused on strengthening emotion regulation as 1 way of dealing with high job demands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a standardized emotion regulation training (Affect Regulation Training [ART]; Berking, 2010) to improve emotion regulation skills and well-being of employees in elderly health care. Therefore, 96 elderly care workers filled out an established questionnaire of emotion regulation skills as well as a measure of well-being at pretreatment, posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up. The findings show that the ART fosters emotion regulation skills. In particularly, acceptance, tolerance, and modification of negative emotions was enhanced in the training groups in comparison to a control-group. Modification, meaning the ability to actively change emotions, improved even more over the follow-up-period. Simultaneously, well-being of participants increased over all measurement time points in the ART-group compared with the control-group. Additionally, the improvement in emotion regulation skills from pre to posttreatment was related to well-being at follow-up. In summary, our results support the ART as an effective intervention for dealing with negative emotions and to enhance well-being among employees in elderly care.

The focus on sensory processing in ASD research has increased substantially in the last decade. This research has been approached from two different perspectives: the first focuses on characterizing the symptoms that manifest in response to real world sensory stimulation, and the second focuses on the neural pathways and mechanisms underlying sensory processing. The purpose of this paper is to integrate the empirical literature on sensory processing in ASD from the last decade, including both studies characterizing sensory symptoms and those that investigate neural response to sensory stimuli. We begin with a discussion of definitions to clarify some of the inconsistencies in terminology that currently exist in the field. Next, the sensory symptoms literature is reviewed with a particular focus on developmental considerations and the relationship of sensory symptoms to other core features of the disorder. Then, the neuroscience literature is reviewed with a focus on methodological approaches and specific sensory modalities. Currently, these sensory symptoms and neuroscience perspectives are largely developing independently from each other leading to multiple, but separate, theories and methods, thus creating a multidisciplinary approach to sensory processing in ASD. In order to progress our understanding of sensory processing in ASD, it is now critical to integrate these two research perspectives and move toward an interdisciplinary approach. This will inevitably aid in a better understanding of the underlying biological basis of these symptoms and help realize the translational value through its application to early identification and treatment. The review ends with specific recommendations for future research to help bridge these two research perspectives in order to advance our understanding of sensory processing in ASD.","[{'authorId': '3766466', 'name': 'Kimberly B.

Study sample: The participant sample included ten adults over the age of 60 years who had owned hearing aids for at least one year. Results: Data analysis revealed three dimensions to patient-centred audiological rehabilitation: the therapeutic relationship, the players (audiologist and patient), and clinical processes. Individualised care was seen as an overarching theme linking each of these dimensions. Conclusions: This study reported two models: the first model describes what older adults with hearing aids believe constitutes patient-centred audiological rehabilitation.

We meta-analyzed studies adopting the model to (a) examine the intercorrelations among illness representation dimensions, coping strategies, and illness outcomes; (b) test the sufficiency of a process model in which relations between illness representations and outcomes were mediated by coping strategies; and (c) test effects of moderators on model relations. Studies adopting the common-sense model in chronic illness (k = 254) were subjected to random-effects meta-analysis. The pattern of zero-order corrected correlations among illness representation dimensions (identity, consequences, timeline, perceived control, illness coherence, emotional representations), coping strategies (avoidance, cognitive reappraisal, emotion venting, problem-focused generic, problem-focused specific, seeking social support), and illness outcomes (disease state, distress, well-being, physical, role, and social functioning) was consistent with previous analyses. Meta-analytic path analyses supported a process model that included direct effects of illness representations on outcomes and indirect effects mediated by coping. Emotional representations and perceived control were consistently related to illness-related and functional outcomes via, respectively, lower and greater employment of coping strategies to deal with symptoms or manage treatment. Representations signaling threat (consequences, identity) had specific positive and negative indirect effects on outcomes through problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies.

The purpose of this study was to analyze differences between preadolescents and adolescents on the use of technology and to test the contribution of using Internet and mobile phone, and circadian preference on sleep quality.


METHODS
We recruited a sample of 850 (364 males) preadolescents and adolescents. Self-report questionnaires about sleep schedule, sleep wake behavior problems, circadian preferences, and the use of technology (e.g., Internet and mobile phone) were administered. Students were asked to fill out the School Sleep Habits Survey, a self-report questionnaire on the use of technology, the Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire (MPIQ), and the Shorter Promis Questionnaire (SPQ).


RESULTS
Adolescents reported more sleep problems, a tendency toward eveningness, and an increase of Internet and phone activities, as well as social network activities, while preadolescents were more involved in gaming console and television viewing. The regression analysis performed separately in the two age groups showed that sleep quality was affected by the circadian preference (eveningness) in both groups. Adolescents' bad sleep quality was consistently associated with the mobile phone use and number of devices in the bedroom, while in preadolescents, with Internet use and turning-off time.


CONCLUSIONS
The evening circadian preference, mobile phone and Internet use, numbers of other activities after 21:00, late turning off time, and number of devices in the bedroom have different negative influence on sleep quality in preadolescents and adolescents.","[{'authorId': '5504752', 'name': 'O.

55958f70710756a8a4544063c812b1582ece2a5f,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES
To examine the experiences of compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction among oncology nurses in the United States and Canada.  .


DESIGN
Quantitative, descriptive, nonexperimental. .


SETTING
Online survey with members from the Canadian Association of Nursing Oncology and the Oncology Nursing Society. .


SAMPLE
486 American and 63 Canadian practicing oncology nurses. .


METHODS
The Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale, version 5, and modified Abendroth Demographic Questionnaire were administered through FluidSurveys™, an online data collection instrument. Chi-square tests of independence were used to investigate associations between demographic characteristics, health, personal stressors, and work-related characteristics to experiences of compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction. Compassion fatigue was measured using the subscales of secondary traumatic stress and burnout.  .


MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES
Compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction. .


FINDINGS
Demographic characteristics were similar in American and Canadian participants, and both cohorts reported comparable levels of compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction. Perception of team cohesiveness within the workplace environment was found to be significant for both groups, as indicated by significant relationships in all three subscales of secondary traumatic stress, burnout, and compassion satisfaction in the ProQOL. .


CONCLUSIONS
Healthy and supportive work environments are imperative to nurses' health, well-being, and satisfaction. Improvements in the workplace can help prevent negative sequelae, as well as improve health outcomes for patients and nurses, decrease nurse turnover, and reduce healthcare expenditures.  .


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING
Findings can be used to implement institutional changes, such as creating policies and guidelines for the development of preventive interventions and psychosocial support for nurses.","[{'authorId': '14196850', 'name': 'Stacey Wu'}, {'authorId': '1399202880', 'name': 'S.

We informed our authors that we would provide the introductory framework to neurobiology so as to give them the flexibility to focus with more specificity on their respective topic areas. The dizzying pace of development and advancing literature in a number of converging fields makes the study of neurobiology and clinical work an exciting and daunting task. We recognize that literature from the broad fields of attachment theory, infant research, trauma theory, cognitive neuroscience, relational theory, relational analytic trauma theory, and nonlinear dynamic systems theory (to name a few) are converging in a synergistic and interesting manner. These theories underscore that human beings are resilient and that change is possible across the life cycle, even if individuals have experienced unfortunate traumatic beginnings. We use the term neurobiology to discuss current research findings on brain structure and function(s). We agree with Louis Cozolino (2006) when he suggested that there is no such thing as a “single brain” and that an individual’s brain and mind functions, which effect a multitude of intrapsychic and interpersonal factors, are fundamentally shaped in interaction with other people. There are many implications to this statement—this article illuminates some of these implications, especially as they inform clinical work based on the understanding that the treatment relationship is a central component of change in brain functioning that leads to therapeutic change with a diverse range of clients. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, we outline some “brain basics” that give the reader foundational knowledge of neurobiology. Second, we briefly discuss the importance of “relationship” as the foundation for change in brain function.","[{'authorId': '82003814', 'name': 'Dennis Miehls'}, {'authorId': '52509524', 'name': 'J.

Children treated the robots as interlocutors. They supplied information to the robots and retained what the robots told them.

Consistent with studies of children's early sensitivity to an interlocutor's non-verbal signals, children were especially attentive and receptive to whichever robot displayed the greater non-verbal contingency. Such selective information seeking is consistent with recent findings showing that although young children learn from others, they are selective with respect to the informants that they question or endorse.","[{'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

Experiment 1 compared a colorful and a gray room, whereas in experiments 2 and 3 red and blue rooms were compared. The results indicate that the color of an interior space will have effects on many different levels. The perception of the room itself was affected, and the colors also had an impact on the emotions and physiology of those who stayed in the rooms. Strong, especially red, colors and patterns put the brain into a more excited state, sometimes to such an extent as to cause a paradoxical slowing of the heart rate. Introvert persons, as well as those already in a negative mood, became more affected than others, which caused severe changes in their performance. The series of experiments described here were among the first to be carried out in full-scale rooms painted or otherwise decorated in various colors. One practical implication is that a moderate use of good color design will serve to improve the overall mood and well-being of people.

Our aim in this paper was to manipulate the Regulatory Focus Theory to assess its impact on the induction of regulatory focus related emotions in children in a pretend play scenario with a social robot. The Regulatory Focus Theory suggests that people follow one of two paradigms while attempting to achieve a goal; by seeking gains (promotion focus - associated with feelings of happiness) or by avoiding losses (prevention focus - associated with feelings of fear). We conducted a study with 69 school children in two different conditions (promotion vs. prevention). We succeeded in inducing happiness emotions in the promotion condition and found a resulting positive effect of the induction on children’s social engagement with the robot.

Despite mounting evidence that the magnitude of these associations is comparable to that of many leading health determinants (that receive significant public health resources), government agencies, health care providers and associations, and public or private health care funders have been slow to recognize human social relationships as either a health determinant or health risk marker in a manner that is comparable to that of other public health priorities.

Results showed that objectification does not affect the perception of competence, but increases the estimated pay. For high-status jobs, the effect of objectification interacts with gender, increasing women’s fit for a masculine job and decreasing men’s fit for a feminine occupation. Finally, objectification increases the suitability for low-status jobs, and this is particularly true for women holding service-oriented professions.

Because rumination is a risk factor for many forms of psychopathology, especially depression, such knowledge could prove important for preventing negative mental health outcomes in youth. This study examined developmental origins of rumination in a longitudinal sample (N=337; 51% girls) studied in preschool (ages 3½ and 4½ years) and early adolescence (ages 13 and 15 years). Results indicated that family context and child temperament, assessed during the preschool period, were risk factors for a ruminative style in adolescence. Specifically, early family contexts characterised by over-controlling parenting and a family style of negative-submissive expressivity predicted higher levels of later rumination. These associations were moderated by children's temperamental characteristics of negative affect and effortful control. Further, the interaction of these temperament factors exerted an additional influence on later rumination. Implications for prevention and intervention efforts are discussed.","[{'authorId': '5625647', 'name': 'L. Hilt'}, {'authorId': '38799349', 'name': 'Jeffrey M.

Much of this happens in an everyday way, with reminiscing arising naturally out of one's experiences, thoughts, and conversations. In this article we describe work around Pensieve, a tool to support everyday, spontaneous, individual reminiscing through memory triggers—e-mailed reminders that contain snippets from content one has previously created in social media or generic questions that encourage people to reflect on their past. Through a combination of interviews, questionnaires, design activities, and a long-term deployment of Pensieve, we demonstrate the potential value of social media content such as Facebook wall posts and status updates for supporting reminiscence, the utility of systems that support spontaneous reminiscing and writing about the past, the importance of reminders to both reminiscing and lifelogging systems, and insights into people's current practices in reminiscing in social media. Through this work, we generate a number of design goals, issues to consider, and directions for future work around designing systems to support reminiscence and other types of reflection on personal experience.","[{'authorId': '3314625', 'name': 'D.

We proposed and tested the hypothesis that whether prevention-focused states boost creativity depends on regulatory closure (whether a goal is fulfilled or not). We predicted that prevention-focused states that activate the individual (unfulfilled prevention goals, fear) would lead to similar levels of creativity as promotion-focused states but that prevention-focused states that deactivate (closed prevention goals, relief) would lead to lower levels of creativity. Moreover, we predicted that this effect would be mediated by feelings of activation. Predictions were tested in 3 studies on creative insights and 1 on original ideation.

Methods: Encounter records were retrospectively reviewed for all patients presenting to our pediatric emergency department, a standalone pediatric department with 20,000 patient visits per year, located in an urban, public teaching hospital, between March and June 2004. Data collected included patient demographics, provider type, procedures performed, and pharmacological pain management methods documented used. For intravenous catheter placement, the time lag between order and placement was noted. Results: There were 1727 procedures performed in 1210 patients (18% of the total 6545 patients seen). Few to no patients undergoing venipuncture, intravenous catheter placement, fingersticks, intramuscular or subcutaneous injections, urethral catheterization, or nasogastric tube placement received pain management. The median time between order and placement of intravenous catheters was 30 minutes. Nearly all patients undergoing fracture reductions received procedural sedation with ketamine, and most of the lacerations repaired with sutures and nail avulsions received injected local anesthetic. Pain management of abscess incision and drainage and lumbar punctures was more variable. For lumbar punctures, of the patients aged 4 months or younger with a procedure note written, only 29% (7/24) had pain management documented versus 85% (22/26) of those aged 1 year or older (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Several minor painful procedures are commonly performed in the emergency department without pharmacological pain management. There remains a gap between what we know to be effective, easily implemented pain management strategies, and what is actually practiced. We must work to close this gap.","[{'authorId': '145843016', 'name': 'Steven MacLean'}, {'authorId': '2090100401', 'name': 'Jonas Obispo'}, {'authorId': '7210055', 'name': 'K. D.

However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far.

A research was carried out to examine and compare students’ and employers’ perceptions regarding the importance of soft skills in different European countries. Results show that 86% of respondents indicate an increased emphasis on soft skills over the last 5–10 years and that companies consider soft skills more important than students/graduates. Furthermore, major differences have also been identified in the ranking of the 20 soft skills listed in this paper, indicating different levels of priorities. This paper suggests that companies and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to work together not only to increase students’ awareness of the importance of soft skills but also to guide them in taking individual responsibility to acquire and develop these essential skills in order to continuously adapt to the changing labour market and improve their employability.","[{'authorId': '32731900', 'name': 'Chiara Succi'}, {'authorId': '118872375', 'name': 'Magali Canovi'}]",278.0,,35.0,Soft skills to enhance graduate employability: comparing students and employers’ perceptions,2020.0
573e6814c16178186daf537b1e1a5d3c840eef2f,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.","[{'authorId': '50474058', 'name': 'Ming-Hui Huang'}, {'authorId': '1813939', 'name': 'R.

Using experience-sampling methodology, we tested group differences in 2 types of emotion beliefs (emotion control values and emotion malleability beliefs) and whether emotion beliefs predicted trait and daily use of cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression. People with SAD endorsed higher emotion control values and lower emotion malleability beliefs than did healthy controls. Across groups, emotion control values were positively associated with suppression (but unrelated to reappraisal), and emotion malleability beliefs were negatively associated with suppression and positively associated with reappraisal. We also addressed 2 exploratory questions related to measurement. First, we examined whether trait and state measures of emotion regulation strategies were related to emotion control values in different ways and found similar associations across measures. Second, we examined whether explicit and implicit measures of emotion control values were related to daily emotion regulation strategy use in different ways-and found that an implicit measure was unrelated to strategy use. Results are discussed in the context of growing research on metaemotions and the measurement of complex features of emotion regulation.

Emotion regulation (ER) is an internal process through which a person maintains a comfortable state of arousal by modulating one or more aspects of emotion. The neural correlates underlying ER suggest an interplay between cognitive control areas and areas involved in emotional reactivity. Although some studies have suggested that music may be a useful tool in ER, few studies have examined the links between music perception/production and the neural mechanisms that underlie ER and resulting implications for clinical music therapy treatment. Objectives of this systematic review were to explore and synthesize what is known about how music and music experiences impact neural structures implicated in ER, and to consider clinical implications of these findings for structuring music stimuli to facilitate ER.


METHODS
A comprehensive electronic database search resulted in 50 studies that met predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pertinent data related to the objective were extracted and study outcomes were analyzed and compared for trends and common findings.


RESULTS
Results indicated there are certain music characteristics and experiences that produce desired and undesired neural activation patterns implicated in ER. Desired activation patterns occurred when listening to preferred and familiar music, when singing, and (in musicians) when improvising; undesired activation patterns arose when introducing complexity, dissonance, and unexpected musical events. Furthermore, the connection between music-influenced changes in attention and its link to ER was explored.


CONCLUSIONS
Implications for music therapy practice are discussed and preliminary guidelines for how to use music to facilitate ER are shared.","[{'authorId': '46543855', 'name': 'K. S.

A pilot study in a rural disadvantaged area in England sought to evaluate the effectiveness of training practitioners who work with children and young people in schools, early years settings and youth centres to apply emotion coaching strategies in professional contexts, particularly during emotionally intensive and behavioural incidents. The study rested on the premise that supportive adults can individually and collectively empower children and young people to build a repertoire of internal and external socio-emotional regulatory skills that promote prosocial behavior. A mixed method approach was adopted (n=127). The findings suggest the efficacy of adopting emotion coaching strategies to support behavioural management approaches and policies within settings across the age range. Data from school contexts are largely recorded here. The research is the first pilot in the UK that builds on and complements similar work being undertaken in the USA and Australia.","[{'authorId': '47252154', 'name': 'J.

A survey of 337 college students reveals that greater social activity is a positive predictor of addiction to Snapchat. Another significant finding is a positive relationship between social media addiction and the fear of missing out, which explained the most variance in addiction scores for Snapchat (16%). An inductive analysis of open-ended responses indicated strong similarities between those who claimed that they were addicted to these social media apps and those said that they were not addicted. Both groups described largely similar usage patterns and media dependency, yet several users did not self-identify as addicted to social media.

Converging findings from a variety of disciplines are leading to the emergence of a fundamentally new view of the human mind, and with it a new framework for the behavioral and social sciences. First, with the advent of the cognitive revolution, human nature can finally be defined precisely as the set of universal, species-typical information-processing programs that operate beneath the surface of expressed cultural variability. Second, this collection of cognitive programs evolved in the Pleistocene to solve the adaptive problems regularly faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors--problems such as mate selection, language acquisition, cooperation, and sexual infidelity. Consequently, the traditional view of the mind as a general-purpose computer, tabula rasa, or passive recipient of culture is being replaced by the view that the mind resembles an intricate network of functionally specialized computers, each of which imposes contentful structure on human mental organization and culture. The Adapted Mind explores this new approach--evolutionary psychology--and its implications for a new view of culture.","[{'authorId': '4441856', 'name': 'J.

587b7fb571d8088df449bcac8446a6304a2926a5,"Emotion has a substantial influence on the cognitive processes in humans, including perception, attention, learning, memory, reasoning, and problem solving. Emotion has a particularly strong influence on attention, especially modulating the selectivity of attention as well as motivating action and behavior. This attentional and executive control is intimately linked to learning processes, as intrinsically limited attentional capacities are better focused on relevant information. Emotion also facilitates encoding and helps retrieval of information efficiently. However, the effects of emotion on learning and memory are not always univalent, as studies have reported that emotion either enhances or impairs learning and long-term memory (LTM) retention, depending on a range of factors. Recent neuroimaging findings have indicated that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex cooperate with the medial temporal lobe in an integrated manner that affords (i) the amygdala modulating memory consolidation; (ii) the prefrontal cortex mediating memory encoding and formation; and (iii) the hippocampus for successful learning and LTM retention. We also review the nested hierarchies of circular emotional control and cognitive regulation (bottom-up and top-down influences) within the brain to achieve optimal integration of emotional and cognitive processing. This review highlights a basic evolutionary approach to emotion to understand the effects of emotion on learning and memory and the functional roles played by various brain regions and their mutual interactions in relation to emotional processing. We also summarize the current state of knowledge on the impact of emotion on memory and map implications for educational settings. In addition to elucidating the memory-enhancing effects of emotion, neuroimaging findings extend our understanding of emotional influences on learning and memory processes; this knowledge may be useful for the design of effective educational curricula to provide a conducive learning environment for both traditional “live” learning in classrooms and “virtual” learning through online-based educational technologies.","[{'authorId': '9259162', 'name': 'C.

In Study 2 (N = 339), we experimentally manipulated individuals’ lay theories about honesty and effort and found that an individual’s lay theory that honesty is effortful increased subsequent dishonesty. In Study 3, we manipulated (Study 3a; N = 294) and measured (Study 3b; N = 153) lay theories, and then manipulated the strength of situational force that encourages dishonesty, and found that an individual’s lay theory influences subsequent dishonesty only in a weak situation, where individuals have more agency to interpret the situation.

The method's applicability to different research topics is demonstrated through the composite narratives of nursing students learning nursing practice in an accelerated and condensed program, obese female adolescents attempting weight control, chronically ill male parolees, and midlife women experiencing distress during menopause. Within current research, these four phenomena have been predominantly described and understood through quantified articulations that give the reader a structural understanding of the phenomena, but the more embodied or “contextual” human qualities of the phenomena are often not visible. The “what is it like” or the “unsaid” aspects of such human phenomena are not clear to the reader when proxies are used to “account for” a variety of situated conditions. This novel method is employed to re-present narrative data and findings from research through first person accounts that blend the voices of the participants with those of the researcher, emphasizing the connectedness, the “we” among all participants, researchers, and listeners. These re-presentations allow readers to develop more embodied understandings of both the texture and structure of each of the phenomena and illustrate the use of the composite account as a way for researchers to better understand and convey the wholeness of the experience of any phenomenon under inquiry.","[{'authorId': '39993493', 'name': 'M.

Yet, for an appropriate use of these new tools, it is necessary to understand how perception of and interaction with artificial agents differ from natural agents, both in normally developed adults and in patients with disorders of social cognition. Here we investigated the neural bases of social interactions with a human or with a humanoid robot using fMRI. During interaction, participants were playing a computerized version of the game chifumi (stone-paper-scissors), while believing they were interacting `live' either with a fellow human (Intentional agent, Int), a humanoid robot endowed with an artificial intelligence (Artificial agent, Art), or a random number generator running on a laptop (Rnd). The belief was built both with an extensive briefing before the actual experiment, including a live interaction with the human and humanoid robot opponents, and with videos of the opponent, presented as live but actually recorded prior to the experiment, that preceded and followed each series of 5 games played against one opponent in a block. Results indicate that the brain network found when interacting with an active opponent (Art & Int vs Rnd) was more activated when interacting with the human than with the robot agent, implying that interacting with a human is more engaging than interacting with an artificial agent. Areas involved in social interactions in the posterior temporal sulcus were activated when controls, but not high-functioning autistic patients patients, interacted with a fellow human.","[{'authorId': '1728769', 'name': 'T.

5912c343e1aa9320a6c9eba11877fc33f82688f7,"Mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) has appeared as a prospective solution for large-scale data collection, leveraging built-in sensors and social applications in mobile devices that enables a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) services. However, the human involvement in MCS results in a high possibility for unintentionally contributing corrupted and falsified data or intentionally spreading disinformation for malevolent purposes, consequently undermining IoT services. Therefore, recruiting trustworthy contributors plays a crucial role in collecting high-quality data and providing a better quality of services while minimizing the vulnerabilities and risks to MCS systems. In this paper, a novel trust model called experience–reputation (E-R) is proposed for evaluating trust relationships between any two mobile device users in an MCS platform. To enable the E-R model, virtual interactions among the users are manipulated by considering an assessment of the quality of contributed data from such users. Based on these interactions, two indicators of trust called experience and reputation are calculated accordingly. By incorporating the experience and reputation trust indicators (TIs), trust relationships between the users are established, evaluated, and maintained. Based on these trust relationships, a novel trust-based recruitment scheme is carried out for selecting the most trustworthy MCS users to contribute to data sensing tasks. In order to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed trust-based mechanism as well as the E-R trust model, we deploy several recruitment schemes in an MCS testbed, which consists of both normal and malicious users. The results highlight the strength of the trust-based scheme as it delivers a better quality for MCS services while being able to detect malicious users. We believe that the trust-based user recruitment offers an effective capability for selecting trustworthy users for various MCS systems and, importantly, the proposed mechanism is practical to deploy in the real world.","[{'authorId': '10421619', 'name': 'N.

I begin by describing the Schmid-Leiman bifactor procedure (Schmid & Leiman, 1957) and highlight its relations with correlated-factors and second-order exploratory factor models. After describing limitations of the Schmid-Leiman, 2 newer methods of exploratory bifactor modeling are considered, namely, analytic bifactor (Jennrich & Bentler, 2011) and target bifactor rotations (Reise, Moore, & Maydeu-Olivares, 2011). Then I discuss limited- and full-information estimation approaches to confirmatory bifactor models that have emerged from the item response theory and factor analysis traditions, respectively. Comparison of the confirmatory bifactor model to alternative nested confirmatory models and establishing parameter invariance for the general factor also are discussed. Finally, important applications of bifactor models are reviewed. These applications demonstrate that bifactor modeling potentially provides a solid foundation for conceptualizing psychological constructs, constructing measures, and evaluating a measure's psychometric properties. However, some applications of the bifactor model may be limited due to its restrictive assumptions.","[{'authorId': '6427086', 'name': 'S.

Participants tried to resist using stereotypes while describing or talking to a stimulus person. Participants whose habitual motivation to suppress stereotypes was low exhibited impaired Stroop and anagram performance after the suppression task, presumably because of self-regulatory depletion (i.e., a reduction of self-regulatory strength following prior use). Two weeks of self-regulation exercises (such as using one’s nondominant hand or refraining from cursing) eliminated this effect. These findings indicate that self-regulatory exercise can improve resistance to self-regulatory depletion and, consequently, people can suppress stereotypes without suffering subsequent decrements in task performance.","[{'authorId': '3556293', 'name': 'M.

59cae244d15e6dc69f0dfed3532717db9ab953e0,"Speech recognition and speech-based dialogue are means for realizing communication between humans and robots. In case of conventional system setup a headset or a directional microphone is used to collect speech with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the user must wear a microphone or has to approach the system closely for interaction. Therefore it's preferable to develop a hands-free speech recognition system which enables the user to speak to the system from a distant point. To collect speech from distant speakers a microphone array is usually employed. However, the SNR will degrade in a real environment because of the presence of various kinds of background noise besides the user's utterance. This will most often decrease speech recognition performance and no reliable speech dialogue would be possible. Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is a method to detect the user utterance part in the input signal. If VAD fails, all following processing steps including speech recognition and dialogue will not work. Conventional VAD based on amplitude level and zero cross count is difficult to apply to hands-free speech recognition, because speech detection will most often fail due to low SNR. 
 
This paper proposes a VAD method based on the acoustic model (AM) for background noise and the speech recognition algorithm applied to hands-free speech recognition. There will always be non-speech segments at the beginning and end of each user utterance. The proposed VAD approach compares the likelihood of phoneme and silence segments in the top recognition hypotheses during decoding. We implemented the proposed method for the open-source speech recognition engine Julius. Experimental results for various SNRs conditions show that the proposed method attains a higher VAD accuracy and higher recognition rate than conventional VAD.","[{'authorId': '2068983025', 'name': 'Hiroyuki Sakai'}, {'authorId': '1784264', 'name': 'T.

This study examined whether they are capable of showing evasive action (ie, adjusting crossing speed) to avoid injury when crossing streets. Methods The study used a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) system interfaced with a three-dimensional movement measurement system so that the actual crossing behaviour of 7–10-year-old children under different traffic conditions could be precisely measured. Relating outcomes to that which would have been obtained based on using the approach of estimating walking speed and assuming a constant speed provided insights into the realised benefits of the current movement monitoring VR system. Results Controlling for age and sex, children showed evasive action, crossing more quickly as traffic conditions became more risky. Using an average and assuming a constant walking speed underestimated actual walking speed, failing to capture evasive action and leading to overestimation of children being hit compared with the actual incidence of hits. Conclusions VR technology is a valuable tool for assessing child pedestrian behaviour. However, systems need to allow the child to cross the street so their level of pedestrian skill is appropriately measured. The current findings provide the first evidence that children are capable of implementing evasive action in reaction to risky traffic conditions.","[{'authorId': '4511319', 'name': 'B.

Self-regulation abilities allow for engagement in learning activities and provide the foundation for adjustment to school. A focus on readiness as self-regulation does not supplant interest in the development of acquired ability, such as early knowledge of letters and numbers; it sets the stage for it.

In doing so, we illustrate the idea that research on self-regulation powerfully highlights ways in which gaps in school readiness and later achievement are linked to poverty and social and economic inequality and points the way to effective approaches to counteract these conditions.","[{'authorId': '3381695', 'name': 'C.

Inclusion criteria were samples diagnosed with SMI and validated measure tools. Results Ten studies met inclusion criteria. Considerable heterogeneity was found across studies in relation to construct measurement, sample size, and gender distribution.

Although the common belief is that empathy is a “psychological” topic, sociologists have made important contributions to this conversation. The goal of this article is to provide a theoretical effort in advancing the sociology of empathy. In the first part of the paper, I review classical and contemporary statements on empathy. I identify Charles H. Cooley as an important precursor of the sociology of empathy, and discuss how contemporary interactionists have further developed this notion. Based on these previous insights, I next propose a preliminary framework for the study of the social construction of empathy. This framework is presented in two steps. First, I introduce a vocabulary based on interpretivist concepts: empathy frames, empathy rules, and empathy performances. Next, I coin the idea of empathy paths. I theorize three ideal-typical empathy paths: self-transcendent, therapeutic, and instrumental. Throughout this presentation, I use empirical cases to illustrate the applicability of this framework. In the conclusion, I show how sociologists can inform public understandings of the meaning of empathy.","[{'authorId': '1423368349', 'name': 'Natalia Ruiz-Junco'}]",30.0,,32.0,Advancing the Sociology of Empathy: A Proposal,2017.0

The challenge of maintaining order intensifies with teachers' concerns about the growing inclusion of students with emotional and behavioral problems in general education classrooms and the general levels of diversity common in America's schools. Little is known about the demography (i.e., who, what, where, when, how) of behavior requiring attention from administrators and other professionals in elementary schools. The need for comprehensive and continuous monitoring of what goes on in schools within the context of increasing appropriate behavior and reducing inappropriate behavior is clear. In this research, we investigated the extent of variation in problem behavior at the school and classroom level. We evaluated office referrals, reasons for removing students from the classroom for discipline, and consistency of reasons for office referrals in schools using different recording systems. Rates of referral differed greatly among teachers within schools and a small group of students accounted for most of the documented behavior problems. The results have implications for efforts to improve academic and behavior instruction in elementary classrooms, which we discuss.","[{'authorId': '8025083', 'name': 'K.

The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine if emotion regulation warrants investigation as a factor influencing social outcomes in children with specific language impairment (SLI). Emotion regulation was evaluated in children with SLI and their typically developing peers.


METHOD
Teachers were asked to rate the emotion regulation behaviors of 41 children with SLI and 41 typical peers using the ""Emotion Regulation Checklist"" (ERC, Shields & Cicchetti, 1997; 1998). Children were sampled from two age levels (6-9 years and 10-13 years). At each age level, equal numbers of boys and girls were sampled.


RESULTS
As a group, children with SLI received significantly lower ratings than typical children. In addition, girls produced higher scores than boys. None of the other interactions was significant. Scores on the two subscales of the ERC, labeled as lability/negativity and emotion regulation, were then examined to further delineate performance. Boys with SLI had notably lower ratings than all the other groups on the emotion regulation subscale.


CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
Emotion regulation warrants further research to determine if it is associated with specific social outcomes in children with SLI.","[{'authorId': '2649849', 'name': 'M.

However, the existing methods cannot rely on the common smart bracelets or watches for emotion monitoring in daily life. To address this issue, our study proposes a method for emotional recognition using heart rate data from a wearable smart bracelet. A ‘neutral + target’ pair emotion stimulation experimental paradigm was presented, and a dataset of heart rate from 25 subjects was established, where neutral plus target emotion (neutral, happy, and sad) stimulation video pairs from China’s standard Emotional Video Stimuli materials (CEVS) were applied to the recruited subjects. Normalized features from the data of target emotions normalized by the baseline data of neutral mood were adopted. Emotion recognition experiment results approved the effectiveness of ‘neutral + target’ video pair simulation experimental paradigm, the baseline setting using neutral mood data, and the normalized features, as well as the classifiers of Adaboost and GBDT on this dataset. This method will promote the development of wearable consumer electronic devices for monitoring human emotional moods.","[{'authorId': '144308894', 'name': 'Lin Shu'}, {'authorId': '2107621785', 'name': 'Y.

The second demonstrates that variations in the parameters of assistance techniques such as predictive mouse acceleration can have a significant impact on users' sense of agency.

Nonetheless, emotional management training may improve patients’ emotion recognition, emotional expression, and negative symptoms. Developing and applying a short but effective program that reflects the current medical environment, in which hospital stays are ever-diminishing, is warranted.

After the completion of a twice-a-week, eight-session, four-week long EMP-S, participants showed improvements in emotion recognition, emotional expression, and negative symptoms. Our results suggest the applicability and potential effectiveness of the EMP-S, which takes the length of psychiatric hospital stay and the inpatient environment into consideration.

This article presents a review of current research within the field of Tactile Human–Robot Interactions (Tactile HRI) , where physical contact from a human is detected by a robot during the execution or development of robot behaviors. Approaches are presented from two viewpoints: the types of physical interactions that occur between the human and robot, and the types of sensors used to detect these interactions. We contribute a structure for the categorization of Tactile HRI research within each viewpoint. Tactile sensing techniques are grouped into three categories, according to what covers the sensors: (i) a hard shell, (ii) a flexible substrate or (iii) no covering. Three categories of physical HRI likewise are identified, consisting of contact that (i) interferes with robot behavior execution, (ii) contributes to behavior execution and (iii) contributes to behavior development.

These settings are able to present positive adult and peer examples, various and daily chances to have academic and social achievement, and permanent peer and adult relations promoted by social exchanges (Sugai et al., 2000).Discipline problems such as widespread alcohol, drug abuse, and bullying shown in schools in the late 1990s, focused everyone's attention on these problem behaviors (Sugai & Horner, 2002). Such problem behaviors increasing steadily in schools pushed people and policy makers to search for new solutions to prevent these problem behaviors in schools. As Skiba (2000) said, traditional methods such as zero tolerance, strict rules and punishment, and others were of no use. There was also no evidence-based research proving the positive effect of these methods on students. As Sugai and Horner noted, such systems not using positive behavior supports caused increases in the problem behaviors that needed to be reduced. In a similar way, Costenbader and Markson (1998) stated that exclusion and punishment of problem behaviors are not effective in the long term. Some types of punishment can even be rewarding and cause problem behaviors to continue. ""Traditional school discipline practices"" (TSDP) (Scheuermann & Hall, 2011, pp. 12-13) and PBS (Positive Behavior Support) are compared in Table 1.Sprague and Horner (2006) indicated the main points of a schoolwide system for positive behavior support are: (a) problem behavior in schools is not only an important social challenge but also an obstacle to effective learning; (b) it has not been proven that conventional ""get tough"" approaches are effective; (c) a positive social culture needs to be established first through describing, teaching, and rewarding appropriate behaviors as the basis for all behavior support; (d) further behavior support processes beased on principles of behavior analysis are essential for students who need greater behavior support; (e) school staff are able not only to gather and utilize quality enhancement data systems, but also appreciate the value of those systems in terms of enhancing schools (pp. 413-427).PBS is neither a recent intervention package nor a recent behavior theory; it is rather a practice of a systems approach based on behavior to improve the capacity of schools, families, and communities with the aim of building effective settings that enhance the harmony or connection among practices validated by research and the settings where teaching and learning happen. It is focused on building and maintaining school settings that enhance behavioral outcomes for all children and youth through decreasing the effectiveness, efficiency, and relevance of problem behavior and increasing the functionality of desired behavior (Sugai et al., 2000).SWPBIS FrameworkSWPBIS is defined by the processes arranged around three major themes: Prevention, Multi-Tiered Support, and Data-based Decision Making. Contributing to the prevention of problem behavior are these principles: (a) describing and teaching basic behavioral expectations; (b) approving and awarding appropriate behavior (e.g., obeying the rules of the school, secure and considerate peer relations, and academic work/involvement); and (c) building a regular continuation of outcomes for problem behavior. Attention is focused on building a positive social atmosphere where expectations of behavior for students are greatly foreseeable, directly taught, constantly approved, and actively observed (Sprague & Horner, 2006).Homer, Todd, Lewis-Palmer, Irvin, Sugai, and Boland (2004) explained the Seven Key Features of Schoolwide Positive Behavior Support as: (a) describe 3-5 expectations for appropriate behavior schoolwide; (b) actively have all students leam the schoolwide expectations of behavior; (c) observe and approve of students when they engage in expectations of behavior; (d) correct problem behaviors by using a continuation of behavioral outcomes regularly administrated; (e) collect and use data about student behavior in order to assess and direct decision-making; (f) get leadership of schoolwide applications from a director who 1. …","[{'authorId': '2091533283', 'name': 'Kürşat Öğülmüş'}, {'authorId': '51965711', 'name': 'Sezgin Vuran'}]",20.0,,0.0,"Schoolwide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support Practices: Review of Studies in the ""Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions"".",2016.0

Methodologically, it is based on the qualitative educational approach. The sample was intentional and selected through criterion sampling. We used methods, techniques and instruments that showed the level of development of creativity in preschool, as seen in the indicators: fluency, originality and motivation, and the way of conducting the teaching-learning process by teachers. The epistemological foundations and the scientific reflections contrasted with the practical results allowed to contribute as essential conclusion, a didactic strategy that contributed to the development of the creative capacity in the children of the Preschool Education in Puno (Peru).","[{'authorId': '108040501', 'name': 'Nancy Medina Sánchez'}, {'authorId': '108024862', 'name': 'M.

Cross-lagged panel models indicated bidirectional relations between EF and math over preschool, which became directional in kindergarten with only EF predicting math. Moreover, there was a bidirectional relation between math and literacy that emerged in kindergarten. Similarly, LGCM revealed correlated growth between EF and math as well as math and literacy, but not EF and literacy. Exploring the patterns of relations across the waves of the panel model in conjunction with the patterns of relations between intercepts and slopes in the LGCMs led to a more nuanced understanding of the relations between EF and academic skills across preschool and kindergarten.

This study examined the 7-year developmental and academic outcome of speech/language-impaired and control children selected from a community sample.


METHOD
Speech/language and psychiatric measures were administered to the children at ages 5 and 12.5 years. Using children's age 5 speech/language test results, a cluster analysis was performed to ascertain whether specific linguistic subgroups would emerge. The long-term consistency of these subgroups was explored. The association between time 1 speech/language clusters and linguistic, cognitive and academic measures at time 2 were examined.


RESULTS
Four groups were identified in the cluster analysis: high overall, poor articulation, poor comprehension, and low overall. Children with pervasive language problems continued to perform poorly on linguistic, cognitive, and academic measures, while those with comprehension problems fared slightly better but still had more difficulties than those with normal language. The poor articulation cluster had few articulation errors at follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
Empirically supported speech/language classifications identified as early as age 5 continued to be relevant into late childhood. Pervasive speech/language impairment in early childhood was associated with increased risk of poor linguistic and academic outcome at follow-up, while isolated articulatory problems improved over time. These findings reveal the urgent need for early intervention among children with pervasive speech/language impairment.","[{'authorId': '4244466', 'name': 'J.

5ebcfb9a9a48de871f51cf0ab1b583deadb366cf,"Object recognition through the use of input from multiple sensors is an important aspect of an autonomous manipula tion system. In tactile object recognition, it is necessary to determine the location and orientation of object edges and surfaces. We propose a controller that utilizes a tactile sensor in the feedback loop of a manipulator to track edges in real time. In our control system, the data from the tactile sensor is processed in two stages to determine the location of edges. The first stage involves adaptive thresholding of tactile images. This thresholded image is used to detect edges. In the second stage, we use a combination of weighted least squares and the Modified Adaptive Hough Transform to choose the edge to be tracked from the multiple edges present in the tactile image. The parameters of these edges are then used to generate a set-point signal to drive the manipulator. In our implementation, we use a Hybrid controller that uses both position and force set points. The edge tracker, pre sented in this article, has been implemented on the CMU DD Arm II system. While the signal processing and the control computation require 30 ms, the tactile images are transferred from the sensor to the computer every 240 ms. Consequently, the acquisition of tactile images limits the sampling rate to 4.2 Hz. In this article, we describe both the theory and exper imental implementation of tactile edge detection and an edge tracking controller.","[{'authorId': '20922434', 'name': 'A.

With divorce increasingly becoming a normal life event, societal changes are now challenging this idea as regards to current cohorts. We hypothesize that the relative strong feelings of loneliness among divorcees, compared with married people, has diminished over time. Using 1992, 2002, and 2012 data sets of 54–65-year-old people, we examine the impact of divorce on loneliness over 20 years. We compare those who are divorced or remarried to people married for the first time, and differentiate the supportiveness of the partnership. The results show that for both emotional and social loneliness, divorcees were lonelier than respondents in their first marriage; remarried divorces were socially lonelier than respondents in their first marriage. Respondents with a supportive partnership were less emotionally and socially lonely than respondents without a partnership or with a less supportive partnership. The main finding is that, compared with 1992, the divorcees are less socially lonely in 2002, with a smaller and non-significant further decrease in loneliness in 2012. This suggests that the social position of divorcees has been improved over the past two decades.","[{'authorId': '115482680', 'name': 'T. V. van Tilburg'}, {'authorId': '4617063', 'name': 'M.

The SAAS demonstrated a unifactorial structure with high test-retest reliability and internal consistency. The SAAS was positively associated with measures of social anxiety. The SAAS was also related to greater disparity between perceived, actual, and ideal physical attributes, beliefs that one's appearance is inherently flawed and socially unacceptable and that being unattractive is socially deleterious, feelings of unattractiveness, emphasis on appearance and its maintenance, and a preoccupation with being overweight. It was a unique predictor of social anxiety above and beyond negative body image indicators.

Although stress and drug cue exposure each increase drug craving and contribute to relapse in cocaine dependence, no previous research has directly examined the neural correlates of stress-induced and drug cue-induced craving in cocaine-dependent women and men relative to comparison subjects.


METHOD
Functional MRI was used to assess responses to individualized scripts for stress, drug/alcohol cue and neutral-relaxing-imagery conditions in 30 abstinent cocaine-dependent individuals (16 women, 14 men) and 36 healthy recreational-drinking comparison subjects (18 women, 18 men).


RESULTS
Significant three-way interactions between diagnostic group, sex, and script condition were observed in multiple brain regions including the striatum, insula, and anterior and posterior cingulate. Within women, group-by-condition interactions were observed involving these regions and were attributable to relatively increased regional activations in cocaine-dependent women during the stress and, to a lesser extent, neutral-relaxing conditions. Within men, group main effects were observed involving these same regions, with cocaine-dependent men demonstrating relatively increased activation across conditions, with the main contributions from the drug and neutral-relaxing conditions. In men and women, subjective drug-induced craving measures correlated positively with corticostriatal-limbic activations.


CONCLUSIONS
In cocaine dependence, corticostriatal-limbic hyperactivity appears to be linked to stress cues in women, drug cues in men, and neutral-relaxing conditions in both. These findings suggest that sex should be taken into account in the selection of therapies in the treatment of addiction, particularly those targeting stress reduction.","[{'authorId': '3113215', 'name': 'M.

Carrow-Woodfolk, 1999) was administered to provide a measure of language ability. A regression analysis including all participants indicated that the emotion regulation scores and the CASL scores were significant predictors of the reticence scores, accounting for 43% of the variance. Group-specific analyses were then conducted to determine whether the 2 predictor scales differentially predicted reticence based on language and age groups. None of the tests exceeded the.05 level, indicating that there was no significant difference in predictive power on the 2 factors in question.","[{'authorId': '2649849', 'name': 'M.

However, reviews of trends in social skills treatment for children with ASDs have been scant, despite a robust and growing empirical literature on the topic. In this selective review of 79 treatment studies, the authors note that the research has been particularly marked by fragmented development, using a range of intervention approaches and definitions of the construct. Modeling and reinforcement treatments have been the most popular model from the outset, with most studies conducted in school settings by teachers or psychologists. Investigators have been particularly attentive to issues of generalization and follow-up. However, large-scale group studies and comparisons of different training strategies are almost nonexistent. These trends and their implications for future research aimed at filling gaps in the existing literature are discussed.","[{'authorId': '8271755', 'name': 'J.

In general, based on the notion that a prevention-focused orientation of self-regulation is associated with a need for security and a vigilant tendency to avoid losses and other types of negative events we advocate that a prevention-focused orientation, both as a disposition as well as a situationally induced state, lowers generalized trust, thus hindering cooperation within social interactions that entail threats. Specifically, we found that the more individuals’ habitual self-regulatory orientation is dominated by a prevention focus, the less likely they are to score high on a self-report measure of generalized trust (Study 1), and to express trust in a trust game paradigm as manifested in lower sums of transferred money (Studies 2 and 3). Similar findings were found when prevention focus was situationally manipulated (Study 4). Finally, one possible factor underlying the impact of prevention-focused self-regulation on generalized trust was demonstrated as individuals with a special sensitivity to negative information were significantly affected by a subtle prevention focus manipulation (versus control condition) in that they reacted with reduced trust in the trust game (Study 5). In sum, the current findings document the crucial relevance of self-regulatory orientations as conceptualized in regulatory focus theory regarding generalized trust and responses to threats within a social interaction. The theoretical and applied implications of the findings are discussed.","[{'authorId': '39281733', 'name': 'J.

613eb8f9a416d05b916f4bf9d9f48b80e6e4fd1f,"Significance Claims about how reported emotional experiences are geometrically organized within a semantic space have shaped the study of emotion. Using statistical methods to analyze reports of emotional states elicited by 2,185 emotionally evocative short videos with richly varying situational content, we uncovered 27 varieties of reported emotional experience. Reported experience is better captured by categories such as “amusement” than by ratings of widely measured affective dimensions such as valence and arousal. Although categories are found to organize dimensional appraisals in a coherent and powerful fashion, many categories are linked by smooth gradients, contrary to discrete theories. Our results comprise an approximation of a geometric structure of reported emotional experience. Emotions are centered in subjective experiences that people represent, in part, with hundreds, if not thousands, of semantic terms. Claims about the distribution of reported emotional states and the boundaries between emotion categories—that is, the geometric organization of the semantic space of emotion—have sparked intense debate. Here we introduce a conceptual framework to analyze reported emotional states elicited by 2,185 short videos, examining the richest array of reported emotional experiences studied to date and the extent to which reported experiences of emotion are structured by discrete and dimensional geometries. Across self-report methods, we find that the videos reliably elicit 27 distinct varieties of reported emotional experience. Further analyses revealed that categorical labels such as amusement better capture reports of subjective experience than commonly measured affective dimensions (e.g., valence and arousal). Although reported emotional experiences are represented within a semantic space best captured by categorical labels, the boundaries between categories of emotion are fuzzy rather than discrete. By analyzing the distribution of reported emotional states we uncover gradients of emotion—from anxiety to fear to horror to disgust, calmness to aesthetic appreciation to awe, and others—that correspond to smooth variation in affective dimensions such as valence and dominance. Reported emotional states occupy a complex, high-dimensional categorical space. In addition, our library of videos and an interactive map of the emotional states they elicit (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/emogifs/map.html) are made available to advance the science of emotion.","[{'authorId': '49531494', 'name': 'Alan S.

614b0022bb10d9aae8d4080af20982c9a8adf25c,"Had we been there, we might have noticed that the people entering the cave, on the cliff overlooking the ocean, were carrying several objects. We might have given in to our curiosity, and quietly followed them in. Once inside, we would have seen them laboriously rubbing reddish rocks against shiny gray slabs of stone, producing a thin red powder. We would also have noticed them using sharp stone tools to break off small pieces from the red rocks, which they then crushed with stone hammers. A large mammal bone that had previously been heated with fire was also mashed. They subsequently mixed the powder, the crushed rock and bone with charcoal and a liquid in two large abalone shells. The mixture was stirred gently and extracted from the two containers with a long thin broken bone. After applying the deep red compound, they left their tools in two neat packages on a sandy mound in the cave, ready to be used the next time. Neither toolkit, however, was used ever again. They were covered by the sand blowing in from the outside, and remained buried for about 100,000 years. They were not seen again until 4 years ago, when the team of archeologists working at what is known today as Blombos Cave, on the shore of the Indian Ocean, 300 km east of Cape Town, unearthed both sets of tools, still tightly piled and set 16 cm apart from each other (Henshilwood et al., 2011) (see Figure 1). The toolkits were preserved in excellent condition, allowing researchers to retrieve ochre from the hammer, the grinding slab and the flakes, and samples of the mixture itself from the shell and a canid ulna that was probably used as a spatula. Chemical analyses have revealed the red pigment’s composition, but we will probably never know with certainty what those early Homo sapiens, physically very similar to us, used it for. On what did they apply it? The compound contained no resin or wax, so it was probably not used as an adhesive. More likely, it was used to paint a surface or to create a design on it. People had been processing ochre for tens of thousands of years before in several places across Africa, and researchers believe that they used it for coloring in general, and body painting in particular, because highly saturated red minerals were preferred to other colors (Marean et al., 2007). Ochre sought for the specific red hues it produced, and dated to 90,000–100,000 years, has also been found in Qafzeh Cave, Israel. Again, researchers have claimed that its primary purpose was painting bodies (Hovers, Ilani, Bar-Yosef, & Vandermeersch, 2003), and maybe the bodies of the deceased, as inferred from the association of pigment with burials. Ochre was not only used as a source for pigment. There is evidence for a true tradition of engraving ochre at Blombos Cave itself, less than 25,000 years after the pigment preparation episode described above (Henshilwood, d’Errico, & Watts, 2009). Engraving, however, was not limited to ochre or Blombos Cave. It was practiced in many locations throughout Africa, and also on bone and ostrich shells used as containers (Texier et al., 2010). There is also evidence that between 100,000 and 70,000 years ago our ancestors in northern and southern Africa created personal ornaments using shells collected from the seashore and riverbeds. The shells were perforated and strung together. They were often painted or worn against painted bodies or clothes (Bouzouggar et al., 2007; d’Errico, Henshilwood, Vanhaeren, & van Niekerk, 2005; d’Errico et al., 2009; Henshilwood, d’Errico, Vanhaeren, van Niekerk, & Jacobs, 2004; Vanhaeren et al., 2006). With the possible exception of Neandertals (Roebroeks et al., 2012; Zilhão et al., 2010), there is little evidence of such an intense and consistent interest in color and ornamentation in earlier hominin species. And there is growing evidence that our species expressed itself through color, ornaments, and other symbolic means wherever it went (Balme, Davidson, McDonald, Stern, & Veth, 2009; Brumm & Moore, 2005). Such behaviors seem to be, thus, inherent constituents of our human nature, a true species property, to borrow the expression Chomsky (1988) used when referring to language. All humans engage aesthetically with different forms of visual representation, or music, dance, literature, theater, landscapes, and so on. Such engagement can take the form of liking, disliking, preferring, or finding beauty or ugliness in the world around us.

Consecutive patients (n=343) at the Department of Audiology during 1 year completed the Sense of Humour Questionnaire-6 (SHQ-6) and the Communication Strategies Scale (CSS with maladaptive behaviour, verbal and non-verbal strategies). It was found that a high sense of humour was related to female gender and younger age. In multiple regression analyses, use of non-verbal communication strategies was more prevalent among females and increased with younger age, longer duration of HI, and previous HA experience. Use of verbal communication strategies and maladaptive communication behaviour increased with increasing HI. Use of verbal strategies was further associated with younger age and previous HA experience. Frequent use of maladaptive behaviour was related to younger age, longer duration of HI and less sense of humour. Maladaptive behaviour, alternatively expressed as negative reactions to stressful events in communication, was negatively associated with sense of humour.

The present study explores whether kindergarten children with and without immigrant parents in Germany differ in respect to their emotion understanding (TEC) and their behavioral selfregulation (HTKS). 356 three-to-six-year-olds with germanborn parents were contrasted with 155 children with at least one parent who was born abroad. In addition, influences of children’s age, gender, and their receptive understanding of the German language were included in the analyses. There were strong effects for migration background and no main effects for gender. When children’s language abilities were included in the analyses, the significant influence of having at least one immigrant parent on emotion understanding and behavioral self regulation disappeared. Moreover: receptive language skills that are related to parents’ migration status exerted themselves a significant influence. Children with at least one non-german parent were on average less proficient in their receptive language abilities, their emotion understanding, and their behavioral self-regulation than children of two germanborn parents. The function of language for the acquisition of emotion understanding and self regulation is discussed.

An analogy is drawn between coping with negative events and the processes of taking advantage of, or capitalizing on, positive events. It was hypothesized that expressive displays (e.g., communicating the event to others, celebrating, etc.) and perceived control would be effective capitalizing responses after positive events. These responses were predicted to augment the benefits of the events on temporary moods and longer-term well-being.

Results revealed considerable variability in HTKS scores. Evidence for construct validity was found in positive correlations with parent ratings of attentional focusing and inhibitory control and teacher ratings of classroom behavioral regulation. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that higher levels of behavioral regulation in the fall predicted stronger levels of achievement in the spring and better teacher-rated classroom self-regulation (all ps < .01) but not interpersonal skills. Evidence for domain specificity emerged, in which gains in behavioral regulation predicted gains in mathematics but not in language and literacy over the kindergarten year (p < .01) after site, child gender, and other background variables were controlled.

There will, however, necessarily be some communication hurdles between “foreign language teachers” and “native students.” This research presents an emotion recognition method for foreign language teachers in order to eliminate communication barriers between teachers and students and improve student learning efficiency. We discovered four factors of emotion recognition through literature analysis: smile, eye contact, gesture, and tone. We believe that differences in foreign language teachers’ performance in these four areas will have an impact on students’ emotion recognition and, as a result, on their learning efficiency. The influence of the foreign language teacher’s eye contact and gestures is larger (the weight of a single variable accounted for 30% or more) in the decision whether can improve the students’ classroom learning efficiency, according to 43 of the questionnaire data analysis. The second is the tone and smile (the weight of a single variable accounted for between 10 and 20%). Our research contributes to the body of knowledge on emotion recognition in university foreign language teachers by presenting a practical method for recognizing emotion in foreign language teachers.

62e8794d917f76b1ae2d21c292102293da798d19,"ABSTRACT Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders typically have social skills deficits that put them at risk for experiencing peer victimization and the development of psychiatric illness. Social skills training groups have been developed to provide an evidence-based practice to target these difficulties. However, several barriers exist to implementing these groups within real-world settings, including community mental health clinics serving children with autism spectrum disorders. Our article identifies these barriers and poses potential solutions to overcoming these obstacles. Specifically, we share adaptations to the implementation of a social skills curriculum in order to meet the needs of an urban, underserved, economically challenged, and diverse population; tailor the curriculum to meet the individual needs of each participant; and facilitate generalization of the learned skills to different settings, most notably the school setting. Effectiveness of these adaptations was measured through assessing parent, teacher, and child perspective of social skills, emotion regulation skills, and anxiety at preintervention, postintervention, and follow-up time points. It is our hope that the adaptations implemented in this setting can be translated to inform social skills groups in other similar settings.","[{'authorId': '117942031', 'name': 'Jennifer S.

62f0adee3d4e3891b7cd7f087444831090eb7fbe,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterised by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations. Cognitive models suggest that self-focused cognitive processes play a crucial role in generating and maintaining social anxiety, and that self-focused cognition occurs prior to, during, and following social situations (Clark & Wells, 1995; Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). There is a substantial body of empirical evidence demonstrating that socially anxious individuals engage in self-focused cognition during and following a social or performance situation. A smaller but growing body literature suggests that a similar process occurs prior to such situations, and that these three processes are interdependent. Furthermore, the vast majority of research to date indicates that self-focused cognitive processes are detrimental, and that they generate and maintain social anxiety in a variety of ways. However, there remains considerable scope for research to further explicate the role of these processes in the maintenance of SAD, and to enhance interventions designed to ameliorate their negative effects.","[{'authorId': '4949931', 'name': 'Alice R.

Previous theoretical attempts to characterize social emotions are compared, and their inconsistencies highlighted. Evidence for the present formulation is derived from theory and research into links between appraisals and emotions. Emotions identified as social using our criteria are also shown to bring more consistent consequences for social behavior than nonsocial emotions.

Of the 480 participants contacted, 152 mental health professionals completed the questionnaire, which contained measures of STS, VT and burnout. Results: Exposure to patients’ traumatic material did not affect STS, VT or burnout, contradicting the theory of the originators of STS and VT.

It aims to make robots capable of recognizing human emotions and understanding related emotional intention, the FCM is suitable for gathering similar information so that the calculations of dimensionality of DNNSA will be reduced, and the sparse autoencoder of DNNSA can make the neuron of DNNSA sparse to reduce the complexity of the network in such a way human–robot interaction is running smoothly. To validate the proposal, simulation experiments based on benchmark databases such as facial expression database of CK+, and speech emotion corpus of CASIA were completed. The experimental results show that the proposal outperforms the baseline algorithms of Softmax regression (SR), DNNSA, FCM-based SR (FSR), Softplus, Gath Geva-based DNNSA (GDNNSA), and ensemble DNNSA (EDNNSA).

The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome (AS): The Junior Detective Training Program. This 7-week program included a computer game, small group sessions, parent training sessions and teacher handouts.


METHOD
Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) or wait-list control (n = 23) conditions.


RESULTS
Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention.


CONCLUSIONS
The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.","[{'authorId': '7261783', 'name': 'Renae Beaumont'}, {'authorId': '4384768', 'name': 'K.

There is a suggestion that subjective assessment of hearing difficulties may be more closely associated with listening effort and fatigue rather than objective measures of hearing and/or speech perception. The aim of this study was to better understand these perceptual deficits and experiences of this population. Design: An exploratory survey was distributed to participants with self-reported listening-in-noise difficulties. The primary aim of the survey was to gather information about challenging listening environments, its impact, and preferred rehabilitation strategies. Secondly, responses were compared to their performance on behavioural tasks. Study sample: Fifty adults aged 33–55 (22 females, with normal or near-normal hearing thresholds), completed the survey, and 45 of these performed behavioural tasks. Results: Background noise with conversational content was the most common source of hearing difficulties. Participants expended higher concentration and attention when communicating in noise, and correlations with previously published behavioural data was reported. Social impacts varied, few had sought treatment, and respondents preferred training over devices. Conclusions: Insights gained may provide clinicians and researchers with an understanding of the situations, impacts and non-auditory factors associated with listening-in-noise difficulties, and preferred rehabilitation for these clients.","[{'authorId': '115416113', 'name': 'Jermy Pang'}, {'authorId': '49732995', 'name': 'E.

The assessment of cognitive change requires a means of conceptualizing the initial and end states as well as the nature of the change. The LPAD model and cognitive map provide this means. Four changes from traditional psychometric approaches are necessary: shift from product to process orientation and modification of test structure, test situation, and interpretation of results. The components of the cognitive map (content, modality, operation, phase, level of complexity, and level of efficiency) provide the conceptual model for production and measurement of cognitive change. The paper presents 3 empirical studies illustrating how the LPAD may be applied in solving practical problems with important educational and social implications.","[{'authorId': '38228510', 'name': 'R.

Recent neuroimaging studies suggest a possible neurocognitive pathway for this process, but methodological limitations of previous studies have prevented strong inferences from being drawn. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of affect labeling was conducted to remedy these limitations. The results indicated that affect labeling, relative to other forms of encoding, diminished the response of the amygdala and other limbic regions to negative emotional images. Additionally, affect labeling produced increased activity in a single brain region, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (RVLPFC). Finally, RVLPFC and amygdala activity during affect labeling were inversely correlated, a relationship that was mediated by activity in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). These results suggest that affect labeling may diminish emotional reactivity along a pathway from RVLPFC to MPFC to the amygdala.","[{'authorId': '1920154', 'name': 'Matthew D.

Preliminary studies conducted during the pandemic have shown that children and adolescents are mainly affected by social distancing and the lack of a supportive framework. The purpose of the present study was to compare mental health symptoms of 430 children and adolescents who sought mental health services in the community before vs. during the pandemic. The study examined children's perceived burden of the pandemic, reports of emotional and behavioral problems (SDQ) anxiety (SCARED), depressed moods (SMFQ-C), and difficulty in emotional regulation (DERS), as well as intervening variables such as age and gender. Furthermore, the effect of difficulty in emotional regulation on children's mental health symptoms was explored. Findings indicate an increase in all mental health symptoms excluding anxiety, during the pandemic. Boys reported more difficulty in emotional regulation during the pandemic than before, and girls reported more emotional and behavioral problems. Children reported an increase in emotional and behavioral problems and adolescents in peer relationship problems. Difficulty in emotional regulation predicted all mental health symptoms in both samples, more so in girls and adolescents. These initial findings support the need for further studies to examine the long-term mental health effects of COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents.","[{'authorId': '13554360', 'name': 'Meirav Hen'}, {'authorId': '1404473134', 'name': 'Vered Shenaar-Golan'}, {'authorId': '113655119', 'name': 'Uri Yatzker'}]",6.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry', 'volume': '13'}",68.0,Children and Adolescents' Mental Health Following COVID-19: The Possible Role of Difficulty in Emotional Regulation,2022.0

As such, in this paper, we expand Sandseter’s and Kennair’s focus in their original article in 2011 on the evolved function of risky play as an anti-phobic mechanism, and consider other types of risk than physical risks and other types of play, including other types of emotional regulation than anxiety reduction. Motivated by the thrilling emotions involved in risky play, one matures in competency and masters new and more complex psychosocial settings. Play with emotional, social, and physical risk may have evolved to increase the child’s psychosocial competency here-and-now, but also train them for future adult contexts.

6608b109c7a84f9614ed177a914907681aa67369,"People high in attachment avoidance typically respond more negatively to partner support, but some research suggests they can be calmed by high levels of practical support. In the present research, we attempted to reconcile these inconsistencies by modeling curvilinear associations between romantic partners' support and support recipients' outcomes and testing whether these curvilinear associations were moderated by recipients' degree of attachment avoidance. We examined the effect of partner support during support-relevant discussions (Studies 1-3) and in daily life (Study 4) on support recipients' distress (Studies 1-4), self-efficacy (Studies 2 and 3), perceived partner control/criticism (Studies 2 and 4), and distancing from the partner (Study 4). The results and a meta-analysis across all four studies (N = 298 couples) demonstrated that the curvilinear effect of practical support on recipients' outcomes was moderated by attachment avoidance. Highly avoidant recipients exhibited more negative responses as their partner provided them low-to-moderate levels of practical support, including increasing distress, perceived partner control/criticism and distancing, and decreasing self-efficacy. However, as partners' practical support shifted from moderate to high levels, highly avoidant recipients experienced more positive outcomes, including decreasing distress, perceived partner control/criticism and distancing, and increasing self-efficacy. Less avoidant individuals were resilient and experienced better outcomes regardless of the level of partner support they received. These results demonstrate the utility of curvilinear models in reconciling the costs and benefits of support, and indicate that high levels of practical support can overcome the defenses of highly avoidant individuals by offering undeniable evidence of the partner's availability.","[{'authorId': '4584982', 'name': 'Yuthika U.

Expanding on prior dual frameworks that differentiate teachers’ own SRL from their self-regulated teaching (SRT), the “triple SRL–SRT processes” framework also distinguishes teacher-focused from student-focused aspects of SRT. Specifically, three types of self-regulation are proposed: (1) teachers self-regulate their own learning as learners (SRL); (2) teachers self-regulate their practice as self-regulated teachers (teacher-focused SRT); (3) teachers activate students’ SRL as teachers of SRL (student-focused SRT). To support teachers’ self-regulation using this framework, a spiral model of professional development, supported by preliminary research showing positive effects on teachers’ SRL–SRT and students’ SRL and achievement, is proposed. Conceptual contributions and practical implications are discussed.","[{'authorId': '3345164', 'name': 'B.

Adolescent girls have a greater tendency toward sleep quality problems. However, relationship of sleep quality, smartphone dependence, and health-related behaviors in female junior college students has not been studied. Objectives This study had the two goals: to investigate the relationship between female college students' sleep quality, smartphone dependence, and health-related behaviors, and to identify predictors of sleep quality. Methods This study employed a cross-sectional research approach to gather 409 subjects at a junior college in southern Taiwan, and used a structured questionnaire to collect data. The questionnaire consisted of four parts: basic demographic data, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, assessment of smartphone dependence, and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP). Logistic regression analysis was employed to check for any association between sleep quality and smartphone dependence or HPLP. Results Sleep quality was significantly associated with degree of smartphone dependence, total HPLP score, and scores on the four HPLP subscales of nutritional behavior, self-actualization, interpersonal support, and stress management behavior. The lower the subjects' degree of smartphone dependence was, the better their sleep quality was. Furthermore, the degree of smartphone dependence and total HPLP score were significant predictors of sleep quality. Conclusions Smartphone dependence is associated with poor sleep quality among female college students. Improving health-related behaviors (nutritional behavior, self-actualization, interpersonal support, and stress management behavior) can also promote improvement in sleep quality.","[{'authorId': '48319361', 'name': 'Po-Yu Wang'}, {'authorId': '50053552', 'name': 'Kai-li Chen'}, {'authorId': '3106824', 'name': 'Shang-Yu Yang'}, {'authorId': '5212304', 'name': 'Pin-Hsuan Lin'}]",59.0,,63.0,"Relationship of sleep quality, smartphone dependence, and health-related behaviors in female junior college students",2019.0

This article uses multilevel models for 38 developed countries to test three hypotheses about societal differences. Data are used from the European and World Values Studies. Results show that, in most countries, the divorced have a lower level of well-being than the married, but the magnitude of this difference varies significantly across countries, even when compositional factors are taken into account. The results show that the effect of divorce is weaker in countries where the family is strong, in line with notions of support. The effect of divorce also appears to be weaker when divorce is more common, which points to the role of declining selectivity as divorce rates go up. Mixed evidence was found for the role of norms. The divorce effect is stronger in countries that have stronger norms against divorce, but this was only found for religious persons. Together, these three factors explain more than half of the variance in the divorce effect. Outlier analyses further indicate that the estimates of cross-level interaction effects are sensitive to specific countries that are in the sample.","[{'authorId': '1850523', 'name': 'M.

Design: Audiology appointments were video-recorded and analysed using quantitative coding and conversation analysis (CA). Study sample: The study sample included 13 audiologists, 17 older adults with hearing impairment, and 17 family members. Results: Initial coding showed that family members participated in 12% of the total talk time during audiology appointments. The CA results demonstrated that family members were not typically invited to join the conversation. However, family members would self-select to speak by: (1) responding to questions from the audiologist which were directed at the client; (2) self-initiating expansions on clients’ turns; and (3) self-initiating questions. When family members did participate in the interaction, audiologists typically responded by shifting the conversation back to the client. Conclusion: While family members currently have minimal participation in audiology appointments, they display a strong interest in being involved and sharing their experiences of the client's hearing impairment.

6871c3babd4f47895d616d15b17b7ba471afa89a,"The premise of equipotentiality, which has been widely adhered to among learning theorists, states that the laws of learning should not vary with the use of particular stimuli, responses, or reinforcements. This premise has recently been challenged by some data originating within the learning tradition itself, for example, studies on the effects of verbal stimuli in eye-lid conditioning. More importantly, however, the premise of equipotentiality is incompatible with data from experiments carried out within a biological-ethological framework. The results of such studies indicate that a given species is prepared to associate certain stimuli, responses, and reinforcers but not others. In an attempt to examine the validity of this premise in human classical conditioning, we investigated the effect of pictures of potentially phobic objects as conditioned stimuli (CSs) for electrodermal responses, since it has been suggested that phobias may be instances of biologically prepared learning. Three experiments are reported, all of them involving a long interstimulus interval differential conditioning paradigm with different pictures as CSs and electric shock as the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). In Experiment 1 we established that different pictures are differentially effective as CSs. A groupconditioned to potentially phobic stimuli, snakes or spiders, showed greater resistance to extinction than a group conditioned to fear-irrelevant pictorial stimuli, that is, flowers or mushrooms. A third group conditioned to ""representative laboratory stimuli,"" circles or triangles, fell in between thses two groups. Experuce similar effects to those observed with phobic and fear-irrelevant stimuli in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3 superior resistance to extinction for phobic stimuli was demonstrated when the UCS was an electric shock, but not when it was a tone to which the subject produced reaction times. Thus, the effect appears specific for aversive UCSs, and CS-UCS ""belongingness"" has been demonstrated. It was concluded that our data do challenge the premise of equipotentiality in human conditioning. There are several learning-theory accounts that could accommodate at least some aspects of the data, but they seem to be best explained in terms of biologically orsiented constructs, such as preparedness.","[{'authorId': '2276310', 'name': 'A.

687b504fb300f8aa94f59789468a03df15d8fb9a,"Participatory design (PD) has been used to good success in human-robot interaction (HRI) but typically remains limited to the early phases of development, with subsequent robot behaviours then being hardcoded by engineers or utilised in Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) systems that rarely achieve autonomy. In this article, we present LEADOR (Led-by-Experts Automation and Design Of Robots), an end-to-end PD methodology for domain expert co-design, automation, and evaluation of social robot behaviour. This method starts with typical PD, working with the domain expert(s) to co-design the interaction specifications and state and action space of the robot. It then replaces the traditional offline programming or WoZ phase by an in situ and online teaching phase where the domain expert can live-program or teach the robot how to behave whilst being embedded in the interaction context. We point out that this live teaching phase can be best achieved by adding a learning component to a WoZ setup, which captures implicit knowledge of experts, as they intuitively respond to the dynamics of the situation. The robot then progressively learns an appropriate, expert-approved policy, ultimately leading to full autonomy, even in sensitive and/or ill-defined environments. However, LEADOR is agnostic to the exact technical approach used to facilitate this learning process. The extensive inclusion of the domain expert(s) in robot design represents established responsible innovation practice, lending credibility to the system both during the teaching phase and when operating autonomously. The combination of this expert inclusion with the focus on in situ development also means that LEADOR supports a mutual shaping approach to social robotics. We draw on two previously published, foundational works from which this (generalisable) methodology has been derived to demonstrate the feasibility and worth of this approach, provide concrete examples in its application, and identify limitations and opportunities when applying this framework in new environments.","[{'authorId': '28006726', 'name': 'Katie Winkle'}, {'authorId': '2778924', 'name': 'Emmanuel Senft'}, {'authorId': '2497939', 'name': 'Séverin Lemaignan'}]",10.0,,58.0,LEADOR: A Method for End-To-End Participatory Design of Autonomous Social Robots,2021.0

 This paper describes design and results of a human-robot interaction study aimed at determining the extent to which affective robotic behavior can influence participants' compliance with a humanoid robot’s request in the context of a mock-up search-and-rescue setting. The results of the study argue for inclusion of affect into robotic systems, showing that nonverbal expressions of negative mood (nervousness) and fear by the robot improved the participants' compliance with its request to evacuate, causing them to respond earlier and faster.

The answer, writes Sandy Pentland in Honest Signals, is that subtle patterns in how we interact with other people reveal our attitudes toward them. These unconscious social signals are not just a back channel or a complement to our conscious language; they form a separate communication network. Biologically based ""honest signaling,"" evolved from ancient primate signaling mechanisms, offers an unmatched window into our intentions, goals, and values. If we understand this ancient channel of communication, Pentland claims, we can accurately predict the outcomes of situations ranging from job interviews to first dates. Pentland, an MIT professor, has used a specially designed digital sensor worn like an ID badgea ""sociometer""to monitor and analyze the back-and-forth patterns of signaling among groups of people. He and his researchers found that this second channel of communication, revolving not around words but around social relations, profoundly influences major decisions in our liveseven though we are largely unaware of it. Pentland presents the scientific background necessary for understanding this form of communication, applies it to examples of group behavior in real organizations, and shows how by ""reading"" our social networks we can become more successful at pitching an idea, getting a job, or closing a deal. Using this ""network intelligence"" theory of social signaling, Pentland describes how we can harness the intelligence of our social network to become better managers, workers, and communicators.","[{'authorId': '1682773', 'name': 'A.

The study asks when does inclusive research add value? The authors argue that this is important, given the additional time and cost of co-researching with people with intellectual disabilities. The study is situated in debates about a ""second generation"" of inclusive research which advocates focussing more on outcomes than process. The authors argue that this is premature, rather the authors propose that inclusive research is valuable when it helps to recognize, foster, and above all communicate the contributions people with intellectual disabilities can make.


METHOD
The authors conducted a literature review of 52 peer-reviewed journal articles about inclusive research and analysed them..


RESULTS
The authors conclude that inclusive research adds value when there is a distinctive contribution which only co-researchers with intellectual disabilities can make, when it highlights the contributions people with intellectual disabilities make, and when it contributes to better lives for the wider population of people with intellectual disabilities.

The authors propose a revised definition of inclusive research to replace that published by Walmsley and Johnson in 2003.","[{'authorId': '38113493', 'name': 'J.

The research is based on a 3 step framework: 1) Human-Human Interaction, Stage-1 (HHI-S1), 2) Human-Robot Interaction, Stage-2 (HRI-S2), and 3) Human-Human Interaction, Stage-3 (HHI-S3). All three stages of the therapy consist of two command sets: 1) Controls commands and 2) Evaluation commands (auditory commands, visual commands, and combination of both). The concept of multiple robots is introduced to help multi-human communication and discourage isolation in ASD children. The joint attention of an ASD child is improved by the robotic therapy in stage 2 considering it as a key parameter for a multi-human communication scenario. The improvement in joint attention results in better command following in a triad multi-human communication scenario in stage 3 as compared to stage 1. The proposed intervention has been tested on 8 ASD subjects with 10 sessions over a period of two and a half months (10 weeks). Each session of human-human interaction (stage 1 and 3) consisted of 14 cues whereas 18 cues were presented by each robot for human-robot interaction (stage 2). The results indicate an overall 86% improvement in the social communication skills of ASD children in case of a multi-human scenario.

Methods In this study, 218 university students completed questionnaires assessing seven different behavioral addictions (i.e., Facebook addiction, video game addiction, Internet addiction, exercise addiction, mobile phone addiction, compulsive buying, and study addiction) as well as an instrument assessing the main dimensions of the five-factor model of personality. Results Of the 21 bivariate intercorrelations between the seven behavioral addictions, all were positive (and nine significantly). The results also showed that (i) Neuroticism was positively associated with Internet addiction, exercise addiction, compulsive buying, and study addiction, (ii) Extroversion was positively associated with Facebook addiction, exercise addiction, mobile phone addiction, and compulsive buying, (iii) Openness to experience was negatively associated with Facebook addiction and mobile phone addiction, (iv) Agreeableness was negatively associated with Internet addiction, exercise addiction, mobile phone addiction, and compulsive buying, and (v) Conscientiousness was negatively associated with Facebook addiction, video game addiction, Internet addiction, and compulsive buying and positively associated with exercise addiction and study addiction. Conclusions The positive associations between the seven behavioral addictions suggest one or several underlying pathological factors. Hierarchical multiple regressions showed that personality traits explained between 6% and 17% of the variance in the seven behavioral addictions, suggesting that personality to a varying degree explains scores on measures of addictive behaviors.","[{'authorId': '7473366', 'name': 'C.

To recreate the same kind of rich, human-like interactions, a social robot should be aware of our needs and affective states and continuously adapt its behavior to them. Our proposed solution is to have the robot learn how to select the behaviors that would maximize the pleasantness of the interaction for its peers. To make the robot autonomous in its decision making, this process could be guided by an internal motivation system. We wish to investigate how an adaptive robotic framework of this kind would function and personalize to different users. We also wish to explore whether the adaptability and personalization would bring any additional richness to the human-robot interaction (HRI), or whether it would instead bring uncertainty and unpredictability that would not be accepted by the robot's human peers. To this end, we designed a socially adaptive framework for the humanoid robot iCub. As a result, the robot perceives and reuses the affective and interactive signals from the person as input for the adaptation based on internal social motivation. We strive to investigate the value of the generated adaptation in our framework in the context of HRI. In particular, we compare how users will experience interaction with an adaptive versus a non-adaptive social robot. To address these questions, we propose a comparative interaction study with iCub whereby users act as the robot's caretaker, and iCub's social adaptation is guided by an internal comfort level that varies with the stimuli that iCub receives from its caretaker. We investigate and compare how iCub's internal dynamics would be perceived by people, both in a condition when iCub does not personalize its behavior to the person, and in a condition where it is instead adaptive. Finally, we establish the potential benefits that an adaptive framework could bring to the context of repeated interactions with a humanoid robot.","[{'authorId': '30909094', 'name': 'Ana Tanevska'}, {'authorId': '143807743', 'name': 'F.

Cross-sectionally, we found that the relationship between adaptive strategies and psychopathology symptoms was moderated by levels of maladaptive strategies: adaptive strategies had a negative association with psychopathology symptoms only at high levels of maladaptive strategies. In contrast, adaptive strategies showed no prospective relationship to psychopathology symptoms either alone or in interaction with maladaptive strategies.

Physiological arousal dysregulation, a core feature of anxiety disorders, has been identified in children of parents with elevated anxiety. However, little is understood about how parent–infant interpersonal regulatory processes differ when the dyad includes a more anxious parent. Methods We investigated moment-to-moment fluctuations in arousal within parent-infant dyads using miniaturised microphones and autonomic monitors. We continually recorded arousal and vocalisations in infants and parents in naturalistic home settings across day-long data segments. Results Our results indicated that physiological synchrony across the day was stronger in dyads including more rather than less anxious mothers. Across the whole recording epoch, less anxious mothers showed responsivity that was limited to ‘peak’ moments in their child's arousal. In contrast, more anxious mothers showed greater reactivity to small-scale fluctuations. Less anxious mothers also showed behaviours akin to ‘stress buffering’ – downregulating their arousal when the overall arousal level of the dyad was high. These behaviours were absent in more anxious mothers. Conclusion Our findings have implications for understanding the differential processes of physiological co-regulation in partnerships where a partner is anxious, and for the use of this understanding in informing intervention strategies for dyads needing support for elevated levels of anxiety.","[{'authorId': '2110217439', 'name': 'Celia G Smith'}, {'authorId': '2244804889', 'name': 'Emily J.H.

The purpose was to examine the contribution of body self-esteem, personality traits, and demographic factors in the prediction of adolescents’ addictive use of social media and the internet. The participants were 447 Spanish adolescents aged 13−16 years (M = 14.90, SD = 0.81, 56.2% women). We measured gender, age, body self-esteem (body satisfaction and physical attractiveness), personality traits (extraversion, neuroticism, disinhibition and narcissism) and social networking and internet addiction (internet addiction symptoms, social media use, geek behaviour, and nomophobia). The effects of gender, age, body self-esteem and personality on the different dimensions of internet addiction were estimated, conducting hierarchical linear multiple regression analysis and a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results evidenced different pathways explaining four types of adolescents’ internet addiction: gender and disinhibition were the most relevant predictors of addiction symptoms; gender combined with physical attractiveness best explained social media use; narcissism and neuroticism appear to be the most relevant predictors of geek behaviour; and narcissism was the variable that best explained nomophobia.

6a2e1b51bf4740ba85395b6c0388ff1f38507641,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world and has had a long-term impact. The pandemic has caused great harm to society and caused serious psychological trauma to many people. Children are a vulnerable group in this global public health emergency, as their nervous systems, endocrine systems, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes are not well developed. Psychological crises often cause children to produce feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity, and exhaustion, and even raise the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. The inclusion of psychosocial support for children and their families are part of the health responses to disaster and disaster recovery. Based on the biopsychosocial model, some children may have catastrophic thoughts and be prone to experience despair, numbness, flashbacks, and other serious emotional and behavioral reactions. In severe cases, there may be symptoms of psychosis or posttraumatic stress disorder. Timely and appropriate protections are needed to prevent the occurrence of psychological and behavioral problems. The emerging digital applications and health services such as telehealth, social media, mobile health, and remote interactive online education are able to bridge the social distance and support mental and behavioral health for children. Based on the psychological development characteristics of children, this study also illustrates interventions on the psychological impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the world has been struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, the quarantine and social distancing policies will have long-term impacts on children. Innovative digital solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative consequences on children. Health care delivery and services should envision and implement innovative paradigms to meet broad well-being needs and child health as the quarantine and social distancing over a longer term becomes a new reality. Future research on children's mental and behavioral health should pay more attention to novel solutions that incorporate cutting edge interactive technologies and digital approaches, leveraging considerable advances in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, and health informatics among many others. Digital approaches, health technologies, and informatics are supposed to be designed and implemented to support public health surveillance and critical responses to children’s growth and development. For instance, human-computer interactions, augmented reality, and virtual reality could be incorporated to remote psychological supporting service for children’s health; mobile technologies could be used to monitor children’s mental and behavioral health while protecting their individual privacy; big data and artificial intelligence could be used to support decision making on whether children should go out for physical activities and whether schools should be reopened. Implications to clinical practices, psychological therapeutic practices, and future research directions to address current effort gaps are highlighted in this study.","[{'authorId': '1972294370', 'name': 'Jiancheng Ye'}]",95.0,,58.0,Pediatric Mental and Behavioral Health in the Period of Quarantine and Social Distancing With COVID-19,2020.0

While humanoid robots can draw on signals such as facial expressions or voice, emotions in appearance-constrained robots can only be conveyed through less-anthropomorphic output channels. While previous work focused on identifying specific expressional designs to convey a particular emotion, little work has been done to quantify the information content of different modalities and how they become effective in combination. Based on emotion metaphors that capture mental models of emotions, we systematically designed and validated a set of 28 different uni- and multimodal expressions for the basic emotions joy, sadness, fear and anger using the most common output modalities color, motion and sound. Classification accuracy and users’ confidence of emotion assignment were evaluated in an empirical study with 33 participants and a robot probe. The findings are distilled into a set of recommendations about which modalities are most effective in communicating basic artificial emotion. Combining color with planar motion offered the overall best cost/benefit ratio by making use of redundant multi-modal coding. Furthermore, modalities differed in their degree of effectiveness to communicate single emotions. Joy was best conveyed via color and motion, sadness via sound, fear via motion and anger via color.","[{'authorId': '39665145', 'name': 'Diana Löffler'}, {'authorId': '2055455662', 'name': 'Nina Schmidt'}, {'authorId': '2730421', 'name': 'Robert Tscharn'}]",79.0,,54.0,"Multimodal Expression of Artificial Emotion in Social Robots Using Color, Motion and Sound",2018.0

6aa5f7f63a2bf0d7752414c8bfc0fa8984634833,"Significance In an age of globalization, emotional understanding is the central problem of human interaction. Here, we show that historical heterogeneity, or the extent to which a country’s present-day population descends from numerous (vs. few) source countries, predicts cultural variation in norms for emotional expressivity. Reanalysis of cultural display rules from 32 countries reveals that historical heterogeneity is associated with norms favoring greater emotional expressivity. In addition, the results of a study of nine countries show that the belief that smiles signal social bonding motives vs. the negotiation of status in a social hierarchy is predicted by historical heterogeneity as well. A small number of facial expressions may be universal in that they are produced by the same basic affective states and recognized as such throughout the world. However, other aspects of emotionally expressive behavior vary widely across culture. Just why do they vary? We propose that some cultural differences in expressive behavior are determined by historical heterogeneity, or the extent to which a country’s present-day population descended from migration from numerous vs. few source countries over a period of 500 y. Our reanalysis of data on cultural rules for displaying emotion from 32 countries [n = 5,340; Matsumoto D, Yoo S, Fontaine J (2008) J Cross Cult Psychol 39(1):55–74] reveals that historical heterogeneity explains substantial, unique variance in the degree to which individuals believe that emotions should be openly expressed. We also report an original study of the underlying states that people believe are signified by a smile. Cluster analysis applied to data from nine countries (n = 726), including Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States, reveals that countries group into “cultures of smiling” determined by historical heterogeneity. Factor analysis shows that smiles sort into three social-functional subtypes: pleasure, affiliative, and dominance. The relative importance of these smile subtypes varies as a function of historical heterogeneity. These findings thus highlight the power of social-historical factors to explain cross-cultural variation in emotional expression and smile behavior.","[{'authorId': '3397445', 'name': 'Magdalena Rychlowska'}, {'authorId': '1963463', 'name': 'Yuri Miyamoto'}, {'authorId': '145413880', 'name': 'D.

To examine and predict the relationship among social appearance anxiety, emotional regulation and quality of life in individuals with premature canities.


METHODS
The correlational study was conducted from September 2019 to February 2020 in Lahore, Pakistan, after approval from the Riphah International University, Lahore, and comprised individuals of either gender aged 15-25 years with premature canities. Social Appearance Anxiety Scale, Emotional Regulation Questionnaire and the Quality of Life Scale were used to measure the study variables. Data was analysed using SPSS 21.


RESULTS
Of the 100 subjects, 50(50%) each were males and females. The overall mean age was 19.80±3.33 years. Individuals with premature canities had significant social appearance anxiety which was positively correlated with emotional suppression. As social appearance anxiety increased, the quality of life decreased (p<0.05). Lower level of cognitive reappraisal and higher expressive suppression were linked with improved quality of life in individuals with premature canities (p<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Social appearance anxiety, emotional regulation along with age were together found to be the predictors of quality of life.","[{'authorId': '35096442', 'name': 'Naheed Noor'}, {'authorId': '2001059650', 'name': 'S.

6b27e62226766385527f7eabf2fc942ea205cc24,"A common objection to the use and development of “emotional” robots is that they are deceptive. This intuitive response assumes 1) that these robots intend to deceive, 2) that their emotions are not real, and 3) that they pretend to be a kind of entity they are not. We use these criteria to judge if an entity is deceptive in emotional communication (good intention, emotional authenticity, and ontological authenticity). They can also be regarded as “ideal emotional communication” conditions that saliently operate as presuppositions in our communications with other entities. While the good intention presupposition might be a bias or illusion we really need for sustaining the social life, in the future we may want to dispense with the other conditions in order to facilitate cross-entity communication. What we need instead are not “authentic” but appropriate emotional responses-appropriate to relevant social contexts. Criteria for this cannot be given a priori but must be learned-by humans and by robots. In the future, we may learn to live with “emotional” robots, especially if our values would change. However, contemporary robot designers who want their robots to receive trust from humans had better take into account current concerns about deception and create robots that do not evoke the three-fold deception response.","[{'authorId': '46450294', 'name': 'Mark Coeckelbergh'}]",54.0,,7.0,Are Emotional Robots Deceptive?,2012.0

6baf9cfbca39dbd6c86a60d39359120d7bc0675d,"The concept of self-regulation has received heightened attention as a key mechanism that predicts a variety of developmental outcomes throughout the life span. Although researchers have focused on self-regulation from a diverse set of perspectives, it is clear that self-regulation has important implications for individual health and well-being starting early in life. In the fields of child psychology and developmental science, an emphasis on Relational-Developmental-Systems (RDS) illuminates how self-regulation contributes to individual development. 
 
 
 
This chapter reflects the RDS theoretical orientation and focuses on major issues in the study of self-regulation in childhood and adolescence. We start by situating the study of self-regulation within the RDS context and discussing key conceptual issues that guide researchers’ understanding of the development of self-regulation. We then define self-regulation and reviews research on important correlates of self-regulation including academic achievement, motor processes, intelligence, and risk factors. Next, we discuss cross-cultural variation in these skills and person-context relations. We conclude by discussing self-regulation from the perspective of RDS and next steps for studying self-regulation in context, improving intervention efforts, and advancing analytical and measurement methods.

6bbd7abf9eb7a9a5af4e24630bf2e6628493837e,"This study extends previous work on emotion communication across cultures with a large-scale investigation of the physical expression cues in vocal tone. In doing so, it provides the first direct test of a key proposition of dialect theory, namely that greater accuracy of detecting emotions from one's own cultural group-known as in-group advantage-results from a match between culturally specific schemas in emotional expression style and culturally specific schemas in emotion recognition. Study 1 used stimuli from 100 professional actors from five English-speaking nations vocally conveying 11 emotional states (anger, contempt, fear, happiness, interest, lust, neutral, pride, relief, sadness, and shame) using standard-content sentences. Detailed acoustic analyses showed many similarities across groups, and yet also systematic group differences. This provides evidence for cultural accents in expressive style at the level of acoustic cues. In Study 2, listeners evaluated these expressions in a 5 × 5 design balanced across groups. Cross-cultural accuracy was greater than expected by chance. However, there was also in-group advantage, which varied across emotions. A lens model analysis of fundamental acoustic properties examined patterns in emotional expression and perception within and across groups. Acoustic cues were used relatively similarly across groups both to produce and judge emotions, and yet there were also subtle cultural differences. Speakers appear to have a culturally nuanced schema for enacting vocal tones via acoustic cues, and perceivers have a culturally nuanced schema in judging them. Consistent with dialect theory's prediction, in-group judgments showed a greater match between these schemas used for emotional expression and perception.

6bdec6a1a89097e6ab9cef3136e21be18e776e1b,"Purpose This study evaluated the pathways between developmental language disorder (DLD), psychosocial risk factors, and the development of emotional difficulties from ages 3 to 11 years within the Millennium Cohort Study. Method A total of 14,494 singletons (49.4% female) from the Millennium Cohort Study were evaluated within this study. Risk of DLD (rDLD) was defined as age 5 parent-reported language problems and/or -1.5 SDs on a Naming Vocabulary subtest at the age of 5 years. Children without rDLD formed the general population comparison group. Psychosocial risk factors included 9-month temperamental traits, parental psychological distress, and maternal attachment as well as age 3 emotional regulation abilities, parent-child relationship, and peer problems. The parent report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Emotional Difficulty subscale at 3, 5, 7, and 11 years of age was the outcome variable. The trajectory of emotional difficulties was evaluated within a variable-centered approach and a person-centered approach, using growth mixture modeling. Results Children with rDLD ( n = 884) had increased levels of emotional problems when compared to the general population group ( n = 13,344). Psychosocial risk factors were increased in children with rDLD, fully mediated the increased emotional difficulties at 3 years, and partially mediated the increased emotional difficulties at 11 years. Children with rDLD were more likely to be included in emotional trajectory subgroups with an increasing pattern of emotional problems. rDLD was an additional risk factor for lower levels of emotional self-regulation and increased peer problems when controlling for the emotional difficulties trajectory subgroup. Conclusion This article indicates that the increased emotional difficulties found in children with rDLD are likely a function of early language difficulties influencing other domains of development, specifically social interactions (parent and peer) and emotional self-regulation abilities. Clinically, this reiterates the importance of early identification and treatment of children with language delays or clinical level language disorders.

Study 1 used a daily experience approach in a U.S. community sample (N = 244) to examine positive emotion variability across 2 weeks (macrolevel). Study 2 adopted a daily reconstruction method in a French adult sample (N = 2,391) to examine variability within 1 day (microlevel). Greater macro- and microlevel variability in positive emotion was associated with worse psychological health, including lower well-being and life satisfaction and greater depression and anxiety (Study 1), and lower daily satisfaction, life satisfaction, and happiness (Study 2). Taken together, these findings support the notion that positive emotion variability plays an important and incremental role in psychological health above and beyond overall levels of happiness, and that too much variability might be maladaptive.","[{'authorId': '2667598', 'name': 'J.

6c77af8b3a7c0665dd337767ea70d55d7e19a29f,"Neuropsychological research on the neural basis of behaviour generally posits that brain mechanisms will ultimately suffice to explain all psychologically described phenomena. This assumption stems from the idea that the brain is made up entirely of material particles and fields, and that all causal mechanisms relevant to neuroscience can therefore be formulated solely in terms of properties of these elements. Thus, terms having intrinsic mentalistic and/or experiential content (e.g. ‘feeling’, ‘knowing’ and ‘effort’) are not included as primary causal factors. This theoretical restriction is motivated primarily by ideas about the natural world that have been known to be fundamentally incorrect for more than three-quarters of a century. Contemporary basic physical theory differs profoundly from classic physics on the important matter of how the consciousness of human agents enters into the structure of empirical phenomena. The new principles contradict the older idea that local mechanical processes alone can account for the structure of all observed empirical data. Contemporary physical theory brings directly and irreducibly into the overall causal structure certain psychologically described choices made by human agents about how they will act. This key development in basic physical theory is applicable to neuroscience, and it provides neuroscientists and psychologists with an alternative conceptual framework for describing neural processes. Indeed, owing to certain structural features of ion channels critical to synaptic function, contemporary physical theory must in principle be used when analysing human brain dynamics. The new framework, unlike its classic-physics-based predecessor, is erected directly upon, and is compatible with, the prevailing principles of physics. It is able to represent more adequately than classic concepts the neuroplastic mechanisms relevant to the growing number of empirical studies of the capacity of directed attention and mental effort to systematically alter brain function.","[{'authorId': '39601954', 'name': 'J.

The various attempts within this relatively new literature to conceptualise this phenomenon include countertransference, compassion fatigue and vicarious traumatisation. The limited research evidence is evaluated and found to support anecdotal accounts by trauma therapists. Empathic engagement with trauma survivors is necessary for effective psychotherapeutic intervention. However, empathic engagement also makes therapists vulnerable to the detrimental effects of vicarious trauma, with consequent negative effects on individual counsellor effectiveness and organisational dynamics in the workplace.","[{'authorId': '2076837954', 'name': 'L.

FOMO can be identified as an intra-personal trait that drives people to stay up to date of what other people are doing, among others on social media platforms. Drawing from the findings of a large-scale survey study among 2663 Flemish teenagers, this study explores the relationships between FOMO, social media use, problematic social media use (PSMU) and phubbing behavior. In line with our expectations, FOMO was a positive predictor of both how frequently teenagers use several social media platforms and of how many platforms they actively use. FOMO was a stronger predictor of the use of social media platforms that are more private (e.g., Facebook, Snapchat) than platforms that are more public in nature (e.g., Twitter, Youtube). FOMO predicted phubbing behavior both directly and indirectly via its relationship with PSMU. These findings support extant research that points towards FOMO as a factor explaining teenagers’ social media use.","[{'authorId': '1556827523', 'name': 'V.

Self-compassion is theorized to represent a system with 6 constituent components: self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and reduced self-judgment, isolation and overidentification. There has been controversy as to whether a total score on the SCS or if separate scores representing compassionate versus uncompassionate self-responding should be used. The current study examined the factor structure of the SCS using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) to examine 5 distinct models: 1-factor, 2-factor correlated, 6-factor correlated, single-bifactor (1 general self-compassion factor and 6 group factors), and 2-bifactor models (2 correlated general factors each with 3 group factors representing compassionate or uncompassionate self-responding). Results indicated that a 1- and 2-factor solution to the SCS had inadequate fit in every sample examined using both CFA and ESEM, whereas fit was excellent using ESEM for the 6-factor correlated, single-bifactor and correlated 2-bifactor models. However, factor loadings for the correlated 2-bifactor models indicated that 2 separate factors were not well specified. A general factor explained 95% of the reliable item variance in the single-bifactor model. Results support use of the SCS to examine 6 subscale scores (representing the constituent components of self-compassion) or a total score (representing overall self-compassion), but not separate scores representing compassionate and uncompassionate self-responding.","[{'authorId': '2969088', 'name': 'K.

Our findings show that most children reach similar levels of performance on turn-taking skills across standard human treatment and RET, meaning that children benefit to a similar extent from both interventions.

Whereas young adults view this strategy as conferring more benefits than costs, older adults have a more balanced view of the costs and benefits of explicit social support seeking.

This study tested whether these attributions in fact exert the claimed causal influence on emotional experiences. The study employed a procedural priming technique in which neutral events were repeatedly attributed either to oneself (internal attribution) or to another person (external attribution). Subsequently, participants were exposed to a negative event that was ambiguous as to its causes. The results reveal that the prior repeated use of internal attributions enhanced the tendency to experience guilt, whereas the repeated use of external attributions enhanced the tendency to experience anger. These findings support the assumption that attributions exert a causal influence on emotions.","[{'authorId': '47921749', 'name': 'Roland Neumann'}]",108.0,,11.0,The Causal Influences of Attributions on Emotions: A Procedural Priming Approach,2000.0

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the psychometric properties for parent and teacher ratings in the Danish version of SDQ for different age groups of boys and girls. Methods The Danish versions of the SDQ were distributed to a total of 71,840 parent and teacher raters of 5-, 7- and 10- to 12-year-old children included in four large scale Danish cohorts. The internal reliability was assessed and exploratory factor analyses were carried out to replicate the originally proposed five factor structure. Mean scores and percentiles were examined in order to differentiate between low, medium and high levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties. Results The original five factor structure could be substantially confirmed. The Conduct items however did not solely load on the proposed Conduct scale and the Conduct scale was further contaminated by non-conduct items. Positively worded items tended to load on the Prosocial scale. This was more so the case for teachers than for parents. Parent and teacher means and percentiles were found to be lower compared to British figures but similar to or only slightly lower than those found in the other Nordic countries. The percentiles for girls were generally lower than for boys, markedly so for the teacher hyperactivity ratings. Conclusions The study supports the usefulness of the SDQ as a screening tool for boys and girls across age groups and raters in the general Danish population.","[{'authorId': '3842114', 'name': 'J.

Apart from these ten hue groups, three achromatic colors (white, black and gray) were also used. The sample consisted of 98 volunteered college students at a public institution in the southeast region of the US. Results revealed that the principle hues comprised the highest number of positive emotional responses, followed by the intermediate hues and the achromatic colors. Color symbolism seems to be apparent in how individuals associate colors with things, objects or physical space. Red-purple, for instance, was associated with the color of red wine, plum, bridesmaid dress, or the color of a bedroom.

Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (3, Serial No. 150). A distinction was made between the general level of a person's IQ (i.e., the average of his scores across age) and his profile contour (i.e., the developmental pattern of inflections in performance). Most research has focused on the general level of IQ and its correlates; this project systematically investigated patterns of IQ change with data from the Fels Longitudinal Study. Normal middle-class children changed an average of 28.5 IQ points between 21/2 and 17 years of age, and one in seven displayed shifts of more than 40 points. While siblings were more similar in their general level of IQ than unrelated children matched or unmatched for social class, the pattern of developmental changes in childhood IQs or infant DQs was not more similar among siblings than among unrelated children. Twins and triplets scored lower in general level and were less variable in IQ over age than singletons, thus potentially qualifying attempts to generalize IQ change results based upon multiple-birth samples to singletons. Parent-child IQ correlations were higher when the parent was assessed as an adult than if both parent and child were tested at the same chronological ages. A sample of 80 subjects who had relatively complete IQ data (maximum of 17 tests) between 2/2 and 17 years were clustered into five groups which represented different patterns of IQ change over age. These profiles were relatively simple linear or quadratic trends and not random fluctuations about a constant value. Major inflection points occurred at 6 and 10 years of age. It was not obvious that these patterns were simple products of repeated testing or the changing nature of the IQ test. The children in the five IQ profile clusters had parents who were different in the extent to which they attempted to accelerate their child's development and the severity of punishments they administered. These parental correlates appeared to hold up even when parental education and IQ as well as the general level of the child's IQ were statistically controlled. Given the assumptions prompted by these data, the changing nature of environmental circumstances across the childhood years for a given individual may be as potent in changing IQ as the differences between family environments.

THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN IQ Several reviews of the literature on the development of mental performance are available (Bayley 1970; Bloom 1964; Pinneau 1961). However, most of the research surveyed involves correlations between mental test performance at several different ages and correlations between personality and social variables with IQ at one age versus another. Such research strategies are valuable and have yielded important results, but they are ""developmental"" only in the sense that data are available at several ages on the same subjects and correlational relationships are derived within and across age periods. Because the correlation coefficient is independent of the means of the distributions, it is possible to obtain high correlational stability of IQ across age but marked fluctuations in the group mean. In short, cross-age correlations reveal little about the nature of absolute changes in level of performance, and they provide only partial information about individual differences in developmental pattern. This project focuses on developmental patterns of change in the level of mental performance as assessed by traditional intelligence tests.","[{'authorId': '143887530', 'name': 'R.

We aimed to identify high-risk groups whose mental health conditions were vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected from 7,236 self-selected participants measured by anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. People aged < 35 years reported a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms than people aged ≥ 35 years. Healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep compared to other occupations. Healthcare workers/younger people who spent a high level of time (≥ 3 hours/day) had a particular higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms than in those who spent less time (< 1 hours/day and 1-2 hours/day) on the outbreak. During the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers and younger people were at an especially high-risk of displaying psychological impact when they spent too much time thinking about the outbreak. Continuous monitoring of the psychological consequences for high-risk population should become routine as part of targeted interventions during times of crisis.I","[{'authorId': '2108609882', 'name': 'Yeen Huang'}, {'authorId': '2055269802', 'name': 'N.

Emotion regulation can be defined as the process, which enables individuals to regulate experiences and express emotions. Objectives: The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) on emotion regulation in methamphetamine-dependent individuals undergoing rehabilitation. Patients and Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study of pretest-posttest design with a control group (where follow-up was also done). The population under study consisted of Methamphetamine-dependent individuals undergoing rehabilitation (MDUR), who were inpatients and outpatients of Tehran’s medical centers. First, 30 MDUR, who were in the withdrawal stage were selected. Then, based on interest to participate in group therapy and matching, they were assigned to the test and control group. Mindfulness-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in eight sessions (eight weeks) with 1.5-hour duration was done. The tool used for this project was Gratz and Roemer’s difficulties in emotion regulation scale. Repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for analyzing the data. Results: Group ACT caused a significant decrease in emotion regulation scores (P < 0.001) and its following dimensions, including non-acceptance (P = 0.03), difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior (P = 0.002), impulse control difficulties (P = 0.027), and limited access to emotion regulation strategies (P = 0.038). However, it could not significantly decrease the lack of emotional awareness and clarity dimensions. Conclusions: Group acceptance and commitment therapy improved emotion regulation in methamphetamine-dependent individuals and enabled them to regulate experiences and express emotions that are very effective in controlling cravings and retention in treatment and prevention of recurrence.","[{'authorId': '113775073', 'name': 'Hamid Khakbaz'}, {'authorId': '6064221', 'name': 'A.

Yet, how such technologies should be evaluated within the context of HCI research remains unclear. In this paper, we argue that the obvious answer to this question - that evaluations should assess whether a technology brought about the intended change in behavior - is too limited. We propose that demonstrating behavior change is often infeasible as well as unnecessary for a meaningful contribution to HCI research, especially when in the early stages of design or when evaluating novel technologies. As an alternative, we suggest that HCI contributions should focus on efficacy evaluations that are tailored to the specific behavior-change intervention strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, conditioning) embodied in the system and studies that help gain a deep understanding of people's experiences with the technology.","[{'authorId': '2035680', 'name': 'P.

These results can serve to construct a model of teachers’ promotion of SRL as well as provide ideas on how to help teachers supporting SRL. This study is frontline as to my understanding no other research has been published on teachers’ beliefs, in particular self-efficacy beliefs towards promoting SRL, and how these are related to teachers’ promotion of SRL.

In this diary study, we investigated multi-level predictors of daily counterproductive work behavior (CWB) relying on the theoretical frameworks of affective events theory and the emotion-centered model of CWB. We assessed significant work events, event-based fairness perceptions, negative emotional reactions to work events, and employee CWB over a 10-day period. We tested within-person relations predicting CWB, and cross-level moderating effects of two emotion regulation strategies (suppression and reappraisal). Results from a multi-level path analysis revealed that significant work events had both direct and indirect effects on negative emotional reactions. Further, negative emotional reactions in turn mediated the relationships between significant work events and all forms of daily CWB as well as the relationship between event-based fairness perceptions and daily CWB-O. Results also supported the moderating role of reappraisal emotion regulation strategy on relations between significant work events and negative emotional reactions. Less support, however, was found for the moderating influence of suppression on the link between negative emotional reactions and CWB. Among the broad work event categories we identified, our supplemental analyses revealed that negative work events involving interactions with supervisors elicited the highest levels of employee negative emotional reactions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[{'authorId': '8381772', 'name': 'Fadel K.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of job demands and resources as well as emotional labour on job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion among nurses.


BACKGROUND
While emotional labour is a construct that has considerable significance in health care as nurses often need to express organizationally desired emotions, little research has investigated the relationships between emotional labour, job demands and resources in the prediction of nurses' well-being.


METHODS
The questionnaire was distributed to 450 registered nurses (RN) working in a teaching hospital in Taiwan during February 2007, of which 240 valid questionnaires were returned and analysed (53.33% response rate). In addition to descriptive statistics and correlation, structural equation modelling (LISREL 8.8) was conducted.


RESULTS
The findings showed that the frequency of interacting with difficult patients positively related to surface acting. Perceived organizational support (POS) positively related to deep acting and negatively to surface acting. The results also showed that surface acting related negatively, and deep acting related positively, to job satisfaction. The frequency of interactions with difficult patients related positively to emotional exhaustion, and negatively to job satisfaction. Perceived organizational support related negatively to emotional exhaustion and positively to job satisfaction.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that job demands, resources and emotional labour can predict nurses' well-being.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
The results of the present study indicate that nurses' well-being can be predicted by job demands, resources and emotional labour. There is a need to address organizational support and training programmes to enhance job satisfaction and reduce emotional exhaustion among nurses.","[{'authorId': '2325195', 'name': 'Huei-Yin Chou'}, {'authorId': '40166741', 'name': 'R.

Moreover, interventions based on the limited-strength model of self-control have received considerable criticism, but few studies have tested moderation of interventions by motivational variables fundamental to computational and process models of self-control. To correct this deficiency, we tested the ability of three interventions—using one’s nondominant hand, engaging in cognitive reappraisal exercises, and tracking one’s schedule—to increase self-control and patience in 355 high school students (mean = 16.0 years; 59% female). The nondominant hand and schedule tracking conditions were found to increase self-control, patience, and well-being only when the perceived difficulty was low. Results suggest that the limited-strength model of self-control is insufficient and underscore the explanatory power of computational and process models that account for difficulty. Implications for constructing character interventions for adolescents are discussed.","[{'authorId': '10735300', 'name': 'Sarah A. Schnitker'}, {'authorId': '114714652', 'name': 'Thomas J.

It is not uncommon for care teams to decide against initiating or continuing mechanical ventilation when such treatment would not achieve a patient’s goals or directives. COVID-19 presents a different case: patients who do not receive a ventilator could benefit, perhaps living for many additional years, if they receive short-term mechanical ventilation. Denying patients such treatment, against their wishes, most likely will result in their death, but it will also make this scarce resource available to other patients who are more likely to survive if they receive ventilator support. Recently developed protocols expressly call for the rationing and reallocation of ventilators, in a manner that aims to save the greatest number of lives.1 These protocols are broadly accepted by medical ethicists.1,2 But ethics aside, there are potential legal ramifications of either withholding or withdrawing a ventilator from a patient who would ordinarily receive such aid in the absence of a public health emergency. In this Viewpoint, we assess the legal risks that physicians, other health care workers, and hospital systems confront in such scenarios and recommend that states explicitly and immediately adopt legal protections for health care workers, modeled on provisions in place in Maryland.","[{'authorId': '2242803522', 'name': 'JD I.GlennCohen'}, {'authorId': '2249208046', 'name': 'JD AndrewM.Crespo'}, {'authorId': '2249201505', 'name': 'MD DouglasB.White'}, {'authorId': '2249207516', 'name': 'JD I.Glenn Cohen'}]",94.0,,7.0,Potential Legal Liability for Withdrawing or Withholding Ventilators During COVID-19: Assessing the Risks and Identifying Needed Reforms.,2020.0

Risky outdoor play has diminished over time, concurrent with increasing concerns regarding child safety and emphasis on injury prevention. We sought to conduct a systematic review to examine the relationship between risky outdoor play and health in children, in order to inform the debate regarding its benefits and harms. We identified and evaluated 21 relevant papers for quality using the GRADE framework. Included articles addressed the effect on health indicators and behaviours from three types of risky play, as well as risky play supportive environments. The systematic review revealed overall positive effects of risky outdoor play on a variety of health indicators and behaviours, most commonly physical activity, but also social health and behaviours, injuries, and aggression. The review indicated the need for additional “good quality” studies; however, we note that even in the face of the generally exclusionary systematic review process, our findings support the promotion of risky outdoor play for healthy child development. These positive results with the marked reduction in risky outdoor play opportunities in recent generations indicate the need to encourage action to support children’s risky outdoor play opportunities.

Based on three cases taken from a corpus of 64 interviews and on a protocol identifying the essentially verbal expression of emotions and emotion management, the focus in the paper is on how emotions can erupt when the client is recounting biographical episodes and how counsellors handle the situation. The results highlight the discourse procedures used by clients (e.g. preliminary phrases, seeking ratification, hesitations, repetitions, reference to self) and by counsellors (e.g. reformulations, questions) and show that counsellors can transform the client’s emotional reactions, which can have a decisive impact on the outcome of counselling interviews.","[{'authorId': '2085841674', 'name': 'Isabelle Olry‐Louis'}]",9.0,,74.0,Expression and management of emotions in career counselling interactions,2018.0

Subsequent years saw the appearance of competitors such as Google Now , swiftly followed by consumer products such as Amazon Echo . These devices are seen as the ﬁrst steps towards more advanced ‘conversational’ artefacts (especially robots ). However, evidence suggests that the usage of such voice-enabled devices is surprisingly low, perhaps due to noise in the environment, privacy concerns or manual alternatives.. Another possible contributing factor is that the ubiquitous deployment of inappropriate humanlike voices for non-living artefacts might deceive users into overestimating their capabilities, thereby creating a conﬂict of expectations that ultimately leads to a breakdown in communications. This paper highlights the beneﬁts of providing an appropriate voice for a given artefact based on three separate studies. Results are presented that demonstrate the positive impact of a non-human voice and illustrate how ‘appropriateness’ might be measured objectively. Finally, a worked-example is presented of implementing an appropriate voice for the MiRo biomimetic robot.

A battery of 16 aptitude tests was administered in the 6th grade and course grades were collected in 17 different subject matter areas in the 9th grade (N = 866). For the aptitude tests a confirmatory factor model is fitted with a general factor (G) along with nine orthogonal, residual factors. Some of the residual factors are quite broad (Crystallized intelligence, Gc(1), and General visualization G(1)), but most are narrow factors identified by pairs of tests (e.g., V(1), Ms(1), Num Ach(1), Vz(1), S, and Cs(1)). A model is fitted to the 17 course grades as well. The model includes a general school achievement factor (GENACH) and domain specific achievement factors in areas such as science-mathematics (SCIENCE), social science (SOCSCI(1)), language (LANG(1)) and spatial-practical performance (SPATPR(1)). Relating the latent criterion variables to the latent aptitude variables it is found that some 40% of the variance in GENACH may be accounted for by G and Gc(1). However, larger proportions of variance are accounted for in the domain specific achievement factors and different aptitude factors are important in different domains.

Research suggests that self-compassion may improve mental health by promoting emotion regulation (Berking & Whitley, ). This review aimed to identify studies which investigated the relationship between self-compassion, emotion regulation, and mental health in order to examine the role of emotional regulation as a mechanism of change.


METHODS
Searches were conducted in PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline complete, Web of Science and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria required publications to be: peer reviewed, published in English, contain validated measures of self-compassion and emotion regulation, and report a direct analysis on the relationship between these constructs.


RESULTS
The search yielded five studies which met inclusion criteria. Emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between self-compassion and mental health. This pattern was consistent across community and clinical samples, for a range of mental health symptoms including stress, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. A critical limitation of the review was that all included studies used cross-sectional data, limiting interpretations regarding causation.


CONCLUSIONS
Results provide preliminary evidence that emotion regulation may be a mechanism of change in the relationship between self-compassion and mental health. Self-compassion may be a pertinent preliminary treatment target for individuals who avoid experiences of emotions.","[{'authorId': '51041535', 'name': 'Elisa Inwood'}, {'authorId': '32265785', 'name': 'Madeleine Ferrari'}]",214.0,,34.0,"Mechanisms of Change in the Relationship between Self-Compassion, Emotion Regulation, and Mental Health: A Systematic Review.",2018.0

Study One examined this association in seven domains – psychopathology, positive psychological health, emotional intelligence, self-concept, body image, motivation, and interpersonal functioning – and found that while reduced negative self-responding had a stronger link to negative emotionality and self-evaluation than positive self-responding, they were roughly equivalent predictors in other domains. Study Two examined the association of compassionate and reduced uncompassionate behavior with sympathetic nervous system and inflammatory activity after stress, and found they equally predicted salivary alpha amylase and interleukin-6 levels in individuals after a stressful situation. Overall, results suggest that both compassionate and reduced uncompassionate self-responding are central to self-compassion and that both help to explain its link to healthy psychological functioning.","[{'authorId': '2969088', 'name': 'K.

Emotion regulation (ER) supports multiple individual functions and promotes mental health and wellbeing. Among the tools that may be used to help people in managing their affective states, videogames are reaching attention and are showing positive effects. Yet, little is known about their effectiveness.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to assess the amount and quality of studies investigating the effects and modalities of the use of videogames for ER.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A systematic literature search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Subsequently, according to expert advice other few studies have been added.


RESULTS
Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; they can be categorized into three groups, namely (1) cross-sectional and qualitative studies, (2) experimental studies investigating the effects of videogame experience on ER and (3) ER intervention with serious games.


DISCUSSION
Discussion of the reviewed studies highlights that frequent gaming with commercial games offers more opportunities for ER improvement (related to gameplay and enjoyment of fictional properties) than limited-time experiences, such as those supported by bespoke serious games. This research area is still in its infancy and findings need to be interpreted with caution; furthermore, future reviews are encouraged to include clinical populations.


CONCLUSION
Videogames offer several opportunities for ER and a challenge for educational and psychological interventions.","[{'authorId': '103238720', 'name': 'D. Villani'}, {'authorId': '2164209', 'name': 'C.

and burnout in student counsellors and student cognitive 
behavioural psychotherapists. Method: A quantitative survey using four validated data collection instruments: (1) Professional Quality of Life Scale; (2) Self-Compassion Scale; (3) short Warwick and Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale; (4) Compassion For Others scale, was used to measure relationships between self-compassion, compassion fatigue, 
well-being and burnout. Participants: A mixed sample of student counsellors and student cognitive behavioural psychotherapists (n = 54) in their final year of study. Results: This preliminary study shows that student counsellors and student cognitive behavioural psychotherapists who reported high on measures of self-compassion and well-being also reported less compassion fatigue and burnout. Implications for practice: Compassion fatigue and burnout are found in many modern-day, 
highly stressful healthcare professions. The practice of self-compassion could help student practitioners manage these symptoms and subsequently improve their professional quality of life.","[{'authorId': '3219868', 'name': 'E.

Since human beings gain many advantages from deceptive capabilities, we can also assume that robotic deception can provide benefits in several ways. Particularly, the use of robotic deception in human-robot interaction contexts is becoming an important and interesting research question. Despite its importance, very little research on robot deception has been conducted. Furthermore, no basic metrics or definitions of robot deception have been proposed yet. In this paper, we review the previous work on deception in various fields including psychology, biology, and robotics and will propose a novel way to define a taxonomy of robot deception. In addition, we will introduce an interesting research question of robot deception in HRI contexts and discuss potential approaches.","[{'authorId': '1712885', 'name': 'Jaeeun Shim'}, {'authorId': '1706062', 'name': 'R.

74c3f68c20dc2eba2025a2d2b6eb6787d4a7efc1,"Background: The aim of this study was to examine the link between adolescent sleep and non-attendance in school. Methods: A large population-based study from Norway conducted in 2012, the youth@hordaland study, surveyed 8,347 adolescents aged 16–19 years (54% girls). Self-reported sleep measures included bedtime, rise time, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), insomnia symptoms, tiredness, and sleepiness. School attendance was obtained from national administrative registries. Results: Most sleep parameters were associated with increased risk of school non-attendance. After adjusting for gender and socioeconomic status, short sleep duration and sleep deficiency were the sleep measures with the highest odds of non-attendance (OR=4.61, CI 95% 3.29–6.46) and (OR=3.26, CI 95% 2.67–3.99), respectively). Also, large bedtime discrepancies in weekend versus weekdays were associated with non-attendance (OR=2.43, CI 95% 1.93–2.02), as well as insomnia (OR=2.25, CI % 1.89–2.67) and daytime tiredness (OR=2.09, CI 95% 1.70–2.57). The associations were somewhat reduced after additional adjustment for depression, but remained significant in the fully adjusted model. Conclusion: The demonstrated relationship between sleep problems and school absence suggests that careful assessment of sleep is warranted when adolescents present with extensive school absence. Future studies on how the sleep–school absence relationship in adolescence may impact later work affiliation in adulthood are needed.","[{'authorId': '4081393', 'name': 'M.

When it comes to an eerie, deadly and chronic disease like cancer, the individual is much more likely to be affected by it. Objective : This descriptive study aims to identify quality of life and level of social support and the affecting factors in cancer patients. Methods: The sample included 170 patients who applied to Internal Diseases, Radiation Oncology, Thorax diseases clinics and Chemotherapy polyclinic in a university hospital in Turkey between March and August, 2005, who met the research criteria, and who volunteered to participate in the study. The sample represented 20 % of the target population. Data were collected through SF-36 Quality of Life Scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Results: The patients’ Global Quality of Life mean score was found 38.67 ± 13.64, and mean score for the Perceived Social Support was found 59.19 ± 17.5. Global Quality of Life score was higher in those who underwent an operation and who received ambulatory health care. Although Global Quality of Life was not influenced by the gender variable, male patients’ level of well-being was found to be higher. Perceived Social Support total score was found to be higher in those who knew about their disease. Family support was found to be higher in those who were married and who lived in town; it was found to be low in those who had low socio-economic level and who received inpatient treatment. Friend support was found to be high in those who knew about their disease. Conclusion: There was a linear relationship between Perceived Social Support and Quality of Life. It is recommended that more studies with wider groups of participants would shed more light to the issue of identifying quality of life, social support level and the relationships between them in cancer patients.","[{'authorId': '39980603', 'name': 'A.

74dbafed162dd9f32b7c062f5360deaaecbea268,"Vicarious traumatization (VT) refers to harmful changes that occur in professionals’ views of themselves, others, and the world, as a result of exposure to the graphic and/or traumatic material of their clients. Secondary traumatic stress (STS) refers to a set of psychological symptoms that mimic post-traumatic stress disorder, but is acquired through exposure to persons suffering the effects of trauma. Numerous studies have sought to identify correlates of both VT and STS, yet there still exists a lack of conceptual clarity in the literature about VT, STS, and the related constructs of burnout and compassion fatigue. This has made it difficult to use the literature to inform practice and training. This study clarifies the definitions of VT and STS and uses levels of evidence analysis to synthesize the research findings to date. Originally planned as a meta-analysis, the study was re-designed as methodological issues in the literature became apparent that would call into question the validity of a meta-analysis. The current method of analysis documents the degree of evidence for the most commonly researched factors that have been researched as possible contributors to the development of both VT and STS, synthesizing the findings of published research and dissertations written in the English language from 1994–2003. Findings indicate that persuasive evidence exists for personal trauma history, reasonable evidence for perceived coping style, and some evidence for supervision experiences, as important predictors of VT. Persuasive evidence for amount of exposure to trauma material and reasonable evidence for personal trauma history are indicated as important in the development of STS. Limitations of the current study and directions for further research are discussed. *An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 112th Annual Conference of the American Psychological Association, 31 July 2004, Honolulu Hawaii, USA","[{'authorId': '40620831', 'name': 'Katie Baird'}, {'authorId': '3514924', 'name': 'A.

Although conceptually self-regulation has been defined as multifaceted, previous research has not investigated whether there is conceptual and empirical overlap between the factors that comprise self-regulation or if they are distinct. In this study, using a bifactor model, we tested the shared and unique variance among self-regulation constructs and prediction to pre-academic and social-emotional skills. The sample included 932 preschool children (Mage = 48 months, SD = 6.55; 49% female), their parents, and their teachers in the United States. Children’s self-regulation was assessed using measures of executive function, behavioral self-regulation, and emotion regulation. The bifactor model demonstrated a common overarching self-regulation factor, as well as distinct executive function and emotion regulation factors. The common overarching self-regulation factor and executive function predicted children’s pre-academic (i.e., mathematics and literacy) and social-emotional skills. The emotion regulation factor predicted children’s social-emotional skills. Identifying the shared and unique aspects of self-regulation may have important implications for supporting children’s regulatory skills as well as their success in school.","[{'authorId': '77697542', 'name': 'I.

A combination of talking beat gestures with emotional cues such as eye lightings, body posture of voice intonation and volume permits a rich variety of behaviors. The developed approach is not purely reactive, and it easily allows to assign a kind of personality to the robot.

These factors cohere to form a COVID stress syndrome, which we sought to further delineate in the present study. Methods A population‐representative sample of 6,854 American and Canadian adults completed a self‐report survey comprising questions about current mental health and COVID‐19‐related experiences, distress, and coping. Results Network analysis revealed that worry about the dangerousness of COVID‐19 is the central feature of the syndrome. Latent class analysis indicated that the syndrome is quasi‐dimensional, comprising five classes differing in syndrome severity. Sixteen percent of participants were in the most severe class and possibly needing mental health services. Syndrome severity was correlated with preexisting psychopathology and with excessive COVID‐19‐related avoidance, panic buying, and coping difficulties during self‐isolation. Conclusion The findings provide new information about the structure and correlates of COVID stress syndrome. Further research is needed to determine whether the syndrome will abate once the pandemic has passed or whether, for some individuals, it becomes a chronic condition.","[{'authorId': '143933569', 'name': 'S.

This phenomenon makes communication between robots and individuals become more natural. However, many robots currently in use are appearance constrained and not able to perform facial expressions and gestures. In addition, although humanoid-oriented techniques are promising, they are time and cost consuming, which leads to many technical difficulties in most research studies. To increase interactive efficiency and decrease costs, we alternatively focus on three interaction modalities and their combinations, namely color, sound, and vibration. We conduct a structured study to evaluate the effects of the three modalities on a human's emotional perception towards our simple-shaped robot “Maru.” Our findings offer insights into human-robot affective interactions, which can be particularly useful for appearance-constrained social robots. The contribution of this work is not so much the explicit parameter settings but rather deepening the understanding of how to express emotions through the simple modalities of color, sound, and vibration while providing a set of recommended expressions that HRI researchers and practitioners could readily employ.","[{'authorId': '66245274', 'name': 'Sichao Song'}, {'authorId': '1679243', 'name': 'S.

Effective emotion regulation involves the ability to accurately detect and evaluate cues related to physiological reactions to stressful events, accompanied by appropriate regulation strategies that temper and influence the emotional response. There is compelling evidence demonstrating links between poor or disrupted awareness of sensory information, or interoceptive awareness, and difficulties with emotion regulation. This paper presents a framework, based on psychological and neurobiological research, for understanding how interoceptive awareness facilitates regulation and an integrated sense of self, and thus contributes to health and well-being. A mind-body therapeutic approach called mindful awareness in body-oriented therapy (MABT), uniquely designed to teach fundamental skills of interoceptive awareness, is described. MABT develops the distinct interoceptive awareness capacities of identifying, accessing, and appraising internal bodily signals that are identified in physiological models as the critical components of interoception for emotion regulation. The explanatory model is that the development of these key interoceptive capacities improves sensory (physical and emotional) awareness, reduces distress, and improves regulation. Strategies for teaching and learning interoceptive awareness are not well-developed in mindfulness or psychotherapeutic approaches, particularly important for people who may have difficulty attending to interoceptive awareness due to stress, chronic pain or trauma. To address this issue, MABT provides an individualized protocol for scaffolding interoceptive awareness through a combination of psychoeducation and somatic approaches explicitly addressing difficulties with interoceptive processing. Clinical vignettes are included to provide exemplars of this approach and to highlight key components of the therapeutic process. Results from research are also included to highlight the acceptability, safety, health outcomes, and possible mechanisms underlying the MABT approach.","[{'authorId': '4208790', 'name': 'C.

The lack of a consensual classification for SMD hinders the further development of the research field. The six components of Griffiths’ biopsychosocial model of addiction have been the most widely used criteria to assess and diagnosis SMD. The Bergen social media addiction scale (BSMAS) based on Griffiths’ six criteria is a widely used instrument to assess the symptoms and prevalence of SMD in populations. This study aims to: (1) determine the optimal cut-off point for the BSMAS to identify SMD among Chinese adolescents, and (2) evaluate the contribution of specific criteria to the diagnosis of SMD. Method Structured diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample (n = 252) were performed to determine the optimal clinical cut-off point for the BSMAS. The BSMAS was further used to investigate SMD in a community sample of 21,375 adolescents. Results The BSMAS score of 24 was determined as the best cut-off score based on the gold standards of clinical diagnosis. The estimated 12-month prevalence of SMD among Chinese adolescents was 3.5%. According to conditional inference trees analysis, the criteria “mood modification”, “conflict”, “withdrawal”, and “relapse” showed the higher predictive power for SMD diagnosis. Conclusions Results suggest that a BSMAS score of 24 is the optimal clinical cut-off score for future research that measure SMD and its impact on health among adolescents. Furthermore, criteria of “mood modification”, “conflict”, “withdrawal”, and “relapse” are the most relevant to the diagnosis of SMA in Chinese adolescents.","[{'authorId': '2068286480', 'name': 'Tao Luo'}, {'authorId': '47657534', 'name': 'Lixia Qin'}, {'authorId': '2150209849', 'name': 'Limei Cheng'}, {'authorId': '2151487104', 'name': 'Sheng Wang'}, {'authorId': '2109438436', 'name': 'Zijun Zhu'}, {'authorId': '2128691575', 'name': 'Jiabin Xu'}, {'authorId': '2118442340', 'name': 'Haibo Chen'}, {'authorId': '83875535', 'name': 'Qiaosheng Liu'}, {'authorId': '6732067', 'name': 'Maorong Hu'}, {'authorId': '1713584201', 'name': 'Jianqin Tong'}, {'authorId': '144043882', 'name': 'W.

Methods: The psychometric properties of the MPSS were analyzed in a sample of 991 Spanish early retirees enrolled in university programs. Participants had an average age of 62.7 years (SD = 5.89). An exploratory factor analysis and second-order confirmatory factor analysis were developed to identify the factorial solution and the best model fit. Results: The three factors identified were MSPSS significant others, MSPSS friends, and MSPSS family. Regarding reliability and validity, internal consistency indices were above .92 and the correlation between perceived social support subscales and measures of satisfaction with life in retirement were significantly positive. Conclusion: The Spanish language version of the MSPSS demonstrates acceptable psychometric properties in relation to internal structure and reliability, and all but one of the goodness-of-fit indices emerging from the CFA also supported this factor structure. The practical implications of the scale in different populations and the problems in relation to the three-factor solution and the index values obtained are discussed.","[{'authorId': '1399562900', 'name': 'Yolanda López Ramos'}, {'authorId': '48357635', 'name': 'Juan José Fernández Muñoz'}, {'authorId': '1399106491', 'name': 'E.

Despite the fast-growing richness of these worlds, the majority of interactions between the player and non-player characters (NPCs) still remain scripted. In this paper we propose using an NPC's animations to reflect how they feel towards the player and as a proof of concept, investigate the potential for a straightforward gaze model to convey trust. Through two perceptual experiments, we find that viewers can distinguish between high and low trust animations, that viewers associate the gaze differences specifically with trust and not with an unrelated attitude (aggression), and that the effect can hold for different facial expressions and scene contexts, even when viewed by participants for a short (five second) clip length. With an additional experiment, we explore the extent that trust is uniquely conveyed over other attitudes associated with gaze, such as interest, unfriendliness, and admiration.","[{'authorId': '1682962', 'name': 'Aline Normoyle'}, {'authorId': '1697165', 'name': 'J.

In this critical review, the authors appraise neuroimaging findings in bipolar disorder in emotion-processing, emotion-regulation, and reward-processing neural circuitry in order to synthesize the current knowledge of the neural underpinnings of bipolar disorder and provide a neuroimaging research road map for future studies.


METHOD
The authors examined findings from all major studies in bipolar disorder that used functional MRI, volumetric analysis, diffusion imaging, and resting-state techniques, integrating findings to provide a better understanding of larger-scale neural circuitry abnormalities in bipolar disorder.


RESULTS
Bipolar disorder can be conceptualized, in neural circuitry terms, as parallel dysfunction in prefrontal cortical (especially ventrolateral prefrontal cortical)-hippocampal-amygdala emotion-processing and emotion-regulation circuits bilaterally, together with an ""overactive"" left-sided ventral striatal-ventrolateral and orbitofrontal cortical reward-processing circuitry, resulting in characteristic behavioral abnormalities associated with bipolar disorder: emotional lability, emotional dysregulation, and heightened reward sensitivity. A potential structural basis for these functional abnormalities is gray matter volume decreases in the prefrontal and temporal cortices, the amygdala, and the hippocampus and fractional anisotropy decreases in white matter tracts connecting prefrontal and subcortical regions.


CONCLUSIONS
Neuroimaging studies of bipolar disorder clearly demonstrate abnormalities in neural circuits supporting emotion processing, emotion regulation, and reward processing, although there are several limitations to these studies. Future neuroimaging research in bipolar disorder should include studies adopting dimensional approaches; larger studies examining neurodevelopmental trajectories in youths with bipolar disorder or at risk for bipolar disorder; multimodal neuroimaging studies using integrated systems approaches; and studies using pattern recognition approaches to provide clinically useful individual-level data. Such studies will help identify clinically relevant biomarkers to guide diagnosis and treatment decision making for individuals with bipolar disorder.","[{'authorId': '2656493', 'name': 'M.

Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak. Conclusion: Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.","[{'authorId': '1624613608', 'name': 'S.

7714dc3ac29bc866cec7f73de53ec199bbd025d8,"A growing clinical literature indicates that there is a link between substance abuse and stress. One explanation for the high co-occurrence of stress-related disorders and drug addiction is the self-medication hypothesis, which suggests that a dually diagnosed person often uses the abused substance to cope with tension associated with life stressors or to relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression resulting from a traumatic event. However, another characteristic of self-administration is that drug delivery and its subsequent effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are under the direct control of the individual. This controlled activation of the HPA axis may produce an internal state of arousal or stimulation that is actually sought by the individual. During abstinence, exposure to stressors or drug-associated cues can stimulate the HPA axis and thereby remind the individual about the effects of the abused substance, thus producing craving and promoting relapse. Stress reduction, either alone or in combination with pharmacotherapies targeting the HPA axis, may prove beneficial in reducing cravings and promoting abstinence in individuals seeking treatment for addiction.","[{'authorId': '5209550', 'name': 'N.

This paper presents an MRI‐based study undertaken to (i) identify the differences in brain activities due to ASD, (ii) verify whether such differences exist within the ‘social brain’ circuit which is hypothesized to be responsible for social functions, and (iii) uncover potential compensatory mechanisms within the identified differences in brain activities. In this study, a whole‐brain voxel‐wise analysis is performed using resting‐state fMRI data from 598 adolescent males, that is openly available from the ABIDE consortium. A new method is developed, which can (i) extract the discriminative brain activities, that provide high separability between the blood oxygenation time‐series signals from ASD and neurotypical populations, (ii) select the activities that are relevant to ASD by evaluating the correlation between the separability and traditional severity scores, and (iii) map the spatial pattern of regions responsible for generating the discriminative activities. The results show that the most discriminative brain activities occur within a subset of the social brain that is involved with affective aspects of social processing, thereby supporting the idea of the social brain and also its fractionalization in ASD. Further, it has also been found that the diminished activities in the posterior cingulate area are potentially compensated by enhanced activities in the ventromedial prefrontal and anterior temporal areas within the social brain. Hemispherical lateralization is also observed on such compensatory activities.","[{'authorId': '48659885', 'name': 'Vigneshwaran Subbaraju'}, {'authorId': '2098996729', 'name': 'S.

Although theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that impairment in the social brain network could be the neural underpinnings of ASD, previous structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in adults with ASD have not provided clear support for this, possibly due to confounding factors, such as language impairments. To further explore this issue, we acquired structural MRI data and analyzed gray matter volume in adults with ASD (n = 36) who had no language impairments (diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, with symptoms milder than those of Asperger’s disorder), had no comorbidity, and were not taking medications, and in age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) controls (n = 36). Univariate voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed that regional gray matter volume was lower in the ASD than in the control group in several brain regions, including the right inferior occipital gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, bilateral amygdala, right inferior frontal gyrus, right orbitofrontal cortex, and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A multivariate approach using a partial least squares (PLS) method showed that these regions constituted a network that could be used to discriminate between the ASD and TD groups. A PLS discriminant analysis using information from these regions showed high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision (>80%) in discriminating between the groups. These results suggest that reduced gray matter volume in the social brain network represents the neural underpinnings of behavioral social malfunctioning in adults with ASD.","[{'authorId': '46581944', 'name': 'W.

However, there exists no systematic mapping of thermal feedback to models of emotion that could be used by designers and users to convey a range of emotions in HCI. A common way of classifying emotions and quantifying emotional experience is through ratings along valence and arousal dimensions, originating from Russell's circumplex model [32]. Therefore, the research in this paper mapped subjective ratings of a range of thermal stimuli to the circumplex model to understand the range of emotions that might be conveyed through thermal feedback. However, as the suitability of the model varies depending on the type of emotional stimuli [31], we also compared the goodness of fit of ratings between the circumplex and vector [8,31] models of emotion. The results showed that thermal feedback was interpreted as representing a limited range of emotions concentrated in just two quadrants or categories of the circumplex: high valence, low arousal and low valence, high arousal. Warm stimuli were perceived as more pleasant/positive than cool stimuli and altering either the rate or extent of temperature change affected both valence and arousal axes simultaneously.

The purpose of this review is to configure primarily qualitative and mixed methods findings from studies meeting our selection and quality criterion to answer the review question: How do robotic construction kits function as computational manipulatives in P–12 STEM education? Our synthesis of the literature has resulted in four key insights that are new to the field. First, RCKs have a unique double application: They may be used for direct instruction in robotics (first-order uses) or as analogical tools for learning in other domains (second-order uses). Second, RCKs make possible additional routes to learning through the provision of immediate feedback and the dual modes of representation unique to RCKs. Third, RCKs support a computational thinking learning progression beginning with a lower anchor of sequencing and finishing with a high anchor of systems thinking. And fourth, RCKs support evolving problem-solving abilities along a continuum, ranging from trial and error to heuristic methods associated with robotics study. Furthermore, our synthesis provides insight into the second-order (analogical) uses of RCKs as computational manipulatives in the disciplines of physics and biology. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.

No studies have been performed yet to assess their effect in children while waiting for emergency room consultations. Objective: To assess the impact of social robots in managing stress in children waiting for an emergency room procedure through the assessment of salivary cortisol levels. Methods: This was an open randomised clinical trial in children attending a paediatric emergency department. Children accessing the emergency room were randomised to one of three groups: 1) playing with a NAO social robot; 2) playing with a study nurse; 3) waiting with parents. All children were measured salivary cortisol levels through a swab. Salivary cortisol levels before and after the intervention were compared in the three groups. We calculated the effect size of our interventions through the Cohen's d-based effect size correlation (r). Results: A total of 109 children aged 3 to 10 years were enrolled in the study and 94 had complete data for the analyses. Salivary cortisol levels decreased significantly more in the group exposed to robot interaction than in the other two groups (r=0.75). Cortisol levels decreased more in girls (r=0.92) than boys (r=0.57). Conclusions: Social robots are efficacious in decreasing stress in children accessing the emergency room and may be considered as a tool for improving emotional perceptions of children and their families in such a critical setting.

A widely-held belief in these countries is that employees have developed 'bad' attitudes due to the labour shortage. Employees are believed to job-hop for no reason, or even for fun. Unfortunately, despite employee turnover being such a serious problem in Asia, there is a dearth of studies investigating it; in particular studies using a comprehensive set of variables are rare. This study examines three sets of antecedents of turnover intention in companies in Singapore: demographic, controllable and uncontrollable. Singapore companies provide an appropriate setting as their turnover rates are among the highest in Asia. Findings of the study suggest that organisational commitment, procedural justice and a job-hopping attitude were three main factors associated with turnover intention in Singapore companies.","[{'authorId': '2950604', 'name': 'Naresh Khatri'}, {'authorId': '119334865', 'name': 'Chong Tze Fern'}, {'authorId': '96954690', 'name': 'P.

This article aims to explore the value of attachment theory as a framework for understanding the ways in which the staff-patient relationship is associated with different methods of regulating emotion in individuals with a diagnosis of psychosis.


METHOD
Patient participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychosis not otherwise specified and mental health workers were recruited from 24-hour rehabilitation teams. Patient participants completed questionnaires assessing emotion regulation, attachment, therapeutic alliance and symptomatology. The therapeutic alliance was also assessed from mental workers' perspective.


RESULTS
Insecure attachment was significantly associated with greater difficulties in regulating emotions. A strong therapeutic alliance was associated with fewer difficulties in regulating emotions.


CONCLUSIONS
Attachment is a useful theoretical construct for understanding psychosis, with evidence for a link between a positive staff-patient relationship and enhanced emotion regulation. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.


KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE
The study supports a link between attachment organisation and psychosis, characterised by difficulties in emotion regulation. A positive patient-key worker relationship may facilitate the development of emotion regulation in this client group. A key implication of these findings is the training of MDT staff in the implementation of attachment-informed interventions.","[{'authorId': '35064441', 'name': 'K.

However, due to (a) large variations in students’ domain-specific abilities (e.g. knowledge and/or skills) and the effort they invest into the collaboration and (b) teachers’ limited knowledge about how to assess collaborative learning, two main challenges arise. The first challenge concerns ensuring construct validity of the assessment methods, that is, whether an assessment accurately measures students’ domain-specific abilities. The second challenge originates from the potential of assessment methods to elicit student behaviour that is misaligned with the objectives of collaborative learning (e.g. free-riding behaviour). This paper aims to enhance teachers’, researchers’, and students’ awareness for and need to develop what we refer to as ‘collaborative learning assessment literacy’. In particular, we will discuss the two challenges in relation to three frequently used and discussed methods for assessing collaborative learning - group assessment, individual assessment, and group assessment combined with intra-group peer assessment - with specific attention to the purpose of assessment (i.e. formative and summative). Implications of the two challenges as well as their relation to other core components in the design of any collaborative learning setting (e.g. group constellation) will be discussed.","[{'authorId': '2053491067', 'name': 'H.

Self-compassion and emotional regulation have been identified as constructive attitudes towards the self which can reduce emotional distress. This study is the first to examine the role of a self-compassionate attitude towards the self in reducing symptoms of social anxiety. The study also explored the role of emotional regulation strategies of cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES) as mechanisms that mediate the impact of self-compassion on social anxiety.


DESIGN
Structural equation modelling (SEM) was conducted on cross-sectional correlational data with MPlus version 6.


METHODS
A sample of 750 undergraduate students (378 men and 372 women) completed an online survey comprised of well validated self-report measures of social anxiety, emotional regulation and self-compassion.


RESULTS
Structural equation modelling showed that self-compassion predicted lower social anxiety directly and indirectly through lower ES. Higher self-compassion also predicted higher CR. Contrary to expectation, CR did not predict lower social anxiety. Exploratory analyses of self-compassion divided into Compassionate Self-responding (CSR) and Refraining from Non-compassionate Responding (RUSR) identified RUSR as a predictor of lower social anxiety directly and indirectly via ES and CR. CSR had no direct effect on social anxiety but did so indirectly via CR.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings provide preliminary evidence that self-compassion can play an important role in alleviating social anxiety and that emotion regulation through ES and CR are important mechanisms of that influence.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
Adopting a more compassionate attitude towards the self can reduce the symptoms of social anxiety Emotional regulation through reducing emotional suppression may be a mechanism whereby higher levels of self-compassion reduce symptoms of social anxiety. Although higher levels of self-compassion predict greater use of emotional regulation through cognitive appraisal, cognitive appraisal does not predict levels of symptoms of social anxiety The capacity to refrain from non-compassionate self-responding may reduce symptoms of social anxiety directly and indirectly through lower levels of emotional suppression and greater cognitive reappraisal (CR). However, compassionate self-responding only influences symptoms of social anxiety through CR.","[{'authorId': '34620978', 'name': 'G. Bates'}, {'authorId': '52167054', 'name': 'B.

The data revealed how children individually and collectively engaged with risk in their everyday activities. The children assessed risks in relation to their perceptions of their health as strength and control, negotiated the conditions of playing, and attuned their responses to situations of potential social and physical conflict. In the paper this risk engagement is illustrated in a variety of contexts: children's decisions to wear or not to wear a bicycle helmet; playing and games and routine pushing and shoving at school. In looking after themselves, children negotiate rules of participation and they safeguard personal and collective interests. Gender differences in these processes are addressed and discussed. The article argues that risk engagement is an important resource through which children also learn from their own mistakes. This is a necessary learning process when children engage with their personal health and safety.

There were no significant relations among behavioral self-regulation and social-emotional functioning during the preschool year; however, evidence for bidirectional associations were found between the spring of preschool and the fall of kindergarten. There were no significant relations among behavioral self-regulation and behavior problems at any time point. Finally, there were bidirectional relations among social skills and behavior problems in preschool, but directional relations emerged after this time point.

Both share the features of hierarchical structure, complex sound systems, and sensorimotor sequencing demands, and both are used to convey and influence emotions, among other functions [1]. Both music and speech also prominently use acoustical frequency modulations, perceived as variations in pitch, as part of their communicative repertoire. Given these similarities, and the fact that pitch perception and production involve the same peripheral transduction system (cochlea) and the same production mechanism (vocal tract), it might be natural to assume that pitch processing in speech and music would also depend on the same underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. In this essay we argue that the processing of pitch information differs significantly for speech and music; specifically, we suggest that there are two pitch-related processing systems, one for more coarse-grained, approximate analysis and one for more fine-grained accurate representation, and that the latter is unique to music. More broadly, this dissociation offers clues about the interface between sensory and motor systems, and highlights the idea that multiple processing streams are a ubiquitous feature of neuro-cognitive architectures.","[{'authorId': '1821823', 'name': 'R.

A theoretical model is constructed that links inhibition to 4 executive neuropsychological functions that appear to depend on it for their effective execution: (a) working memory, (b) self-regulation of affect-motivation-arousal, (c) internalization of speech, and (d) reconstitution (behavioral analysis and synthesis). Extended to ADHD, the model predicts that ADHD should be associated with secondary impairments in these 4 executive abilities and the motor control they afford. The author reviews evidence for each of these domains of functioning and finds it to be strongest for deficits in behavioral inhibition, working memory, regulation of motivation, and motor control in those with ADHD. Although the model is promising as a potential theory of self-control and ADHD, far more research is required to evaluate its merits and the many predictions it makes about ADHD.","[{'authorId': '5082316', 'name': 'R.

7a14503cb52d26a2197c82bf40b65771cf54abbd,"Purpose of review In recent years, deficits in emotion regulation have been studied as a putative maintaining factor and promising treatment target in a broad range of mental disorders. This article aims to provide an integrative review of the latest theoretical and empirical developments in this rapidly growing field of research. Recent findings Deficits in emotion regulation appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and treatment of various forms of psychopathology. Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties. Summary Despite some yet to be resolved challenges, the concept of emotion regulation has a broad and significant heuristic value for research in mental health.","[{'authorId': '2581311', 'name': 'M.

The effects of this simulated `human touch' on HRI were examined in the context of viewing a horror film clip. Results suggest that experiences of physical warmth and handholding increase feelings of friendship and trust toward the robot. However, the discrepancy between the expectation of an actual human touch and the mechanical appearance of a robot could result in negative effects.","[{'authorId': '2066549537', 'name': 'Jiaqi Nie'}, {'authorId': '50263312', 'name': 'Michelle Pak'}, {'authorId': '2056555562', 'name': 'Angie Marin'}, {'authorId': '2052856001', 'name': 'S.

We found that after controlling for early achievement, demographic, and home environment variables, only working memory at 54 months significantly predicted working memory at 15 years and that working memory was the only significant EF predictor of achievement at age 15. In contrast, all early achievement measures were significant predictors of later achievement. Furthermore, no demographic or home environment variables at 54 months significantly predicted EF at 15, and only maternal education significantly explained variance in adolescent math and literacy achievement. These findings demonstrate the predictability of working memory and highlight its importance for academic outcomes across development. However, the lack of associations of preschool inhibition and attention measures, after controlling for early achievement, demographic, and home environment variables, to corresponding measures in adolescence suggests the need for more developmentally sensitive measures of EF. Given that the EF measures used in this study are commonly used in educational and psychological research, more care should go into understanding the psychometric properties across development.","[{'authorId': '1387850348', 'name': 'Sammy F.

These techniques are relatively simple exercises that allow happiness seekers to mimic thoughts and behavior of naturally happy people, in order to increase their level of well-being. Because research has shown that the joint use of these exercises increases their effects, practitioners who want to help happiness seekers need validated interventions that combine several of these techniques. To meet this need, we have developed and tested an integrative intervention (Positive Emotion Regulation program – PER program) incorporating a number of validated techniques structured around a theoretical model: the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation. To test the effectiveness of this program and to identify its added value relative to existing interventions, 113 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a 6-week positive emotion regulation pilot program, a loving-kindness meditation training program, or a wait-list control group. Results indicate that fewer participants dropped out from the PER program than from the Loving-Kindness Meditation training. Furthermore, subjects in the PER group showed a significant increase in subjective well-being and life satisfaction and a significant decrease in depression and physical symptoms when compared to controls.

Children with autism have difficulties with social interaction and several studies indicate that they show preference toward interaction with objects, such as computers and robots, rather than with humans. In 1991, Carol Gray developed Social Stories, an intervention tool aimed to increase children’s social skills. Social stories are short scenarios written or tailored for autistic individuals to help them understand and behave appropriately in social situations. This study shows that, in specific situations, the social performance of autistic children improves when using the robot Probo, as a medium for social story telling, than when a human reader tells the stories. The robot tells Social Stories to teach ASD children how to react in situations like saying “hello”, saying “thank you” and “sharing toys”. The robot has the capability of expressing emotions and attention via its facial expressions and its gaze.

Existing systems are mainly based on simplified protocols which qualitatively evaluate subject performance. We propose a robotic coaching platform for training social, motor and cognitive capabilities, with two main contributions: (i) using triadic interactions(adult, robot and child), with robotic mirroring, and (ii) providing quantitative performance indicators. The key system features were accurately designed, including type of protocols, feedback systems and evaluation metrics, contemplating the requirements for applications with ASD children. We implemented two protocols, Robot-Master and Adult-Master, where children performed different gestures guided by the robot or the adult respectively, eventually receiving feedback about movement execution. In both, the robot mirrors the subject during the movement. To assess system functionalities, with a homogeneous group of subjects, tests were carried out with 28 healthy subjects; one preliminary acquisition was done with an ASD child. Data analysis was customized to design protocol-specific parameters for movement characterization. Our tests show that robotic mirroring execution depends on the complexity and standardization of movements, as well as on the robot technical features. The feedback system evaluated movement phases and successfully estimated the completion of the exercises. Future work includes improving platform flexibility and adaptability, and clinical trials with ASD children to test the impact of the robotic coach on reducing symptoms. We trust that the proposed quantitative performance indicators extend the current state-of-the-art towards clinical usage of robotic-based coaching systems.","[{'authorId': '118399629', 'name': 'Laura Santos'}, {'authorId': '26602958', 'name': 'A.

Additionally, while a growing body of research supports self-compassion as a key predictor of psychopathology, understanding of the processes by which self-compassion exerts effects on mental health outcomes is limited. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test an emotion regulation model of self-compassion and stress among psychologists, including postgraduate trainees undertaking clinical work (n = 198). Self-compassion significantly negatively predicted emotion regulation difficulties and stress symptoms. Support was also found for our preliminary explanatory model of self-compassion, which demonstrates the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties in the self-compassion-stress relationship.

The problems children have upon entering foster care can potentially explain prior research findings that frequent placement changes are associated with poor outcomes. This study sought to disentangle this cascading relationship in order to identify the independent impact of placement stability on behavioral outcomes downstream. DESIGN/METHODS. Placement stability over the first 18 months in out-of-home care for 729 children from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being was categorized as early stability (stable placement within 45 days), late stability (stable placement beyond 45 days), or unstable (never achieving stability). Propensity scores predicting placement instability based on baseline attributes were divided into risk categories and added to a logistic regression model to examine the independent association between placement stability and behavioral well-being using the Child Behavior Checklist and temperament scores from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. RESULTS. Half (52%) of the children achieved early stability, 19% achieved later stability, and 28% remained unstable. Early stabilizers were more likely to be young, have normal baseline behavior, have no prior history with child welfare, and have birth parents without mental health problems. After accounting for baseline attributes, stability remained an important predictor of well-being at 18 months. Unstable children were more likely to have behavior problems than children who achieved early stability across every level of risk for instability. Among low-risk children, the probability of behavioral problems among early stabilizers was 22%, compared to 36% among unstable children, showing a 63% increase in behavior problems due to instability alone. CONCLUSIONS. Children in foster care experience placement instability unrelated to their baseline problems, and this instability has a significant impact on their behavioral well-being. This finding would support the development of interventions that promote placement stability as a means to improve outcomes among youth entering care.","[{'authorId': '144179831', 'name': 'D.

This skill is particularly important in social situations, as emotions provide information about the state of relationships and help guide interpersonal decisions, such as whether to disclose personal information. Given the interpersonal difficulties linked to social anxiety disorder (SAD), deficient negative emotion differentiation may contribute to impairment in this population. We hypothesized that people with SAD would exhibit less negative emotion differentiation in daily life, and these differences would translate to impairment in social functioning. We recruited 43 people diagnosed with generalized SAD and 43 healthy adults to describe the emotions they experienced over 14 days. Participants received palmtop computers for responding to random prompts and describing naturalistic social interactions; to complete end-of-day diary entries, they used a secure online website. We calculated intraclass correlation coefficients to capture the degree of differentiation of negative and positive emotions for each context (random moments, face-to-face social interactions, and end-of-day reflections). Compared to healthy controls, the SAD group exhibited less negative (but not positive) emotion differentiation during random prompts, social interactions, and (at trend level) end-of-day assessments. These differences could not be explained by emotion intensity or variability over the 14 days, or to comorbid depression or anxiety disorders. Our findings suggest that people with generalized SAD have deficits in clarifying specific negative emotions felt at a given point of time. These deficits may contribute to difficulties with effective emotion regulation and healthy social relationship functioning.","[{'authorId': '6618929', 'name': 'T.

Studies reporting an association between hearing loss and depression in older adults are conflicting and warrant a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A search of academic databases (e.g., MEDLINE) and gray literature (e.g., OpenGrey) identified relevant articles published up to July 17, 2018. Cross-sectional or cohort designs were included. Outcome effects were computed as odds ratios (ORs) and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42018084494).


RESULTS
A total of 147,148 participants from 35 studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-four studies were cross-sectional and 11 were cohort designs. Overall, hearing loss was associated with statistically significantly greater odds of depression in older adults (OR = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31-1.65). When studies were stratified by design, hearing loss was associated with greater odds of depression in cross-sectional studies (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.31-1.80) and cohort studies (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.16 - 1.67), and there was no difference between cross-sectional or cohort effect estimates (Q = 0.64, p = .42). There was no effect of moderator variables (i.e., hearing aid use) on the association between hearing loss and depression, but these findings must be interpreted with caution. There was no presence of publication bias but certainty in the estimation of the overall effect was classified as ""low.""


DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Older adults may experience increased odds of depression associated with hearing loss, and this association may not be influenced by study or participant characteristics.","[{'authorId': '46301983', 'name': 'Blake J.

The predictive validity of a University of Rhode Island change assessment questionnaire in a heroin-addicted polysubstance abuse sample. Psychology of Addictive Behaviors, 18(2), 106–112. This research looked at the stages-of-change model’s ability to predict outcomes of treatment for polysubstance abusers. It also was designed to examine the effects of severity of drug abuse on treatment outcome. All 96 subjects tested positive for heroin and cocaine and met criteria for opiate (heroin) dependence. They completed the University of Rhode Island’s Change Assessment Questionnaire (URICA) and the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), before beginning one of two treatment trials using buprenorphine and multiple therapies. One group in each trial received vouchers for negative urine samples, the other did not. Outcome measures included treatment retention along with heroin and cocaine negative urines three times a week over 29 weeks, while controlling for demographic variables. The more severe the drug problem (ASI scores) the more likely the subject was in the contemplation stage of change and the less likely that the subject would have a cocaine free urine sample. There was a trend of more female than male subjects in the action stage of change. Subjects with less education were significantly more often in the precontemplation stage of change with a trend towards starting heroin at an earlier age. The older subjects attended more treatment visits and had more heroin negative urine samples. Multiple regression analysis resulted in the maintenance scale of the URICA being predictive of treatment retention and cocaine free urines. An example of a maintenance item in the 32 item URICA is “It worries me that I might slip back on a problem I have already changed so I am here to seek help.” The URICA accounted for a full 10% of variance beyond demographics, severity of substance use and treatment assignment in the regression analysis. Although treatment assignment and substance severity did not contribute significantly to the variance, the stages-of-change scales did contribute to the likelihood of clean heroin urines. Unfortunately, stages-of-change data were not available during or upon completion of treatment, which was recognized as a limitation of the study. None of the univariate analyses were significant for the precontemplation stage of change. The authors conclude that readiness to address drug problems at treatment entry for heroin addicted polysubstance abusers is related to more negative drug screens. They point out the importance of having separate readiness tools for different drugs of abuse. Comment: This study combined two studies that measured the same variables, and was a buprenorphine opioid treatment trial. Few studies of the stages-of-change model have addressed polysubstance abusers. There was significance found in the sample of those more motivated for treatment. This supports the premise that strategies for treatment must address the specific stage of change.

The utilization of a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic framework for categorizing the psychological adjustment of breast cancer (BC) patients has been debated. We wanted to study the prevalence of PTSD and predictors for PTSD. DESIGN. The current study is a one-year follow-up of 64 early BC patients. METHODS. PTSD, subclinical PTSD, delayed onset PTSD and several theory-driven predictive variables were examined. RESULTS. Thirteen per cent of the patients showed full symptoms of disease-related PTSD compared with 7% at the initial study (6 weeks after diagnosis). Considerable changes were observed in all PTSD clusters (intrusion, avoidance, and arousal), in most cases representing a decrease in symptom level. Immature defence style, emotional coping, avoidant behaviour, and negative affectivity were all implicated as predicting variables in a hierarchical multiple regression analysis which explained 65% of the variability of PTSD severity one year after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS. This study highlights the PTSD diagnosis as being highly relevant in oncology settings. Early screening for the above-mentioned four variables may help early identification of the patients most at risk of developing PTSD.","[{'authorId': '152406581', 'name': 'A.

The SCS-SF demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ≥ 0.86 in all samples) and a near-perfect correlation with the long form SCS (r ≥ 0.97 all samples). Confirmatory factor analysis on the SCS-SF supported the same six-factor structure as found in the long form, as well as a single higher-order factor of self-compassion.

An expression or gesture may suggest that the person is engaged in deception without revealing just what is being concealed. Wallace Friesen and I have used the phrase deception clue to distinguish this from those instances in which the mistake provides what we called Zeakage of the concealed information.' Consider the dinner party guest who leaves much earlier than the rest of the guests, telling the host how much he regrets that a very early business meeting the next morning requires that he depart this most enjoyable gathering. Suppose that as the guest says this, he engages in a prolonged hand-tohand manipulation, using one hand to scratch and pick the other. If noticed this could be a deception clue, tipping off the host that the guest is at least quite uncomfortable, and perhaps therefore his excuse should be regarded as false and his enjoyment but a mask. Unless there was leakage, the host would not, however, know the information concealed-why the guest actually was leaving. Was he bored, irritated by the partner the host had assigned to sit next to him, off for a rendevous, or did he not want to miss the next installment of Masterpiece Theater? Confession is not the same as leakage, although confession often follows or is compelled by a very noticeable leakage incident. In confession the betrayal of the concealed information is not unintended or unwitting. Instead, the confessor deliberately gives up the deceptive pretense, volunteering the true information.

7cdb6c5e8cf13caf0303c94bd6ce08a95deddc8f,"Background: Several behaviors, besides psychoactive substance ingestion, produce short-term reward that may engender persistent behavior, despite knowledge of adverse consequences, i.e., diminished control over the behavior. These disorders have historically been conceptualized in several ways. One view posits these disorders as lying along an impulsive-compulsive spectrum, with some classified as impulse control disorders. An alternate, but not mutually exclusive, conceptualization considers the disorders as non-substance or “behavioral” addictions. Objectives: Inform the discussion on the relationship between psychoactive substance and behavioral addictions. Methods: We review data illustrating similarities and differences between impulse control disorders or behavioral addictions and substance addictions. This topic is particularly relevant to the optimal classification of these disorders in the forthcoming fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Results: Growing evidence suggests that behavioral addictions resemble substance addictions in many domains, including natural history, phenomenology, tolerance, comorbidity, overlapping genetic contribution, neurobiological mechanisms, and response to treatment, supporting the DSM-V Task Force proposed new category of Addiction and Related Disorders encompassing both substance use disorders and non-substance addictions. Current data suggest that this combined category may be appropriate for pathological gambling and a few other better studied behavioral addictions, e.g., Internet addiction. There is currently insufficient data to justify any classification of other proposed behavioral addictions. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: Proper categorization of behavioral addictions or impulse control disorders has substantial implications for the development of improved prevention and treatment strategies.","[{'authorId': '145422006', 'name': 'J.

This study examines whether co-teaching has an effect on the teaching experiences of 12 students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 10 students with intellectual disability (ID) as compared with the experiences of the same students in non-co-taught classes. We implemented 264 structured observations in 22 classes to identify students with SEN grouping arrangements, level of engagement, interactions with teachers and peers, and the nature of the interactions. We also conducted 44 structured interviews with co-teachers to compound their perceptions with our observations. 
 
Observational results indicate that co-teaching has a strong effect on students' with SEN level of engagement and on the nature of interactions. The grouping arrangements for these students and their interactions with teachers and peers were slightly different between co-taught and non-co-taught classes. More statistically significant differences were identified between the two conditions for students with ASD than for students with ID. Also, co-teachers reported that co-teaching had a positive effect on students with SEN in all researched variables. Our study concludes that co-teaching has some positive effect on the teaching experiences of students with SEN; nevertheless, there is still scope for improving the employment of co-teaching in Greek mainstream classrooms.

Meanwhile, the research on the factors that influence high school students' online learning engagement is still limited. Objectives Based on the theories of regulatory focus and value control, this study developed a multi-mediation model to investigate whether self-efficacy and academic emotions can mediate the relationship between regulatory focus and online learning engagement. Methods A total of 926 high school student (52.16% female, mean age = 16.47 years) were recruited to participate in this study and completed self-report measures of regulatory focus, online learning engagement, online learning self-efficacy and academic emotions. And we used SPSS macro PROCESS developed by Hayes to examine the mediating role of online learning self-efficacy and academic emotions. Results and Conclusions The results indicated that promotion focus had a stable positive effect on online learning engagement of high school students, whereas prevention focus had a significant negative effect on the same. Self-efficacy and positive emotions had a significant positive mediating effect between promotion focus and online learning engagement.

However, there is no clarity on the impact of the interaction quality between a child with ASD and a robot on the effectiveness of the therapy. Previous research showed that the use of a robot in Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) could be an effective treatment component in diminishing ASD-related symptoms. Further analyzing the data from a randomized controlled trial of PRT treatment, we looked at the long-term effects of child–robot game interactions to see whether the interaction quality changes over time. The attention and the engagement of six children were measured through the observation of non-verbal behavior at three different stages in the treatment that took 20 sessions per child. The gaze and arm/hand behavior of the participants towards the robot, the game, and other present humans were observed. The analysis showed no significant decrease in the attention and the engagement of the children towards the robot and the game. However, the attention and engagement toward the parents of the children increased. We conclude that the main result of sustained attention and engagement with the robot is due to the personalization of the games to meet the specific needs of this user group. These specific needs are met through inclusion of variability to the level of development and personal choice of each participating child. We see the additional finding of increased attention towards the parents as especially positive since the children are expected to improve in human–human interaction as a result of this treatment.","[{'authorId': '2003378087', 'name': 'M.

A developmental framework was used to organize 58 studies of coping involving over 250 age comparisons or correlations with age. The framework was based on (1) conceptualizations of coping as regulation to suggest ages at which coping should show developmental shifts (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2009), and (2) notions of hierarchical families to clarify which coping categories should be distinguished at each age (Skinner, Edge, Altman, & Sherwood, 2003). Developmental patterns in coping (e.g., problem-solving, distraction, support-seeking, escape) were scrutinized with a focus on common age shifts. Two kinds of age trends were discerned, one reflecting increases in coping capacities, as seen in support-seeking (from reliance on adults to more self-reliance), problem-solving (from instrumental action to planful problem-solving), and distraction (adding cognitive to behavioural strategies); and one reflecting improvements in the deployment of different coping strategies according to which ones are most effective in dealing with specific kinds of stressors.

A systematic search has been conducted for required articles which have been published between 1990 and 2015. Only those studies have been included in the review which reported either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression in their findings. Review indicates that individualistic cultures prefer emotional expression to regulate emotions while collectivistic cultures, such as in Pakistan, focus more on expressive suppression. Emotional suppression can cause mental disease, physiological illness, and poor social and psychological adjustment. To sum up, culture predicts whether individuals are motivated to express or suppress their emotions. Collectivist culture encourages greatest control on emotion expression while interacting with family and friends with more emphasis on maintaining social harmony. On the other hand, individualistic culture endorses comparatively less expression of negative emotions especially towards strangers. Adjusting one’s emotion to the social environment is more important in cultural context.","[{'authorId': '114346072', 'name': 'Nosheen Ramzan'}, {'authorId': '35126366', 'name': 'N.

This review considers trust from the organizational, sociological, interpersonal, psychological, and neurological perspectives. It considers how the context, automation characteristics, and cognitive processes affect the appropriateness of trust. The context in which the automation is used influences automation performance and provides a goal-oriented perspective to assess automation characteristics along a dimension of attributional abstraction. These characteristics can influence trust through analytic, analogical, and affective processes. The challenges of extrapolating the concept of trust in people to trust in automation are discussed. A conceptual model integrates research regarding trust in automation and describes the dynamics of trust, the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics. Actual or potential applications of this research include improved designs of systems that require people to manage imperfect automation.","[{'authorId': '1520031837', 'name': 'John D.

In this study we explored psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms) using an online survey platform in a sample of 1781 Spanish adults during the confinement due to COVID-19, relationships between distress and sleep problems, affect, pain, sleep, emotional regulation, gender, type of housing, history of psychopathology, and living alone during the confinement, and differences depending on demographic and psychological variables. Results showed that between 25-39% of the sample referred to clinically significant levels of distress. In addition, women showed higher levels of distress, negative affect, perception of pain, and cognitive reappraisal, and lower levels of emotional suppression and sleep quality than men. A history of psychopathology, being younger, living alone or in a flat was associated with higher distress. Finally, the variables most strongly related to distress were negative and positive affect, levels of pain, sleep quality, and emotional suppression. Our results highlight the important role of emotional suppression, cognitive reappraisal, and loneliness, and the impact of being a woman and younger in Spain during the Covid -19 pandemic. Therefore, it would be necessary to provide assessments of distress levels in these population groups and focus psychological preventive and therapeutic online interventions on expressing emotions and preventing loneliness.","[{'authorId': '113874327', 'name': 'S.

7e01b5c585591c8b12000c6b7a5f5d6a4ca02d8c,"A comprehensive approach, including social and emotional affectations, has been recently proposed as an important framework to understand Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). There is an increasing considerable interest in knowing how language and emotion are related, and as far as we know, the role of the emotional regulation (ER) of parents of children with and without DLD, and their impact on their children’s ER is still unknown. The main aims of this study are to advance our knowledge of ER in school-age children and adolescents with and without DLD, to analyze the predictive value of expressive and receptive vocabulary on ER in school-age children and adolescents, and to explore parental ER and their effect on their children’s and adolescents’ ER. To cover all objectives, we carried out three studies. In the first and second study, expressive and receptive vocabulary were assessed in wave 1, and ER (Emotional Regulation Checklist -ERC- for children and Emotion Regulation Scale -DERS- for adolescents) was assessed in wave 2, 4 years later. Participants in the first study consisted of two groups of school-aged children (13 had DLD and 20 were typically developing children -TD). Participants in the second study consisted of two groups of adolescents (16 had DLD and 16 were TD adolescents). In the third study, the ER of 65 of the parents of the children and adolescents from study 1 were assessed during wave 2 via self-reporting the DERS questionnaire. Results showed no significant differences in ER between DLD and TD groups neither in middle childhood nor in adolescence. Concerning vocabulary and ER, expressive language predicted ER in school-age children but not in adolescents. Finally, parental ER explained their school-age children’s ER, but this was not the case in adolescents. In conclusion, the present data indicated that expressive vocabulary has a fundamental role in ER, at least during primary school years, and adds new evidence of the impact of parents’ ER upon their children’s ER, encouraging educators and speech language pathologists to include parents’ assessments in holistic evaluations and interventions for children with language and ER difficulties.","[{'authorId': '30895408', 'name': 'M.

Interviews were held with academics at both public and private well-established universities and new private universities. The analysis shows a consensus regarding the production of certain public goods such as knowledge, wider access and the promotion of a public sphere. It also reveals a dissensus such that academics at well-established universities tend to maintain a statist view of the public university in which the state plays a key role while academics at new private universities characteristically adopt an individualist view in which the university is detached from the state and more focused on securing social mobility. Drawing on an Archerian framework, it is suggested that these perceptions have been shaped by global, national and especially institutional factors. Critical questions arise concerning the possibility of spaces for new perceptions of the public dimension of universities.","[{'authorId': '1404971224', 'name': 'Carolina Guzmán-Valenzuela'}, {'authorId': '97870972', 'name': 'R.

7e697c481ab3154affaf9a533f5bfadc4689b76e,"Chronic alcoholism is characterized by impaired control over emotionally motivated actions towards alcohol use. Neuropathologically, it is associated with widespread brain structural compromise marked by gray matter shrinkage, ventricular enlargement, and white matter degradation. The extent to which cortical damage itself or cortical disconnection by white matter fiber pathway disruption contribute to deficits in emotion, cognition, and behavior can be investigated with in vivo structural neuroimaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based quantitative fiber tracking. Tractography in alcoholism has revealed abnormalities in selective white matter fiber bundles involving limbic fiber tracts (fornix and cingulum) that connect cortico-limbic-striatal nodes of emotion and reward circuits. Studies documenting brain-behavior relationships support the role of alcoholism-related white matter fiber degradation as a substrate of clinical impairment. An understanding of the role of cortico-limbic fiber degradation in emotional dysregulation in alcoholism is now emerging.","[{'authorId': '2127726', 'name': 'T.

Design: A 60-item version of the questionnaire was developed and completed by 223 participants who also provided information about their hearing health behaviors (help seeking, hearing-aid acquisition, and hearing-aid use). Study sample: Individuals aged between 22 and 90 years recruited from a primary care waiting area at a Veterans hospital. Seventy-six percent were male, 80% were Veterans. Results: A 26-item version of the HBQ with six scales was derived using factor analysis and reliability analyses. The scales measured: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived self-efficacy, and cues to action. HBQ scores differed significantly between individuals with different hearing health behaviors. Logistic regression analyses resulted in robust models of hearing health behaviors that correctly classified between 59% and 100% of participant hearing health behaviors. Conclusions: The HBM appears to be an appropriate framework for examining hearing health behaviors, and the HBQ is a valuable tool for assessing hearing health beliefs and predicting hearing health behaviors.","[{'authorId': '2683821', 'name': 'G.

Our work explores the role of empathy by examining how humans respond to a simple robotic object when asked to strike it. We measure the effects of lifelike movement and stories on people's hesitation to strike the robot, and we evaluate the relationship between hesitation and people's trait empathy. Our results show that people with a certain type of high trait empathy (empathic concern) hesitate to strike the robots. We also find that high empathic concern and hesitation are more strongly related for robots with stories. This suggests that high trait empathy increases people's hesitation to strike a robot, and that stories may positively influence their empathic responses.","[{'authorId': '48891226', 'name': 'K.

7ec52b2c794acbf0dd4bf0208b195c54ee44aeb1,"Recent work in psychology and neuroscience has revealed that moral judgments are often mediated by two classes of brain processes (Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, & Cohen, 2004; Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen, 2001; Haidt, 2001). One class, probably reflecting earlier evolutionary development, consists of processes that automatically alter hedonic states in response to specific types of socially relevant stimuli. A second class consists of more domain-general, effortful processes that underlie abilities for abstract reasoning, simulation, and cognitive control. Often, these intuitive and deliberative processes work in unison to foster decisions in accord with the goals of both; goals that are socially adaptive are often congruent with more abstract moral principles. Certain classes of ethical dilemmas, however, require decisions in which the competition between these two systems becomes evident (Greene et al., 2001, 2004). The structure of such dilemmas often requires endorsing a personal moral violation in order to uphold a utilitarian principle. The well-known footbridge dilemma is illustrative. In it, the lives of five people can be saved through sacrificing another. However, the sacrifice involves pushing a rather large man off a footbridge to stop a runaway trolley before it kills the other five. The vast majority of individuals believe it wrong to push him, even though not pushing him will result in a greater number of deaths (Greene et al., 2004; Thomson, 1986). The reason for this seemingly illogical response stems from competition between the emotionally intuitive and deliberative systems. Neuroimaging has revealed that such dilemmas produce increased activation in emotion-related brain centers, as well as in centers normally used for deliberative reasoning; considering personal moral violations, such as inflicting direct harm, elicits prepotent negative reactions that appear designed to inhibit amoral acts (Greene et al., 2001). The infrequent selection of the logically appropriate option in such dilemmas is associated with heightened activation of deliberative centers aimed at cognitive control, suggesting that the automatic negative reaction must be disregarded if a utilitarian judgment is to bemade (Greene et al., 2004). Given these findings, one might expect that the ultimate arbiter of ethical choice for such dilemmas would reside in individuals’ abilities and motivations to engage in controlled analysis. However, the proposed dual-process model of moral judgment suggests another unexamined route by which choice might be influenced: contextual sensitivity of affect. Affective states stand as momentary informational signals regarding the environment and are multiply determined (Schwarz & Clore, 1996). Consequently, environmental factors separate from any potential moral violations might influence affect at the time of judgment. A close temporal contiguity of such affectively stochastic events and the stable negative emotion stemming from a dilemmamight unhinge the direct relation between a dilemmaspecific prepotent emotional response and choice. Simply put, environment-induced feelings of positivity at the time of judgment might reduce the perceived negativity, or aversion ‘‘signal,’’ of any potential moral violation and, thereby, increase utilitarian responding.","[{'authorId': '49421872', 'name': 'Piercarlo Valdesolo'}, {'authorId': '3034682', 'name': 'David DeSteno'}]",564.0,,7.0,Manipulations of Emotional Context Shape Moral Judgment,2006.0

Given this, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between fear of missing out (FoMO), internet addiction, and psychological symptoms. Based on research demonstrating that FoMO, the pervasive anxiety associated with the feeling that one is missing out others’ satisfying experiences, increases social media engagement, it was expected that FoMO would relate to internet addiction, which in turn would be linked to poor psychological well-being. The sample consisted of 322 undergraduate students who filled out items measuring FoMO, internet addiction and psychological symptoms. The regression analysis revealed that internet addiction acts as a mediator in the link between FoMO and psychological symptoms. That is, the participants’ greater FoMO is linked to higher levels of psychological symptoms both directly and indirectly through a higher level of internet addiction.

People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.","[{'authorId': '7863949', 'name': 'B.

Emotion varies by gender and age of the speaker, location, and cause. This article focuses on the improvement of emotion recognition (ER) from speech using gender-biased influences in emotional expression. The problem is addressed by testing emotional speech with an appropriate specific-gender ER system. As acoustical characteristics vary among the genders, there may not be a common optimal feature set across both genders. Gender-based speech emotion recognition, a two-level hierarchical ER system is proposed, where the first level is gender identification which identifies the gender, and the second level is a gender-specific ER system, trained with an optimal feature set of expressions of a particular gender. The proposed system increases the accuracy of traditional Speech Emotion Recognition Systems (SER) by 10.36% than the SER trained with mixed gender training when tested on the EMO-DB Corpus.","[{'authorId': '7962414', 'name': 'P.

Accreditation pressure and accountability measures are influencing a focus on improving the presentation of competencies aligned to their assessment measures. This study examines the extent to which institutions publicly and proactively disclose relevant information regarding assessment of the general education curriculum, thereby contributing to literature forming robust comparisons of general education assessment practices. It examines the websites of seventy-one higher education institutions, representing a range of public settings in all American regions. Results show variability in the alignment of objectives to measures and reveal current themes and an emphasis regarding how competencies relate to coursework.

Users of SNSs seek social support and validation, often using posts that illustrate how they have changed over time. The purpose of the present research is to examine how the valence and temporal context of an SNS post affect the likelihood of other users providing social support. Participants viewed hypothetical SNS posts and reported their intentions to provide social support to the users. Results revealed that participants were more likely to provide social support for posts that were positive and included temporal context (i.e., depicted improvement over time; Study 1). Furthermore, this research suggests that visual representations of change over time are needed to elicit social support (Study 2). Results are discussed in terms of their practical implications for SNS users and theoretical implications for the literature on social support and social media.","[{'authorId': '46747999', 'name': 'Erin A.

Early studies have shown that the novelty effect of robots and agents quickly wears out and that people change their attitudes and preferences towards them over time. In this paper, we study the role of social presence in long-term human-robot interactions. We conducted a study where children played chess exercises with a social robot over a five week period. With this experiment, we identified possible key issues that should be considered when designing social robots for long-term interactions.","[{'authorId': '39799707', 'name': 'Iolanda Leite'}, {'authorId': '145813496', 'name': 'C.

It has been theorized that differentiating between emotions facilitates effective emotion regulation, but this link has yet to be comprehensively tested. In two experience-sampling studies, we examined how negative emotion differentiation was related to (a) the selection of emotion-regulation strategies and (b) the effectiveness of these strategies in downregulating negative emotion (Ns = 200 and 101 participants and 34,660 and 6,282 measurements, respectively). Unexpectedly, we found few relationships between differentiation and the selection of putatively adaptive or maladaptive strategies. Instead, we found interactions between differentiation and strategies in predicting negative emotion. Among low differentiators, all strategies (Study 1) and four of six strategies (Study 2) were more strongly associated with increased negative emotion than they were among high differentiators. This suggests that low differentiation may hinder successful emotion regulation, which in turn supports the idea that effective regulation may underlie differentiation benefits.","[{'authorId': '3893887', 'name': 'E.

This paper presents an exploratory study that, for the first time, uses the Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT) to assess children's creativity skills in an educational context with a social robot. We investigated whether two key emotional regulation techniques, promotion (approach) and prevention (avoidance), stimulate creativity during a story-telling activity between a child and a robot. We conducted a between-subjects field study with 69 children between the ages of 7 and 9 years old, divided between two study conditions: (1) promotion, where a social robot primes children for action by eliciting positive emotional states, and (2) prevention, where a social robot primes children for avoidance by evoking a states related to security and safety associated with blockage-oriented behaviors. To assess changes in creativity as a response to the priming interaction, children were asked to tell stories to the robot before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the priming interaction. We measured creativity levels by analyzing the verbal content of the stories. We coded verbal expressions related to creativity variables, including fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and originality. Our results show that children in the promotion condition generated significantly more ideas, and their ideas were on average more original in the stories they created in the post-test rather than in the pre-test. We also modeled the process of creativity that emerges during storytelling in response to the robot's verbal behavior. This paper enriches the scientific understanding of creativity emergence in child-robot collaborative interactions.","[{'authorId': '28908289', 'name': 'Maha Elgarf'}, {'authorId': '2052028871', 'name': 'Natalia Calvo-Barajas'}, {'authorId': '1401670338', 'name': 'Patrícia Alves-Oliveira'}, {'authorId': '1556566185', 'name': 'G.

Peers also rated likability. Children's observed reticent activities were related to adults' ratings of high regulation, low externalizing problems, and high asocial behavior, as well as to low anger and low positive emotion. On the other hand, solitary play was associated with low positive emotion and low regulation over time and with high asocial behavior and high peer exclusion.

To collect data, California Preschool Social Competence Scale and Social Skills Rating System were completed by kindergarten teachers. Results The trend analysis shows that both the linear and quadratic trends for verbal facility were statistically significant. Similarly, both the linear and cubic trends were significant for considerateness, and the linear trend tendency was significant for subscales of extraversion, response to unfamiliar and task orientation. Pearson's correlation coefficient yielded a low-to-moderate and negative correlation patterns between social component and problem behaviors. Conclusion The study findings indicate a significant linear trend between the progression in social competence and increasing age, consequently leading to a decrease in social problems for children whose age was from 2 years up to 5 years and 6 months.","[{'authorId': '4093949', 'name': 'Shahrum Vahedi'}, {'authorId': '144981432', 'name': 'F.

The literature establishes that achievement tests do not adequately capture character skills|personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains. Their predictive power rivals that of cognitive skills. Reliable measures of character have been developed. All measures of character and cognition are measures of performance on some task. In order to reliably estimate skills from tasks, it is necessary to standardize for incentives, effort, and other skills when measuring any particular skill. Character is a skill, not a trait. At any age, character skills are stable across different tasks, but skills can change over the life cycle. Character is shaped by families, schools, and social environments. Skill development is a dynamic process, in which the early years lay the foundation for successful investment in later years. High-quality early childhood and elementary school programs improve character skills in a lasting and cost-effective way. Many of them beneficially affect later-life outcomes without improving cognition. There are fewer long-term evaluations of adolescent interventions, but workplace-based programs that teach character skills are promising.

825bfc3bf576e8bd1784d292b3cd93aa3e6d1f10,"IntroductionMaladaptive beliefs, such as irrational cognitions, are regarded as mechanisms underlying psychopathology. Their illogical and inconsistent with reality nature prevent an individual from achieving his/her goals, therefore making the person more vulnerable to psychopathology (Ellis, 1994). Irrational beliefs, and general/core irrational beliefs in particular (e.g., ""When people I like reject me or dislike me, it is because I am a bad or worthless person""), interfere with the processing of activating events (A) (e.g. A break-up), causing specific irrational beliefs (B) (""I am a worthless person"") which result in negative consequences (C) (e.g. distress; depressive mood) (see the ABC model - Ellis, 1994). Therefore, distress is mainly a consequence of irrational thinking.Irrational beliefs have been particularly studied in the ethiopathology of depression. Ellis (1962; 1994) isolated the components of irrationality (i.e., demandingness, awfulizing, self-downing, and catastrophizing) and regarded demandingness (i.e., absolutistic requirements that a person/situation must be in a certain way) and self-downing (i.e., global negative evaluations about oneself) as core vulnerability factors for depression. Studies investigating the association between depression and irrational beliefs have generally found a positive relationship between the two concepts (e.g. Nelson, 1977; Prudhomme & Barron, 1992; Smith, 1989), depressed individuals being indeed more irrational than non-depressed individuals (McDermut et al., 1997). Further evidence comes from longitudinal studies which have shown that irrational beliefs interact with expectancies of failure (Brown, Hammen, Craske and Wickens, 1995; Hankin, Abramson, Miller, and Haeffel, 2004) or stressful events (Kwon and Oei, 1992; Dykman and Johll, 1998) to predict depressive symptoms shortly after the negative event or three months later.It is well known that irrational beliefs are quite commonly experienced (Podina, Uscatescu, & Mogoase, 2013). Yet not everyone with irrational beliefs develops a form of psychopathology. This is partly due to a lack of interaction with stressors (the diathesis-stress model; Zubin & Spring, 1977) and partly due to resilience factors that buffer against psychopathology. Regarding irrational beliefs, there are a limited number of studies on what boosts the ""cognitive immunity"" of irrational individuals against psychopathology and depression, in particular.One of the best known buffers are functional/rational beliefs, which are logical, empirically oriented, and flexible styles of thinking (e.g., ""I would prefer things to be easier, but I can tolerate if they aren't instead"" of ""Things must be more easy""). In the pathway from irrationality to depression, main functional buffers are a preferential style of thinking and unconditional self-acceptance (Davies, 2006). Other known buffers are positive life events (Dixon & Reid, 2000), the internal locus of control (Johnson & Sarason, 1978), perceived social support (Holt & Espelage, 2005), perceived stress level (Kuiper, Olinger & Lyons, 1986), social problem solving abilities (Nezu & Ronan, 1988), and self-esteem (Civitci, 2010). However, these variables have been connected to a wide range of psychopathology, not only depression, and few of them are cognitive in nature.In conclusion, whereas the literature is clear that irrational beliefs predispose to depression, far less is known about the factors that enhance the ""cognitive immunity"" of irrational individuals against depression. In light of recent studies, self-compassion may be a candidate buffer in the pathway from irrational beliefs to depression, given the arguments below.Self-compassion has been defined as the act of being considerate and compassionate towards oneself (Neff, 2003a). There are several studies which attest its beneficial effect on life satisfaction, well-being, optimism and positive affect (Neely, Schallert, Mohammed, Roberts, & Chen, 2009; Neff et al. …","[{'authorId': '4582583', 'name': 'Ioana R.

82806244607ce9a9b0f742dcc7be8a92c7e87f0a,"Previous research suggests that emotional prosody processing is a highly rapid and complex process. In particular, it has been shown that different basic emotions can be differentiated in an early event-related brain potential (ERP) component, the P200. Often, the P200 is followed by later long lasting ERPs such as the late positive complex. The current experiment set out to explore in how far emotionality and arousal can modulate these previously reported ERP components. In addition, we also investigated the influence of task demands (implicit vs. explicit evaluation of stimuli). Participants listened to pseudo-sentences (sentences with no lexical content) spoken in six different emotions or in a neutral tone of voice while they either rated the arousal level of the speaker or their own arousal level. Results confirm that different emotional intonations can first be differentiated in the P200 component, reflecting a first emotional encoding of the stimulus possibly including a valence tagging process. A marginal significant arousal effect was also found in this time-window with high arousing stimuli eliciting a stronger P200 than low arousing stimuli. The P200 component was followed by a long lasting positive ERP between 400 and 750 ms. In this late time-window, both emotion and arousal effects were found. No effects of task were observed in either time-window. Taken together, results suggest that emotion relevant details are robustly decoded during early processing and late processing stages while arousal information is only reliably taken into consideration at a later stage of processing.","[{'authorId': '2515872', 'name': 'S.

There has been a great deal of research on the comorbidity between alcohol abuse or dependence (AAD) and major depression (MD). However, it is unclear whether AAD increases the risk of MD or vice versa.


OBJECTIVE
To examine the associations between AAD and MD using fixed-effects modeling to control for confounding and using structural equation models to ascertain the direction of causality.


DESIGN
Data were gathered during the course of the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a 25-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of children from New Zealand (635 boys, 630 girls).


SETTING
General community sample.


PARTICIPANTS
The analysis was based on a sample of 1055 participants with available data on AAD and MD at ages 17 to 18, 20 to 21, and 24 to 25 years.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Symptom criteria for AAD and MD from the DSM-IV at ages 17 to 18, 20 to 21, and 24 to 25 years as well as measures of life stress, cannabis use, other illicit drug use, affiliation with deviant peers, unemployment, partner substance use, and partner criminality at ages 17 to 18, 20 to 21, and 24 to 25 years.


RESULTS
There were significant (P < .001) pooled associations between AAD and MD. Controlling for confounding factors using conditional fixed-effects models and time-dynamic covariate factors reduced the magnitude of these associations, but they remained statistically significant. Structural equation modeling suggested that the best-fitting causal model was one in which AAD led to increased risk of MD.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that the associations between AAD and MD were best explained by a causal model in which problems with alcohol led to increased risk of MD as opposed to a self-medication model in which MD led to increased risk of AAD.","[{'authorId': '144040154', 'name': 'D.

This shift in thinking is due in large part to the growing evidence for the fundamental role of developmental processes in the generation of the stability and variations in phenotype that researchers in developmental and evolutionary sciences seek to understand. Here I review the tenets of a metatheoretical model of development called probabilistic epigenesis (PE) and explore its implications for furthering our understanding of developmental and evolutionary processes. The PE framework emphasizes the reciprocity of influences within and between levels of an organism's developmental manifold (genetic activity, neural activity, behavior, and the physical, social, and cultural influences of the external environment) and the ubiquity of gene-environment interaction in the realization of all phenotypes.","[{'authorId': '118444314', 'name': 'G.

Research reveals that counselling victims of violent crime may cause psychological symptoms in trauma workers, which in turn may lead to Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS). However, despite this knowledge, there appear to be very few trauma studies that focus on trauma workers. Furthermore there also appears to be a lack of studies that focus on the roles that key variables play in the transmission of STS. Therefore through the analysis of 64 self-report questionnaires, we aim to explore the psychological impact on trauma workers who work with ‘victims’ of violent crimes, specifically focusing on the level of exposure to traumatic material; level of empathy; level of perceived social support and their relation to STS. In order to test these hypotheses, analysis comprised simple statistics, correlations, a t test and a moderate multiple regression. Results indicate that the trauma workers, to some extent, experience symptoms of STS. In addition, it was found that previous exposure to traumatic material (in the personal lives of counsellors), level of empathy, and level of perceived social support have a significant relationship with STS. Social support was not found to have a moderating effect, but empathy emerged as a consistent moderator between the trauma workers' previous exposure to traumatic material and STS.","[{'authorId': '114203301', 'name': 'Victoria MacRitchie'}, {'authorId': '2070688041', 'name': 'S.

To replicate and extend work on the psychometric properties of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), a child and parent self-report instrument used to screen for children with anxiety disorders.


METHOD
The 41-item version of the SCARED was administered to a new sample of 190 outpatient children and adolescents and 166 parents. The internal consistency, discriminant, and convergent validity were assessed. In addition, using discriminant function analysis, a briefer version of the SCARED was developed.


RESULTS
Using item analyses and factor analyses on the 41-item version, 5 factors were obtained: panic/somatic, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, and school phobia. In general, the total score and each of the 5 factors for both the child and parent SCARED demonstrated good internal consistency and discriminant validity (both between anxiety and depressive and disruptive disorders and within anxiety disorders). A reduced version of the SCARED yielded 5 items and showed similar psychometrics to the full SCARED.


CONCLUSIONS
In a new sample, the authors replicated their initial psychometric findings that the SCARED is a reliable and valid instrument to screen for childhood anxiety disorders in clinical settings. Furthermore, pending future research, the 5-item SCARED appears to be a promising brief screening inventory for anxiety disorders in epidemiological studies.","[{'authorId': '5141715', 'name': 'B.

Method This study employed grounded theory as a conceptual framework. Qualitative data were generated based on semistructured interviews conducted with 12 mothers of children who had received speech-language pathology services. Results The following themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) Many mothers reported receiving confusing or irrelevant diagnostic terms for language disorder, (b) mothers of children with language disorders were distressed about their children's language problems, (c) mothers did not always trust or understand their children's speech-language pathologist, and (d) mothers were satisfied with the interventions their child had been receiving. Mothers described their children's language disorder using a total of 23 labels, most of which were not useful for accessing meaningful information about the nature of their child's communication problem. Generally, mothers reported they did not receive language-related diagnostic labels from speech-language pathologists for their child's language disorder. Conclusions Two theories were generated from the results: (a) Lack of information provided to mothers about their child's language disorder causes mothers psychological harm that appears to be long lasting.

Whereas previous research mainly explores interventions that operate on people’s goals (e.g., via goal setting), we explore an intervention that operates on overcoming interfering temptations and nudging self-control success. We report an experiment testing a 1-week smartphone field intervention. Self-control involves anticipating and battling temptation; hence, we encouraged participants in a treatment condition to anticipate temptation (i.e., obstacles) for daily goal pursuit and to envision resolutions. They generated these responses for half the goals they listed daily. Participants in the treatment (anticipation resolution) condition reported more successful pursuit of the daily goals for which they listed obstacles and planned resolutions than for their other goals. We found no such difference between daily goals for participants in a control condition (no anticipation and no resolution) and for participants in an anticipationonly condition. The beneficial effect of listing obstacles and resolutions was further limited to goals that require self-control and are stronger for people with an assessment self-regulatory mode. Finally, participants in the treatment condition reported increased general happiness during the period of the intervention.

As discussed herein, emotion regulation is understood to consist of two component processes, emotion (e.g., positive and negative emotionality) and regulation (e.g., effortful and reactive forms of control), which interact with one another at the behavioral level. Review of work to date suggests that the heterogeneous behavioral category of ADHD may encompass two distinct kinds of inputs: inattentive ADHD symptoms may be primarily associated with breakdowns in the regulation side, whereas hyperactivity-impulsive ADHD symptoms may be associated with breakdowns in the emotionality side. It is argued that breakdowns in control may be a signature for ADHD specifically, while increased negative emotionality may serve as non-specific risk factors for disruptive behavior disorders, explaining their comorbidity. Increased understanding of the interrelations and interactions of component emotion regulation processes may elucidate developmental, sex, and neural mechanisms of ADHD and associated comorbid disruptive disorders.","[{'authorId': '113593812', 'name': 'Michelle M.

Fear and disgust were more frequently reported when participants made deontological choices, whereas regret was more frequently reported when participants made utilitarian choices. In addition, habitual reappraisal negatively predicted deontological choices, and this effect was significantly carried through emotional arousal (Study 2). Individual differences in the habitual use of other emotion regulation strategies (i.e., acceptance, rumination and catastrophising) did not influence moral choice.

It may cause several problems regarding physical, psychological, and social aspects. Cognitive emotion self-regulation is key factor in coping with these issues. This study is aimed to assess the mediating role of psychological hardiness between emotional self-regulation and stress management in breast cancer patients. 
Method: Current study is a cross-sectional study. Study society included women with breast cancer referring to shiraz governmental hospitals including Namazi, Shahid Faghihi and Bualisina Hospitals from which 120 individuals fulfilling inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. This investigation is a descriptive-correlation study in which three questionnaires (psychological hardiness, emotional self-regulation and stress management) were used for data collection. Data was analyzed using statistical methods such as Pearson correlation coefficient and regression using SPSS ver. 24 software. 
Results: Mean age of participants was 45 years in this study (81.7%). Results of regression test revealed a significant relationship between cognitive emotional self-regulation with stress management and cognitive hardiness (P<0.001). Regression results showed that cognitive emotional self-regulation explains 17% and 15% of all changes in cognitive hardiness and stress management. 
Conclusion: Results of this study showed that emotional regulation (disorder in emotional regulation) can directly affect stress management ability. Moreover, increased emotional regulation disorder, reduced psychologic hardiness.

However, little is known about differences in counselor burnout from the counselors' perspective in rural versus urban treatment centers. In 2008, focus group data from 28 rural and urban counselors in a southern state were analyzed, revealing three burnout themes across all counselors: causes, consequences, and prevention. However, there were various differences between rural and urban counselors in subthemes, with only rural counselors citing office politics and low occupational prestige as causes of burnout. Only urban counselors reported responses endorsing the subthemes of role reversal, clients trying to choose their counselors, and changing jobs as consequences of burnout. All counselors cited coworker support, clinical supervision, and self-care as important strategies for managing burnout. In sum, context clearly matters as rural counselors cited more causes of burnout; yet, the implications of burnout are universal in that they often lead to poor quality clinical care. There is a continued need for greater understanding of addiction as a disease, which would reduce stigma, especially in rural areas, as well as increase the prestige and earning potential of the substance abuse counseling occupation.","[{'authorId': '4239295', 'name': 'C.

One aim is to specify this thesis with respect to language development. The empirical investigations show that language is the central means of creating pretence. By explicit metacommunication, children collaboratively negotiate the plot, transform meanings and distinguish fiction from reality. Thus, metacommunication functions as a verbal frame, determining the meanings within play. Thereby children overcome sympraxic language use which is characteristic of toddlers. Another result is that role play changes during the preschool years. The paper argues that these changes can be subsumed under a general developmental phenomenon, namely the transition of interpsychic into intrapsychic processes. A point of special interest is why preschoolers, through role play, can act in the ZPD, although their ability to cooperate with other children is only at a nascent stage. To explain this, the paper discusses several aspects of psychosocial development.","[{'authorId': '2073285770', 'name': 'Helga Andresen'}]",49.0,,53.0,Role Play and Language Development in the Preschool Years,2005.0

They are seen as a ‘global consumer phenomenon’ with an exponential rise in usage within the last few years. Anecdotal case study evidence suggests that ‘addiction’ to social networks on the Internet may be a potential mental health problem for some users. However, the contemporary scientific literature addressing the addictive qualities of social networks on the Internet is scarce. Therefore, this literature review is intended to provide empirical and conceptual insight into the emerging phenomenon of addiction to SNSs by: (1) outlining SNS usage patterns, (2) examining motivations for SNS usage, (3) examining personalities of SNS users, (4) examining negative consequences of SNS usage, (5) exploring potential SNS addiction, and (6) exploring SNS addiction specificity and comorbidity. The findings indicate that SNSs are predominantly used for social purposes, mostly related to the maintenance of established offline networks. Moreover, extraverts appear to use social networking sites for social enhancement, whereas introverts use it for social compensation, each of which appears to be related to greater usage, as does low conscientiousness and high narcissism. Negative correlates of SNS usage include the decrease in real life social community participation and academic achievement, as well as relationship problems, each of which may be indicative of potential addiction.","[{'authorId': '2034264', 'name': 'D.

Whereas pre-21st century learning paradigms catered reasonably well for the pursuit of this moral purpose in turning out school leavers with specialized skills that were applicable in highly compartmentalized and specialized Industrial Age economies, 21st century skills require a new paradigm. In their seminal book entitled 21 st Century Skills: Learning for Life in Our Times, Trilling and Fadel (2009) eloquently elaborate on the essential skills for 21st century learning and occupations. I call the adoption of these essential skills the pedagogical paradigm shift. According to these leaders in the field, the essential skills for 21 st century learning and occupations fall into four domains. First are the core subjects and skills such as the orthodoxy 3Rs that every educated person should have mastery of. Second is the learning and innovations skills domain requiring skills such as critical thinking and problem solving. The third is the career and life skills domain, calling for skills such as collaboration, teamwork and leadership. Fourth, is the digital literacy skills domain, requiring skills such as computer literacy and digital fluency. While computers and digital technologies play a central role in the development and utilization of the skills, the more essential skills for 21st century learning and occupations relate not just to the application of technology but more importantly, to the ability to engage in independent critical thinking, and a high level of problem solving, often using technology. This paper reviews the learning paradigms that have guided pedagogy over the centuries and argues that a shift is needed in pedagogy and curriculum towards a paradigm that emphasizes critical thinking and problem solving as proposed by Trilling and Fadel (2009) within the social connectivist paradigm as well articulated by Siemens rather than the dominant Vygotskyian social constructivist paradigm.","[{'authorId': '70630575', 'name': 'C.

We suggest a research model with the entire stage from the consumer gaze response to the perceived consumer beliefs and further their attitudes toward social robots. Specifically, the eye tracking indicators used in this study are Fixation, First Visit, Total Viewed Stay Time, and Number of Revisits. Also, Areas of Interest are selected to the face, eyes, lips, and full-body of a social robot. In the first relationship, we check which element of the social robot design the consumer’s gaze stays on, and how the gaze on each element affects consumer beliefs. The consumer beliefs are considered as the social robot’s emotional expression, humanness, and facial prominence. Second, we explore whether the formation of consumer attitudes is possible through two major channels. One is the path that the consumer beliefs formed through the gaze influence their attitude, and the other is the path that the consumer gaze response directly influences the attitude. This study made a theoretical contribution in that it finally analysed the path of consumer attitude formation from various angles by linking the gaze tracking reaction and consumer perception. In addition, it is expected to make practical contributions in the suggestion of specific design insights that can be used as a reference for designing social robots.","[{'authorId': '2150288857', 'name': 'Sangjip Ha'}, {'authorId': '2060296400', 'name': 'Eun-ju Yi'}, {'authorId': '66490651', 'name': 'In-jin Yoo'}, {'authorId': '3264128', 'name': 'Do-Hyung Park'}]",1.0,{'name': 'SHS Web of Conferences'},34.0,A Study on the Mechanism of Social Robot Attitude Formation through Consumer Gaze Analysis: Focusing on the Robot Face,2022.0

Language competence (LC) and emotional competence (EC) comprise multiple components. These components and their specific interrelations have not been studied sufficiently.

Five measures represented LC: receptive vocabulary, verbal fluency, literacy, narrative structure, and the narrative use of evaluative devices. Four measures represented EC: expressive emotion vocabulary, declarative emotion knowledge, awareness of mixed emotions, and facial emotion recognition. Results showed strong positive correlations between LC and EC ranging between r = .12 and r = .45. In particular, receptive vocabulary and literacy were closely related to emotion knowledge and awareness of mixed emotions. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed that there is a common general ability factor for LC and EC. We discuss why receptive vocabulary and literacy might be so strongly related to emotion knowledge in school-age children.

Alliance may be particularly pertinent for people with schizophrenia as this group often have a history of interpersonal trauma and relationship difficulties including difficult relationships with mental health staff. This review aimed to determine (a) the quality of therapeutic alliance between people with schizophrenia and their therapists; (b) whether alliance predicts therapeutic outcomes; and (c) variables associated with alliance. Databases were searched from inception up to April 2015. The search yielded 4,586 articles, resulting in 26 eligible studies, involving 18 independent samples. Weighted average client and therapist Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form total scores were 64.51 and 61.26, respectively. There was evidence that alliance predicts overall psychotic symptomatic outcomes and preliminary evidence for alliance predicting rehospitalization, medication use, and self-esteem outcomes. There was evidence for specific client-related factors being linked to different perspectives of alliance. For example, poorer insight and previous sexual abuse were associated with worse client-rated alliance, whereas baseline negative symptoms were associated with worse therapist-rated alliance. Therapist and therapy-related factors, including therapists' genuineness, trustworthiness, and empathy were associated with better client-rated alliance, whereas suitability for therapy, homework compliance, and attendance were associated with better therapist-rated alliance. Key clinical implications include the need to consider alliance from both client and therapist perspectives during therapy and training and supervision to enhance therapist qualities that foster good alliance.

However, the perceived changes in psychological adjustment during home confinement with respect to the period before the pandemic have not been addressed yet. Moreover, little is known about the role of coparenting and specific COVID‐19 contextual variables on parental stress and children's behavioral difficulties in the Italian context. Using a cross‐sectional survey, we collected data on 841 Italian parents of children aged 3–11 years with typical development during the home confinement (20th April–18th May). We analyzed levels of parental stress, coparenting, and child externalizing behaviors before and during the home confinement. Additionally, hierarchical regressions were performed to investigate predictors of parental stress and child externalizing behaviors during the lockdown. Results showed that parental stress (especially in mothers) and child externalizing behaviors increased during the lockdown period. Coparenting was a strong predictor of parental stress, together with being a mother, younger child age, less time dedicated to the child, and scarce feasibility of remote working. Besides, child externalizing behaviors were predicted by male gender, less parental time dedicated to the child, higher parental stress, and child distance learning workload. Our findings indicate a negative impact of COVID‐19 lockdown in both parents and children, suggesting that positive coparenting and time dedicated to children may help to reduce the detrimental effect of pandemic restrictions on family adjustment.","[{'authorId': '1386995068', 'name': 'M.

86ee85e22d0fce9d6cdd8e6eadab7b0045efb9a9,"Video games are a highly heterogeneous form of entertainment. As recent reviews highlight, this heterogeneity makes likely that video games have both positive and negative consequences for child development. This study investigated the associations between gaming frequency and psychosocial health among children younger than 12 years of age, an understudied cohort in this field. Both parents and children reported children's gaming frequency, with parents also reporting on children's psychosocial health. Given that children may be too young to report the time they spend playing video games accurately, children's reports were scaffolded by a developmentally appropriate measure. We further investigated the potential bias of having parents report both their children's gaming frequency and their children's psychosocial health (i.e., a single source bias). Parental reports of children's gaming frequency were higher than their children's reports. However, a direct test of the potential single source bias rendered null results. Notably, however, while parental reports showed negative associations between gaming and psychosocial health, children's reports showed no associations. Specifically, based on parent reports, children's gaming was associated with more conduct and peer problems, and less prosocial behavior. As children's reports produced no associations between gaming and psychosocial health, parental reports in this study may belie an erroneous set of conclusions. We therefore caution against relying on just one reporter when assessing children's gaming frequency.","[{'authorId': '2225758', 'name': 'Adam Lobel'}, {'authorId': '2745623', 'name': 'I.

New York: The Guildford Press. 314 pages. ISBN: 978 1 59385 445 4 If you have stopped by your local bookstore lately, you may have noticed that there is no shortage of self-help books. Parents, in particular, are a vulnerable target audience for quasi-scientific writers aiming to offer anything from childrearing advice to boosting their children's brainpower. The book in question, Smart But Scattered: The Revolutionary ""Executive Skills"" Approach to Helping Kids Reach Their Potential by Peg Dawson and Richard Guare falls within a unique subsection of this self-help/advice giving genre. It promises readers that it ""will show you how you can modify the daily experience of a child aged 4 to 14 to build the executive skills that will make it possible for the child to get on track and get things done"" (p. 2). An attractive sales pitch indeed, without falling into the diagnostic dilemma of targeting only individuals with specific disorders of attention. Instead the authors choose to use a more inclusive approach, where prospective readers may be left wondering who would not benefit from boosting their own powers of self-control and organization, never mind their children's. The authors exude credibility, with Drs. Dawson and Guare reporting to have had over 30 years of field experience working with children who have difficulties with learning, attention, and behavior disorders. Not to diminish Peg Dawson's worthy accomplishments, it is comforting to note that Richard Guare is a neuropsychologist because their book addresses issues of executive functioning in general, and brain-based behavior paradigms in particular. Just so the reader does not confuse ""executive skills"" with preparing their child for life in the corporate world, the authors make it clear that they are referring to ""brain-based skills that are required for humans to execute, or perform tasks"" (p. 13). More specifically, their model is subdivided into a set of 11 developmentally and functionally differentiated skills that range from response inhibition and working memory to flexibility and metacognition. Thankfully you do not need a medical dictionary or neuroscience textbook to gain at least a perfunctory understanding of these 11 skills. The authors provide ample definitions along with corresponding examples to illustrate each skill's meaning and purpose. To simplify matters even more, their model and overall motis operandi for the book is based on two basic principle of learning. The first is an acknowledgement that most individuals have an array of executive skills that range from areas considered to be strengths to those that are less well developed or areas of weakness. Second, the authors rationalize that areas of weakness need to be identified so that intervention plans can be developed. The road to success is a combination of building skills and manipulating the environment so that problems related to skill weaknesses are minimized or prevented. The book itself is divided into three distinct but related sections. The first part promises to explain why you are smart but scattered. A tall order, indeed, but four chapters are all that is needed to identify individual strengths and weaknesses so that one can ""match the child to the task"" (p. …","[{'authorId': '108155717', 'name': 'Tim R.

This is a first exploratory study aimed to analyze and compare the perspectives adopted on reflection (immersion and distancing) of negative experiences across therapy and the relationship between them and depressive symptoms in contrasting therapeutic outcomes of emotion-focused therapy (EFT). Method: Three good-outcomes cases and three poor-outcomes cases of EFT, diagnosed with mild to moderate depression at the beginning of therapy, were randomly selected. Immersion and distancing on negative experiences were analyzed using the measure of immersed and distanced speech. The depressive symptoms were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Results: Significant differences across sessions were only found in the good-outcome cases which showed a significant decrease of immersion and an increase of distancing, and this evolution pattern was found related to the reduction of symptoms. Moreover, at the beginning of therapy, distancing was higher in the poor-outcome cases rather than in the good-outcome cases. Conclusion: The progressive and significant evolution from higher immersion at the initial phase to higher distancing in the final phase may be helpful in EFT for depression.","[{'authorId': '38289083', 'name': 'Eunice Barbosa'}, {'authorId': '144396863', 'name': 'Sara Silva'}, {'authorId': '113139253', 'name': 'J.

Coupled with the rise in popularity and usage, there have been a growing number of reports in the popular press about excessive use of the internet under the guise of “Internet addiction”, “Internet Addiction Disorder” (IAD) and “Internet Addiction Syndrome” (IAS). For instance, in as early as 1995, Newsweek reported that 2% to 3% of the online community have serious “Internet addictions” and spend most of their waking time surfing and chatting in this medium (Hamilton and Kalb, 1995). Although the concept of “Internet addictions” and its derivatives appear to have its supporters in the popular press, there is a form of “knee-jerk scepticism” amongst the academic community not least among those working in the field of addiction research. It is not hard to understand the scepticism shown. For many people, the concept of Internet addiction seems far-fetched particularly if their concepts and definitions of addiction involve the taking of drugs. Despite the predominance of drug-based definitions of addiction, there is now a growing movement which views a number of behaviours as potentially addictive including many behaviours which do not involve the ingestion of a psychoactive drug (e.g. gambling, computer game playing, exercise, sex, and now the Internet). Such diversity has led to new all encompassing definitions of what constitutes addictive behaviour.

This proposal was supported in 4 studies with over 2,000 adolescents and young adults. Study 1 documented a correlation between a self-transcendent purpose for learning and self-reported trait measures of academic self-regulation. Those with more of a purpose for learning also persisted longer on a boring task rather than giving in to a tempting alternative and, many months later, were less likely to drop out of college. Study 2 addressed causality. It showed that a brief, one-time psychological intervention promoting a self-transcendent purpose for learning could improve high school science and math grade point average (GPA) over several months. Studies 3 and 4 were short-term experiments that explored possible mechanisms. They showed that the self-transcendent purpose manipulation could increase deeper learning behavior on tedious test review materials (Study 3), and sustain self-regulation over the course of an increasingly boring task (Study 4).

The key idea of this hypothesis is that decision making is a process that is influenced by marker signals that arise in bioregulatory processes, including those that express themselves in emotions and feelings. This influence can occur at multiple levels of operation, some of which occur consciously and some of which occur non-consciously. Here we review studies that confirm various predictions from the hypothesis. The orbitofrontal cortex represents one critical structure in a neural system subserving decision making. Decision making is not mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex alone, but arises from large-scale systems that include other cortical and subcortical components. Such structures include the amygdala, the somatosensory/insular cortices and the peripheral nervous system. Here we focus only on the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in decision making and emotional processing, and the relationship between emotion, decision making and other cognitive functions of the frontal lobe, namely working memory.","[{'authorId': '1998849', 'name': 'A.

Why do children take risks in spite of the fact that this can be a harmful and even fatal activity? This article aims to explore this issue. Semi-structured interviews of 23 pre-school children aged four and five years were analyzed on the basis of the concepts of paratelic and telic states in Reversal Theory, the paratelic state being an excitement-seeking mode, and the telic state being an anxiety-avoiding mode. The phenomenological structure of children’s risky play was found to be characterized by children expressing the ambiguous nature of quick reversals between the paratelic and telic states, producing both pleasant and unpleasant emotions. This ‘walk on the dangerous edge’ seemed to be one of the primary goals of engaging in risky play. As long as the paratelic state dominated the situation, children embraced the potential fear by arousal-increasing strategies and maintained play. If the telic state dominated the situation, children described arousal-avoidance strategies and ultimately withdrew from play.","[{'authorId': '3909009', 'name': 'E. B. H.

Our research focuses on employing Arash in a pediatric hospital environment to entertain, assist, and educate children with cancer who suffer from physical pain caused by both the disease and its treatment process. Since cancer treatment causes emotional distress, which can reduce the efficiency of medications, using social robots to interact with children with cancer in a hospital environment could decrease this distress, thereby improving the effectiveness of their treatment. Arash is a 15 degree-of-freedom low-cost humanoid mobile robot buddy, carefully designed with appropriate measures and developed to interact with children ages 5–12 years old. The robot has five physical subsystems: the head, arms, torso, waist, and mobile-platform. The robot’s final appearance is a significant novel concept; since it was selected based on a survey taken from 50 children with chronic diseases at three pediatric hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Founded on these measures and desires, Arash was designed, built, improved, and enhanced to operate successfully in pediatric cancer hospitals. Two experiments were devised to evaluate the children’s level of acceptance and involvement with the robot, assess their feelings about it, and measure how much the robot was similar to the favored conceptual sketch. Both experiments were conducted in the form of storytelling and appearance/performance evaluations. The obtained results confirm high engagement and interest of pediatric cancer patients with the constructed robot.","[{'authorId': '145793437', 'name': 'A.

The emotional regulation (ER) strategies that we use determine the way in which we feel, express, and behave. Moreover, ER strategies are particularly important in adolescents, a population for which ER strategy deficits can be linked to the appearance of numerous mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, or disruptive behaviors. Thus, the early detection of dysfunctional ER strategies and training in adaptive ER strategies can help prevent future occurrences of possible behavioral and psychosocial disorders. In this article, the authors present the GameTeen System (GT-System), a novel instrument based on virtual reality and serious games for the assessment and training of ER strategies in adolescents.

8a79ea938bdcef50562ef6cac49978f398e43205,"Higher education (HE) faces the challenge of responding to an increasing diversity. In this context, more attention is being paid to teachers and teaching skills positively related to students learning. Beyond the knowledges identified as key components of an effective teacher, teachers also need to be capable of unraveling what their students think and believe, and how they accommodate the new information. More importantly, teachers need to be able to adapt their own teaching to their audience’s needs. In learners, social cognition (SC) has been related to a better receptivity to the different teacher-student interactions. Since these interactions are bidirectional, SC could also help to explain teachers’ receptiveness to the information available in feedback situations. However, little is known about how SC is related to teacher development, and therefore teaching effectiveness, in HE. In addition, executive functions (EFs), closely related to SC, could play a key role in the ability to self-regulate their own teaching to better answering their students emerging needs. Although there is wide evidence regarding the association of EFs to performance in high demanding settings, as far as we know, there are no studies exploring the relationship between teachers’ EFs and teaching effectiveness in HE. Establishing a positive association between teaching effectiveness and these socio-cognitive functions could be a promising first step in designing professional development programs that promote HE academics’ ability to understand and care about students thoughts and emotions, to eventually adapt their teaching to their students needs for a better learning.","[{'authorId': '47338275', 'name': 'Rut Correia'}, {'authorId': '2230093', 'name': 'G.

Although critical care nurses gain satisfaction from providing compassionate care to patients and patients' families, the nurses are also at risk for fatigue. The balance between satisfaction and fatigue is considered professional quality of life.


OBJECTIVES
To establish the prevalence of compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue in adult, pediatric, and neonatal critical care nurses and to describe potential contributing demographic, unit, and organizational characteristics.


METHODS
In a cross-sectional design, nurses were surveyed by using a demographic questionnaire and the Professional Quality of Life Scale to measure levels of compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction.


RESULTS
Nurses (n = 221) reported significant differences in compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue on the basis of sex, age, educational level, unit, acuity, change in nursing management, and major systems change.


CONCLUSIONS
Understanding the elements of professional quality of life can have a positive effect on work environment. The relationship between professional quality of life and the standards for a healthy work environment requires further investigation. Once this relationship is fully understood, interventions to improve this balance can be developed and tested.","[{'authorId': '49205395', 'name': 'Tara L.

In fact, the narration constructs and organizes temporal frames that connect one's own experiences. From this point of view, oncological illness is experienced as a traumatic experience that interrupts the sense of continuity of one's own life, resulting in the configuration of different temporal frames, which are not always able to support the processes of elaboration of this experience. The aim of this article is to explore the way the modal verbal predicates (must, can, will, know) are organized and work in relation to the representation of time in narrations of cancer patients. The modal verbal predicates—introducing the meanings of possibility, knowledge, will, desire, duty, need, or ability—allow us to organize the relationship between the subject, action, and context. Six narrations of cancer experience were analyzed—one for each time frame (linear, circular, fragmentary, static, cyclic, and spiral) proposed by Brockmeier (2000)—by means of quali-quantitative analysis of the use of modal verbs. Narrations show specific modal positioning: dispersion, plasticity, focusing, rigidity, and poverty. It is possible organize them along a continuum from plasticity to rigidity. The modal plasticity is the capacity to reconfigure a new temporal relation between subject and context, whereas modal rigidity shows a repetition of a specific and same modality in connecting subject and context. This preliminary research allows us to reflect about some possible clinical implications to support and foster processes of meaning making of cancer conditions.","[{'authorId': '3643091', 'name': 'Raffaele De Luca Picione'}, {'authorId': '1656688918', 'name': 'Maria Luisa Martino'}, {'authorId': '4774039', 'name': 'M.

This is the first study to date to examine volumetric alterations in the anterior insula (AI) as a potential biomarker for the course of childhood major depressive disorder (MDD).


OBJECTIVES
To examine whether children with a history of preschool-onset (PO) MDD show reduced AI volume, whether a specific symptom of PO MDD (pathological guilt) is related to AI volume reduction (given the known relationship between AI and guilt processing), and whether AI volumes predict subsequent likelihood of having an episode of MDD.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
In a prospective longitudinal study, 306 children (age range, 3.00-5.11 years) and caregivers completed DSM diagnostic assessments at 6 annual time points during 10 years as part of the Preschool Depression Study. Magnetic resonance imaging was completed on a subset of 145 school-age children (age range, 6.11-12.11 years).


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Whole-brain-adjusted AI volume measured using magnetic resonance imaging at school age and children's diagnosis of MDD any time after their imaging.


RESULTS
Compared with children without a history of PO MDD, school-age children previously diagnosed as having PO MDD had smaller left and right AI volumes (Wilks Λ = 0.94, F2,124 = 3.37, P = .04, Cohen d = 0.23). However, the effect of PO MDD on reduced AI volumes was better explained by children's experience of pathological guilt during preschool (Λ = 0.91, F2,120 = 6.17, P = .003, d = .30). When covarying for children's lifetime history of MDD episodes, their experience of pathological guilt during preschool, as well as their sex and age at the time of imaging, schoolchildren's right-side AI volume was a significant predictor of being diagnosed as having an MDD episode after imaging (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.01-0.75; P = .03).


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
These results provide evidence that structural abnormalities in AI volume are related to the neurobiology of depressive disorders starting in early childhood. The present findings are consistent with mounting research in adult MDD suggesting that insula function and structure may be a target biomarker for major depression.","[{'authorId': '5819070', 'name': 'Andy C.

8c4b36a0dc0c19d192ec8cc7ef0e0e8eb19c6fe5,"CONTEXT
Proneness to overgeneralization of self-blame is a core part of cognitive vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) and remains dormant after remission of symptoms. Current neuroanatomical models of MDD, however, assume general increases of negative emotions and are unable to explain biases toward emotions entailing self-blame (eg, guilt) relative to those associated with blaming others (eg, indignation). Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in healthy participants have shown that moral feelings such as guilt activate representations of social meaning within the right superior anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Furthermore, this area was selectively coupled with the subgenual cingulate cortex and adjacent septal region (SCSR) during the experience of guilt compared with indignation. Despite its psychopathological importance, the functional neuroanatomy of guilt in MDD is unknown.


OBJECTIVE
To use fMRI to test the hypothesis that, in comparison with control individuals, participants with remitted MDD exhibit guilt-selective SCSR-ATL decoupling as a marker of deficient functional integration.


DESIGN
Case-control study from May 1, 2008, to June 1, 2010.


SETTING
Clinical research facility.


PARTICIPANTS
Twenty-five patients with remitted MDD (no medication in 16 patients) with no current comorbid Axis I disorders and 22 controls with no personal or family history of MDD.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Between-group difference of ATL coupling with a priori SCSR region of interest for guilt vs indignation.


RESULTS
We corroborated the prediction of a guilt-selective reduction in ATL-SCSR coupling in MDD vs controls (familywise error-corrected P=.001 over the region of interest) and revealed additional medial frontopolar, right hippocampal, and lateral hypothalamic areas of decoupling while controlling for medication status and intensity of negative emotions. Lower levels of ATL-SCSR coupling were associated with higher scores on a validated measure of overgeneralized self-blame (67-item Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire).


CONCLUSIONS
Vulnerability to MDD is associated with temporofrontolimbic decoupling that is selective for self-blaming feelings. This provides the first neural mechanism ofMDD vulnerability that accounts for self-blaming biases.","[{'authorId': '48330056', 'name': 'Sophie Green'}, {'authorId': '3731590', 'name': 'M. L.

recovery in psychosis. The aim of this paper is to conceptualise recovery, 
through service users’ descriptions of their recovery stories. A 
qualitative approach (interpretive phenomenological analysis) was used to 
guide interviews and analysis of data. Results Eight service users were interviewed about their recovery 
from psychosis. Data analysis revealed four superordinate themes: ‘
impacts on mental health’, ‘self-change and 
adaptation’, ‘social redefinition’ and ‘individualised 
coping mechanisms’. Clinical implications Data indicates that multiple dimensions of 
recovery are all important to individuals when considering their subjective 
experiences of recovery from psychosis. Recovery can only be conceptualised by 
the person making the recovery journey and treatment outcome measures must 
reflect this individuality.","[{'authorId': '145585911', 'name': 'L. Wood'}, {'authorId': '1879159822', 'name': 'Jason P. Price'}, {'authorId': '2043312', 'name': 'A.

Studies (687; 4,946 effects, 49,473 participants) were included that elicited the discrete emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety as independent variables with adults. Consistent with discrete emotion theory, there were (a) moderate differences among discrete emotions; (b) differences among discrete negative emotions; and (c) correlated changes in behavior, experience, and physiology (cognition and judgment were mostly not correlated with other changes). Valence, valence-arousal, and approach-avoidance models of emotion were not as clearly supported. There was evidence that these factors are likely important components of emotion but that they could not fully account for the pattern of results. Most emotion elicitations were effective, although the efficacy varied with the emotions being compared. Picture presentations were overall the most effective elicitor of discrete emotions. Stronger effects of emotion elicitations were associated with happiness versus negative emotions, self-reported experience, a greater proportion of women (for elicitations of happiness and sadness), omission of a cover story, and participants alone versus in groups. Conclusions are limited by the inclusion of only some discrete emotions, exclusion of studies that did not elicit discrete emotions, few available effect sizes for some contrasts and moderators, and the methodological rigor of included studies.","[{'authorId': '5078798', 'name': 'Heather C.

It was hypothesized that children who demonstrated adaptive emotion regulation in pretend play and/or engaged in pretend play with parents would be more proficient at emotion regulation in a wider context. Forty‐seven pre‐school boys and girls, aged 4 to 5 years, and their parents participated. Emotion regulation was assessed in a pretend play context using a negatively valenced event designed to elicit a high level of arousal. Children's responses were categorized according to successfully continuing pretend play and effectively resolving conflict. Children's success in continuing pretend play was related to emotion regulation skills in other contexts, whereas their effectiveness at resolving conflict was not. Children who engaged in pretend play frequently, and who did so with caregivers, had higher ratings of emotion regulation. This study provides some support for the relationship between pretend play and emotion regulation, and emphasizes the need for further research to examine the effects of parent‐child pretend play interaction on the development of emotion regulation skills.","[{'authorId': '4939259', 'name': 'Karma T.

Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was employed among 351 people with schizophrenia and attending the followup service at Jimma University Medical Center, psychiatric clinic during the study period. Participants were recruited using a systematic random sampling method and a sample fraction of two was used after the first person was identified by a lottery method. Data entry was done using EpiData version 3.1 and then exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25 for analysis. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the statistically significant association between quality of life and independent variables. Results Among the four domains of quality of life, respondents scored the lowest mean in the social relationships domain (10.14 ± 3.12). Final adjusted multiple regression model revealed, being divorced was negatively associated with the physical domain (β = −0.72, p = 0.02), having no formal education was negatively associated with physical health domain (β = −0.69, p = 0.001) and age was positively associated with the psychological domain (β = 0.371, p = 0.071). Being rural resident was negatively associated with physical domain (β = −0.48, p = 0.01), with environmental domain (β = −0.64, p = 0.03), with social relationships domain (β = −0.45, p = 0.04), and with overall quality of life (β = −1.93, p = 0.006). Positive symptoms (β = −0.22, p = 0.001), negative symptoms (β = −0.36, p = 0.001), and general psychopathology (β = −0.098, p = 0.006) were inversely associated with overall quality of life. Conclusion In this study, the social relationship domain of quality of life among people with schizophrenia has the lowest mean score.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of a short protocol of music therapy as a tool to reduce stress and improve the emotional state in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.


METHODS
A sample of 25 patients with mild Alzheimer's received therapy based on the application of a music therapy session lasting 60 min. Before and after the therapy, patient saliva was collected to quantify the level of salivary cortisol using the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) immunoassay technique and a questionnaire was completed to measure anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).


RESULTS
The results show that the application of this therapy lowers the level of stress and decreases significantly depression and anxiety, establishing a linear correlation between the variation of these variables and the variation of cortisol.

8d496abd8901df21983938e2c4d86cba96fd8136,"In educational scenarios involving social robots, understanding the way robot behaviors affect children’s motivation to achieve their learning goals is of vital importance. It is crucial for the formation of a trust relationship between the child and the robot so that the robot can effectively fulfill its role as a learning companion. In this study, we investigate the effect of a regulatory focus design scenario on the way children interact with a social robot. Regulatory focus theory is a type of self-regulation that involves specific strategies in pursuit of goals. It provides insights into how a person achieves a particular goal, either through a strategy focused on “promotion” that aims to achieve positive outcomes or through one focused on “prevention” that aims to avoid negative outcomes. In a user study, 69 children (7–9 years old) played a regulatory focus design goal-oriented collaborative game with the EMYS robot. We assessed children’s perception of likability and competence and their trust in the robot, as well as their willingness to follow the robot’s suggestions when pursuing a goal. Results showed that children perceived the prevention-focused robot as being more likable than the promotion-focused robot. We observed that a regulatory focus design did not directly affect trust. However, the perception of likability and competence was positively correlated with children’s trust but negatively correlated with children’s acceptance of the robot’s suggestions.","[{'authorId': '2052028871', 'name': 'Natalia Calvo-Barajas'}, {'authorId': '28908289', 'name': 'Maha Elgarf'}, {'authorId': '1556566185', 'name': 'G.

Some researchers propose that people apply the same social norms to computers as they do to humans, suggesting that social psychological knowledge can be applied to our interactions with computers. In contrast, theories of human–automation interaction postulate that humans respond to machines in unique and specific ways. We believe that anthropomorphism—the degree to which an agent exhibits human characteristics—is the critical variable that may resolve this apparent contradiction across the formation, violation, and repair stages of trust. Three experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints by varying the appearance and behavior of automated agents. Participants received advice that deteriorated gradually in reliability from a computer, avatar, or human agent. Our results showed (a) that anthropomorphic agents were associated with greater trust resilience, a higher resistance to breakdowns in trust; (b) that these effects were magnified by greater uncertainty; and c) that incorporating human-like trust repair behavior largely erased differences between the agents. Automation anthropomorphism is therefore a critical variable that should be carefully incorporated into any general theory of human–agent trust as well as novel automation design.","[{'authorId': '113889522', 'name': 'E.

Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Data were obtained via survey from 276 working adults, and responses were subjected to structural equation modeling to confirm the measurement model and test hypotheses. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Surface acting was found to mediate the relationships between perceptions of organizational politics and intent to turnover and satisfaction, and between proactive personality and intent to turnover and satisfaction. No mediating effect for surface acting was found between agreeableness and the outcomes. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
Individual differences and situational contingencies do affect surface acting in the workplace, and individual work-related outcomes.

The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey was used for each survey to assess the level of academic burnout. The longitudinal data were analysed using latent growth modelling. The results of the study indicated that high initial values (intercept) for emotional exhaustion were associated with a higher rate of increase (slope) in cynicism and academic inefficacy. On the other hand, high initial values for cynicism and academic inefficacy were associated with a lower rate of increase in the other dimensions.

Results In the multivariable analysis, younger maternal age (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.00), financial problems (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.39), maternal mental distress (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16), having older siblings (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.39), increased gestational age at birth (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.07) and male gender (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.42) were risk factors for hospital-attended injuries. Children with impaired gross motor development had a decreased risk of injury (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.99), whereas those with impaired fine motor development had an increased risk (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.97). Shyness was a protective factor (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.98). Children with three reported attention problems had a slightly increased risk of hospital-attended injuries (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.72; p=0.035); otherwise, behaviour was not a significant risk factor. Conclusions This study demonstrated that a wide variety of factors were in play as predictors of injuries in young children. Both child-related factors (gender, gestational age at birth, child motor development, shyness and attention) and familial factors (having older siblings, maternal age, financial difficulties and maternal mental health problems) were associated with injuries in toddlers.","[{'authorId': '5259780', 'name': 'M.

The PD process builds on participants' self-identified issues and concerns, and develops robot concepts according to participants' interpretations of the capabilities and potential applications of robotic technologies. We present methodological insights from an ongoing PD project aimed at designing socially assistive robots with older adults diagnosed with depression and their therapists, and identify remaining challenges in this project. We particularly focus on supporting mutual learning between researchers and participants and on promoting active participation of older adults as “designers” (rather than consumers) as foundational aspects of PD.

8e581ba2594ddce03347ae29590eff1fe3241614,"ABSTRACT Theories of emotion have often maintained artificial boundaries: for instance, that cognition and emotion are separable, and that an emotion concept is separable from the emotional events that comprise its category (e.g. “fear” is distinct from instances of fear). Over the past several years, research has dissolved these artificial boundaries, suggesting instead that conceptual construction is a domain-general process—a process by which the brain makes meaning of the world. The brain constructs emotion concepts, but also cognitions and perceptions, all in the service of guiding action. In this view, concepts are multimodal constructions, dynamically prepared from a set of highly variable instances. This approach obviates old questions (e.g. how does cognition regulate emotion?) but generates new ones (e.g. how does a brain learn emotion concepts?). In this paper, we review this constructionist, predictive coding account of emotion, considering its implications for health and well-being, culture and development.","[{'authorId': '3422257', 'name': 'Katie Hoemann'}, {'authorId': '8914400', 'name': 'Lisa Feldman Barrett'}]",47.0,,120.0,"Concepts dissolve artificial boundaries in the study of emotion and cognition, uniting body, brain, and mind",2018.0

The Addiction Severity Index-Gambling assessed severity of gambling problems at baseline, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up. Compared with behaviorally conditioned (BC) gamblers, emotionally vulnerable (EV) gamblers had higher psychiatric and gambling severity, and were more likely to have a parent with a psychiatric history. Antisocial impulsive (AI) gamblers also had elevated gambling and psychiatric severity relative to BC gamblers. They were more likely to have antisocial personality disorder and had the highest legal and family/social severity scores. They were also most likely to have a history of substance abuse treatment, history of inpatient psychiatric treatment, and a parent with a substance use or gambling problem. AI and EV gamblers experienced greater gambling severity throughout treatment than BC gamblers, but all three subtypes demonstrated similar patterns of treatment response.

The reasons that some smokers find it harder to quit than others are unclear. Understanding how individual differences predict smoking cessation outcomes may allow the development of more successful personalized treatments for nicotine dependence. Theoretical models suggest that drug users might be characterized by increased sensitivity to drug cues and by reduced sensitivity to nondrug-related natural rewards. We hypothesized that baseline differences in brain sensitivity to natural rewards and cigarette-related cues would predict the outcome of a smoking cessation attempt.


METHODS
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we recorded prequit brain responses to neutral, emotional (pleasant and unpleasant), and cigarette-related cues from 55 smokers interested in quitting. We then assessed smoking abstinence, mood, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms during the course of a smoking cessation attempt.


RESULTS
Using cluster analysis, we identified 2 groups of smokers who differed in their baseline responses to pleasant cues and cigarette-related cues in the posterior visual association areas, the dorsal striatum, and the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Smokers who showed lower prequit levels of brain reactivity to pleasant stimuli than to cigarette-related cues were less likely to be abstinent 6 months after their quit attempt, and they had higher levels of negative affect during the course of the quit attempt.


CONCLUSIONS
Smokers with blunted brain responses to pleasant stimuli, relative to cigarette-related stimuli, had more difficulty quitting smoking. For these individuals, the lack of alternative forms of reinforcement when nicotine deprived might be an important factor underlying relapse. Normalizing these pathological neuroadaptations may help them achieve abstinence.","[{'authorId': '2786323', 'name': 'F. Versace'}, {'authorId': '33154579', 'name': 'J.

8f4d6f789e46b9f336bfff0139ebabf9fecdc9cd,"In his first description of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Kanner emphasized emotional impairments by characterizing children with ASD as indifferent to other people, self-absorbed, emotionally cold, distanced, and retracted. Thereafter, emotional impairments became regarded as part of the social impairments of ASD, and research mostly focused on understanding how individuals with ASD recognize visual expressions of emotions from faces and body postures. However, it still remains unclear how emotions are processed outside of the visual domain. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by focusing on impairments of emotional language processing in ASD. We systematically searched PubMed for papers published between 1990 and 2013 using standardized search terms. Studies show that people with ASD are able to correctly classify emotional language stimuli as emotionally positive or negative. However, processing of emotional language stimuli in ASD is associated with atypical patterns of attention and memory performance, as well as abnormal physiological and neural activity. Particularly, younger children with ASD have difficulties in acquiring and developing emotional concepts, and avoid using these in discourse. These emotional language impairments were not consistently associated with age, IQ, or level of development of language skills. We discuss how emotional language impairments fit with existing cognitive theories of ASD, such as central coherence, executive dysfunction, and weak Theory of Mind. We conclude that emotional impairments in ASD may be broader than just a mere consequence of social impairments, and should receive more attention in future research.","[{'authorId': '1801152', 'name': 'Alina Lartseva'}, {'authorId': '143649297', 'name': 'T.

8f5603f1234d0b745e436273dcb023af9aff54e4,"What motives underlie the ways humans interact socially? Are these the same for all societies? Are these part of our nature, or influenced by our environments? Over the last decade, research in experimental economics has emphatically falsified the textbook representation of Homo economicus. Literally hundreds of experiments suggest that people care not only about their own material payoffs, but also about such things as fairness, equity and reciprocity. However, this research left fundamental questions unanswered: Are such social preferences stable components of human nature; or, are they modulated by economic, social and cultural environments? Until now, experimental research could not address this question because virtually all subjects had been university students, and while there are cultural differences among student populations throughout the world, these differences are small compared to the full range of human social and cultural environments. A vast amount of ethnographic and historical research suggests that people's motives are influenced by economic, social, and cultural environments, yet such methods can only yield circumstantial evidence about human motives. Combining ethnographic and experimental approaches to fill this gap, this book breaks new ground in reporting the results of a large cross-cultural study aimed at determining the sources of social (non-selfish) preferences that underlie the diversity of human sociality. The same experiments which provided evidence for social preferences among university students were performed in fifteen small-scale societies exhibiting a wide variety of social, economic and cultural conditions by experienced field researchers who had also done long-term ethnographic field work in these societies. The findings of these experiments demonstrated that no society in which experimental behaviour is consistent with the canonical model of self-interest. Indeed, results showed that the variation in behaviour is far greater than previously thought, and that the differences between societies in market integration and the importance of cooperation explain a substantial portion of this variation, which individual-level economic and demographic variables could not. Finally, the extent to which experimental play mirrors patterns of interaction found in everyday life is traced. The book starts with a succinct but substantive introduction to the use of game theory as an analytical tool and its use in the social sciences for the rigorous testing of hypotheses about fundamental aspects of social behaviour outside artificially constructed laboratories. The results of the fifteen case studies are summarized in a suggestive chapter about the scope of the project.

An additional objective was to contrast the perspectives of the clients and audiologists. Design: Four focus groups were conducted: (1) clients (n = 7) in Denmark, (2) clients (n = 10) in the United Kingdom, (3) audiologists (n = 6) in Denmark, and (4) audiologists (n = 7) in the United Kingdom. Clients owned hearing aids and audiologists had regular contact with clients. The focus group facilitators used a topic guide to generate the participants’ views on optimal hearing aid use. The focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated into English if conducted in Danish, and qualitatively analyzed with content analysis. Results: Both clients and audiologists described optimal hearing aid use as being frequent and regular and driven by the individual needs of the clients. When describing determinants of optimal hearing aid use, both clients and audiologists mentioned the role of the client (e.g., adjustment to hearing aids), the role of the audiologist (e.g., audiologic practice and profession), and the role of the hearing aid (e.g., benefits and limitations of the hearing aid). They both highlighted the importance of client access to information. However, how clients and audiologists described the influence of these determinants varied somewhat. Clients emphasized the role of the hearing aid in achieving optimal hearing aid use. From a client perspective, hearing aids that performed well and had relevant features were most central. In contrast, audiologists emphasized the role of a good client–audiologist relationship in achieving optimal hearing aid use. From the audiologist’s perspective, audiologists who were able to understand the needs of the clients and to instruct clients appropriately were most central. Conclusions: This study highlights similarities and differences in how clients and audiologists describe optimal hearing aid use and its determinants. It is commendable that audiologists acknowledge the importance of the client–audiologist relationship, but given clients’ focus on hearing aids, audiologists might wish to describe more explicitly to their clients how their intervention can extend beyond provision of the optimal hearing aid.","[{'authorId': '1398058151', 'name': 'Ariane Laplante-Lévesque'}, {'authorId': '15850845', 'name': 'L.

The purpose of the present investigation was to examine acoustic voice changes across the life span. Previous voice production investigations used small numbers of participants, had limited age ranges, and produced contradictory results.


METHOD
Voice recordings were made from 192 male and female participants 4-93 years of age. Acoustic measures of fundamental frequency (F0), sound pressure level (SPL), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were made. Coefficients of variation for F0, SPL, and SNR served as measures of variability. Variables were analyzed separately with stepwise regressions, using age and sex as predictors.


RESULTS
Differences in F0 and SNR across the life span were sex specific. Male and female participants demonstrated significant nonlinear trends for F0, but the trends were stronger for male participants. Female participants demonstrated a similar nonlinear trend for SNR, whereas male participants demonstrated linear increases in SNR with age. Variability of F0, SPL, and SNR followed nonlinear trends, higher at younger and older ages.


CONCLUSIONS
Changes in voice production occur throughout the life span, often in a nonlinear way and differently for male and female individuals. Higher variability of acoustic measures of voice in both young and old speakers reflects changes in anatomic structure, physiologic mechanisms, and motor control.","[{'authorId': '39998085', 'name': 'E.

909a2cb5c6e4450d29e77a50b5c6b883de8e21e4,"In this review, we present a new conceptual framework for the study of play behavior, a hitherto puzzling array of seemingly purposeless and unrelated behavioral elements that are recognizable as play throughout the mammalian lineage. Our major new functional hypothesis is that play enables animals to develop flexible kinematic and emotional responses to unexpected events in which they experience a sudden loss of control. Specifically, we propose that play functions to increase the versatility of movements used to recover from sudden shocks such as loss of balance and falling over, and to enhance the ability of animals to cope emotionally with unexpected stressful situations. To obtain this ""training for the unexpected,"" we suggest that animals actively seek and create unexpected situations in play through self-handicapping; that is, deliberately relaxing control over their movements or actively putting themselves into disadvantageous positions and situations. Thus, play is comprised of sequences in which the players switch rapidly between well-controlled movements similar to those used in ""serious"" behavior and self-handicapping movements that result in temporary loss of control. We propose that this playful switching between in-control and out-of-control elements is cognitively demanding, setting phylogenetic and ontogenetic constraints on play, and is underlain by neuroendocrinological responses that produce a complex emotional state known as ""having fun."" Furthermore, we propose that play is often prompted by relatively novel or unpredictable stimuli, and is thus related to, although distinct from, exploration. We present 24 predictions that arise from our new theoretical framework, examining the extent to which they are supported by the existing empirical evidence and contrasting them with the predictions of four major alternative hypotheses about play. We argue that our ""training for the unexpected"" hypothesis can account for some previously puzzling kinematic, structural, motivational, emotional, cognitive, social, ontogenetic, and phylogenetic aspects of play. It may also account for a diversity of individual methods for coping with unexpected misfortunes.","[{'authorId': '152242041', 'name': 'M. Špinka'}, {'authorId': '4072153', 'name': 'R. C.

We explore the relationship between child development, play, and conceptions of risk taking with the aim of informing child injury prevention. Generational trends indicate children’s diminishing engagement in outdoor play is influenced by parental and societal concerns. We outline the importance of play as a necessary ingredient for healthy child development and review the evidence for arguments supporting the need for outdoor risky play, including: (1) children have a natural propensity towards risky play; and, (2) keeping children safe involves letting them take and manage risks. Literature from many disciplines supports the notion that safety efforts should be balanced with opportunities for child development through outdoor risky play. New avenues for investigation and action are emerging seeking optimal strategies for keeping children “as safe as necessary,” not “as safe as possible.” This paradigm shift represents a potential for epistemological growth as well as cross-disciplinary collaboration to foster optimal child development while preserving children’s safety.","[{'authorId': '3511908', 'name': 'M.

A comprehensive literature search identified 150 studies that met inclusion criteria (745 effect sizes; total n = 215,212). Data were analyzed using inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analysis. Mean effect sizes from 55 meta-analyses provided evidence that self-regulation relates to 25 discrete outcomes. Results showed that self-regulation in preschool (∼age 4) was positively associated with social competency, school engagement, and academic performance, and negatively associated with internalizing problems, peer victimization, and externalizing problems, in early school years (∼age 8). Self-regulation in early school years was positively related to academic achievement (math and literacy), and negatively related to externalizing problems (aggressive and criminal behavior), depressive symptoms, obesity, cigarette smoking and illicit drug use, in later school years (∼age 13). Results also showed that self-regulation in early school years was negatively related to unemployment, aggressive and criminal behavior, depression and anxiety, obesity, cigarette smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, and symptoms of physical illness in adulthood (∼age 38). Random effects metaregression identified self-regulation measurement as the most important moderator of pooled mean effects, with task-based assessments and teacher-report assessments often showing stronger associations than parent-report assessments.

The authors provide a brief overview over prominent theories of self-control, identifying implicit assumptions surrounding the effects of self-control that warrant empirical testing. They report the results of a meta-analysis of 102 studies (total N = 32,648) investigating the behavioral effects of self-control using the Self-Control Scale, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and the Low Self-Control Scale. A small to medium positive effect of self-control on behavior was found for the three scales. Only the Self-Control Scale allowed for a fine-grained analysis of conceptual moderators of the self-control behavior relation. Specifically, self-control (measured by the Self-Control Scale) related similarly to the performance of desired behaviors and the inhibition of undesired behaviors, but its effects varied dramatically across life domains (e.g., achievement, adjustment). In addition, the associations between self-control and behavior were significantly stronger for automatic (as compared to controlled) behavior and for imagined (as compared to actual) behavior.","[{'authorId': '145100156', 'name': 'D.

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders vary considerably according to variables such as index subject characteristics, study setting, sampling frame, diagnostic methods used, as well as country of geographic origin. To date, most studies comprise clinical or treatment referral samples in tertiary care or subjects enrolled in clinical trials and genetic cohort collections. Such samples carry the potential for overestimation of both the frequency and severity of psychiatric comorbidity. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases restricted to population-based study publications in the English between May 1, 2015, and May 31, 2020. A comprehensive keyword list was generated to investigate co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. A wide range of DSM-5 based disorders such as anxiety, mood, ADHD, intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorder, eating/feeding, gender dysphoria and sleep-wake disorders were assessed. Initial search revealed a total of 1674 articles after removal of duplicates. Two independent researchers conducted a parallel-blinded screening process to identify the eligible studies based on titles and abstracts; 39 studies were analyzed in the current review. The main findings show prevalence estimates of 22.9% (95% CI: 17.7- 29.2) for intellectual disability; 26.2% (22-31) for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 11.1% (8.6-14.1) for anxiety disorders; 19.7% (11.9-30.7) for sleep disorders; 7% (5.2- 9.3) for disruptive disorders; 2% (1.3- 3.1) for bipolar disorders; 2.7% (1.8- 4.2) for depression; 1.8% (0.4–8.7) for obsessive-compulsive disorder; and 0.6% (0.3–1.1) for psychosis. Psychiatric comorbidity in population-based studies is lower than in clinical and referred samples. However, our results also indicate that the frequency of psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with ASD in the population context is considerable, without the influence of referral bias implicit in clinical and treatment samples. There is a need for better targeted diagnostic tools to detect psychiatric comorbidity in children and youth in future population-based studies, as an essential component in providing care as well as new insights into the nature and mechanisms of its underlying associations.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) posed an unprecedented threat and a great challenge to health professionals in Hong Kong. The study reported here aimed at investigating the origin of stress and psychological morbidity among frontline healthcare workers in response to this catastrophe. Method. Self-administered questionnaires were sent to frontline healthcare workers in three hospitals. The General Health Questionnaire was used to identify psychological distress. Sociodemographic and stress variables were entered into a logistic regression analysis to find out the variables associated with psychological morbidity. Results. The response rate was 40%. Sixty-eight per cent of participants reported a high level of stress. About 57% were found to have experienced psychological distress. The healthcare workers' psychological morbidity was best understood by the perceptions of personal vulnerability, stress and support in the workplace. Conclusion. These findings shed light on the need for hospital administrators to be aware of the extent and sources of stress and psychological distress among frontline healthcare workers during disease outbreak.","[{'authorId': '144308587', 'name': 'C.

How should we organize the myriad ways people attempt to regulate their emotions? We explore the utility of a framework that distinguishes among four fundamental classes of emotion regulation strategies. The framework describes each strategy class in terms their behavioral characteristics, underlying psychological processes and supporting neural systems. A key feature of this multi-level framework is its conceptualization of the psychological processes in terms of two orthogonal dimensions that describe (i) the nature of the emotion regulation goal (ranging from to implicit to explicit) and (ii) the nature of the emotion change process (ranging from more automatic to more controlled). After describing the core elements of the framework, we use it to review human and animal research on the neural bases of emotion regulation and to suggest key directions for future research on emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '2066223876', 'name': 'Laura Martin Braunstein'}, {'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

The mean effect size (r) across studies was .27 (95% confidence interval [.24, .29]), indicating a moderate and statistically significant association between self-regulation and academic skills. The association between IC and academic skills was moderated by type of IC behavior task (i.e., hot vs. cool behavior task), by method of assessing IC (i.e., behavior task vs. parent report), and by academic subject (i.e., literacy vs. math), but not by other methods of assessing IC (i.e., behavior task vs. teacher report, parent report vs. teacher report) or by grade (i.e., preschool vs. kindergarten). The results of this meta-analysis suggest that there are preferred methods for assessing IC (i.e., cool behavior tasks, teacher reports) that should be considered when examining the relations between IC and academic skills in young children.

Setting—Schools, youth clubs, and a holiday activity scheme in the south east of England. Methods—Sixteen focus groups were held with 7–11 year old children. Transcripts of the discussions were analysed using qualitative methods. Results—Children were knowledgeable about injury risks and how to reduce them. They also saw injury prevention as primarily their own responsibility. However, they were also sophisticated in their criticisms of generalised prevention advice, and evaluated safety messages in the light of local environmental and social knowledge. Personal experience was more often reported as a reason for risk reduction than formal prevention advice. Risks for injury were not isolated from other risks faced. Conclusions—Effective educational interventions aimed at changing children's risk behaviour should build more on children's own competence and knowledge of their local environment, and stress the need to manage risks rather than avoid dangers.","[{'authorId': '2134869823', 'name': 'J.

941382ab83547a940686f4d717cf52df442a8003,"Emotional awareness (EA) has been defined as the cognitive skill devoted to the identification and description of one’s own and others’ emotional experiences, an ability that has usually been conceptualized along with the development of cognitive intelligence. Despite this, EA has also been deemed a central constituent of Emotional Intelligence (EI), a construct that captures individual differences in how we perceive, communicate, regulate, and understand our own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. The overlap between the cognitive and the emotional domain in the definition of the EA construct has created several difficulties in both its understanding and its usage, so much so that several questions regarding its nature and structure remain unanswered. The aim of the present work was to test in a unique model the explanatory role of both trait EI and fluid nonverbal intelligence on EA variability in children, controlling for the effect of age, a variable strictly related to cognitive development, as well as gender, which is highly associated with trait EI during childhood. Four hundred and eighty-eight pupils (258 females and 230 males) ranging from 8 to 12 years old completed the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale for Children, the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire – Child Form, and a measure of pure non-verbal reasoning ability, the Raven’s Progressive Matrices. The results of a structural equation model showed a positive explanatory power of both Raven and TEIQue scores on EA, revealing that both cognitive intelligence and trait EI significantly explained EA. The same model also showed an indirect effect of age, via intelligence scores, on EA, suggesting that the increase of EA with age could be partially imputed to the development of intelligence. Finally, a relation between gender and TEIQue scores confirmed higher trait EI scores in girls than in boys. The implications emerging from this model are discussed.","[{'authorId': '5559718', 'name': 'Sergio Agnoli'}, {'authorId': '51109919', 'name': 'Giacomo Mancini'}, {'authorId': '37709767', 'name': 'Federica Andrei'}, {'authorId': '4106541', 'name': 'E.

Emotion recognition is an important aspect of social interactions. Patients suffering from schizophrenia exhibit some disturbances in affective processing. The aim of the study was the evaluation of facial emotion perception and its relation to the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia patients.


METHODS
102 patients with schizophrenia (F20.0, ICD 10) and 50 healthy volunteers participated in the study; all the subjects were 18-60 years old. Psychical condition was assessed with following diagnostic tools: CGI (Clinical Global Impression Scale), PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale), CDSS (Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia), UKU (Side Effect Rating Scale). Facial emotion recognition ability was assessed by SIE-T (Emotional Intelligence Scale - Faces).


RESULTS
On the basis of gathered data it was found that patients suffering from schizophrenia performed worse on facial emotion recognition task compared to the healthy subjects. Severity of negative symptoms corresponded with the facial emotion perception impairment. There was no relation found between age of schizophrenia-onset and level of the facial emotion perception impairment, but the facial emotion recognition ability was worsening with the age of the subjects, both healthy and suffering from schizophrenia.


CONCLUSIONS
Severity of schizophrenia corresponded with the facial emotion perception impairment.","[{'authorId': '39731535', 'name': 'A. Leszczynska'}]",18.0,,39.0,Facial emotion perception and schizophrenia symptoms.,2015.0

However, the relative importance of parenting in different developmental stages, indicative of sensitive periods, has rarely been studied. Therefore, we formulated four hypothetical developmental timing models to test the stage-specific effects of mothering and fathering in terms of parental autonomy and intimacy in infancy, middle childhood, and late adolescence on adolescents’ emotion regulation. The emotion regulation included reappraisal, suppression, and rumination. We hypothesized that both mothering and fathering in each developmental stage contribute unique effects to adolescents’ emotion regulation patterns. The participants were 885 families followed from pregnancy to late adolescence. This preregistered study used data at the children’s ages of 1 year, 7 to 8 years, and 18 years. At each measurement point, maternal and paternal autonomy and intimacy were assessed with self- and partner reports using the Subjective Family Picture Test. At the age of 18 years, adolescents’ reappraisal and suppression were assessed using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and rumination using the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Stage-specific effects were tested comparing structural equation models. Against our hypotheses, the results showed no effects of mothering or fathering in infancy, middle childhood, or late adolescence on adolescents’ emotion regulation patterns. The results were consistent irrespective of both the reporter (i.e., self or partner) and the parental dimension (i.e., autonomy or intimacy). In addition to our main results, there were relatively low agreement between the parents in each other’s parenting and descriptive discontinuity of parenting across time (i.e., configural measurement invariance).

Transition programmes should create an appropriate degree of continuity between preschool and school experiences and develop strategies to help children adjust to school. In addressing these issues, this paper will present findings of a recent study of factors influencing the adjustment of children to the first year of school. Results indicate statistically significant associations between children's adjustment to the first year of school, personal and background factors, transition activities conducted by schools, children's preschool and early school experiences, the absence or presence of a friend, and a number of other factors. Implications for promoting children's adjustment to school will be addressed.","[{'authorId': '72265070', 'name': 'K. Margetts'}]",105.0,,25.0,Transition to school — Complexity and diversity,2002.0
94d8d837b9f2e9627999fa05b9915135cd0aa4ef,"Objective In recent years scientific interest in Internet use disorders, especially among young people, has grown dramatically. Within this contemporary research field, difficulties in regulating emotions have been increasingly explored in association with problematic Internet use (PIU). Indeed, individuals who experience difficulties in emotion regulation might be more exposed to the risk of developing PIU. Therefore, the present study aimed to review the literature from the last ten years focused on the relationship between young people’s emotional dysregulation and PIU, taking into account the main variables involved in this relationship and possible gender-related differences. Method This review included studies published between 2010 and 2020 that were indexed in major databases with the following keywords: emotion regulation, problematic Internet use, Internet addiction, social network addiction, and social media addiction. In the selection process of the studies, close attention was paid for the mean age of the involved samples that had to range between 13 and 25 years. Results A total of 23 studies satisfied the initial inclusion criteria and were included in the present literature review. Several reviewed studies found a strong association between emotion dysregulation and both PIU and problematic social networking with controversial gender-based findings. Furthermore, the relationships among emotional dysregulation, PIU, attachment styles, and metacognitions were largely explored. Conclusions Overall, the present review showed that problematic Internet use might represent a coping strategy to compensate for emotional regulation deficits. The lack of social support and the lack of a good parent-adolescent relationship seem to negatively affect emotional regulation abilities, which in turn increase the risk of developing PIU. Moreover, good metacognitive abilities might represent a protective factor towards emotional dysregulation and PIU. Finally, males with emotional dysregulation are likely to be more problematically engaged in Internet use than females. These results might have important practical implications to implement health prevention/promotion programs, emotion regulation-based training programmes and therapies.","[{'authorId': '46729777', 'name': 'Francesca Gioia'}, {'authorId': '2145468267', 'name': 'Valeria Rega'}, {'authorId': '46214471', 'name': 'Valentina Boursier'}]",37.0,,163.0,Problematic Internet Use and Emotional Dysregulation Among Young People: A Literature Review,2021.0

The paper is based on original analysis of the 2003 Australian survey of disability, aging and carers (SDAC). This analysis shows that hearing loss was associated with an increased rate of non-participation in employment of between 11.3% and 16.6%. Advancing age and the existence of co-morbidities contribute significantly to reduced participation in employment. A disproportionate impact is evident for women and for those having low education and communication difficulties. Controlling for co-morbidities, hearing loss was associated with a 2.1% increase of non-participation in employment, a proportional difference of 1.4 times the population. People with hearing loss were less likely to be found in highly skilled jobs and were over-represented among low income earners. The SDAC data set provides self-report findings on the experience of disability rather than hearing impairment. As such, these findings serve as a conservative estimate of the impact of hearing loss on accessing well-paid employment.","[{'authorId': '4744869', 'name': 'A.

951c951b4b117953ae0086666aea1eda7eb616cf,"This paper explores the power of personality traits both as predictors and as causes of academic and economic success, health, and criminal activity. Measured personality is interpreted as a construct derived from an economic model of preferences, constraints, and information. Evidence is reviewed about the ""situational specificity"" of personality traits and preferences. An extreme version of the situationist view claims that there are no stable personality traits or preference parameters that persons carry across different situations. Those who hold this view claim that personality psychology has little relevance for economics. The biological and evolutionary origins of personality traits are explored. Personality measurement systems and relationships among the measures used by psychologists are examined. The predictive power of personality measures is compared with the predictive power of measures of cognition captured by IQ and achievement tests. For many outcomes, personality measures are just as predictive as cognitive measures, even after controlling for family background and cognition. Moreover, standard measures of cognition are heavily influenced by personality traits and incentives. Measured personality traits are positively correlated over the life cycle. However, they are not fixed and can be altered by experience and investment. Intervention studies, along with studies in biology and neuroscience, establish a causal basis for the observed effect of personality traits on economic and social outcomes. Personality traits are more malleable over the life cycle compared to cognition, which becomes highly rank stable around age 10. Interventions that change personality are promising avenues for addressing poverty and disadvantage.","[{'authorId': '113143672', 'name': 'Mathilde Almlund'}, {'authorId': '5720574', 'name': 'A.

Under comprehensive lockdown and quarantine measures, social life and interpersonal contacts have changed drastically. We explore the extent to which people have adjusted their daily contacts in Taiwan, where the spread of the coronavirus has been minimal and only some potential virus carriers were ordered to quarantine at home. To compare contact patterns across time and between groups, we used longitudinal online surveys and 30-day web-based contact diaries to collect data from a quarantined and a never-quarantined group of people between late March and early May in 2020. Based on individual survey data (N = 298) and diary records (N = 42,102), we first assess the extent and mode of contacts among all participants against a representative sample of Taiwan that was part of the 2017 module of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP), filtering for age and education to make the groups compatible. Then we evaluate how the daily contacts of the quarantined group (N = 140) differed between shortly before quarantine and during quarantine, and between during quarantine and after quarantine. We also compare between the quarantined group, using only after quarantine data, and the never-quarantined group (N = 158). Preliminary findings indicate some major differences and shed new light on how a contact-based approach to social network studies may help pinpoint precise changes in social interactions under complex circumstances during a pandemic.","[{'authorId': '2219973491', 'name': 'Yang-chih Fu'}, {'authorId': '121405609', 'name': 'Hsuan Lee'}]",11.0,,16.0,Daily Contacts Under Quarantine amid Limited Spread of COVID-19 in Taiwan,2020.0

To clarify this, we analyzed remote handshaking in which a robot hand that was attached just under a videoconferencing terminal's display moved according to the opening and closing motion of a conversation partner's hand. Combining touch and video channels raises a question as to whether the partner's action of touching a haptic device should be visible to the user. If it can be invisible, the action may be unnecessary, and a unilaterally controlled device may be enough to establish an effective touch channel. Our analysis revealed that the feeling of being close to the partner can be enhanced by mutual touch in which the partner's action needs to occur but should be invisible.","[{'authorId': '2268916', 'name': 'Hideyuki Nakanishi'}, {'authorId': '2109387734', 'name': 'Kazuaki Tanaka'}, {'authorId': '2057979035', 'name': 'Yuya Wada'}]",110.0,,37.0,Remote handshaking: touch enhances video-mediated social telepresence,2014.0

Automatic engagement detection is necessary in enhancing educational process, there is a lack of out-of-the-box technical solutions. Engagement can be detected while tracing learning-centered affects: interest, confusion, frustration, delight, anger, boredom, and their facial and bodily expressions. Most of the researchers reveal these emotions on video using Facial Action Coding System (FACS). But there doesn’t exist a set of ready-made criteria to detect engagement and many scientists use additional techniques like self-reports, audio-data, physiological indicators and others. In this paper we present a review of most recent researches in the field of automatic affect and engagement detection and present our theoretical model of engagement in educational process based on the learning-centered affects’s detection. Engagement is understood as an affective and cognitive state, accompanying learning process. While reaching optimal engagement students experience various affects, where highly positive and negative feelings mean that a student is close to be engaged in the learning process.","[{'authorId': '2023306923', 'name': 'D.

Research concerning autonomic states corresponding to different emotions has prevailed for several decades. The present study was designed to investigate how specific emotions influence cardiac activities that reflect autonomic responses. Affective videos selected from a standardized Chinese database were used to induce amused, fearful, angry, and neutral emotions, while electrocardiogram and self-rated emotional experiences were recorded. Heart rate was significantly lower in the amused condition than in the angry, fearful and neutral condition. There were no significant differences among the latter three conditions. The root mean square of successive differences, an index of heart rate variability (HRV), was significantly larger in the amused condition than in the fearful, neutral, and angry conditions. It was also significantly larger in the angry condition than in the fearful condition. There were no significant differences between the fearful and neutral, or angry and neutral conditions. These results revealed that: (1) amusement activates the parasympathetic nervous system, and (2) compared with fear, anger is more likely to be linked with parasympathetic activation. We suggest that HRV, rather than the valence dimension (i.e., positive or negative) be regarded as a potential index to discriminate emotions related to approach or avoidance motivation.","[{'authorId': '2145071925', 'name': 'Yan Wu'}, {'authorId': '8712605', 'name': 'Ruolei Gu'}, {'authorId': '50514028', 'name': 'Qiwei Yang'}, {'authorId': '152908543', 'name': 'Yue-jia Luo'}]",35.0,,24.0,"How Do Amusement, Anger and Fear Influence Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability?",2019.0

Using an experience sampling design across 2 work weeks, we found that experiencing incivility earlier in the day reduced one's levels of self-control (captured via a performance-based measure of self-control), which in turn resulted in increased instigated incivility later in the day. Moreover, organizational politics-a stable, environmental factor-strengthened the relation between experienced incivility and reduced self-control, whereas construal level-a stable, personal factor-weakened the relation between reduced self-control and instigated incivility.

The results showed that people’s perceived social support dramatically increased from the pre-pandemic to the peak COVID-19 stage, and remained stable during the decline of COVID-19 stage. In contrast, COVID-19 anxiety decreased from the peak to the decline stage. Further, perceived social support consistently moderated the relationship between loneliness with both chronic anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety. The current study provides initial evidence that perceived social support provides protection for lonely people in daily life as well as during unexpected disasters, which will contribute to finding ways to alleviate lonely people’s anxiety during this global health crisis.","[{'authorId': '1510558868', 'name': 'Jianjie Xu'}, {'authorId': '1634767371', 'name': 'Jingyi Ou'}, {'authorId': '2035642739', 'name': 'Shuyi Luo'}, {'authorId': '2108369879', 'name': 'Zhuojun Wang'}, {'authorId': '6832237', 'name': 'E.

Recent evidence suggests that this mode regulation can be problematic in the context of regulation of emotion elicited by the suffering of others, resulting in reduced emotional connectedness. Here, we investigated the effects of an alternative emotion regulation technique based on the up-regulation of positive affect via Compassion-meditation on experiential and neural affective responses to depictions of individuals in distress, and compared these with the established emotion regulation strategy of Reappraisal. Using fMRI, we scanned 15 expert practitioners of Compassion-meditation either passively viewing, or using Compassion-meditation or Reappraisal to modulate their emotional reactions to film clips depicting people in distress. Both strategies effectively, but differentially regulated experienced affect, with Compassion primarily increasing positive and Reappraisal primarily decreasing negative affect. Imaging results showed that Compassion, relative to both passive-viewing and Reappraisal increased activation in regions involved in affiliation, positive affect and reward processing including ventral striatum and medial orbitfrontal cortex. This network was shown to be active prior to stimulus presentation, suggesting that the regulatory mechanism of Compassion is the stimulus-independent endogenous generation of positive affect.","[{'authorId': '2826066', 'name': 'Haakon G.

The SAM pleasure ratings showed that short and longer film fragments were effective in inducing a longer lasting negative mood, whereas the negative mood induced by the IAPS slideshow was short lived. The induced arousal during the anxious MIPs diminished quickly after the mood induction; nevertheless, the SCL data suggest longer lasting arousal effects for both movies. The decay of the induced mood follows a logarithmic function; diminishing quickly in the first minutes, thereafter returning slowly back to baseline. These results reveal that caution is needed when investigating the effects of the induced mood on a task or the effect of interventions on induced moods, because the induced mood diminishes quickly after the mood induction.","[{'authorId': '2873035', 'name': 'A.

Although cognitive processes are at the center in developing new ideas, they are rarely taken into account in research and development of design support methods and systems. It is conceivable that if one understands how cognitive processes are stimulated to generate design ideas, then more effective methods and tools can be developed to support conceptual design. In this article, a cognitive model of conceptual design is developed to capture the relationships among design entities, design operations, and cognitive processes. A protocol analysis is performed to evaluate the model, and a cognitive experiment carried out to study the creative patterns and stimulating relationships. The results show that designers exhibit patterns of creative design behavior, and that these patterns can be captured and instilled into the design process to promote creativity.","[{'authorId': '117216412', 'name': 'Yan Jin'}, {'authorId': '2098604298', 'name': 'Oren Benami'}]",66.0,,75.0,Creative patterns and stimulation in conceptual design,2010.0

Nadel had previously used an adaptation of the still-face paradigm to demonstrate that children with autism showed more expectant behaviors such as looking and touching an adult stranger after being imitated by that stranger. Our studies are then reviewed showing that children with autism respond more to imitative than contingently responsive adults. After repeated imitation sessions the children showed more distal social behaviors (looking, vocalizing) and proximal social behaviors (moving close to and touching adult). In another study children approached more imitative and playful adults. And, children with autism were more imitative with an imitative adult than with their parents. In the final study reviewed the children showed more joint attention behaviors following imitation including referential looking, gaze following and imitation. This literature suggests, then, that children with autism show more social and imitative behavior when they are imitated, highlighting the importance of imitation as an effective therapy for these children.","[{'authorId': '46370996', 'name': 'T.

Toward answering this question, 81 adults participated in a 20-minute interaction with (a) a humanoid robot (Robovie) interacting in a highly social way as a lab tour guide, and (b) with a human being interacting in the same highly social way. As a baseline comparison, participants also interacted with (c) a humanoid robot (Robovie) interacting in a more rudimentary social way. In each condition, the tour guide asks for the secret keeping behavior. Results showed that the majority of the participants (59%) kept the secret of the highly social robot, and did not tell the experimenter when asked directly, with the robot present. This percentage did not differ statistically from the percentage who kept the human's secret (67%). It did differ statistically when the robot engaged in the more rudimentary social interaction (11%). These results suggest that as humanoid robots become increasingly social in their interaction, that people will form increasingly intimate and trusting psychological relationships with them. Discussion focuses on design principles (how to engender psychological intimacy in human-robot interaction) and norms (whether it is even desirable to do so, and if so in what contexts).

The aim of the present study was to investigate daytime screen use and use of electronic devices before bedtime in relation to sleep. Design A large cross-sectional population-based survey study from 2012, the youth@hordaland study, in Hordaland County in Norway. Setting Cross-sectional general community-based study. Participants 9846 adolescents from three age cohorts aged 16–19. The main independent variables were type and frequency of electronic devices at bedtime and hours of screen-time during leisure time. Outcomes Sleep variables calculated based on self-report including bedtime, rise time, time in bed, sleep duration, sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset. Results Adolescents spent a large amount of time during the day and at bedtime using electronic devices. Daytime and bedtime use of electronic devices were both related to sleep measures, with an increased risk of short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency and increased sleep deficiency. A dose–response relationship emerged between sleep duration and use of electronic devices, exemplified by the association between PC use and risk of less than 5 h of sleep (OR=2.70, 95% CI 2.14 to 3.39), and comparable lower odds for 7–8 h of sleep (OR=1.64, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.96). Conclusions Use of electronic devices is frequent in adolescence, during the day as well as at bedtime. The results demonstrate a negative relation between use of technology and sleep, suggesting that recommendations on healthy media use could include restrictions on electronic devices.","[{'authorId': '4081393', 'name': 'M.

Secretary Thompson has dedicated his professional life to public service, most recently serving as governor of Wisconsin since 1987. He made state history when he was reelected to office for a third term in 1994 and a fourth term in 1998. During his 14 years as governor, Thompson focused on revitalizing Wisconsin's economy. He also gained national attention for his leadership in education and expanded access to health care for low-income residents. Most notably, in 1996 Thompson enacted Wisconsin Works, the state's landmark welfare-to-work legislation, which served as a national model for welfare reform. The program required participants to work and, at the same time, provided services and support to participants to enable them to make the transition to work. As secretary of HHS, Thompson leads the federal government's largest department. With a fiscal year 2001 budget of $429 billion, HHS has the largest budget among cabinet-level departments, representing 23 percent of federal outlays. HHS provides a wide array of services to Americans, including medical and social science research, food and drug safety, Medicaid and Medicare, financial assistance for low-income families, prevention of child abuse and domestic violence, and comprehensive health services for Native Americans. POLICY & PRACTICE recently talked with Secretary Thompson about his views on the public human services. PP * strengthen and modernize Medicare, and include a prescription drug benefit; * reauthorize welfare reform legislation to bring even more people into the job market, while strengthening family structures; * improve foster care and adoption programs to ensure every child has the opportunity to succeed; * enhance the groundbreaking research being done at the National Institutes of Health; * place a new emphasis on preventive care to improve people's lives and save billions in health care dollars; and * create an aggressive program to encourage organ donation and transplants. P&P: Some observers believe you'll be a powerful voice in the Bush Administration for further loosening the reins on states. They offer as evidence the way in which you've approved state Medicaid waivers at warp speed. Can you share your views on that assumption? Thompson: President Bush and I both served as governors, and he is a strong advocate of letting states try new approaches toward providing services to their citizens. It is with the president's full support that Health and Human Services has approved state waivers and amendments for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). We recently cleared up a backlog of more than 400 such requests and, with the states, extended expanded eligibility to more than 1.4 million people and enhanced benefits for about 3.5 million people. P&P: In July, HCFA (the Health Care Financing Administration) was revamped and is now known as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with three new business centers to better serve people's health care needs. …","[{'authorId': '8974068', 'name': 'T.

This research indicates that there are difficulties in assessing young children’s abilities, and there are limitations to the concomitant practice of retention. These challenges have prompted attempts to reconceptualize entry to school as a process of transition. However, transition has variously been conceptualized as: a set of teacher practices in a time‐limited period around school entry; a process of establishing continuity from home to school; and a multi‐layered, multi‐year experience. An analysis of the academic literature from 1990 to 2004 in the USA, Australia/New Zealand and Europe was undertaken to identify trends in the conceptualization of transition to school. The analysis suggests a trend towards more complex understandings of transition emphasizing continuity of children’s experience, partnership with stakeholders, and system coherence across extended time periods.

The onset and progression of graying or canities correlate very closely with chronological aging, and occur in varying degrees in all individuals eventually, regardless of gender or race. Premature canities may occur alone as an autosomal dominant condition or in association with various autoimmune or premature aging syndromes. It needs to be differentiated from various genetic hypomelanotic hair disorders. Reduction in melanogenically active melanocytes in the hair bulb of gray anagen hair follicles with resultant pigment loss is central to the pathogenesis of graying. Defective melanosomal transfers to cortical keratinocytes and melanin incontinence due to melanocyte degeneration are also believed to contribute to this. The white color of canities is an optical effect; the reflection of incident light masks the intrinsic pale yellow color of hair keratin. Full range of color from normal to white can be seen both along individual hair and from hair to hair, and admixture of pigmented and white hair is believed to give the appearance of gray. Graying of hair is usually progressive and permanent, but there are occasional reports of spontaneous repigmentation of gray hair. Studies evaluating the association of canities with osteopenia and cardiovascular disease have revealed mixed results. Despite the extensive molecular research being carried out to understand the pathogenesis of canities, there is paucity of effective evidence-based treatment options. Reports of repigmentation of previously white hair following certain inflammatory processes and use of drugs have suggested the possibility of cytokine-induced recruitment of outer sheath melanocytes to the hair bulb and rekindled the hope for finding an effective drug for treatment of premature canities. In the end, camouflage techniques using hair colorants are outlined.","[{'authorId': '5021487', 'name': 'D. Pandhi'}, {'authorId': '34609223', 'name': 'D.

Purpose: This study investigated the effects of an internet-based self-efficacy intervention (the experimental condition), compared to an education (the active control condition) on STS and SPTG among workers exposed to traumatic events indirectly, through their clients. We hypothesized that the group assignment (experimental vs. control) would affect STS and SPTG indirectly, with a mediating role of self-efficacy beliefs. Methods: Participants were 168 health and human services professionals (78% women), exposed indirectly to a traumatic event at work. They were randomly assigned to either a 4-session internet-based self-efficacy intervention (n = 87) or an education control group (n = 81) which received information about coping resources and consequences of stressors at work or at home. STS, SPTG, and self-efficacy were measured at the baseline (Time 1), 1-month follow-up (Time 2) and 2-month follow-up (Time 3). Results: Analysis of covariance showed that the group assignment had a significant effect on STS (Time 2) and self-efficacy (Time 2), with lower STS and higher self-efficacy reported by the self-efficacy intervention participants. Compared to the experimental group, the active control (education) group participants reported higher SPTG at Time 2. Mediation analyses indicated that the group assignment had indirect effects on STS and SPTG at Time 3. Workers who experienced increases in self-efficacy (Time 2) through the intervention were more likely to report lower STS and higher SPTG at Time 3. Conclusion: Elucidating the mediating processes that explain why an intervention for secondary trauma works is essential in order to develop more effective support systems that promote improved mental health outcomes among health and human services professionals. Prevention programs for workers exposed indirectly to traumatic events may target self-efficacy enhancement and education.","[{'authorId': '6291588', 'name': 'R.

Medicine has learned much from professions that have established programs in simulation for training, such as aviation, the military and space exploration. Increased demands on training hours, limited patient encounters, and a focus on patient safety have led to a new paradigm of education in healthcare that increasingly involves technology and innovative ways to provide a standardized curriculum. A robust body of literature is growing, seeking to answer the question of how best to use simulation in healthcare education. Building on the groundwork of the Best Evidence in Medical Education (BEME) Guide on the features of simulators that lead to effective learning, this current Guide provides practical guidance to aid educators in effectively using simulation for training. It is a selective review to describe best practices and illustrative case studies. This Guide is the second part of a two-part AMEE Guide on simulation in healthcare education. The first Guide focuses on building a simulation program, and discusses more operational topics such as types of simulators, simulation center structure and set-up, fidelity management, and scenario engineering, as well as faculty preparation. This Guide will focus on the educational principles that lead to effective learning, and include topics such as feedback and debriefing, deliberate practice, and curriculum integration – all central to simulation efficacy. The important subjects of mastery learning, range of difficulty, capturing clinical variation, and individualized learning are also examined. Finally, we discuss approaches to team training and suggest future directions. Each section follows a framework of background and definition, its importance to effective use of simulation, practical points with examples, and challenges generally encountered. Simulation-based healthcare education has great potential for use throughout the healthcare education continuum, from undergraduate to continuing education. It can also be used to train a variety of healthcare providers in different disciplines from novices to experts. This Guide aims to equip healthcare educators with the tools to use this learning modality to its full capability.","[{'authorId': '4666150', 'name': 'Ivette Motola'}, {'authorId': '35055310', 'name': 'L.

Direct assessments of executive function, effortful control, and stress response physiology (indexed by resting levels of cortisol and alpha amylase obtained from saliva) were measured at child age 48 months and parents and teachers reported on children's effortful control using temperament rating scales at child age approximately 60 months. Math and reading ability, as measured by the Woodcock-Johnson III applied problems and letter-word subtests, respectively, were measured at prekindergarten through the second grade. Effects for self-regulation measures were seen primarily for initial level and to some extent growth in both mathematics and reading, even when controlling for family demographic characteristics that represent relevant selection factors into higher levels of both self-regulation and academic achievement. These effects persisted for mathematics but not for reading with the inclusion of child cognitive abilities, vocabulary, and speed of processing measured in prekindergarten, concurrent with the first time point for the academic measures. Results are interpreted as indicating a role for self-regulation in learning ability generally, likely through support for attention and reasoning abilities that are most specific to the assessment of mathematics in this analysis. Implications for instruction and for assessment and the best ways to support the development of early math and reading ability for children at risk for school failure are discussed.","[{'authorId': '3381695', 'name': 'C.

This focusing-oriented therapy is based on the assumption that trauma once struck straight into the body, and that it should be processed in the same bodily way that it came in. Dissociative clients generate a defensive, foggy state on top of the fear that has been triggered by a frightening experience. The “embattled person in there” is caught in a split that needs therapeutic assistance. During the first phases of therapy, when the client cannot bear undistorted reality, reconstitution of experiencing can be initiated by experiential body-mapping, a pre-verbal method of investigation that does not address explicitly to traumatic content. Dissociative phenomena will be described, as well as the approaches that I propose they demand.

Premature hair greying may have significant adverse effects on the appearance, self-esteem, and socio-cultural acceptance of the affected individual. The exact aetiopathogenetic mechanism causing premature greying is still not clear and much speculative. Premature canities may appear alone as an autosomal dominant trait or it may occur in association with certain other disorders. The genes Pax3 and MITE play an important role in melanocyte stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Defective melanosomal transfer to the cortical keratinocytes or melanin incontinence due to melanocyte degeneration is also believed to contribute to greying. Despite the extensive molecular research being carried out to understand the pathogenesis of canities, treatment options still remain far from satisfactory and no effective therapy is available.

In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for severe depression. However, biomarkers that accurately predict a response to ECT remain unidentified.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether certain factors identified by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are able to predict ECT response.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
In this nonrandomized prospective study, gray matter structure was assessed twice at approximately 6 weeks apart using 3-T MRI and voxel-based morphometry. Patients were recruited through the inpatient service of the Department of Psychiatry, University of Muenster, from March 11, 2010, to March 27, 2015. Two patient groups with acute major depressive disorder were included. One group received an ECT series in addition to antidepressants (n = 24); a comparison sample was treated solely with antidepressants (n = 23). Both groups were compared with a sample of healthy control participants (n = 21).


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Binary pattern classification was used to predict ECT response by structural MRI that was performed before treatment. In addition, univariate analysis was conducted to predict reduction of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score by pretreatment gray matter volumes and to investigate ECT-related structural changes.


RESULTS
One participant in the ECT sample was excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 participants (27 men and 40 women; mean [SD] age, 43.7 [10.6] years). The binary pattern classification yielded a successful prediction of ECT response, with accuracy rates of 78.3% (18 of 23 patients in the ECT sample) and sensitivity rates of 100% (13 of 13 who responded to ECT). Furthermore, a support vector regression yielded a significant prediction of relative reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. The principal findings of the univariate model indicated a positive association between pretreatment subgenual cingulate volume and individual ECT response (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x = 8, y = 21, z = -18; Z score, 4.00; P < .001; peak voxel r = 0.73). Furthermore, the analysis of treatment effects revealed a increase in hippocampal volume in the ECT sample (MNI coordinates x = -28, y = -9, z = -18; Z score, 7.81; P < .001) that was missing in the medication-only sample.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
A relatively small degree of structural impairment in the subgenual cingulate cortex before therapy seems to be associated with successful treatment with ECT. In the future, neuroimaging techniques could prove to be promising tools for predicting the individual therapeutic effectiveness of ECT.","[{'authorId': '1810485', 'name': 'R.

Previous research supports the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) to train a variety of specific skills (i.e., riding a bus or crossing the street) as well as more complex social skills, such as emotion recognition and functional communication. The present reports the implementation of a VR-based air travel functional communication activity in five children diagnosed with ASD. Using an iPhone X and Google Cardboard device, researchers delivered the VR intervention once per week for 3 weeks to each participant. During these interventions, researchers measured activity completion ability on a 4-point scale. At week 4, all children participated in a real-world air travel rehearsal at the San Diego International Airport. Parents were asked to rate their child's air travel abilities before week 1 and after week 4. All children improved their air travel skills from pre- to postintervention, reflected in both the researchers' and parents' observations. All children navigated the real-world airport under their own power. This preliminary report suggests the efficacy of VR to teach basic air travel skills to young children diagnosed with autism.

However, no studies have yet been performed to assess their effect in children while waiting for emergency room consultations. Objective This study aims to assess the impact of SRs on managing stress in children waiting for an emergency room procedure through the assessment of salivary cortisol levels. Methods This was an open randomized clinical trial in children attending a pediatric emergency department. Children accessing the emergency room were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) playing with a NAO SR, (2) playing with a study nurse, or (3) waiting with parents. The salivary cortisol levels of all children were measured through a swab. Salivary cortisol levels before and after the intervention were compared in the 3 groups. We calculated the effect size of our interventions through the Cohen d-based effect size correlation (r). Results A total of 109 children aged 3-10 years were enrolled in the study, and 94 (86.2%) had complete data for the analyses. Salivary cortisol levels significantly decreased more in the group exposed to robot interaction than in the other two groups (r=0.75). Cortisol levels decreased more in girls (r=0.92) than in boys (r=0.57). Conclusions SRs are efficacious in decreasing stress in children accessing the emergency room and may be considered a tool for improving emotional perceptions of children and their families in such a critical setting.

Without doubt, this question is immediately comprehensible to any committed teacher in virtually any country in the world, and most teachers are likely to want concrete answers to the question, not only as a theoretical puzzle, but in relation to their immediate practices. If one were to look to scientific psychology and educational research for advice in relation to this practical problem, what would the answer(s) look like? This simple question raises several profound problems. Normative and political issues about the goals of instruction and the resources available for realizing these goals must be resolved. A theory of learning that can explain how intellectual capabilities are developed is needed. If instruction is not viewed as an end in itself, then a theory about the relationship between specific subject matter instruction and its consequences for psychological development is also needed. This last problem was the main tension against which Vygotsky developed his well-known concept of zone of proximal development , so that the zone focused on the relation between instruction and development, while being relevant to many of these other problems. Vygotsky's concept of zone of proximal development is more precise and elaborated than its common reception or interpretation. The main purpose of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive introduction to and interpretation of this concept, along with comments about predominant contemporary interpretations. The chapter concludes with some perspectives and implications derived from the interpretation presented here.","[{'authorId': '2952493', 'name': 'S.

Using an experience-sampling approach, we therefore sought to investigate positive and negative emotionality, emotion regulation strategies, and functioning among remitted individuals with bipolar I disorder (BD; n = 31) compared with both healthy controls (CTL; n = 32) and remitted individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 21). Hierarchical linear modeling analyses of self-report data spanning a 6-day consecutive period revealed that the BD group aligned with the CTL group in reporting greater positive emotionality than the MDD group, but aligned with the MDD group in reporting greater negative emotionality than the CTL group. Furthermore, the BD and MDD groups reported greater general use of emotion regulation strategies than the CTL group. These findings suggest that BD is characterized by amplified emotionality as well as increased efforts to regulate emotions in everyday life. Discussion focuses on implications for BD, as well as identification of unique (disorder-specific) and shared (transdiagnostic) features of emotion disturbance.","[{'authorId': '2667598', 'name': 'J.

99be49597eaf5512162996e09ebc326257db4f0e,"Recently there has been extensive discussion of the construct of emotion-related regulation, including its conceptualization, measurement, and relation to developmental outcomes. Definitions of the construct vary, but in general emotion-related regulation refers to processes used to manage and change if, when, and how one experiences emotions and emotion-related motivational and physiological states, and how emotions are expressed behaviorally. It is accomplished in diverse ways, notably through attentional and planning processes, inhibition or activation of behavior, and management of the external context. 
 
Children’s emotion-related regulation (labeled herein regulation) is increasingly viewed as a core skill relevant to many aspects of their socio-emotional and cognitive functioning. A recent Academy of Science committee concluded that “the growth of self-regulation is a cornerstone of early childhood development that cuts across all domains of behavior” (Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000, p. 3). Similarly, in a report funded by the National Institutes of Health concerning risk factors for academic and behavioral problems at the beginning of school, Huffman, Mehlinger, and Kerivan (2000) concluded that emotion regulation is critical for children’s competence. 
 
Like the members of the National Academy of Science committee, we believe that regulatory skills, including those involved in managing emotions and their expression, are central to many aspects of children’s functioning. However, children’s emotion-related regulation and other early developing abilities likely influence one another while they are emerging. In this chapter, we discuss links between children’s regulation and two emerging skills: language and emotion understanding. In addition, we review findings on the relation of all three of these constructs to developmental outcomes that have infrequently been studied in relation to regulation: school readiness and academic skills. Finally, we propose a heuristic model for the interrelations among these variables, a model that has implications for research and for interventions with young people.","[{'authorId': '15102546', 'name': 'N.

Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, 2002,xii+232 pp. Reviewed by Santoi Leung Teachers College, Columbia University Given the diversity and number of disciplines topic that take an interest in the social aspects of language use, providing an interdisciplinary perspective on this would be a challenging prospect for many scholars. Holtgraves, a social psy- chologist, meets this challenge in an admirable fashion. The book's stated aim, as outlined in the introductory chapter The Social Bases of Language and Linguistic Underpinnings of Social Behavior, social action is to approach the topic of language use as is from an interdisciplinary viewpoint, and the material covered an impressive, wide ranging synthesis of research from the fields of philosophy, lin- guistics, sociolinguistics, pragmatics, anthropology, and cognitive and social psy- chology. Fundamental to the approach taken is the reciprocal relationship between language and social context: ignored and is How the social dimensions of language cannot be how social psychological processes are mediated by language. A chapter devoted to each of five major themes of language use: language as action, lan- guage as interpersonal action, language as contextualized action, language as co- ordinated action, and language as thoughtful action. Chapter One, Speech Acts and Intentions: The Things We mental insight in explicating the Do With Words, reviews the core aspects of speech act theory, starting with Austin's (1962) funda- pragmatic function of language, and moving onto a description of Searle's (1969) speech act taxonomy and felicity conditions. A discussion that may be of more interest to those already familiar with the basic is tenets of speech act theory intentionality. e.c. how hearers recognize literal illocutionary force is a problematic issue, particularly in the case of indirect speech acts, where the intended illocutionary force differs from the illocutionary force. Two contrasting approaches are considered: those that e.g., assume inferential processing, Grice's (1975) theory of conversational implicatures, and those that suggest a direct or idiomatic approach to recognition. Holtgraves observes that illocutionary less than illocutionary force force interpretation has been studied tion, much produc- and regards this lack of attention paid to the hearer as a deficit in speech act theory's social credentials. Language as interpersonal action is addressed in the next two chapters.

99cdf87269994a426ddcc9b3901c620c4959254e,"Introduction Greying of hair is an inevitable phenomenon that occurs commonly as a person ages. It usually occurs in the fourth decade regardless of gender but now a days, even people in their early twenties can experience premature greying. The objective of our study was to determine the frequency of premature greying of hair and its impact on the socio-cultural spheres of life and self-esteem of medical students. Methodology It is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at Foundation University Medical College (FUMC) from January to February 2017. All medical students of FUMC who gave their consent were included in the study sample. Students who were absent or unwilling to participate were excluded. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire, which was then analysed using SPSS version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results Out of 673 students, 210 (31.2%) suffered from premature greying of hair. The prevalence was higher among females (155/73.8%) as compared to males (55/26.2%). There was a statistical difference in perception of both the genders, regarding those with premature greying of hair trying to hide it (p-value = 0.000), premature greying of hair as contagious (p-value = .009) and the affected looking older than their actual age (p-value = 0.036). Conclusion The study showed that premature greying affected the socio-cultural spheres of students’ lives. Females were more prone to developing premature greying of hair. Genetics also play a significant role in the phenomenon. No positive correlation was found by using Rosenberg Self-esteem scale.","[{'authorId': '50576031', 'name': 'Muhammad Saad'}, {'authorId': '34754853', 'name': 'N.

In this context, it is increasingly common for preschool schools to incorporate students with special educational needs, including those with Down syndrome. These inclusion cases have been sparsely documented, so an investigation was proposed whose main objective was to know the characteristics of the teaching practice of those who work with these students. This approach was generated from four dimensions: personal, interpersonal, institutional and didactic. A qualitative research perspective and case study method were adopted. Three educators with experience in inclusion to students with Down syndrome participated. The technique used was the semi-structured interview, the data were categorized inductively. It was identified that teachers: have conceptual clarity in inclusive education and barriers to learning and participation; are looking for continuous training spaces for a relevant practice; emphasize the leadership as favorable for an inclusive education; its didactic planning privileges learning for life with the use of teaching materials; emphasize the importance of taking care of the student's location in the classroom, as well as following work routines; develop a qualitative evaluation of learning and promote collaborative work with parents and regular classroom support services. The research allows teachers to analyze efforts to attend students with relevance, through the self-training and support of the school community.","[{'authorId': '2126895139', 'name': 'Nayeli Lormendez Trujillo'}, {'authorId': '2126917748', 'name': 'Amanda Cano Ruíz'}]",3.0,,61.0,"Educación inclusiva de preescolares con síndrome de Down: la mirada de un grupo de educadoras de Veracruz, México",2020.0

Concepts such as the therapeutic alliance speak directly to the importance of activating the attachment system, normally in relation to the therapist in individual therapy and in relation to other family members in family-based intervention, if therapeutic progress is to be made. In group therapy the attachment process may be activated by group membership. The past decade of neuroscientific research has helped us to understand some key processes that attachment entails at brain level. The article outlines this progress and links it to recent findings on the relationship between the neural systems underpinning attachment and other processes such as making of social judgments, theory of mind, and access to long-term memory. These findings allow intriguing speculations, which are currently undergoing empirical tests on the neural basis of individual differences in attachment as well as the nature of psychological disturbances associated with profound disturbances of the attachment system. In this article, we explore the crucial paradoxical brain state created by psychotherapy with powerful clinical implications for the maximization of therapeutic benefit from the talking cure.","[{'authorId': '3177814', 'name': 'P.

Analysis of Drosophila and other insects has unlocked new opportunities to elucidate the behavioral phenotypes of fundamentally emotional phenomena. Here we propose an integrative model of basic emotions based on observations of this animal model. The basic emotions are internal states that are modulated by neuromodulators, and these internal states are externally expressed as certain stereotypical behaviors, such as instinct, which is proposed as ancient mechanisms of survival. There are four kinds of basic emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, and anger, which are differentially associated with three core affects: reward (happiness), punishment (sadness), and stress (fear and anger). These core affects are analogous to the three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue) in that they are combined in various proportions to result in more complex “higher order” emotions, such as love and aesthetic emotion.

However, tangibility, growth of the firm and food inflation are found insignificantly positively related to profitability. Similarly, an insignificant negative relationship is observed between debt to equity ratio of firm and its profitability. Empirical results provide evidence that the profitability of food sector is shaped by firm specific factors and not macroeconomic variables. One important limitation of study is that it only considers one macroeconomic factor i.e. food inflation.

SC has become a potential treatment target due to its association with functional outcomes. An alternative method of assessment is to administer an observer-based scale incorporating an informant's “first hand” impressions in ratings. Methods. The present study used the Observable Social Cognition: A Rating Scale (OSCARS) in 62 outpatients and 50 non-psychiatric controls (NPCs) to assess performance in domains of SC (e.g. emotion perception, theory of mind). Results. The OSCARS demonstrated sufficient internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Construct validity was assessed through an exploratory factor analysis. Patient OSCARS indices were not significantly correlated with measures of SC with the exception of aggressive attributional style. Individuals with less impairment in SC reacted more aggressively to ambiguous situations. NPC OSCARS were significantly correlated with measures of theory of mind and attributional style. In a combined sample of patients and controls, six of eight items were significantly correlated with the SC task assessing the same domain, providing modest evidence of convergent validity. In patients, the OSCARS was significantly correlated with measures of functional outcome and neurocognition. Last, the OSCARS was found to be significantly associated with functional outcome after the influence of objective measures of SC was statistically removed. Conclusions. The present study provides preliminary evidence that the OSCARS may be useful for clinicians in collecting data about patients’ potential real-world SC deficits, in turn increasing the degree to which these impairments may be targeted in treatment.","[{'authorId': '4288412', 'name': 'K.

We report the second phase of a study using an online Delphi method to address these issues. In the first phase, we focused on criteria for language disorder. Here we consider terminology. Methods The Delphi method is an iterative process in which an initial set of statements is rated by a panel of experts, who then have the opportunity to view anonymised ratings from other panel members. On this basis they can either revise their views or make a case for their position. The statements are then revised based on panel feedback, and again rated by and commented on by the panel. In this study, feedback from a second round was used to prepare a final set of statements in narrative form. The panel included 57 individuals representing a range of professions and nationalities. Results We achieved at least 78% agreement for 19 of 21 statements within two rounds of ratings. These were collapsed into 12 statements for the final consensus reported here. The term ‘Language Disorder’ is recommended to refer to a profile of difficulties that causes functional impairment in everyday life and is associated with poor prognosis. The term, ‘Developmental Language Disorder’ (DLD) was endorsed for use when the language disorder was not associated with a known biomedical aetiology. It was also agreed that (a) presence of risk factors (neurobiological or environmental) does not preclude a diagnosis of DLD, (b) DLD can co‐occur with other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. ADHD) and (c) DLD does not require a mismatch between verbal and nonverbal ability.

We therefore propose a pragmatic, linear view of communication design for social robots that corresponds to a sender–receiver perspective. Our framework is based on Lasswell’s 5Ws of mass communication: Who, says what, in which channel, to whom, with what effect. We extend and adapt this model to communication in HRI. In addition, we point out that, besides the predefined communicative acts of a robot, other characteristics, such as a robot’s morphology, can also have an impact on humans, since humans tend to assign meaning to every cue in robots’ behavior and appearance. We illustrate the application of the extended framework to three different studies on human–robot communication to demonstrate the incremental value as it supports a systematic evaluation and the identification of similarities, differences, and research gaps. The framework therefore offers the opportunity for meta-analyses of existing research and additionally draws the path for future robust research designs for studying human–robot communication.","[{'authorId': '2159680516', 'name': 'Laura Kunold'}, {'authorId': '2904379', 'name': 'L.

METHODS A total of 9544 individuals more than 19 years of age were selected from three counties in central Iran. The presence of DM and HTN were asked from participants. We defined treatment adherence (compliance) based on agreement of individual’s self-report behavior with recommendations from a physician. RESULTS Awareness about DM and HTN was 82.6% and 49.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that odds ratio (OR) of high to low stress level was lower than one for both “usage of medication” and “following exercise regimen” in diabetics even after adjustment for either “age and sex” or “age, sex and education”. In hypertensive patients, OR of high to low stress level was lower than one for “usage of medication” even after adjustment for either “age and sex” or “age, sex and education” and also lower than one for “following exercise regimen” only as crude index. CONCLUSION Cases with higher stress level had lower compliance for accepting either medication or exercise as a treatment option for their DM or HTN.","[{'authorId': '2851200', 'name': 'H.

Second, the analysis of each grade’s student records covered at least a six-year period, creating a statewide longitudinal study. Third, access to the state juvenile justice database allowed the researchers to learn about the school disciplinary history of youth who had juvenile records. Fourth, the study group size and rich datasets from the education and juvenile justice systems made it possible to conduct multivariate analyses. Using this approach, the researchers could control for more than 80 variables, effectively isolating the impact that independent factors had on the likelihood of a student’s being suspended and expelled, and on the relationship between these disciplinary actions and a student’s academic performance or juvenile justice involvement.","[{'authorId': '119209523', 'name': 'Dottie Carmichael'}, {'authorId': '152355372', 'name': 'Eric A.

However, changes in healthcare delivery coupled with concerns about lack of objectivity or standardization of clinical examinations lead to the introduction of the ‘simulated patient’ (SP). SPs are now used widely for teaching and assessment purposes. SPs are usually, but not necessarily, lay people who are trained to portray a patient with a specific condition in a realistic way, sometimes in a standardized way (where they give a consistent presentation which does not vary from student to student). SPs can be used for teaching and assessment of consultation and clinical/physical examination skills, in simulated teaching environments or in situ. All SPs play roles but SPs have also been used successfully to give feedback and evaluate student performance. Clearly, given this potential level of involvement in medical training, it is critical to recruit, train and use SPs appropriately. We have provided a detailed overview on how to do so, for both teaching and assessment purposes. The contents include: how to monitor and assess SP performance, both in terms of validity and reliability, and in terms of the impact on the SP; and an overview of the methods, staff costs and routine expenses required for recruiting, administrating and training an SP bank, and finally, we provide some intercultural comparisons, a ‘snapshot’ of the use of SPs in medical education across Europe and Asia, and briefly discuss some of the areas of SP use which require further research.","[{'authorId': '145780443', 'name': 'J.

We review research suggesting that repeated media exposure to community crisis can lead to increased anxiety, heightened stress responses that can lead to downstream effects on health, and misplaced health-protective and help-seeking behaviors that can overburden health care facilities and tax available resources. We draw from work on previous public health crises (i.e., Ebola and H1N1 outbreaks) and other collective trauma (e.g., terrorist attacks) where media coverage of events had unintended consequences for those at relatively low risk for direct exposure, leading to potentially severe public health repercussions.

Specifically, we investigated whether higher school achievement by girls in comparison to boys can be explained by self-regulation. German and mathematics achievement were assessed in a sample of 53 German fifth graders (19 boys, 34 girls) using formal academic performance tests (i.e., reading, writing, mathematics) and teachers' ratings (i.e., grades in German and mathematics). Moreover, teachers rated children's behavior regulation using the Self-Control Scale (SCS-K-D). Children's self-reported strategies of emotion regulation were assessed with the Questionnaire for the Measurement of Stress and Coping in Children and Adolescents (SSKJ 3-8). Age and intelligence (CFT 20-R) were included as control variables. Analyses of mean differences showed that girls outperformed boys in German achievement and behavior regulation. Regression analyses, using a bootstrapping method, revealed that relations between gender and German achievement were mediated by behavior regulation. Furthermore, we found a suppression effect of behavior regulation on the relation between gender and mathematics achievement: boys' mathematics achievement was underestimated when the analyses did not control for behavior regulation. We discuss these results from a developmental perspective and within the theoretical framework of self-regulation and achievement.","[{'authorId': '2066501970', 'name': 'M.

It also considers the moderating role of two contextual resources and one personal resource (i.e., supervisor transformational leadership, knowledge sharing with peers, and resilience) and argues that they buffer the negative relationship between perceptions of organizational politics and organizational citizenship behavior. Data from a Mexican-based manufacturing organization reveal that perceptions of organizational politics reduce organizational citizenship behavior, but the effect is weaker with higher levels of transformational leadership, knowledge sharing, and resilience. The buffering role of resilience is particularly strong when transformational leadership is low, thus suggesting a three-way interaction among perceptions of organizational politics, resilience, and transformational leadership. These findings indicate that organizations marked by strongly politicized internal environments can counter the resulting stress by developing adequate contextual and personal resources within their ranks.","[{'authorId': '13205213', 'name': 'D.

The goal was to identify methods used, determine their value for design of robots with older adults, and provide guidance for best practices. Background Assistive robots may promote aging-in-place and quality of life for older adults. However, the robots must be designed to meet older adults’ specific needs and preferences. PD and other user-centered methods may be used to engage older adults in the robot development process to accommodate their needs and preferences and to assure usability of emergent assistive robots. Method This targeted review of HRI PD studies with older adults draws on a detailed review of 26 articles. Our assessment focused on the HRI methods and their utility for use with older adults who have a range of needs and capabilities. Results Our review highlighted the importance of using mixed methods and including multiple stakeholders throughout the design process. These approaches can encourage mutual learning (to improve design by developers and to increase acceptance by users). We identified key phases used in HRI PD workshops (e.g., initial interview phase, series of focus groups phase, and presentation phase). These approaches can provide inspiration for future efforts. Conclusion HRI PD strategies can support designers in developing assistive robots that meet older adults’ needs, capabilities, and preferences to promote acceptance. More HRI research is needed to understand potential implications for aging-in-place. PD methods provide a promising approach.","[{'authorId': '145912604', 'name': 'W.

Recent advances in neuroimaging and molecular genetics hold promise for drawing together different levels of analysis of the emergence and growth of self-regulation. In this article, we review research relevant to our approach to understanding self-regulation, beginning with an examination of the temperament construct of Effortful Control (EC). We trace the development of EC and its links to an anatomically defined attentional network and identify genes that may contribute to individual differences in the efficiency of this network. We also report on how intervention may influence a central component of self-regulation, the executive attention network. Although much more work remains to be done, we believe that the importance of the questions addressed and the recent progress in understanding self-regulation make this a very exciting area of research.","[{'authorId': '4597920', 'name': 'M.

Past work with pandemic outbreaks suggests that media attention can increase anxiety and compensatory behaviors. Social isolation can lead to increase in online communication and parents who use social media may be affected by other people's emotions online through what is known as digital emotion contagion (DEC). The current study aimed to examine the role of DEC in the relationship between stress, concern about COVID-19, parental burnout and emotion regulation (ER). Methods: In April 2020, an online survey was advertised in Social Media Parenting Groups and published on FIU Psychology online research system SONA. Data were analyzed using correlational analysis, linear and multiple linear regression, and moderation analysis. Results: Concern about COVID-19 predicted stress, depression, and parental burnout. Susceptibility to DEC significantly increased the impact of stress on parental burnout. Having relatives infected with COVID-19 increased the effect of DEC on parental burnout. A higher level of ER buffered the relationship between emotion contagion and concern about COVID-19. Conclusion: These findings suggest that susceptibility to digital emotion contagion may have a negative effect on parents. Digital emotion contagion may increase parental burnout and is tied to stress.","[{'authorId': '31452144', 'name': 'Alena Prikhidko'}, {'authorId': '31943361', 'name': 'Haiying Long'}, {'authorId': '3718375', 'name': 'Michael G.

Music can help regulate emotions, and mobile phones provide constant access to it. The Music eScape mobile app teaches young people how to identify and manage emotions using music. Objective This study aimed to examine the effects of using Music eScape on emotion regulation, distress, and well-being at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. Moderators of outcomes and user ratings of app quality were also examined. Methods A randomized controlled trial compared immediate versus 1-month delayed access to Music eScape in 169 young people (aged 16 to 25 years) with at least mild levels of mental distress (Kessler 10 score>17). Results No significant differences between immediate and delayed groups on emotion regulation, distress, or well-being were found at 1 month. Both groups achieved significant improvements in 5 of the 6 emotion regulation skills, mental distress, and well-being at 2, 3, and 6 months. Unhealthy music use moderated improvements on 3 emotion regulation skills. Users gave the app a high mean quality rating (mean 3.8 [SD 0.6]) out of 5. Conclusions Music eScape has the potential to provide a highly accessible way of improving young people’s emotion regulation skills, but further testing is required to determine its efficacy. Targeting unhealthy music use in distressed young people may improve their emotion regulation skills.

The proposed internalization model of reflective emotion regulation argues that caregivers’ co-regulation of emotionally challenging events plays a constitutive role for the development of 4- to 6-year-olds’ reflective emotion regulation. The model specifies the gradual shift from co- to self-regulation by focusing on two important ways how caregivers structure emotionally challenging interactions: Through emotion talk, caregivers promote the development of preschoolers’ emotional awareness. Once established, they support children in establishing a repertoire of effective emotion regulation strategies and they guide preschoolers’ emerging skills to generate, evaluate, and select from alternative appraisals or behavioral responses.","[{'authorId': '115964516', 'name': 'Judith Rebecca Silkenbeumer'}, {'authorId': '2052760391', 'name': 'Eva-Maria Schiller'}, {'authorId': '6051757', 'name': 'Manfred Holodynski'}, {'authorId': '4185170', 'name': 'Joscha Kärtner'}]",23.0,,87.0,The role of co-regulation for the development of social-emotional competence,2016.0

This study examines the developmental interplay between emotional and behavioral self-regulation during childhood and the relationship with academic achievement using data from the longitudinal Millennium Cohort Study (UK). Using cross-lagged panel analyses, we found that emotional and behavioral self-regulation were separate and stable constructs. In addition, both emotional and behavioral self-regulation had positive cross-lagged effects from ages 3 to 7. At an early developmental stage (ages 3 to 5), emotional regulation affected behavioral regulation more strongly than later developmental stages. However, the difference between the reciprocal effects was small from ages 5 to 7. Moreover, behavioral regulation during the third year of primary education (age 7) had a substantial and positive effect on teachers’ evaluations of educational achievement during the last year of primary school (age 11). In contrast, emotional self-regulation only had a small indirect and positive effect via behavioral self-regulation. The current study suggests the structure of self-regulation was multidimensional and its facets are mutually dependent in the child’s development. In order to gain a complete picture of the development of self-regulation and its effect on educational achievement, the facets emotional and behavioral regulation should both be studied in concert.","[{'authorId': '115416343', 'name': 'A.

We found that the continuous proximity of the teacher had the greatest impact on the level of play engagement, while the teacher's walking around and only brief contacts with the children had a negative impact. In line with earlier studies, two-sided and reciprocal interactions between teacher and children also yielded positive results for play engagement. Both our quantitative and qualitative analyses showed a strong co-variation of variables. When the teacher paid only brief visits, and peers also walked in and out, there was a greater likelihood of one-sided interactions, When the teacher was always nearby, we observed the opposite. Dutch teachers spend most of their time walking around.

A Viterbi algorithm has been adopted to predict the hidden state from the visible physical manifestation. We verified the model by comparing estimated results with those produced by human observers.

In the current article, the authors propose and then test a theoretical model that integrates these factors. They specify a progressive (cascading) pattern among ability-based EI facets, in which emotion perception must causally precede emotion understanding, which in turn precedes conscious emotion regulation and job performance. The sequential elements in this progressive model are believed to selectively reflect Conscientiousness, cognitive ability, and Neuroticism, respectively. ""Mixed-based"" measures of EI are expected to explain variance in job performance beyond cognitive ability and personality. The cascading model of EI is empirically confirmed via meta-analytic data, although relationships between ability-based EI and job performance are shown to be inconsistent (i.e., EI positively predicts performance for high emotional labor jobs and negatively predicts performance for low emotional labor jobs). Gender and race differences in EI are also meta-analyzed. Implications for linking the EI fad in personnel selection to established psychological theory are discussed.","[{'authorId': '4822520', 'name': 'Dana L Joseph'}, {'authorId': '144294057', 'name': 'Daniel A.

This study thus aimed to examine the relationship between levels of negative mood and characteristics of mouth parts when moods are drawn as facial expressions on a common platform. A cross-sectional study of Japanese college freshmen was conducted, and 1,068 valid responses were analyzed. The questionnaire survey consisted of participants’ characteristics, the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and a sheet of facial expression drawing (FACED), and the sheet was digitized and analyzed using an image-analysis software. Based on the total POMS score as an index of negative mood, the participants were divided into four groups: low (L), normal (N), high (H), and very high (VH). Lengths of drawn lines and between both mouth corners were significantly longer, and circularity and roundness were significantly higher in the L group. With increasing levels of negative mood, significant decreasing trends were observed in these lengths. Convex downward and enclosed figures were significantly predominant in the L group, while convex upward figures were significantly predominant and a tendency toward predominance of no drawn mouths or line figures was found in the H and VH groups. Our results suggest that mood states can be significantly related to the size and figure characteristics of drawn mouths of FACED on a non-verbal common platform. That is, these findings mean that subjects with low negative mood may draw a greater and rounder mouth and figures that may be enclosed and downward convex, while subjects with a high negative mood may not draw the line, or if any, may draw the line shorter and upward convex.","[{'authorId': '2027644215', 'name': 'Chika Nanayama Tanaka'}, {'authorId': '31383928', 'name': 'Hayato Higa'}, {'authorId': '46325995', 'name': 'N.

Earlier age of onset (AOO) is consistently associated with negative outcomes and yet the causes of this association are still unknown. We used a multiplex, extended pedigree design (total N = 771; 636 relatives from 43 multigenerational families with at least 2 relatives diagnosed with schizophrenia and 135 matched controls) to examine among the schizophrenia relatives (N = 103) the relationship between AOO and negative and positive symptom severity, cognition, and community functioning. Most importantly, we assessed whether there are shared genetic effects between AOO and negative symptoms, positive symptoms, cognition, and community functioning. As expected, earlier AOO was significantly correlated with increased severity of negative and positive symptoms and poorer cognition and community functioning among schizophrenia patients. Notably, the genetic correlation between AOO of schizophrenia and negative symptoms was significant (Rg = −1.00, p = .007). Although the genetic correlations between AOO and positive symptoms, cognition, and community functioning were estimated at maximum and in the predicted direction, they were not statistically significant. AOO of schizophrenia itself was modestly heritable, although not significant and negative symptoms, positive symptoms, and cognition were all strongly and significantly heritable. In sum, we replicated prior findings indicating that earlier AOO is associated with increased symptom severity and extended the literature by detecting shared genetic effects between AOO and negative symptoms, suggestive of pleiotropy.","[{'authorId': '47328270', 'name': 'C.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to verify whether a videomodeling intervention is effective for the acquisition of social and emotional behaviour and skills of children with ASD using tablet PC. METHODS: One 6-year-old child with ASD, who does not use verbal communication, was involved in a multiple baseline across behaviours design: the independent variable was the videomodeling intervention, instead the dependent variable was the participant behaviour. Intervention was preceded by a pre-session of Functional Communication training. An intersubject analysis was used to evaluate participant percentage of response through the sessions. RESULTS: The participant showed a marked improvement in his emotional skills. The intersubjective analysis carried out shows the sharp increase in response in many target behaviours from the baseline to the intervention phase. A limitation of the study was the lack of time: there were only two inversion sessions, no follow-up evaluation, no generalization and no double-blind study. CONCLUSIONS: It would be interesting for future research to extend it to everyday life scenarios, to enhance generalization in other contexts, involving a larger number of people with ASD.","[{'authorId': '34838813', 'name': 'Angelo Rega'}, {'authorId': '117628122', 'name': 'Federica Somma'}, {'authorId': '116010808', 'name': 'L.

Purpose
With a basis in the conservation of resources theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between employees’ experience of time-related work stress and their engagement in counterproductive work behavior (CWB), as well as the invigorating roles that different deviant personality traits might play in this process.


Design/methodology/approach
Two-wave survey data with a time lag of three weeks were collected from 127 employees in Pakistani organizations.


Findings
Employees’ sense that they have insufficient time to do their job tasks spurs their CWB, and this effect is particularly strong if they have strong Machiavellian, narcissistic or psychopathic tendencies.


Originality/value
This study adds to extant research by identifying employees’ time-related work stress as an understudied driver of their CWB and the three personality traits that constitute the dark triad as triggers of the translation of time-related work stress into CWB.

The method is philosophical analysis and involves the application of theories from political theory to the ethics of technology. A veil of complexity creates the illusion that machine actions belong to a mysterious and unpredictable domain, and some argue that this unpredictability absolves designers of responsibility. Such a move would create a moral hazard related to both (a) strategically increasing unpredictability and (b) taking more risk if responsible humans do not have to bear the costs of the risks they create.

a0cf0bf4468329e0ce1e3ac1abd0ec352c1c09ea,"Objectives Psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, cognitive remediation training, and social skills training have been found to be effective interventions for patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, their efficacy on psychosocial functioning when provided in combination remains unclear, compared with all types of control conditions. It would also be meaningful to explore the differences of efficacy in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and those with longer term of illness. Methodology The present review followed the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Full-text English journal articles of randomized controlled trials published in the past decade in the databases of PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched. Included studies were all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The included studies should test combined interventions with at least two components from: psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, cognitive remediation training, and social skills training and incorporate assessment of psychosocial functioning at least at baseline and post-intervention. Results Seven studies were included for systematic review, and six of them were eligible for meta-analysis. Five out of the seven studies reported effects on psychosocial functioning that favored combined interventions over any type of control condition. A significant pooled effect was derived from the six studies, SMD = 1.03, 95% CI [0.06, 2.00], Z = 2.09, p = 0.04, I2 = 96%. However, the pool effect became insignificant when synthesizing five of the studies with non-FEP patients as participants and four of the studies testing relative effects of combined interventions compared with stand-alone interventions/interventions with one less component. None of the included studies adopted motivational interviewing and only one of the studies worked with FEP patients. Conclusion Psychoeducation, cognitive remediation training, and social skills training in combination can effectively enhance psychosocial functioning of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It is warranted to conduct more RCTs to test the effects of different specific combinations of the above interventions on psychosocial functioning, especially in FEP patients.","[{'authorId': '113889760', 'name': 'Erin Yiqing Lu'}, {'authorId': '35108539', 'name': 'A.

Yet, surprisingly, recent findings demonstrate that people use cognitive reappraisal less frequently than might be expected (Suri, Whittaker, & Gross, 2015). We employ cognitive energetics theory (CET) to explain this puzzling behavior. CET posits that the likelihood of launching any cognitive process is a function of two opposing forces: the driving force (i.e., the motivation to launch the process) and the restraining force (i.e., task difficulty). We thus hypothesized that people choose to use cognitive reappraisal relatively rarely because of the difficulty of implementing it. We also postulated that the decision to reappraise (or not) does not simply depend on stimuli emotional intensity because the latter is associated with both the driving and the restraining forces. In support of our hypotheses, we found that when the images' emotional intensity posed difficulty for reappraisal (i.e., highly intense images), reducing this difficulty by asking participants to merely predict others' (Study 1) or their own choices (Study 2) increased reappraisal choice. Finally, in Study 3, we show that a relatively easy to implement reappraisal strategy was chosen more often than the more difficult one for high (but not low) intensity images. These findings illustrate the relevance of a CET-based motivational analysis to emotion regulation choice.

University students (N = 201), aged 17 to 24 years, reported their use of SNSs and addictive tendencies for SNSs use and completed the NEO Five-Factor Personality Inventory and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. Multiple regression analyses revealed that, as a group, the personality and self-esteem factors significantly predicted both level of SNS use and addictive tendency but did not explain a large amount of variance in either outcome measure.

a1243398b19617565d2fe67519be42afaf71849d,"Machine learning, combined with a proliferation of electronic healthcare records (EHR), has the potential to transform medicine by identifying previously unknown interventions that reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. To realize this potential, machine learning must leave the conceptual ‘black box’ in complex domains to overcome several pitfalls, like the presence of confounding variables. These variables predict outcomes but are not causal, often yielding uninformative models. In this work, we envision a ‘conversational’ approach to design machine learning models, which couple modeling decisions to domain expertise. We demonstrate this approach via a retrospective cohort study to identify factors which affect the risk of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (HA-VTE). Using logistic regression for modeling, we have identified drugs that reduce the risk of HA-VTE. Our analysis reveals that ondansetron, an anti-nausea and anti-emetic medication, commonly used in treating side-effects of chemotherapy and post-general anesthesia period, substantially reduces the risk of HA-VTE when compared to aspirin (11% vs. 15% relative risk reduction or RRR, respectively). The low cost and low morbidity of ondansetron may justify further inquiry into its use as a preventative agent for HA-VTE. This case study highlights the importance of engaging domain expertise while applying machine learning in complex domains.","[{'authorId': '28341105', 'name': 'Arghya Datta'}, {'authorId': '33639127', 'name': 'Matthew K.

a181a5eb99d7b10db8f44f55c2d3e48f220261db,"Health behavior change (HBC) refers to facilitating changes to habits and/or behavior related to health. In healthcare practice, it is quite common that the interactions between practitioner and patient involve conversations related to HBC. This could be mainly in relation to the practitioner trying to directly persuade the patients to make some changes in their health behavior. However, the patients may not be motivated to do so as they do not see this change as important. For this reason, direct persuasion may result in a breakdown of communication. In such instances, alternative approaches and means of indirect persuasion, such as empowering the patient and their family members, could be helpful. Furthermore, there are several models and/or theories proposed which explain the health behavior and also provide a structured framework for health behavior change. Many such models/approaches have been proven effective in facilitating HBC and health promotion in areas such as cessation of smoking, weight loss and so on. This paper provides an overview of main models/theories related to HBC and some insights into how these models/approaches could be adapted to facilitate behavior change in hearing healthcare, mainly in relation to: i) hearing help-seeking and hearing-aid uptake; and ii) hearing conservation in relation to music-induced hearing loss (MIHL). In addition, elements of current research related to this area and future directions are highlighted.","[{'authorId': '4787916', 'name': 'V.

In this article, we present a novel multimodal emotional HRI architecture to promote natural and engaging bidirectional emotional communications between a social robot and a human user. User affect is detected using a unique combination of body language and vocal intonation, and multimodal classification is performed using a Bayesian Network. The Emotionally Expressive Robot utilizes the user’s affect to determine its own emotional behavior via an innovative two-layer emotional model consisting of deliberative (hidden Markov model) and reactive (rule-based) layers. The proposed architecture has been implemented via a small humanoid robot to perform diet and fitness counseling during HRI. In order to evaluate the Emotionally Expressive Robot’s effectiveness, a Neutral Robot that can detect user affects but lacks an emotional display, was also developed. A between-subjects HRI experiment was conducted with both types of robots. Extensive results have shown that both robots can effectively detect user affect during the real-time HRI. However, the Emotionally Expressive Robot can appropriately determine its own emotional response based on the situation at hand and, therefore, induce more user positive valence and less negative arousal than the Neutral Robot.","[{'authorId': '32418659', 'name': 'A.

Over thirty years ago, a cognitive-developmental theory of emotional awareness patterned after Piaget’s theory of cognitive development was created as well as a performance measure of this ability called the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS). Since then, a large number of studies have been completed in healthy volunteers and clinical populations including those with mental health or systemic medical disorders. Along the way, there have also been further refinements and adaptations of the LEAS such as the creation of a digital version in addition to further advances in the theory itself. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the evolving theoretical background, measurement methods, and empirical findings with the LEAS. The LEAS is a reliable and valid measure of emotional awareness. Evidence suggests that emotional awareness facilitates better emotion self-regulation, better ability to navigate complex social situations and enjoy relationships, and better physical and mental health. This is a relatively new but promising area of research in the domain of socio-emotional skills.

Substantial literature exists to support the use of mindfulness among adolescents with ADHD to improve negative symptoms of emotional regulation and impulsivity. Middle school students were recruited to participate in a six-week intervention that involved formal and informal mindfulness practices. Pre- and post-intervention mixed methods outcomes measures indicate that a mindfulness intervention improves ADHD symptoms, reduces the frequency for external cues to identify negative symptoms, improves the ability to implement mindfulness techniques during events that produce negative symptoms of emotional regulation and impulse control, and improves the understanding of what mindfulness is. Further research is indicated to determine additional uses for mindfulness as an occupational therapy intervention to improve social and educational participation and among adolescents with ADHD.","[{'authorId': '2146911636', 'name': 'Miranda L.

The authors used data from the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS:88) conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to examine immediate and long-term educational sequelae of misbehavior in high school. The authors constructed an extent of serious misconduct (ESM) measure based on classroom and school misbehaviors, ranging from classroom disruption to fighting and gang membership. The authors first examined relationships among specific misbehaviors and the relationship of ESM to student and school demographic characteristics. Second, the authors studied relationships of ESM with high school and post-high school academic outcomes. Misbehavior was related to high school grades, test scores, and graduation and dropout rates. Misbehavior also was related to entering a postsecondary program of study and completing a postsecondary program. In both cases, well-behaved students were more likely to participate in postsecondary education than were moderately misbehaving students, but moderately mis-behaving students did not participate more than did seriously misbehaving students. The authors discussed results in terms of the need to understand more about the structure of school-related misbehavior and the antecedents of misbehavior, including characteristics of classrooms and schools that may exacerbate student misconduct.","[{'authorId': '102313249', 'name': 'J.

We aimed to identify the intervention with the shortest acquisition time for the proposed social tasks. Results: Our findings show that both types of intervention had the same acquisition time for the recognition of primary emotions.

Gender voice is considered one of the pivotal parts to be detected from a given voice, a task that involves certain complications. In order to distinguish gender from a voice signal, a set of techniques have been employed to determine relevant features to be utilized for building a model from a training set. This model is useful for determining the gender (i.e., male or female) from a voice signal. The contributions are three-fold including (i) providing analysis information about well-known voice signal features using a prominent dataset, (ii) studying various machine learning models of different theoretical families to classify the voice gender, and (iii) using three prominent feature selection algorithms to find promisingly optimal features for improving classification models. The experimental results show the importance of subfeatures over others, which are vital for enhancing the efficiency of classification models’ performance. Experimentation reveals that the best recall value is equal to 99.97%; the best recall value is 99.7% for two models of deep learning (DL) and support vector machine (SVM), and with feature selection, the best recall value is 100% for SVM techniques.","[{'authorId': '1901151', 'name': 'Rami Suleiman Alkhawaldeh'}]",40.0,,20.0,DGR: Gender Recognition of Human Speech Using One-Dimensional Conventional Neural Network,2019.0

Indeed, the risk of being arrested and found guilty of criminal behaviour is higher during late adolescence and early adulthood than at any other point in life. Over the past 40 years, hundreds of studies have attempted to shed more light on how playful children become violent juvenile delinquents. Poor parental supervision, family break-up, negative peer influences and poverty have all been shown to be associated with violent juvenile delinquency. Males account for the majority of arrests made for violent crimes. The principal explanation for violent behaviour has long been the following: “aggressive and violent behaviours are learned responses to frustration, they can also be learned as instruments for achieving goals, and the learning occurs by observing models of such behaviour. Such models may be observed in the family, among peers, elsewhere in the neighbourhood, through the mass media, or in violent pornography.”","[{'authorId': '2442014', 'name': 'R.

However, since misbehaver still disrupts learning, research is still needed to find a classroom intervention that will reduce misbehavior in a classroom to prevent students from under achieving, disruption of peers’ learning and teacher burnout. Zones of Regulation focuses on self-regulation, while addressing sensory processing, executive functioning, and emotional regulation. This experimental study tested the effects of co-taught Zones of Regulation on students’ Social, Academic, and Emotional Behavior Risk Screener (SAEBRS). Fifty-six early elementary students (48% female) were assigned randomly to either the experimental group, which received co-taught direct instruction with Zones of Regulation or the control group, which received standard instruction with a morning meeting. It was predicted that the experimental group would score higher on the SAEBRS than the control group. Although results showed no statistical difference on the SAEBRS scores between the two groups, more students in the experimental group moved from “at risk” to “not at risk”. This study suggests additional research needs to be conducted to determine if co-taught Zones of Regulation instruction is an effective intervention for reducing misbehavior.","[{'authorId': '116736230', 'name': 'M.

Recent studies showing that members of literate cultures associated the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors could not demonstrate that at least some facial expressions of emotion are universal; the cultures compared had all been exposed to some of the same mass media presentations of facial expression, and these may have taught the people in each culture to recognize the unique facial expressions of other cultures. To show that members of a preliterate culture who had minimal exposure to literate cultures would associate the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors as do members of Western and Eastern literate cultures, data were gathered in New Guinea by telling subjects a story, showing them a set of three faces, and asking them to select the face which showed the emotion appropriate to the story. The results provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that the association between particular facial muscular patterns and discrete emotions is universal.","[{'authorId': '21451088', 'name': 'P.

Play has an important role in child development with many potential contributions to therapy, education and enjoyment. The project investigates how robotic toys can become social mediators, encouraging children with disabilities to discover a range of play styles, from solitary to social and cooperative play (with peers, carers/teachers, parents etc). This paper presents design issues for such robotic toys related specifically to children with autism as the end user target group. In order to understand the play needs of this user group, and to investigate how robotic toys could be used as a play tool to assist in the children's development, a panel of experts (therapists, teachers, parents) was formed and interviewed.

a389767a2901d51bd8450f9930b398b6f61cab05,"Several studies have found a delay in the development of facial emotion recognition and expression in children with an autism spectrum condition (ASC). Several interventions have been designed to help children to fill this gap. Most of them adopt technological devices (i.e., robots, computers, and avatars) as social mediators and reported evidence of improvement. Few interventions have aimed at promoting emotion recognition and expression abilities and, among these, most have focused on emotion recognition. Moreover, a crucial point is the generalization of the ability acquired during treatment to naturalistic interactions. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two technological-based interventions focused on the expression of basic emotions comparing a robot-based type of training with a “hybrid” computer-based one. Furthermore, we explored the engagement of the hybrid technological device introduced in the study as an intermediate step to facilitate the generalization of the acquired competencies in naturalistic settings. A two-group pre-post-test design was applied to a sample of 12 children (M = 9.33; ds = 2.19) with autism. The children were included in one of the two groups: group 1 received a robot-based type of training (n = 6); and group 2 received a computer-based type of training (n = 6). Pre- and post-intervention evaluations (i.e., time) of facial expression and production of four basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and anger) were performed. Non-parametric ANOVAs found significant time effects between pre- and post-interventions on the ability to recognize sadness [t(1) = 7.35, p = 0.006; pre: M (ds) = 4.58 (0.51); post: M (ds) = 5], and to express happiness [t(1) = 5.72, p = 0.016; pre: M (ds) = 3.25 (1.81); post: M (ds) = 4.25 (1.76)], and sadness [t(1) = 10.89, p < 0; pre: M (ds) = 1.5 (1.32); post: M (ds) = 3.42 (1.78)]. The group*time interactions were significant for fear [t(1) = 1.019, p = 0.03] and anger expression [t(1) = 1.039, p = 0.03]. However, Mann–Whitney comparisons did not show significant differences between robot-based and computer-based training. Finally, no difference was found in the levels of engagement comparing the two groups in terms of the number of voice prompts given during interventions. Albeit the results are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution, this study suggests that two types of technology-based training, one mediated via a humanoid robot and the other via a pre-settled video of a peer, perform similarly in promoting facial recognition and expression of basic emotions in children with an ASC. The findings represent the first step to generalize the abilities acquired in a laboratory-trained situation to naturalistic interactions.","[{'authorId': '51967089', 'name': 'F.

All the constructs were assessed by self-report in an anonymous survey during the final period of the outbreak. Results showed that the relations of stressors and coping to psychological adjustment varied by domain of adjustment. Regression analyses suggested that the number of stressors and use of avoidant coping strategies positively predicted psychological symptoms. Active coping positively predicted life satisfaction when controlling for stressors. Moreover, all types of coping served as a buffer against the negative impact of stressors on perceived general health. These findings hold implications for university counseling services during times of acute, large-scale stressors. In particular, effective screening procedures should be developed to identify students who experience a large number of stressors and thus are at high risk for developing mental health problems. Intervention efforts that target coping should be adapted to take account of the uncontrollability of stressors and clients' cultural preferences for certain coping strategies. A multidimensional battery of psychological adjustment should be used to monitor clients' psychological adjustment to stressors and evaluate the efficacy of intervention.","[{'authorId': '47478537', 'name': 'Alexandra Main'}, {'authorId': '2218929589', 'name': 'Qing Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2109386795', 'name': 'Yue Ma'}, {'authorId': '2303613', 'name': 'L.

Self-compassion describes a positive and caring attitude of a person toward her- or himself in the face of failures and individual shortcomings. As a result of this caring attitude, individuals high in self-compassion are assumed to experience higher individual well-being. The present meta-analysis examines the relationship between self-compassion and different forms of well-being.


METHOD
The authors combined k = 79 samples, with an overall sample size of N = 16,416, and analyzed the central tendencies of effect sizes (Pearson correlation coefficients) with a random-effect model.


RESULTS
We found an overall magnitude of the relationship between self-compassion and well-being of r = .47. The relationship was stronger for cognitive and psychological well-being compared to affective well-being. Sample characteristics and self-esteem were tested as potential moderators. In addition, a subsample of studies indicated a causal effect of self-compassion on well-being.


CONCLUSIONS
The results clearly highlight the importance of self-compassion for individuals' well-being. Future research should further investigate the relationship between self-compassion and the different forms of well-being, and focus on the examination of possible additional moderators.","[{'authorId': '7353043', 'name': 'Ulli Zessin'}, {'authorId': '118391006', 'name': 'O.

It is known that a human has involuntary facial muscles around the eyes, and voluntary facial muscles around the mouth. Thus, it is considered that facial muscles around the eyes express the affective expressions, while facial muscles around the mouth express the social expressions. In an experiment involving a human-robot conversation, using the proposed method, the results showed a sense of human likeness and sociality. Furthermore, the intimacy evaluation results showed that the social expressions work effectively when the intimacy does not require high social bonding such as the desire for friendship.

The study was conducted with a sample of 445 nurses and healthcare assistants from a general hospital. Team reflexivity was evaluated with the validation of the French version of the team reflexivity scale (Facchin, Tschan, Gurtner, Cohen, & Dupuis, 2006). Burnout was measured with the MBI General Survey (Schaufeli, Leiter, Maslach, & Jackson, 1996). Emotional dissonance and re-evaluation were measured with the scale developed by Andela, Truchot, & Borteyrou (2015). With reference to Rimé's theoretical model (2009), we suggested that both dimensions of team reflexivity (task and social reflexivity) respond to both psychological necessities induced by dissonance (cognitive clarification and socio-affective necessities). Firstly, results indicated that emotional dissonance was related to burnout. Secondly, regression analysis confirmed the buffering role of re-evaluation and social reflexivity on the emotional exhaustion of emotional dissonance. Overall, results contribute to the literature by highlighting the moderating effect of re-evaluation and team reflexivity in analysing the relationship between emotional dissonance and burnout.

Young age is the critical period because at this time youth faces lots of changes in his/her life. They are expected to be the elites in the society. Thus, they should enhance their stress management abilities so as to live a healthy life after entering the society. When a child enters into the youth age, they need to not only adapt themselves to the new life and new environment but also be familiar with many new people, events, and things.

The researcher found that the stress mainly comes from academic tests, interpersonal relations, relationship problems, life changes, and career exploration. Such stress may usually cause psychological, physical, and behavioral problems. This study finds the causes of stress among youth. So after identifying causes the researcher suggests that more emphasis can be given to development stage of child into adolescence. They should be brought up in the positive environment.

Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) supported the construct validity of the 8-item two-dimensional BSCS model, combining restraint and non-impulsivity. Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability coefficients supported the internal-consistency reliability of the 8-item two-dimensional BSCS. Multi-group CFAs demonstrated the 8-item two-dimensional BSCS to be invariant at both configural and metric levels for all samples. Moreover, the restraint and non-impulsivity subscales exhibited discriminant validity and were also distinct from the conceptually related conscientiousness construct. Finally, it was revealed that the restraint component was positively associated with optimal sports performance of both adult and adolescent athletes, while non-impulsivity was only positively correlated to that of adolescent athletes. Both BSCS components had a positive association with academic performance of adolescent students.

The results clearly showed exceptional features of the human eye: (1) the exposed white sclera is void of any pigmentation, (2) humans possess the largest ratio of exposed sclera in the eye outline, and (3) the eye outline is extraordinarily elongated in the horizontal direction. The close correlation of the parameters reflecting (2) and (3) with habitat type or body size of the species examined suggested that these two features are adaptations for extending the visual field by eyeball movement, especially in the horizontal direction. Comparison of eye coloration and facial coloration around the eye suggested that the dark coloration of exposed sclera of nonhuman primates is an adaptation to camouflage the gaze direction against other individuals and/or predators, and that the white sclera of the human eye is an adaptation to enhance the gaze signal. The uniqueness of human eye morphology among primates illustrates the remarkable difference between human and other primates in the ability to communicate using gaze signals.","[{'authorId': '2115789873', 'name': 'Hiromitsu Kobayashi'}, {'authorId': '6854522', 'name': 'S.

Design: A descriptive survey design was utilised. A questionnaire, adapted from The Significant Other Scale for Hearing Disability was used for data collection. Subjects: Through purposive sampling, 35 individuals who reported experiencing no hearing difficulties and who were married to a person with an acquired hearing loss contributed data for this study. These data were analysed using Stata® version 9. Results: The majority of the participants identified a range of communication-related difficulties within their marriage, such as repeating themselves extensively in conversation with their hearing-impaired partners (97%), raising the volume of their voices (83%), and having to maintain face-to-face contact with their spouse (74%). These difficulties may have led to negative feelings within the marriage as during communication, 69% of participants reported feeling frustrated because of difficulties experienced in respect of their partner's hearing impairment. Participants reported that they had to accept a hearing impairment in their marriage. Seventy-one per cent of participants expressed concern for their hearing-impaired partners, and specifically with regard to fearing for their safety, e.g. when alarms or warning bells were not heard. Conclusion: A partner's acquired hearing impairment may lead to the development of negative feelings within a marriage. Therefore, audiologists must be aware of the perceptions of spouses with normal hearing when providing aural rehabilitation to both the hearing-impaired individuals and their partners, and thereby preventing disharmony in the marriage, while ensuring effective service delivery.","[{'authorId': '2256017058', 'name': 'Nicole Ginelle Govender'}, {'authorId': '2256056455', 'name': 'Nicole Maistry'}, {'authorId': '2256030710', 'name': 'Nadiya Soomar'}, {'authorId': '8731429', 'name': 'J.

The present study examined the use of specific emotion regulation strategies among individuals with BD (n = 37) and healthy controls (n = 38). Participants' spontaneous use of reappraisal and suppression, as well as their associated effort and success at regulating their emotions, was measured in the context of three emotionally evocative films (neutral, happy, sad). Results indicated that the BD participants made greater use of spontaneous suppression and reappraisal across all films compared to the control group. BD participants also reported greater effort, but less success, when spontaneously regulating emotions. These findings suggest that bipolar disorder is associated with less success when regulating emotions despite a widespread engagement of regulatory efforts. Discussion focuses on the disjunction between troubled emotion functioning in bipolar disorder and sustained efforts to modify intense emotions.","[{'authorId': '2667598', 'name': 'J.

Although the mechanisms underlying such link have not been completely clarified, it has been suggested that problematic use of social media and online videogames (i.e., two common forms of PUI among young adults) lead to increased sleep disturbances which, in turn, represent a relevant trigger for aggression. We have tested this hypothesis in a sample (N = 480) of young individuals (351 females and 129 males; mean age: 21.76 ± 1.92 years; range: 18-24). Self-report measures investigating symptoms related to social media addiction (SMA), Internet gaming disorder (IGD), insomnia severity, and aggression were used. Mediational models analyzing the direct and indirect associations of SMA- and IGD-related symptoms on aggression severity through insomnia-related symptoms were performed controlling for confounding factors. The models showed that the total effects of SMA-related symptoms (B = 0.018; p = .010) and of IGD-related symptoms (B = 0.018; p = .041) on aggression severity were significant and that these associations were mediated by insomnia-related symptoms (respectively, p < .001 and p = .003). Our findings support the potential mediating role of insomnia severity in the association of SMA- and IGD-related disturbances with levels of aggression.","[{'authorId': '46325172', 'name': 'F. S.

Unfortunately, when taken separately, these measures are vulnerable to different sources of bias, and alternative explanations might account for changes in these indicators of negative affect. What is needed is a study that (a) obtains measures of self-reported affect together with facial electromyography, and (b) examines the use of reappraisal to regulate externally and internally generated affective responses. In the present study, participants up- or down-regulated negative affect in the context of both negative and neutral pictures. Up-regulation led to greater self reports of negative affect, as well as greater corrugator and startle responses to both negative and neutral stimuli. Down-regulation led to lesser reports of negative affect, and lesser corrugator responses to negative and neutral stimuli. These results extend prior research by (a) showing simultaneous effects on multiple measures of affect, and (b) demonstrating that cognitive reappraisal may be used both to regulate responses to negative stimuli and to manufacture a negative response to neutral stimuli.","[{'authorId': '3898955', 'name': 'R.

We propose that a major next step in the effort to promote healthy emotional development is to improve the field's understanding of the most proximal contributor to parent ESBs: parents' own experience and regulation of emotions in the context of caregiving. As an initial step, this paper integrates Eisenberg and colleagues' model of emotion socialization with theoretical and empirical work on parental emotion. We review the literature on the emotionally evocative nature of parenting, which influences parental ESBs, including parents' expressions of emotions and their responses to children's emotions. However, whereas parental emotions influence behavior, they do not necessarily determine it; parents may regulate their emotions to engage in optimal ESBs. Thus, parental regulation contributes to emotion socialization not only by modeling emotion regulation strategies for children, but also by influencing the quality of parents' ESBs. From a clinical perspective, parental emotion regulation is of utmost importance due to the degree of parental involvement in interventions for childhood emotional and behavioral disorders, which are often aimed at promoting child self-regulation. To illustrate practical applications of Eisenberg's model, we discuss evidence-based practices that include enhancement of parent emotion regulation as a primary target, with the ultimate goal of promoting child emotional development. Ultimately, we aim to spur future theoretical, empirical, and translational work in this area.

Therefore, it is important to explore potential predictors of social functioning and the quality of nurse–patient relationships. The aim of this study was to explore associations between patient social functioning, nurse–patient therapeutic alliances, emotional regulation, attachment style and nurse distress in acute mental health settings. A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional approach with correlational and regression analyses was used for this study. A total of 50 nurse–patient dyads in acute mental health inpatient wards across four NHS trusts in the north-west of England took part. Patients and nurses completed questionnaires regarding demographic information, emotional regulation, attachment style and alliance. Nurses also rated patient social functioning and their own distress. The patient anxious attachment style was associated with difficulties in regulating emotions. Patient emotional regulation, patient insecure attachment and the patient-rated alliance predicted nurse-rated patient social functioning. Nurse emotion regulation, nurse insecure attachment style and nurse-rated alliance did not significantly predict nurse-rated patient social functioning and correlations were non-significant. Nurse distress was associated with nurse emotion regulation, nurse anxious attachment and nurse-rated alliance. These factors significantly predicted nurse distress. Patient social functioning is predicted by emotion regulation, attachment and alliance. Similarly, nurse distress is predicted by nurse emotion regulation, attachment style and alliance.

This knowledge is crucial, as the first impression children build of robots might influence their willingness to interact with them over extended periods of time, for example in applications where robots play the role of companions or tutors. The present study focuses on investigating the effects of facial expressions of emotions on children’s perceptions of trust towards robots during first encounters. We constructed a set of facial expressions of happiness and anger varying in terms of intensity. We implemented these facial expressions onto a Furhat robot that was either male-like or female-like. 129 children were exposed to the robot’s expressions for a few seconds. We asked them to evaluate the robot in terms of trustworthiness, likability, and competence and investigated how emotion type, emotion intensity, and gender-likeness affected the perception of the robot. Results showed that a few seconds are enough for children to make a trait inference based on the robot’s emotion. We observed that emotion type, emotion intensity, and gender-likeness did not directly affect trust, but the perception of likability and competence of the robot served as facilitator to judge trustworthiness.","[{'authorId': '2052028871', 'name': 'Natalia Calvo-Barajas'}, {'authorId': '1556566185', 'name': 'G.

Participants played with an agent that copied their smiles and frowns or one that showed the opposite pattern -- i.e., that frowned when they smiled. As people tend to smile more than frown, we independently manipulated the contingency of expressions to ensure any effects are due to mimicry alone, and not the overall positivity/negativity of the agent: i.e., participants saw either a reflection of their own expressions or saw the expressions shown to a previous participant. Results show that participants smiled significantly more when playing an agent that mimicked them. Results also show a complex association between smiling, feelings of rapport, and cooperation.

As more complex cognitive abilities emerge with development, this may alter the expression and nature of prosocial behaviors over time. Sharing is one important expression of prosocial behavior. Our aim was to explore how children’s sharing behavior with different recipients across important social categories changes by comparing two distinct transitional periods in development. We compared the responses of 46 preschoolers (M age = 4.95 years) and 52 5th graders (M age = 9.98 years) on two social decision-making paradigms. Results showed that older children shared more selectively depending on the recipient than younger children, who shared resources more equitably with different recipients. A second paradigm revealed greater uncoupling of behavior and cognition among older children, such that prosocial behavior in preschoolers was more closely linked to their judgments about the recipient’s character than it was for 5th graders. Increased cognitive complexity that emerges over the course of development can be used to help or discriminate against others, depending upon how those capacities are channeled. Therefore, how these abilities are shaped has important societal consequences.","[{'authorId': '7028372', 'name': 'Lisa Flook'}, {'authorId': '1398158374', 'name': 'C.

Pit Corder all recognized the reality of language ""acquisition"" in the adult long before I did. I would also like the thank Introduction This book is concerned with what has been called the ""Monitor Theory"" of adult second language acquisition. Monitor Theory hypothesizes that adults have two independent systems for developing ability in second languages, subconscious language acquisition and conscious language learning, and that these systems are interrelated in a definite way: subconscious acquisition appears to be far more important. The introduction is devoted to a brief statement of the theory and its implications for different aspects of second language acquisitions theory and practice. We define acquisition and learning, and present the Monitor Model for adult second language performance. Following this, brief summaries of research results in various areas of second language acquisition serve as both an overview of Monitor Theory research over the last few years and as introduction to the essays that follow. Language acquisition is very similar to the process children use in acquiring first and second languages. It requires meaningful interaction in the target language-natural communication-in which speakers are concerned not with the form of their utterances but with the messages they are conveying and understanding. Error correction and explicit teaching of rules are not relevant to language acquisition but caretakers and native speakers can modify their utterances addressed to acquirers to help them understand, and these modifications are thought to help the acquisition process (Snow and Ferguson, 1977). It has been hypothesized that there is a fairly stable order of acquisition of structures in language acquisition, that is, one can see clear 1 similarities across acquirers as to which structures tend to be acquired early and which tend to be acquired late (Brown, 1973; Dulay and Burt, 1975).

The HPA response is a component of the organism's adaptive system for maintaining function under changing environmental circumstances. Over the long term, however, chronic overactivation following repeated stressors can give rise to wear and tear or allostatic load (McEwen, 2003). Both mal-adaptive responses to stress and disturbances in the functioning of the HPA axis have been implicated in a wide variety of syndromes and illnesses, including cardio-vascular illness, insulin resistance syndrome and diabetes, cognitive decline during aging, fatigue and pain syndromes, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and posttrau-matic stress disorder (PTSD), among others (Charmandari, Tsigos, & Chrousos, 2005). As the name indicates, the main components of the HPA axis are the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal cortex (see Figure 3.1). The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH, also known as CRF) into the portal blood vessels connecting the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary. CRH, which works synergisti-cally with arginine vasopressin (AVP) released from the hypothalamus, then triggers the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the bloodstream. After reaching the adrenal cortex, ACTH stimulates the release of glucocorticoids (GCs)—in humans, cortisol. This entire process takes place within a matter of minutes. The HPA axis is regulated by a complex negative feedback system, with circulating gluco-corticoids inhibiting activity at the level of the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. In general, hippocampal structures exert inhibitory influences on the axis at the level of the hypothalamus, whereas the amygdala plays an activating role (Herman & Cullinan, 1997). Mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors in the brain are thought to play different but complementary roles in regulating normal circa-dian activity, preparing the organism to respond to external stimuli, and facilitating recovery of disturbed homeostasis after acutely stressful situations (de Kloet, 1991). Activity of the HPA axis shows a pronounced circadian rhythm, controlled by the primary endogenous pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. ACTH and cortisol are secreted in short pulsatile episodes, concentrated in the morning hours in humans, but occurring throughout the day, even in the absence of stressors. In a 24-hour cycle, approximately 15 to 18 ACTH pulses can be identified. In people who have a normal routine of nocturnal sleep and daytime activity, cortisol levels are lowest between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. After a quiescent …","[{'authorId': '5591619', 'name': 'N.

This is the first controlled trial examining video-teleconferencing to remotely deliver behavioral parent training to the home setting with a live therapist. Method: Racially/ethnically diverse children ages 3–5 years with disruptive behavior disorders, and their caregiver(s), using webcams and parent-worn Bluetooth earpieces, participated in a randomized trial comparing Internet-delivered parent–child interaction therapy (I-PCIT) versus standard clinic-based PCIT (N = 40). Major assessments were conducted at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Linear regressions and hierarchical linear modeling using maximum-likelihood estimation were used to analyze treatment satisfaction, diagnoses, symptoms, functioning, and burden to parents across conditions. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses found 70% and 55% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, showed “treatment response” after treatment, and 55% and 40% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, continued to show “treatment response” at 6-month follow-up. Both treatments had significant effects on children’s symptoms and burden to parents, and many effects were very large in magnitude. Most outcomes were comparable across conditions, except that the rate of posttreatment “excellent response” was significantly higher in I-PCIT than in clinic-based PCIT, and I-PCIT was associated with significantly fewer parent-perceived barriers to treatment than clinic-based PCIT. Both treatments were associated with positive engagement, treatment retention, and very high treatment satisfaction. Conclusion: Findings build on the small but growing literature supporting the promising role of new technologies for expanding the delivery of behavioral parent training.","[{'authorId': '4454081', 'name': 'Jonathan S.

Participants were told to either (a) think about the film in such a way that they would feel nothing (reappraisal, a form of antecedent-focused emotion regulation), (b) behave in such a way that someone watching them would not know they were feeling anything (suppression, a form of response-focused emotion regulation), or (c) watch the film (a control condition).

A randomized controlled trial (n = 138) was conducted to test the effectiveness of a biofeedback video game (Dojo) for adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety. Adolescents (11–15 years old) were randomly assigned to play Dojo or a control game (Rayman 2: The Great Escape). Initial screening for anxiety was done on 1,347 adolescents in five high schools; only adolescents who scored above the “at-risk” cut-off on the Spence Children Anxiety Survey were eligible. Adolescents’ anxiety levels were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and at three month follow-up to examine the extent to which playing Dojo decreased adolescents’ anxiety. The present study revealed equal improvements in anxiety symptoms in both conditions at follow-up and no differences between Dojo and the closely matched control game condition. Latent growth curve models did reveal a steeper decrease of personalized anxiety symptoms (not of total anxiety symptoms) in the Dojo condition compared to the control condition. Moderation analyses did not show any differences in outcomes between boys and girls nor did age differentiate outcomes. The present results are of importance for prevention science, as this was the first full-scale randomized controlled trial testing indicated prevention effects of a video game aimed at reducing anxiety.

a8a04189ac2ee4121d67cbb933f5fecea262ebca,"Abstract In this paper I suggest that play is a distinctive behavioural category whose adaptive significance calls for explanation. Play primarily affords juveniles practice toward the exercise of later skills. Its benefits exceed its costs when sufficient practice would otherwise be unlikely or unsafe, as is particularly true with physical skills and socially competitive ones. Manipulative play with objects is a byproduct of increased intelligence, specifically selected for only in a few advanced primates, notably the chimpanzee. The adaptiveness of play in pongid evolution is traced through the probable changes in selective pressures that occurred in hominid evolution. It is argued that fantasy was an emergent property in hominids, made possible by symbolic intelligence and language, and serving to make play complex enough to continue to provide useful practice for increasingly complex later skills. The advent of organised instruction and education has meant that play's unplanned, intrinisic goal-setting could be replaced by extrinsic goal-setting in the systematic development of particular skills. However, the need to ensure adequate motivation has continued to give play educational value. In addition, its capacity to enhance innovative behaviour seems to be a residual function of play which has acquired a new cultural importance.","[{'authorId': '40042110', 'name': 'Philip Smith'}]",361.0,,239.0,Does play matter?

The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal relations among child maltreatment, emotion regulation, peer acceptance and rejection, and psychopathology.


METHODS
Data were collected on 215 maltreated and 206 nonmaltreated children (ages 6-12 years) from low-income families. Children were evaluated by camp counselors on emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and were nominated by peers for peer acceptance and rejection.


RESULTS
Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that experiencing neglect, physical and/or sexual abuse, multiple maltreatment subtypes, and earlier onset of maltreatment were related to emotion dysregulation. Lower emotion regulation (Time 1) was associated with higher externalizing symptomatology (Time 1) that contributed to later peer rejection (Time 2), which in turn was related to higher externalizing symptomatology (Time 2). Conversely, higher emotion regulation was predictive of higher peer acceptance over time, which was related to lower internalizing symptomatology controlling for initial levels of symptomatology.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings emphasize the important role of emotion regulation as a risk or a protective mechanism in the link between earlier child maltreatment and later psychopathology through its influences on peer relations.","[{'authorId': '2109995786', 'name': 'Jungmeen E.

After an introduction to life-history theory, and before turning to humans, the author reviews research about the two mammals in which play has been studied the most extensively: laboratory rats and monkeys. He looks at the development of play, deprivation studies, gender segregation, and the functions of gender-differentiated forms of play. The gender segregation and sex differences in play parenting and rough-and-tumble play observed in many primates are also evident in children. Vigorous social-play benefits all children physically by developing strong bones and muscles, by promoting cardiovascular fitness, and by encouraging exercise habits that help prevent obesity. Unsupervised play also helps hone the skills of communication, perspective taking, and emotion regulation. For boys especially, rough-and-tumble play in early childhood provides a scaffold for learning emotion-regulation skills related to managing anger and aggression.","[{'authorId': '5653573', 'name': 'P.

The results of multilevel analyses suggest that person-level psychological flexibility was associated with lower levels of daily emotional exhaustion (measured at bedtime). Moreover, person-level psychological flexibility was found to attenuate, whereas person-level surface acting was found to strengthen, the association between day-level emotional demands and day-level exhaustion. Person-level deep acting had no significant effect on daily exhaustion.

Working alliance has been shown to be important in influencing the outcome of therapy. Research evidence suggests that characteristics of both clients and therapists impact on the development of the working alliance. Although attachment theory is well researched, there is relatively limited research on the relationship between both therapist and client attachment style and the working alliance; traditionally, research has placed greater emphasis on client characteristics. The current study examines the extent to which both client and therapist self-reported attachment styles are related to the working alliance. Thirty clients and 42 therapists were recruited from primary care psychology services. Thirty client-therapist dyads were examined. Participants completed self-report measures of anxiety and depression, attachment style and working alliance at a single time point. Client and therapist attachment security were not independently related to working alliance. However, there was a significant association between therapist insecure attachment and alliance in more symptomatic clients. There was also some evidence that therapists and clients with oppositional attachment styles reported more favourable alliances. The study suggests that the relationship between therapist attachment style and alliance is not straightforward. It is likely that the complexity of clients' presenting problems, coupled with interaction between client-therapist attachment styles, influences the therapeutic alliance.


KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE
Therapist insecure attachment may negatively affect the therapeutic alliance in more symptomatic clients. It is important to consider the interaction between client and therapist attachment and how these interactions influence the therapeutic alliance. Therapists should be aware of their own personal attachment style and reflect on how this might manifest during the therapeutic process.","[{'authorId': '2535077', 'name': 'S.

Intense and frequent negative affect during this period has been hypothesized to explain the increased rates of affective disorders, suicide, and accidental death during this time of life. Yet some teens emerge from adolescence with minimal turmoil. We provide a neurobiological model of adolescence that proposes an imbalance in the development of subcortical limbic (e.g., amygdala) relative to prefrontal cortical regions as a potential mechanism for heightened emotionality during this period. Empirical support for this model is provided from recent behavioral and human imaging studies on the development of emotion regulation. We then provide examples of environmental factors that may exacerbate imbalances in amygdala-ventrofrontal function increasing risk for anxiety related behaviors. Finally we present data from human and mouse studies to illustrate how genetic factors may enhance or diminish this risk. Together, these studies provide a converging methods approach for understanding the highly variable stress and turmoil experienced in adolescence.","[{'authorId': '2242328488', 'name': 'B.

As a way to ensure that students with disabilities or other special needs have access to the same curriculum as other students and the opportunity to succeed in the general education setting, co-teaching occurs when two professionals, typically a general education teacher and a special education teacher or another specialist, partner in delivering instruction. Although the research base on co-teaching is still emerging, it suggests that co-teaching is far more complex to effectively implement than it might seem at first consideration.

Most evaluations of MBIs are either uncontrolled or nonrandomized trials. This meta‐analysis aims to establish the efficacy of MBIs for children and adolescents in studies that have adopted a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) design. Methods A systematic literature search of RCTs of MBIs was conducted up to October 2017. Thirty‐three independent studies including 3,666 children and adolescents were included in random effects meta‐analyses with outcome measures categorized into cognitive, behavioural and emotional factors. Separate random effects meta‐analyses were completed for the seventeen studies (n = 1,762) that used an RCT design with an active control condition. Results Across all RCTs we found significant positive effects of MBIs, relative to controls, for the outcome categories of Mindfulness, Executive Functioning, Attention, Depression, Anxiety/Stress and Negative Behaviours, with small effect sizes (Cohen's d), ranging from .16 to .30. However, when considering only those RCTs with active control groups, significant benefits of an MBI were restricted to the outcomes of Mindfulness (d = .42), Depression (d = .47) and Anxiety/Stress (d = .18) only.

Methods: To reach this aim, we performed an online longitudinal survey recruiting 1,330 participants at Time 1 (at the beginning of the lockdown) and 308 participants at Time 2 (few days before the end of the lockdown). All filled out a set of questionnaires: demographic data, University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale−18 items, and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale−21 items. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling in two steps and controlling for age. First, hypotheses were tested on cross-sectional data. Then, a cross-lagged panel analysis was performed on longitudinal data. Results: Models obtained a good fit and evidenced the predictive role of loneliness levels on the three outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress). Moreover, we found that emotion dysregulation levels partially mediated the longitudinal relationship between loneliness and both depression and stress but not between loneliness and anxiety levels. Conclusions: This study points out that a central goal of clinical intervention could be the ability to regulate negative emotional states.","[{'authorId': '5635016', 'name': 'P.

aa710908681dd403857be0b56aacc28f5d423910,"Background There is a significant need for strategies to increase access to evidence-based interventions for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). One novel approach is to train parents to use evidence-based interventions for their child with ASD via telehealth. Pilot work examining the efficacy of one such program, ImPACT Online, demonstrated a high rate of parent program engagement, low attrition, and associated gains in parent learning and child social communication. Objective The objective of this study was to conduct an open trial of ImPACT Online to better understand its dissemination potential. Methods We examined the reach and representativeness of families who registered (n=36) compared to families who were referred (n=139) to the open trial for one referral site. We then compared the demographics of all families who enrolled in the open trial (n=112) to families who enrolled in one of two controlled trials of the same program (n=50). We also examined metrics of program engagement for the open and controlled trials, the relationship between program engagement and changes in parents’ intervention knowledge, and program evaluation for the participants in the open trial. Results In total, 25.8% (36/139) of the parents who were given information about the program at their child’s diagnostic feedback session registered with the program. The parents who enrolled in the open (OT) and controlled trials (CT), respectively, were similar in gender (OT: 84.8% (95/112); CT: 88% (44/50), female), marital status (OT: 80.4% (90/112) ; CT: 69.6% (32/46), married), education (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 54.0% (27/50), college degree or higher), and employment status (OT: 58.0% (65/112); CT: 65.3% (32/49), employed outside the home). The child participants were similar in terms of gender (OT: 83.0% (93/112); CT: 76.0% (38/50), male) and race and ethnicity (OT: 38.4% (43/112); CT: 24.0% (12/50), minority). However, the mean chronological age of the child participants in the open trial group was significantly higher (Mean=60.0 months) than in the controlled trial group (Mean=43.0 months), with t160=5.22, P<.001. Parents in the open trial engaged with the program at a significantly lower rate than the controlled trial, F3,81=21.14, P<.001. Program engagement was significantly associated with gains in parent intervention knowledge across both the groups, beta=.41, t=2.43, P=.02. Participants in the open access trial evaluated the program highly, but several barriers were noted. Conclusions These data suggest that additional strategies may need to be developed to support families in using telehealth-based parent-mediated intervention in community settings.","[{'authorId': '4011485', 'name': 'Brooke Ingersoll'}, {'authorId': '1855197638', 'name': 'Katherine Shannon'}, {'authorId': '46790608', 'name': 'Natalie I Berger'}, {'authorId': '2773714', 'name': 'Katherine E.

Methods: Patients with a coded diagnosis of hearing loss were identified from the 2006 and 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked household and medical conditions files and compared to patients without hearing loss. Differences in employment, wage income, and Supplemental Security Income were evaluated with multivariate regression models after adjustment for several demographic and Charlson comorbidity variables. Results: An estimated 933,921 ± 88,474 adults were identified with hearing loss (54.7% of whom were male; mean age for all, 51.0 years). Patients with hearing loss were more likely to be unemployed or partly unemployed than those without hearing loss (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; p < 0.001). Similarly, adults with hearing loss were less likely to have any wage income than those without hearing loss (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; p < 0.001). The population with hearing loss earned a mean wage of $23,481 ± $3,366, versus $31,272 ± $517 for the population without hearing loss (difference in wages, $7,791; p < 0.001). The association between hearing loss and receiving Supplemental Security Income was not significant (p = 0.109). Conclusions: Adults with hearing loss are more likely to be unemployed and on average earn significantly less wage income than adults without hearing loss. Further work is needed to determine the potential impact of treatment on these differences.","[{'authorId': '2082603629', 'name': 'David Jung'}, {'authorId': '144545468', 'name': 'N.

A total of 578 children aged from 8 to 14 years were recruited to evaluate humanoid robots depicted either in still images (N = 267) or videos (N = 311). The results showed that the degree of anthropomorphism affected children’s attitudes toward the robots. An uncanny valley was observed in this study, indicating that children prefer robots created with a moderate level of human likeness over those that have a highly human-like appearance but remain distinguishable from humans. A striking finding was that moving robots exhibiting social cues moderate the uncanny valley plot, thus contradicting Mori’s uncanny valley hypothesis, which posits that emotional responses are greater for moving robots than for static robots. In addition, the children in this study perceived the robots as more socially and physically attractive when the robots exhibited social cues. In summary, the current results suggest that children prefer moderately realistic robots and that robot behavior is a key determinant of how children perceive robots. A moderate level of anthropomorphic appearance combined with appropriate social cues can enhance child preferences for and acceptance of robots.","[{'authorId': '13612736', 'name': 'Fang-Wu Tung'}]",59.0,,55.0,Child Perception of Humanoid Robot Appearance and Behavior,2016.0
ab1383827cfefbb09df3831762a10e768e93bae1,"A growing number of investigators have commented on the lack of models to inform the design of behavioral intervention technologies (BITs). BITs, which include a subset of mHealth and eHealth interventions, employ a broad range of technologies, such as mobile phones, the Web, and sensors, to support users in changing behaviors and cognitions related to health, mental health, and wellness. We propose a model that conceptually defines BITs, from the clinical aim to the technological delivery framework. The BIT model defines both the conceptual and technological architecture of a BIT. Conceptually, a BIT model should answer the questions why, what, how (conceptual and technical), and when. While BITs generally have a larger treatment goal, such goals generally consist of smaller intervention aims (the ""why"") such as promotion or reduction of specific behaviors, and behavior change strategies (the conceptual ""how""), such as education, goal setting, and monitoring. Behavior change strategies are instantiated with specific intervention components or “elements” (the ""what""). The characteristics of intervention elements may be further defined or modified (the technical ""how"") to meet the needs, capabilities, and preferences of a user. Finally, many BITs require specification of a workflow that defines when an intervention component will be delivered. The BIT model includes a technological framework (BIT-Tech) that can integrate and implement the intervention elements, characteristics, and workflow to deliver the entire BIT to users over time. This implementation may be either predefined or include adaptive systems that can tailor the intervention based on data from the user and the user’s environment. The BIT model provides a step towards formalizing the translation of developer aims into intervention components, larger treatments, and methods of delivery in a manner that supports research and communication between investigators on how to design, develop, and deploy BITs.","[{'authorId': '50228835', 'name': 'D.

COR theory has been adopted across the many areas of the stress spectrum, from burnout to traumatic stress. Further attesting to the theory's centrality, COR theory is largely the basis for the more work-specific leading theory of organizational stress, namely the job demands-resources model. One of the major advantages of COR theory is its ability to make a wide range of specific hypotheses that are much broader than those offered by theories that focus on a single central resource, such as control, or that speak about resources in general. In this article, we will revisit the principles and corollaries of COR theory that inform those more specific hypotheses and will review research in organizational behavior that has relied on the theory.","[{'authorId': '3475315', 'name': 'S.

Two hundred and fifty effects of the experimental induction of positive, elated and negative, depressed mood in adult, non-clinical samples were integrated. Effect sizes were generally larger for negative than for positive mood inductions. The presentation of a film or story turned out to be most effective in inducing both positive and negative mood states. The effects are especially large when subjects are explicitly instructed to enter the specified mood state. For elated mood, all other MIPs yielded considerably lower effectiveness scores. For the induction of negative mood states, Imagination, Velten, Music, Social Interaction and Feedback MIPs were about as effective as the Film/Story MIP without instruction. Induction effects covaried with several study characteristics. Effects tend to be smaller when demand characteristics are controlled or subjects are not informed about the purpose of the experiment. For behavioural measures, effects are smaller than for self-reports but still larger than zero. Hence, the effects of MIPs can be partly, but not fully due to demand effects.","[{'authorId': '30517729', 'name': 'R. Westermann'}, {'authorId': '2068262589', 'name': 'K.

ab8eae5f35e1eb60d48e1588163f38c0d798c9e0,"Abstract. Although not trained as treatment providers, teachers are increasingly faced with students who present challenging behavioral issues that require intervention. Teachers often resort to reactive and punitive strategies that have many negative side effects and drawbacks because they lack specific training in managing problem behavior in the classroom. Functional analysis and assessment approaches are commonly recommended by clinical researchers and have been demonstrated effective for managing problem behavior, but are sometimes impractical for regular classroom use. In this article, we propose a “keystone” approach to classroom management that may meet the clinical needs of children with challenging behavior while potentially serving as a more practical classroom alternative to commonly recommended strategies. With this approach, teachers are taught to focus on a circumscribed set of skills that have the potential to produce widespread improvement in child outcomes and render problem behavior unnecessary. Empirical support for individual components of this approach is discussed.","[{'authorId': '32619422', 'name': 'J.

The sample was drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and included children who were between 1 and 11 months in 1986. Findings suggested that boys characterized by high activity level and low levels of fear in infancy escalated in both externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Also, boys characterized by high fear and low activity level increased in internalizing symptoms and these effects seemed to be specific to depression rather than anxiety. Temperament did not predict escalation in externalizing symptomatology for girls, but low levels of fear predicted increases in internalizing symptoms. There was also evidence for a decline in depression specific symptoms for girls characterized by high fear and low activity in infancy. These findings suggest the importance of examining interactive models of temperament risk and considering gender specific pathways to behavior problems.","[{'authorId': '5150315', 'name': 'C.

To provide these ‘non-users’ with the best help, hearing care professionals need to have an in-depth understanding of the non-users’ beliefs and feelings with regard to the non-use. This qualitative study explored these beliefs and feelings in order to increase our understanding of hearing aid non-users. Design: Individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews were completed. Study sample: Eleven hearing aid owners (aged 54–80 years) who reported that they never or hardly ever used their hearing aids. Results: The participants expressed a variety of feelings towards their non-use, including indifference, self-annoyance, frustration, powerlessness, shame, and guilt. Their feelings were related to beliefs about: (1) the severity of their hearing handicap with and without hearing aids, (2) whom or what was responsible for the non-use, and (3) the attitudes of significant others towards the non-use. Conclusions: Hearing-aid non-users differ in their beliefs and feelings towards the non-use. A patient-centred approach is needed.","[{'authorId': '32365576', 'name': 'A. M.

Wally Social Problem-Solving Test and PARQ (Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire) were used in the study. It was observed that the mean scores that the children got from Wally Social Problem-Solving Test for the social problem-solving skills differed at a statistically significant level according to the low, medium, and high rejection levels that mothers got from the PARQ. According to the scores obtained from “warmth/affection”, “hostility/aggression”, and “undifferentiated rejection” subscales of PARQ, social problem-solving skill scores of the children in three groups, also differed in these three subscales depending on a rejection level of mothers. But it was determined that children’s social problem-solving skill scores did not differentiate according to the scores obtained from “indifference/neglect” subscale. This result proves that the interaction between the children and the mothers that accept their children positively contributes to ability of the children’s social problem-solving skills.","[{'authorId': '2098598692', 'name': 'Kezban Tepeli̇'}, {'authorId': '48213525', 'name': 'E.

Using circle time games, the study examined whether participating in a treatment group significantly improved behavioral self-regulation and early academic outcomes. Half of the children were randomly assigned to participate in 16 playgroups during the winter of the school year. Behavioral aspects of self-regulation and early achievement were assessed in the fall and spring. Although there was no treatment effect in the overall sample, post hoc analyses revealed that participation in the treatment group was significantly related to self-regulation gains in children who started the year with low levels of these skills. Children in the treatment group also demonstrated significant letter-word identification gains compared to children in the control group. Practice or Policy: The findings from this study provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy of the intervention in terms of improving preschoolers’ behavioral self-regulation for children low in these skills and improving letter-word identification. Although preliminary, these results have the potential to inform preschool curricula that emphasize behavioral self-regulation as a means of facilitating school readiness.","[{'authorId': '83342972', 'name': 'Shauna L.

ac6ef119a61919bd495ccb4493785463616f4987,"Sentiment analysis is the fundamental component in text-driven monitoring or forecasting systems, where the general sentiment towards real-world entities (e.g., people, products, organizations) are analyzed based on the sentiment signals embedded in a myriad of web text available today. Building such systems involves several practically important problems, from data cleansing (e.g., boilerplate removal, web-spam detection), and sentiment analysis at individual mention-level (e.g., phrase, sentence-, document-level) to the aggregation of sentiment for each entity-level (e.g., person, company) analysis. Most previous research in sentiment analysis however, has focused only on individual mention-level analysis, and there has been relatively less work that copes with other practically important problems for enabling a large-scale sentiment monitoring system. In this paper, we propose Empath, a new framework for evaluating entity-level sentiment analysis. Empath leverages objective measurements of entities in various domains such as people, companies, countries, movies, and sports, to facilitate entity-level sentiment analysis and tracking. We demonstrate the utility of Empath for the evaluation of a large-scale sentiment system by applying it to various lexicons using Lydia, our own large scale text-analytics tool, over a corpus consisting of more than a terabyte of newspaper data. We expect that Empath will encourage research that encompasses end-to-end pipelines to enable a large-scale text-driven monitoring and forecasting systems.","[{'authorId': '1719730', 'name': 'Charles B.

The present study tests the efficacy of a brief experiential training approach used to teach MI to child welfare social work students. We hypothesized that students exposed to the experimental training would demonstrate more MI adherent behaviors, experience less decay in skills at follow-up, and report higher levels of self-efficacy and positive attitude toward using MI. Method: Using a randomized controlled trial design, 54 students were assigned to either live supervision (LS) training with standardized clients (SC) or teaching-as-usual (TAU) online self-study. Students were assessed at 4 time points through self-reports and SC interviews. Audiotapes of interviews were coded using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity coding system to determine MI skills, adherent behaviors, and proficiency level. Results: No significant demographic differences were found between groups. The LS group demonstrated overall positive change across time and consistent improvement trends on MI skills. Although no statistical difference existed between groups on baseline proficiency levels, at the 5-month follow-up, a higher percentage of the LS group had maintained or improved compared with the TAU group, suggesting overall, less decay over time. No differences were found between groups or over time on self-efficacy or empathy, whereas self-reported attitudes towards MI improved in both groups over time. Conclusions: Results indicate LS is effective in teaching early stages of MI skills and is a promising training approach for social work students.

ace5cac60aac4362745050eb72cbf9280fb57e42,"BACKGROUND
Since the psychosocial effects of hearing loss are different in the spouse (SP) than in the person with hearing loss (PHL), it seems reasonable that rehabilitation programs designed for PHLs may need to be adapted to benefit SPs.


PURPOSE
To evaluate the effectiveness of training in communication strategies and psychosocial exercises for SPs of PHLs by determining whether SPs who completed the group class had improved mood, reduced stress, improved marital communication, and greater awareness of their partners' hearing loss-related quality of life (HL-QOL) in comparison with SPs who did not participate in a group class. Additionally, to determine whether PHLs of SPs who participated in a group audiological rehabilitation (AR) class had significantly improved mood, reduced stress, improved marital communication, and better HL-QOL scores in comparison with PHLs whose SPs did not participate in a group class.


RESEARCH DESIGN
A randomized controlled study.


STUDY SAMPLE
A total of 72 individuals participated in the study, 36 PHLs and 36 SPs. The PHLs were hearing aid users or cochlear implant users; the SPs had normal or near normal hearing.


INTERVENTION
PHLs in the control group participated in a traditional group AR program while their SPs received no treatment. PHLs in the experimental group also participated in a traditional group AR program while their SPs participated in a treatment program designed for SPs of PHLs. Classes consisted of 90 min sessions meeting once a week for four weeks.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
All participants completed questionnaires measuring HL-QOL (the SPs filled out third-party reports of HL-QOL), stress, mood (positive affect and negative affect), and communication in the marriage. Scales were completed three times: prior to the AR program, within two weeks after completing the AR program, and 6 mo later. SP awareness of their PHL's HL-QOL was measured by comparing preclass and 6 mo scores with reported critical difference values. Preclass, postclass and 6 mo data were examined with repeated measures ANOVAs.


RESULTS
All SPs reported significant improvements in third-party HL-QOL between the preclass and postclass visit. At the 6 mo visit, these reports remained consistent in the control SPs but declined in the experimental SPs. Awareness of HL-QOL in PHLs was improved in SPs who participated in AR classes and remained consistent in SPs who did not. All SPs demonstrated a trend (moderate effect sizes) for decreased stress and decreased negative affect after they and/or their partners completed the AR program. All PHLs demonstrated significant improvements in HL-QOL, significant reductions in stress, significant decreases in negative affect, and significant improvements in marital communication. There were no differences in outcome across the experimental and control PHLs.


CONCLUSIONS
When PHLs participate in an AR program, they receive significant improvements in QOL (quality of life). Congruence (as defined by similar scores) between SP and PHL assessments of HL-QOL improved in the experimental group, suggesting that the principal impact of the AR program on SPs was improved understanding of PHL experiences with hearing loss.","[{'authorId': '6212539', 'name': 'J.

Yet the very emotions that spur employees to express voice may compromise their ability to do so constructively, preventing managers from reacting favorably. I propose that to speak up frequently and constructively, employees need knowledge about effective strategies for managing emotions. Building on theories of emotion regulation, I develop a theoretical model that explains the role of managing emotions in the incidence and outcomes of voice. In a field study at a health care company, emotion regulation knowledge (1) predicted more frequent voice, (2) mediated by the emotional labor strategies of deep acting and surface acting, and (3) enhanced the contributions of voice to performance evaluations. These results did not generalize to helping behaviors, demonstrating that emotion regulation uniquely affects challenging but not affiliative interpersonal citizenship behaviors. This research introduces emotion regulation as a novel influence on voice and its consequences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","[{'authorId': '26973642', 'name': 'Adam M.

We examine the contribution of poor emotion regulation by comparing longitudinal data from children at risk of developmental language disorder (rDLD) and the general population. Method Data from the Millennium Cohort Study were analyzed at ages 3, 5, 7, 11, and 14 years. The rDLD group (children with parent-reported difficulties and/or a score of -1.5 SDs on the Naming Vocabulary subtest at age 5 years) was compared to a general population group on parent reports of emotion regulation, peer problems, and emotional problems. Results In line with the established literature, increased socioemotional problems in individuals with language difficulties were reported. Poor emotion regulation consistently predicted subsequent peer and emotional problems throughout development in both groups. Stronger cross-lag effects were found in the rDLD group for poor emotion regulation at age 3 years predicting age 5 years emotional problems and age 5 years emotional problems predicting age 7 years emotion regulation difficulties. Stronger reciprocal cross-lag effects were also observed in the rDLD group between peer and emotional problems at ages 3 and 5 years. No significant group differences were found in adolescence. Conclusions Poor emotion regulation makes a small but significant contribution to later peer and emotional difficulties, and this relationship is stronger in children at rDLD. Early reciprocal peer and emotional difficulties are also stronger in the rDLD group, but these effects dissipate in midchildhood. Nevertheless, the consistent relationship between early emotion regulation difficulties and socioemotional problems throughout development warrants further investigation in individuals with lower language skills.

Emotion regulation determines the offset of emotional responding and is thus distinct from emotional sensitivity, which determines the onset of emotional responding. Among the most viable categories for classifying emotion-regulation strategies are the targets and functions of emotion regulation. The emotion-generating systems that are targeted in emotion regulation include attention, knowledge, and bodily responses. The functions of emotion regulation include satisfying hedonic needs, supporting specific goal pursuits, and facilitating the global personality system. Emotion-regulation strategies are classified in terms of their targets and functions and relevant empirical work is reviewed. Throughout this review, emotion regulation emerges as one of the most far-ranging and influential processes at the interface of cognition and emotion.","[{'authorId': '3152131', 'name': 'S.

Abnormalities are usually reported in multiple sensory processing domains, showing a higher prevalence of unusual responses, particularly to tactile, auditory, and visual stimuli. This article discusses a novel robot-based framework designed to target sensory difficulties faced by children with ASD in a controlled setting. The setup consists of a number of sensory stations, together with two different robotic agents that navigate the stations and interact with the stimuli. These stimuli are designed to resemble real-world scenarios that form a common part of one's everyday experiences. Given the strong interest of children with ASD in technology in general and robots in particular, we attempt to utilize our robotic platform to demonstrate socially acceptable responses to the stimuli in an interactive, pedagogical setting that encourages the child's social, motor, and vocal skills, while providing a diverse sensory experience. A preliminary user study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework, with a total of 18 participants (5 with ASD and 13 typically developing) between the ages of 4 and 12 years.

The aim of this review is to offer more knowledge and better understanding of social network site addiction (SNS-addiction) among researchers as well as clinicians by presenting a narrative overview of the research field in terms of definition, measurement, antecedents, consequences, and treatment as well as recommendations for future research efforts. Seven different measures of SNS-addiction have been developed, although they have to a very little extent been validated against each other. The small number of studies conducted so far on this topic suggests that SNS-addiction is associated with health-related, academic, and interpersonal problems/issues. However such studies have relied on a simple cross-sectional study design. It is therefore hard to draw any conclusions about potential causality and long-term effects at this point, beyond hypothetical speculations. Empirical studies suggest that SNS-addiction is caused by dispositional factors (e.g., personality, needs, self-esteem), although relevant explanatory socio-cultural and behavioral reinforcement factors remain to be empirically explored. No well-documented treatment for SNS-addiction exists, but knowledge gained from Internet addiction treatment approaches might be transferable to SNS-addiction. Overall, the research on this topic is in its infancy, and as such the SNS-addiction construct needs further conceptual and empirical exploration.

ada5932260f4836488d7ee3223efa6bef79183f3,"Introduction: There is a need to assess the effects of interpersonal problem-solving and social competence on emotional regulation in adolescents. The research was investigating the effect of interpersonal problem-solving and social competence on emotional regulation in adolescents. Moreover, the impact of the study based on demographical variables was also explored. 
Objective: This study aimed to assess perceived interpersonal problem-solving and social competence in the emotional regulation of adolescents in Sialkot. 
Methodology: A sample of 345 adolescents with the age range of (11 to 20 years) was collected from various educational institutes in Sialkot through a random sampling technique. For collecting data, interpersonal problem solving, social competence, and emotional regulation, the Inventory of Interpersonal problems IIP-32, Social Competence Inventory, and Cognitive Emotional Regulation Questionnaire were used as assessment tools. Statistical analysis of correlational analysis, regression analysis, t-test, and descriptive analysis was applied to the collected data.  
Results: Results indicated that interpersonal problem-solving, and social competence significantly correlate with emotional regulation (r = 0.25**, **p<0.01, r = 0.31**, **p<0.01, r=0.42**, **p<0.01 respectively). Further applied analysis indicated that interpersonal problem-solving, and social competence also significantly predict emotional regulation among adolescents (β = 0.31 and β = 0.42, respectively). 
Conclusion: Results of current research concluded that emotional regulation positively correlates with interpersonal problem-solving and social competence. Further, interpersonal problem-solving, and social competence also positively correlates with each other.","[{'authorId': '2100500380', 'name': 'Anna Sharif'}, {'authorId': '9969579', 'name': 'Anum Shehzadi'}]",0.0,{'name': 'Journal of Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University'},0.0,Effects of perceived intrapersonal problem-solving and social competence on emotional regulation in adolescents,2023.0

Nonsmokers, non abstinent smokers, and abstinent smokers participated in a cue reactivity task where eyeblink startle amplitude and startle probe P300 (P3) suppression were measured during the presentation of emotional pictures.During unpleasant pictures, the amplitude of both measures was smaller in non abstinent smokers than in nonsmokers or abstinent smokers. P3 suppression, but not startle amplitude, was larger in abstinent smokers than in nonsmokers. Abstinence-induced increases in cigarette craving were associated with P3 suppression during tobacco-related pictures. Results suggest that tobacco abstinence increases emotional reactivity to unpleasant stimuli, which is consistent with negative reinforcement models of tobacco addiction.","[{'authorId': '3717886', 'name': 'J.

The reasons for these findings are reviewed, and integrating this review with two recent theories of emotions (Roseman, 1984; Scherer, 1982), we propose eight cognitive appraisal dimensions to differentiate emotional experience. In an investigation of this model, subjects recalled past experiences associated with each of 15 emotions, and rated them along the proposed dimensions. Six orthogonal dimensions, pleasantness, anticipated effort, certainty, attentional activity, self-other responsibility/control, and situational control, were recovered, and the emotions varied systematically along each of these dimensions, indicating a strong relation between the appraisal of one's circumstances and one's emotional state. The patterns of appraisal for the different emotions, and the role of each of the dimensions in differentiating emotional experience are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2110202993', 'name': 'Craig A.

Twenty-six participants with high trait psychopathy (HP) and 25 with low trait psychopathy (LP) were selected based on the primary psychopathy scale of the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale. HP participants were more likely to sacrifice one person to save others in sacrificial dilemmas and to pursue a personal advantage in everyday moral situations entailing harm to another's good. While deciding in these situations, HP participants experienced lower unpleasantness as compared to LP participants. Conversely, no group differences emerged in choice of action and unpleasantness ratings for everyday moral situations that did not entail harm to others. Importantly, moral judgements did not differ in the two groups. These results suggest that high psychopathy trait affects choices of action in sacrificial dilemmas because of reduced emotional reactivity to harmful acts. The dissociation between choice of action and moral judgement suggests that the former is more closely related to emotional experience. Also, emotion seems to play a critical role in discriminating harmful from harmless acts and in driving decisions accordingly.","[{'authorId': '4188325', 'name': 'Carolina Pletti'}, {'authorId': '2289262', 'name': 'L.

ae02b0357db2253a5dd43c3ac8f6f896eaf1029c,"Mathematical problem solving is among the most valuable aspects of mathematics education. It is also the hardest for elementary school students (Verschaffel, Greer & De Corte, 2000). Students experience cognitive and metacognitive difficulties in this area and develop negative emotions and poor motivation which hamper their efforts (Kramarski, Weiss, &┬aKololshi-Minsker, 2010). ┬a9ΓCo11 seems the critical stage for developing attitudes and emotional reactions towards mathematics (Artino, 2009). These metacognitive and motivational-emotional factors are fundamental components of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), a non-innate process requiring systematic, explicit student training (Pintrich, 2000; Zimmerman, 2000). Most self-regulation studies relating to problem-solving focus on metacognition. Few explore the motivational-emotional component. This study aimed to develop, examine, and compare two SRL interventions dealing with two additional components of self-regulation: metacognitive regulation (MC) and motivational-emotional regulation (ME). It also sought to examine the significance of these components and their contribution to learners' problem-solving achievements and self-regulation. The study examined 118 fifth grade students, randomly assigned to two groups. Pre- and post-intervention, the two groups completed self-regulation questionnaires relating to metacognition, motivation, and emotion. They also solved arithmetic series problems presented in two ways (verbal form and numeric form). After intervention we also examined a novel transfer problem. The intervention consisted of 10 hours for 5 weeks. Following the intervention the groups exhibited similar improvements across all the problems. The MC group performed best in metacognitive self-regulation and the ME group performed best in certain motivational-emotional aspects of self-regulation. Research implications are discussed.","[{'authorId': '1484660156', 'name': 'Meirav Tzohar-Rozen'}, {'authorId': '3345164', 'name': 'B.

Typically, emotion discovery from speech signals not only requires considerably less computational complexity than other modalities, but also at the same time in the overwhelming majority of studies the inclusion of speech modality increases the accuracy of the overall emotion estimation process.

Main outcome measures Injuries occurring during either PE class, leisure time PA or sports, and caused the child to at least stop the current activity were recorded prospectively. Individual weekly exposure was estimated from baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Potential risk factors were gender, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, habitual level of PA, body mass index and a motor fitness. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model was developed, accounting for clustering within schools. Results Gender, age and level of PA were independent significant risk factors for injury. Different modalities of PA had different injury risk factors. Most importantly, the low levels of habitual PA significantly increased injury risk. Conclusions The children at highest injury risk are the target audience of the contemporary PA promotion efforts.

b05e82330f5b546e9b6a6fe25495e22fc5929e27,"Abstract Metrics of heart period variability are widely used in the behavioral and biomedical sciences, although somewhat confusingly labeled as heart rate variability (HRV). Despite their wide use, HRV metrics are usually analyzed and interpreted without reference to prevailing levels of cardiac chronotropic state (i.e., mean heart rate or mean heart period). This isolated treatment of HRV metrics is nontrivial. All HRV metrics routinely used in the literature exhibit a known and positive relationship with the mean duration of the interval between two beats (heart period): as the heart period increases, so does its variability. This raises the question of whether HRV metrics should be “corrected” for the mean heart period (or its inverse, the heart rate). Here, we outline biological, quantitative, and interpretive issues engendered by this question. We provide arguments that HRV is neither uniformly nor simply a surrogate for heart period. We also identify knowledge gaps that remain to be satisfactorily addressed with respect to assumptions underlying existing HRV correction approaches. In doing so, we aim to stimulate further progress toward the rigorous use and disciplined interpretation of HRV. We close with provisional guidance on HRV reporting that acknowledges the complex interplay between the mean and variability of the heart period.","[{'authorId': '2074222660', 'name': 'E.

In this paper, we present Transfer-based Expression Recognition Generative Adversarial Network (TER-G AN) that combines the effectiveness of a novel feature disentanglement technique with the concept of identity-invariant expression representation learning for FER. More specifically, TER-GAN learns a disentangled expression representation by extracting expression features from one image and transferring the expression information to the identity of another image. To improve the feature disentanglement process and to learn an identity-invariant expression representation, we introduce a novel expression consistency loss and an identity consistency loss that exploit expression and identity information from both real and synthetic images. We evaluated the performance of our proposed facial expression recognition technique by employing four public facial expression databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, MMI, BU-3DFE.

However, there has been no empirical review of the literature on gender and facial, vocal, and behavioral expressions of different types of emotions in children. The present study constitutes a comprehensive meta-analytic review of gender differences and moderators of differences in emotion expression from infancy through adolescence. We analyzed 555 effect sizes from 166 studies with a total of 21,709 participants. Significant but very small gender differences were found overall, with girls showing more positive emotions (g = -.08) and internalizing emotions (e.g., sadness, anxiety, sympathy; g = -.10) than boys, and boys showing more externalizing emotions (e.g., anger; g = .09) than girls. Notably, gender differences were moderated by age, interpersonal context, and task valence, underscoring the importance of contextual factors in gender differences. Gender differences in positive emotions were more pronounced with increasing age, with girls showing more positive emotions than boys in middle childhood (g = -.20) and adolescence (g = -.28). Boys showed more externalizing emotions than girls at toddler/preschool age (g = .17) and middle childhood (g = .13) and fewer externalizing emotions than girls in adolescence (g = -.27). Gender differences were less pronounced with parents and were more pronounced with unfamiliar adults (for positive emotions) and with peers/when alone (for externalizing emotions).

In the visuospatial domain, positive affect impaired visual selective attention by increasing processing of spatially adjacent flanking distractors, suggesting an increase in the scope of visuospatial attention. During positive states, individual differences in enhanced semantic access were correlated with the degree of impaired visual selective attention.

Deficits in emotion perception and social skill have been well established in schizophrenia; however, little is known about the extent of these deficits across the course of the illness; that is, prior to illness onset and as the duration of the illness increases. Method. We compared emotion perception (i.e., the Face Emotion Identification Task [FEIT] and Face Emotion Discrimination Task [FEDT]; Kerr & Neale, 1993) and social skill (Conversation Probe role-play test) performance in four groups: individuals “at risk” for psychosis who met criteria for a prodromal state, individuals early in the course of a schizophrenia spectrum illness (SSI), individuals with a chronic SSI, and healthy control individuals. Results. At-risk individuals did not significantly differ from control participants on emotion perception measures; however, early and chronic SSI groups performed significantly worse than controls, although not different from one another. Conversely, there was evidence that deficits in social skill are present prior to illness onset. Consistent with the findings for the emotion perception tasks, early and chronic SSI groups showed comparable levels of social skill impairment. Conclusion. Social skill deficits may be a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia, and it appears that the initial psychotic episode represents a critical point for the emergence of emotion perception deficits in schizophrenia spectrum illnesses.","[{'authorId': '2728427', 'name': 'A.

The telemedicine setup included two PC-based PictureTel systems at 128 kilibits per second (kbps). Success was defined by (1) decreasing depressive symptoms at similar rates in both the VC group and the F2F group and (2) demonstrating the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial in telemental health. Children were assessed for childhood depression using the mood section of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present Episode (K-SADS-P). Twenty-eight children were randomized to either F2F or VC treatment. The participants completed the K-SADS-P and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) at pre- and post-treatment. The CBT treatment across the two conditions was effective. The overall response rate based on post-evaluation with the K-SADS-P was 82%.

The author proposes a tripartite approach in which theories of the self are grouped into three broad categories: content, structure, and process. Content refers to knowledge and information about the self, structure to the way that information is organised, and process to the ways in which individuals attend to and regulate the self. Structure has been largely neglected to date, and the author outlines ways in which the structural organisation of self-knowledge could contribute to social anxiety. High social anxiety is associated with low clarity about the self and with more uncertainty about self-judgments. Structure interacts with content, and in the final part of the article potential interactions among imagery, self-concept, and self-structure are discussed.","[{'authorId': '3948102', 'name': 'Lusia L.

This work proposes to analyze the neuronal activity related to the discrimination of emotional prosodies in autistic children (aged 9 to 11-year-old) as follows. Firstly, a database for single words uttered in Mexican Spanish by males, females, and children will be created. Then, optimal acoustic features for emotion characterization will be extracted, followed of a cubic kernel function Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to validate the speech corpus. As a result, human-specific acoustic properties of emotional voice signals will be identified. Secondly, those identified acoustic properties will be modified to synthesize the recorded human emotional voices. Thirdly, both human and synthesized utterances will be used to study the electroencephalographic correlate of affective prosody processing in typically developed and autistic children. Finally, and on the basis of the outcomes, synthesized voice-enhanced environments will be created to develop an intervention based on social-robot and Social StoryTM for autistic children to improve affective prosodies discrimination.

If a human can do this, how is it possible to create an emotionally interactive robot that will induce empathy from a human? As interest in emotional interactions with robots is increasing, the answers to these questions are increasingly sought by researchers in HRI. As a starting point to find these answers, three hypotheses are investigated in this paper. An experiment with ten-year old children was performed to analyze the three hypotheses. The results showed that humans can empathize with a robot when the robot expresses emotions through the use of bruise colors and speech. It was also found that the bruised color expression as used here can induce a human to empathize with a robot as much as speech expression. Additionally, no gender difference was noted when a human empathized with an emotional expressing robot.","[{'authorId': '145391043', 'name': 'E. Kim'}, {'authorId': '1743779', 'name': 'Sonya S.

Self-compassion entails three main components: (a) self-kindness—being kind and understanding toward oneself in instances of pain or failure rather than being harshly self-critical, (b) common humanity—perceiving one's experiences as part of the larger human experience rather than seeing them as separating and isolating, and (c) mindfulness—holding painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness rather than over-identifying with them. Self-compassion is an emotionally positive self-attitude that should protect against the negative consequences of self-judgment, isolation, and rumination (such as depression). Because of its non-evaluative and interconnected nature, it should also counter the tendencies towards narcissism, self-centeredness, and downward social comparison that have been associated with attempts to maintain self-esteem. The relation of self-compassion to other psychological constructs is examined, its links to psychological functioning are explored, and potential group differences in self-compassion are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2969088', 'name': 'K.

We argue that these change appraisals are associated with psychological contract violation, which in turn is associated with intentions to leave the organization, and, ultimately, with voluntary employee turnover. In 2009, we collected data over three measurement periods from 252 full-time, permanent employees from a manufacturing organization in the Philippines that was just about to undergo an organizational-wide restructuring. At Time 1 (T1, the change announcement), employees completed a survey assessing their change history in the organization and change appraisals. At Time 2 (T2, six months after the announcement), employees completed a survey assessing psychological contract violation and turnover intentions. Two years later (Time 3, T3), we collected data on voluntary employee turnover. Results suggest that a poor change history in an organization was negatively associated with challenge appraisals and was positively associated with threat and harm appraisals. Challenge and harm appraisals were significantly associated with psychological contract violation. These appraisals, in turn, were associated with turnover intentions and, ultimately, with voluntary employee turnover. In addition, T1 threat appraisals were directly positively associated with T3 voluntary turnover.

There is evidence that high cognitive test scores are likely to result not only from high cognitive skills but also from high motivation and adequate personality traits. This suggests that part of the contribution of cognitive skills to economic growth could be due to personality traits. Across large parts of the literature, there is consensus that non cognitive skills have important effects both on school attainment and on labour market outcomes. These effects might be as important as the effects of cognitive skills. Less consensus exists on the malleability of non cognitive skills, with some arguing that these skills can be altered until the end of teenage years and others claiming that emotional intelligence can be changed at any age. Most of what economists know about the technology of non cognitive skill formation concerns early educational levels, such as preschools and schools. While it is difficult to argue that all relevant skill formation ends before labour market entry, there is scant evidence on the role of the workplace in the maintenance and development of existing skills. Clearly, more research in this area is needed.","[{'authorId': '4860123', 'name': 'G.

Impairments in joint attention are among the earliest signs of the disorder and joint attention skills relate to outcome, both in the 'natural course' of autism and through being targeted in early intervention programmes. In the current study, concurrent and longitudinal associations between joint attention and other social communication abilities measured in a sample of infants with autism and related pervasive developmental disorders at age 20 months, and language and symptom severity at age 42 months, were examined. Extending the findings from previous studies, joint attention ability was positively associated with language gains and (lower) social and communication symptoms, and imitation ability was also positively associated with later language. Some specificity in the association between different aspects of joint attention behaviours and outcome was found: declarative, triadic gaze switching predicted language and symptom severity but imperative, dyadic eye contact behaviours did not. Further, although joint attention was associated with later social and language symptoms it was unrelated to repetitive and stereotyped symptoms, suggesting the latter may have a separate developmental trajectory. Possible deficits in psychological and neurological processes that might underlie the impaired development of joint attention in autism are discussed.","[{'authorId': '3692247', 'name': 'T.

Healthcare workers play an essential role and are one of the most exposed groups. Information about the psychosocial impact on healthcare workers is limited. Methods 3109 healthcare workers completed a national, internet-based, cross-sectional 45-item survey between 9 and 19 April 2020. The objective is to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spanish healthcare workers. A Psychological Stress and Adaptation at work Score (PSAS) was defined combining four modified versions of validated psychological assessment tests (A) Healthcare Stressful Test, (B) Coping Strategies Inventory, (C) Font-Roja Questionnaire and (D) Trait Meta-Mood Scale. Results The highest psychosocial impact was perceived in Respiratory Medicine, the mean (S.D.) PSAS was 48.3 (13.6) and Geriatrics 47.6 (16.4). Higher distress levels were found in the geographical areas with the highest incidence of COVID-19 (>245.5 cases per 100 000 people), PSAS 46.8 (15.2); p < 0.001. The least stress respondents were asymptomatic workers PSAS, 41.3 (15.4); p < 0.001, as well as those above 60 years old, PSAS, 37.6 (16); p < 0.001. Workers who needed psychological therapy and did not receive it, were more stressed PSAS 52.5 (13.6) than those who did not need it PSAS 39.7 (13.9); p < 0.001. Conclusions The psychological impact in healthcare workers in Spain during COVID-19 emergency has been studied. The stress perceived is parallel to the number of cases per 100 000 people. Psychotherapy could have a major role to mitigate the experimented stress level.","[{'authorId': '1697871816', 'name': 'C. Romero'}, {'authorId': '152419782', 'name': 'C.

b4b9991e466d94b95617f7718e58bb3c339f405b,"Inhibitory control describes the suppression of goal-irrelevant stimuli and behavioral responses. Current developmental taxonomies distinguish between Response Inhibition – the ability to suppress a prepotent motor response, and Attentional Inhibition – the ability to resist interference from distracting stimuli. Response Inhibition and Attentional Inhibition have exhibited moderately strong positive correlations in previous studies, suggesting they are closely related cognitive abilities. These results may reflect the use of cognitive tasks combining Stimulus–Stimulus- and Stimulus–Response-conflict as indicators of both constructs, which may have conflated their empirical association. Additionally, previous statistical modeling studies have not controlled for individual differences in Working Memory Capacity, which may account for some of the empirical overlap between Response Inhibition and Attentional Inhibition. The aim of the current study was to test a hierarchical model of inhibitory control that specifies Working Memory Capacity as a higher-order cognitive construct. Response Inhibition and Attentional Inhibition were conceptualized as lower-order cognitive mechanisms that should be empirically independent constructs apart from their shared reliance on Working Memory Capacity for active maintenance of goal-relevant representations. Measures of performance on modified stimulus–response compatibility tasks, complex memory span, and non-selective stopping tasks were obtained from 136 preadolescent children (M = 11 years, 10 months, SD = 8 months). Consistent with hypotheses, results from Structural Equation Modeling demonstrated that the Response Inhibition and Attentional Inhibition factors were empirically independent constructs that exhibited partial statistical dependence on the Working Memory Capacity factor. These findings have important implications for current theories and models of inhibitory control during development.","[{'authorId': '51144319', 'name': 'J.

Furthermore, Dr. Barkley has included in Appendix I, at the end of chapter 1, an International Consensus Statement on ADHD that he and many other experts coauthored in 2002, which does much to dispel many of the myths about ADHD propagated in the media and by some special interest groups. The book is very well written, well edited, and well referenced and includes material dated through the year 2004 and some references from 2005. The lag between the date of these articles and the publication date of this book in 2006 is to be expected, given the long lead time for the compilation and publication of textbooks. Lastly, there is now an accompanying “Clinical Workbook” that provides many useful forms and rating scales for the busy practitioner. Dr. Barkley invited back all of the principal authors of chapters from the 1998 edition of the book, and some chapters were written by other experts. The first-time reader of any edition of this book will find the initial chapters particularly fascinating, especially chapter 1 on the history of ADHD, as these chapters summarize trends and changes in the field that have occurred since the 1930s. It is also noteworthy in this era of massive textbooks with multiple contributors that Part I of this book on the “Nature of ADHD,” with 7 chapters, is written and updated entirely by Dr. Barkley. This section forms a solid basis upon which the other 2 sections of the book, “Assessment” and “Treatment,” can build. A high point in the first part of the book is Dr. Barkley’s conceptual, theoretical model of self-regulation and executive dysfunction presented in chapter 7, which integrates quite well extant research findings in imaging, neurobiology, and neuropsychology. Part II of this new edition, “Assessment,” includes 4 expanded and improved chapters on topics such as the diagnostic interview, rating scales, tests, and the assessment of adults with ADHD. There is also an expanded chapter 10, which includes 10 clinical cases presented to integrate and facilitate the development of diagnosis and treatment strategies. This chapter will be particularly useful for clinicians, since it presents a variety of cases of ADHD and the common or challenging psychiatric comorbid disorders such as oppositional defiant, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Part III, “Treatment,” includes 11 chapters on interventions, such as medications, psychotherapy, and psychoeducation for patients and their families. A particularly well written chapter is chapter 20 on combined child therapies, in which Dr. Barkley and his coauthors review findings from the historic National Institute of Mental Health Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD. There are a few minor suggestions for the next edition that would make this already valuable book even better. Expansion of the number of figures and tables, particularly in the section on treatment, and the addition of flowcharts to aid in decision making would highlight key recommendations in the text. It would also be helpful if such decision trees included further recommendations or even algorithms on addressing the psychiatric comorbid disorders such as tic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the others described in chapter 10. The author index is valuable; perhaps one comprehensive bibliography at the end of the book might reduce some redundancy incurred with the individual chapter bibliographies. In this era of the Internet, a future edition could include a CD-ROM or a linked Web page, where at least the bibliography would be incorporated so as to facilitate retrieval of the primary research articles and references for future research. In summary, this new edition is a compelling update to a vast and ever-growing literature on a very prevalent, potentially devastating disorder. We highly recommend this book to clinicians and investigators in mental health.","[{'authorId': '78492807', 'name': 'L. Silver'}]",2994.0,,0.0,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

The aim of our study was to analyze child-related factors in preschool that facilitate a positive behavioral adaptation in the transitional period to elementary school. A cluster analysis was conducted with the data from 406 preschoolers, in order to identify profiles based on self-regulation skills, social-emotional competences, and externalizing behavior problems. Using structural equation modeling, we then tested a regression model to examine which preschool profile adequately manages to adapt their behavior for elementary school. The profile clustering showed that behavior problems occurred when self-regulation skills were low, despite existing (moderate) social-emotional competences. Moreover, low levels of self-regulation skills in preschool predicted difficulties in behavioral adaptation at school, especially concerning hyperactivity, even when children possessed moderate social-emotional competences. Practice or Policy: Most notably, the results reinforce the relevance of promoting early self-regulation skills to support children in their behavioral adaptation process during the transitional period from preschool to elementary school.","[{'authorId': '2060612544', 'name': 'Annika Rademacher'}, {'authorId': '117313968', 'name': 'Naska Goagoses'}, {'authorId': '46901530', 'name': 'S.

As a starting point, Frenzel’s model of teacher emotions and Pekrun’s control-value theory of achievement emotions were used. The sample consisted of 16 experienced and pedagogically advanced teachers who participated in semi-structured interviews. After abductive content analyses, both positive and negative emotions were detected corresponding to Frenzel’s and Pekrun’s models. The main sources of emotions were validity of assessment, assessment methods, pedagogical development and assessment culture. This preliminary study indicates that assessment evokes both positive and negative emotions, and that validity of assessment is a prominent issue in evoking these emotions. Pedagogical training should deal with emotions and their regulation in assessment to help teachers in higher education to cope with negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '2582198', 'name': 'Liisa Myyry'}, {'authorId': '1398877620', 'name': 'T.

Dr. Lazarus and his collaborator, Dr. Susan Folkman, present here a detailed theory of psychological stress, building on the concepts of cognitive appraisal and coping which have become major themes of theory and investigation. As an integrative theoretical analysis, this volume pulls together two decades of research and thought on issues in behavioral medicine, emotion, stress management, treatment, and life span development. A selective review of the most pertinent literature is included in each chapter. The total reference listing for the book extends to 60 pages. This work is necessarily multidisciplinary, reflecting the many dimensions of stress-related problems and their situation within a complex social context.

Fun science activities, designed to enhance students’ motivation for science, provided the context for examining the relationship between group members’ shared positive emotions and their engagement in collaborative learning of scientific concepts. Data for this study were: self-reports of emotions in several activities (class) and video footage of groups’ interactions with follow-up interviews (selected groups). The identification of distinct types and sources of emotions supported Fredrickson’s (1998, “What Good are Positive Emotions?” Review of General Psychology 2 (3): 300–319) case for distinguishing between joy-related and interest-related positive emotions. Students’ emotional experiences and degree of subsequent engagement in collaborative learning of scientific concepts appeared to be influenced by the characteristics of the groups and of the activities (e.g. if competitive). The critical importance of harnessing joy-related emotions and promoting interest-related emotions in collaborative science learning is highlighted.","[{'authorId': '46859385', 'name': 'S.

This purpose of this study was to investigate the lexical and semantic fast mapping ability of young children with specific language impairment (SLI) and normal language (NL), with a specific emphasis on the influence of phonological factors.


METHOD
The study included 46 children (mean age 58 months), half with SLI and half with NL. Children were asked to fast map visual information only, visual-plus-nonlinguistic-auditory information, and visual-plus-linguistic-auditory information. A mixed design was used to compare children across and within groups.


RESULTS
Children with SLI performed worse than children with NL overall. The SLI group showed specific deficits in semantic fast mapping when they saw visual information only. This condition may have disrupted encoding because it varied from the expected auditory and visual pattern. The children with SLI also performed poorly when they were asked to map phonotactically infrequent linguistic information and when the difficulty of the task increased. A nonword repetition task was correlated with both semantic and lexical fast mapping.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings are discussed in the light of their support for a limited capacity model of processing, as well as the impact of phonology on word learning.","[{'authorId': '143675250', 'name': 'Mary Alt'}, {'authorId': '144427505', 'name': 'E.

However, little is known about the psychological impact of the quarantine during this pandemic. The aim of this study is to assess the emotional impact of the lockdown measures imposed by the Argentinian government to fight the virus. For this, a survey was distributed on social network. We surveyed the Argentinian general population twice: 2 days after the mandatory quarantine started (time 1), and 2 weeks later (time 2). Anxiety levels were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II; and affect was assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. A total of 6057 people answered both surveys. In addition, different socio-demographic factors were considered, such as risk factors for COVID-19, age, gender, educational level, variation in family income due to quarantine, number of children, whether they have older adults in charge or not and the number of hours viewing information about COVID-19. Statistically significant variations were observed between the two time points. The effect size, however, was very small. Depression tends to increase slightly, while levels of anxiety and affect (positive and negative) tend to decrease. Also, some slight differences related to the socio-demographic factors were found. Findings suggests that sustaining the lockdown measures could have a larger effect on mental health in the long term. It is necessary to continue monitoring emotional distress and other related mental health problems on the general population. It is also necessary to create programs aimed at promoting mental health, and to distribute information about it.","[{'authorId': '1996671607', 'name': 'L.

There has not yet been a national population-based study in England of the risk of suicide after cancer diagnosis. Objectives To quantify suicide risk in patients with cancers in England and identify risk factors that may assist in needs-based psychological assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants Population-based study using data from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service in England linked to death certification data of 4 722 099 individuals (22 million person-years at risk). Patients (aged 18-99 years) with cancer diagnosed from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2015, with follow-up until August 31, 2017, were included. Exposures Diagnosis of malignant tumors, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures All deaths in patients that received a verdict of suicide or an open verdict at the inquest. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated. Results Of the 4 722 099 patients with cancer, 50.3% were men and 49.7% were women. A total of 3 509 392 patients in the cohort (74.3%) were aged 60 years or older when the diagnosis was made. A total of 2491 patients (1719 men and 772 women) with cancer died by suicide, representing 0.08% of all deaths during the follow-up period. The overall SMR for suicide was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.16-1.25) and the AER per 10 000 person-years was 0.19 (95% CI, 0.15-0.23). The risk was highest among patients with mesothelioma, with a 4.51-fold risk corresponding to 4.20 extra deaths per 10 000 person-years. This risk was followed by pancreatic (3.89-fold), esophageal (2.65-fold), lung (2.57-fold), and stomach (2.20-fold) cancer. Suicide risk was highest in the first 6 months following cancer diagnosis (SMR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.52-2.98). Conclusions and Relevance Despite low absolute numbers, the elevated risk of suicide in patients with certain cancers is a concern, representing potentially preventable deaths. The increased risk in the first 6 months after diagnosis may indicate an unmet need for psychological support. The findings of this study suggest a need for improved psychological support for all patients with cancer, and attention to modifiable risk factors, such as pain, particularly in specific cancer groups.","[{'authorId': '144673110', 'name': 'Katherine E Henson'}, {'authorId': '40455798', 'name': 'R.

Tests were administered to 31 4- and 5-year-old children with SLI and 31 age-matched controls with normal language (NL). All children spoke General American English. Despite moderate to strong inter-test correlations, no test was a strong identifier of SLI. The group with SLI scored lower than the NL group on each test; however, the individual scores of children with SLI typically fell within the normal range. Vocabulary tests are frequently administered to determine whether a child's language skills require further evaluation (screening), as a method of identifying SLI in children, or simply to describe aspects of language functioning. These purposes for administering a vocabulary test require various forms of empirical evidence in support of their use. Our data support construct validity for the four vocabulary tests examined, but do not support their use for identification purposes. Clinicians must apply a degree of sophistication in evaluating the evidence presented for test validity relative to the purposes for which the test will be administered. Unfortunately, although many test manuals offer inter-test correlations or statistically significant group differences as evidence of construct validity, they often omit data that would support common clinical uses, such as screening or identification.","[{'authorId': '34538195', 'name': 'S.

Following refinement by cognitive testing, items were field-tested in students and instructors of mind-body approaches. Final item selection was achieved by submitting the field test data to an iterative process using multiple validation methods, including exploratory cluster and confirmatory factor analyses, comparison between known groups, and correlations with established measures of related constructs.

It is contended that breach of psychological contracts and affective organizational commitment mediate this relationship. Questionnaires were distributed to 270 teachers in 10 high schools located in the north of Israel; 210 usable questionnaires were returned. One of the important results of this study is the relationship of burnout to the two dimensions of CWBs (interpersonal and organizational). Job burnout was found to be positively and strongly related (based on very high coefficients) to both dimensions. While we did predict that burnout would be related to CWBs, the strength of this relationship was not expected. The findings also show no effect of organizational justice and some effect of perceptions of organizational politics. Psychological contract breach was found to be related to interpersonal but not organizational CWBs. The proposed mediation relationships are partially supported. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research on this issue and notes the practical implications of the findings.","[{'authorId': '145509585', 'name': 'A.

This study set out to explore how mental health symptoms in children and adolescents changed over a month of full lockdown in the United Kingdom in response to the pandemic. Methods UK‐based parents and carers (n = 2673) of school‐aged children and young people aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their child's mental health at two time points between March and May 2020, during early lockdown. The survey examined changes in emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention. Results The findings highlighted particular deteriorations in mental health symptoms among preadolescent children, which translated to a 10% increase in those meeting possible/probable caseness criteria for emotional symptoms, a 20% increase in hyperactivity/inattention, and a 35% increase in conduct problems. In contrast, changes among adolescents were smaller (4% and 8% increase for hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems, respectively) with a small reduction in emotional symptoms (reflecting a 3% reduction in caseness). Overall, there were few differences in change in symptoms or caseness over time according to demographic characteristics, but children and young people in low income households and those with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders exhibited elevated symptoms (and caseness) at both time points. Conclusions The findings highlight important areas of concern in terms of the potential impact of the first national lockdown on children and young people's adjustment. Developing an understanding of who has been most severely affected by the pandemic, and in what ways, is crucial in order to target effective support where it is most needed.","[{'authorId': '40277093', 'name': 'Polly Waite'}, {'authorId': '50708689', 'name': 'S.

b85de3c440413c7e55cab160027f1f695e52429d,"Emotion regulation (ER) is a basic psychological process that has been broadly linked to psychosocial adjustment. Due to its relationship with psychosocial adjustment, a significant number of instruments have been developed to assess emotion regulation in a reliable and valid manner. Among these, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross and John, 2003) is one of the most widely used, having shown good psychometric properties with adult samples from different cultures. Studies of validation in children and adolescents are, however, scarce and have only been developed for the Australian and Portuguese populations. The aim of this study was to validate the Spanish version of the ERQ for use in adolescents and determine possible differences according to the gender and age of young people. The sample consisted of 2060 adolescents (52.1% boys). Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA), multi-group analysis and Two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were performed and the percentiles calculated. The results of the AFE and CFA corroborated the existence of two factors related to the emotion regulation strategies of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, showing acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Both factors also showed good criterion validity with personality traits, self-esteem, and social anxiety. Differences in cognitive reappraisal were found with regard to age, with younger students exhibiting the greatest mastery of this strategy. Gender differences were observed regarding the expressive suppression strategy, with boys being more likely to use this strategy than girls. A gender-age interaction effect was also observed, revealing that the use of the expressive suppression strategy did not vary by age in girls, and was more widely used by boys aged 12–14 years than those aged 15–16 years. However, we found evidence of measurement invariance across sex and age groups. The results suggest that the ERQ is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used to evaluate emotion regulation strategies in adolescents.","[{'authorId': '1405022955', 'name': 'Olga Gómez-Ortiz'}, {'authorId': '6551586', 'name': 'E.

We then focus on effortful or executive aspects of attention, reviewing research on temperamental individual differences and important pathways to normal and pathological development. Pathologies of development may arise when regulatory and reactive systems fail to reach the balance that allows for both self-expression and socially acceptable behavior.

According to Krashen’s affective filter hypothesis, emotions act as a vital element in language acquisition (1981). Due to characteristics of online techniques, emotions can be experienced quite differently from the traditional face-to-face teaching mode. Although many studies have researched on the relations between emotions and online learning, between emotions and language learning, there are few touching on the emotions concerned with language learning in a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. This study, by surveying the products of related researchers, attempts to figure out strategies for language learners to regulate emotions in the computer-supported collaborative learning environment. Strategies are organised based on social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence.

b9176f011b58b07553d282ffe31a6476ef64c6fd,"Abstract Online social networks (OSNs) continue to have a transformative influence on how people socialize, partially because they help facilitate social contact that is crucial to fulfilling an innate need to belong. However, there is increasing evidence that some users suffer from OSN addiction, expressed as OSN obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Using the need-to-belong theory as our foundation, we seek a deeper understanding of the relationship between OSN belongingness and OSN OCD by examining the effects that OSN-specific uses and gratifications (U&Gs) and negative emotions have on it. We find that OSN belongingness is positively associated with use of the OSN to gratify needs for purposive value, self-discovery, maintaining interpersonal interconnectivity, social enhancement, and entertainment value. However, gratification of only the purposive value and social enhancement needs increases the likelihood of OSN OCD. Furthermore, we find that while OSN belongingness decreases the likelihood of OSN envy and anxiety, it slightly increases the likelihood of OSN fear of missing out; notably, all three of these negative emotions drive OSN OCD. Our findings indicate that healthy socialization use by well-adjusted individuals decreases OSN OCD risks, but those experiencing unstable emotional responses or unhealthy socialization on the OSN should avoid use.","[{'authorId': '1707112', 'name': 'T.

Discrete emotions theories assume that neural, affective, and cognitive processes differ across specific emotions and that each emotion has particular motivational and regulatory functions. Thus, efforts at regulation should target the specific dysregulated emotions. The positive effects of emotion regulation are more likely to be optimized when they result from or lead to emotion utilization—the constructive use of the energy of emotion arousal. Effective processes for regulation differ for basic emotions and emotion schemas. This article identifies neural systems that facilitate emotion experiences and emotion regulation processes. It considers the implications of the developmental change from basic emotions to emotion schemas, and also briefly discusses the effects of interventions on changes in emotion knowledge, emotion regulation, and social and emotional competence.","[{'authorId': '38430881', 'name': 'C.

They regulate social interaction and in extension, the social sphere. In turn, processes in the social sphere regulate emotions of individuals and groups. In other words, intrapersonal processes project in the interpersonal space, and inversely, interpersonal experiences deeply influence intrapersonal processes. Thus, I argue that the concepts of emotion generation and regulation should not be artificially separated. Similarly, interpersonal emotions should not be reduced to interacting systems of intraindividual processes. Instead, we can consider emotions at different social levels, ranging from dyads to large scale e-communities. The interaction between these levels is complex and does not only involve influences from one level to the next. In this sense the levels of emotion/regulation are messy and a challenge for empirical study. In this article, I discuss the concepts of emotions and regulation at different intra- and interpersonal levels. I extend the concept of auto-regulation of emotions (Kappas, 2008, 2011a,b) to social processes. Furthermore, I argue for the necessity of including mediated communication, particularly in cyberspace in contemporary models of emotion/regulation. Lastly, I suggest the use of concepts from systems dynamics and complex systems to tackle the challenge of the “messy layers.”","[{'authorId': '1742554', 'name': 'Arvid Kappas'}]",53.0,,117.0,Social regulation of emotion: messy layers,2013.0

This paper discusses a novel framework designed to improve human-robot interaction through robotic imitation of a participant’s gestures. In our experiment, a humanoid robotic agent socializes with and plays games with a participant. For the experimental group, the robot additionally imitates one of the participant’s novel gestures during a play session. We hypothesize that the robot’s use of imitation will increase the participant’s openness towards engaging with the robot. Experimental results from a user study of 12 subjects show that post-imitation, experimental subjects displayed a more positive emotional state, had higher instances of mood contagion towards the robot, and interpreted the robot to have a higher level of autonomy than their control group counterparts did. These results point to an increased participant interest in engagement fueled by personalized imitation during interaction.","[{'authorId': '35500438', 'name': 'R.

This review examines theoretical and empirical evidence describing the role that personality traits play in shaping individuals' intrapersonal and interpersonal regulation styles. We define and delineate personality traits and emotion regulation and summarize empirical relations between them. Specifically, we review research on the Big Five personality traits in relation to each stage of Gross' (2015) extended process model of emotion regulation. In doing so, we document evidence concerning the relationships between personality traits and three key stages of emotion regulation, namely, identification (i.e., choosing which emotions to regulate), selection (i.e., choosing a broad regulatory approach), and implementation (i.e., adopting specific regulatory tactics). Finally, we make recommendations for future research that we hope will guide researchers in building a systematic understanding of how personality traits shape intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulation.

We suggest that the reason some judge such scenarios as wrong (using intuitive feelings) and others do not (using deliberative reasons) is due to an important motivational distinction. Consistent with this view, across 7 studies, we demonstrate that negative judgments of such moral scenarios are more intense when processed in the promotion focus compared to the prevention focus, and that this is due to differences in whether eager (intuitive feelings) versus vigilant (deliberative reasons) means are employed in judging these moral wrongs. By examining both boundary conditions and possible underlying mechanisms for regulatory focus differences in moral judgment intensity, we expand our understanding of the differences between promotion and prevention regarding how proscriptive judgments are processed, while integrating these differences with existing theories in moral psychology.","[{'authorId': '37829823', 'name': 'James F.

The term 'distress' is frequently used in nursing literature to describe patient discomfort related to signs and symptoms of acute or chronic illness, pre- or post-treatment anxiety or compromised status of fetuses or the respiratory system. 'Psychological distress' may more accurately describe the patient condition to which nurses respond than does the term 'distress'. Psychological distress is seldom defined as a distinct concept and is often embedded in the context of strain, stress and distress. This creates confusion for nurses attempting to manage the care of people experiencing psychological distress.


AIMS
This paper is a concept analysis of psychological distress based on Walker and Avant's (1995) criteria that identifies the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of psychological distress based upon the findings of the literature review. In addition, empirical references are identified and constructed cases presented.


METHODS
A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid, PsychINFO, and Cancer Lit databases over the last 50 years. The purposes of this concept analysis were: (1) to establish the concept of psychological distress as a clear and distinct concept, separate from strain, stress and distress, and (2) to provide nurses with a base of knowledge from which to plan effective clinical interventions.


FINDINGS
Content analysis of the literature revealed that, although used frequently in health care literature, the origin of the concept of psychological distress has not been clearly articulated and is ill-defined.


CONCLUSIONS
Psychological distress is a serious problem faced by many of the people whom nurses encounter on a daily basis. An understanding of the concept of psychological distress will help nurses ameliorate this problem in patients. Nursing research related to the exploration of psychological distress is also needed.","[{'authorId': '5137497', 'name': 'S. Ridner'}]",581.0,,35.0,Psychological distress: concept analysis.,2004.0

bd5044421e8680d3774a586e0f10c84fe872a0ef,"There has recently been an exponential increase in research into the psychological health benefits of self-compassion. Since the first two studies on the topic were published by Neff (2003a, 2003b) 15 years ago, there are now more than 1600 studies or dissertations on self-compassion, with over half of these published in the last two years (based on a Google Scholar search of entries with “self-compassion” in the title). Self-compassion is a way of relating to ourselves in times of suffering that is characterized by increased kindness and reduced self-judgment, increased feelings of common humanity and decreased isolation, and greater mindfulness and less overidentification with difficult thoughts and feelings (Neff, 2003b). Self-compassion has been consistently linked with positive mental health. Meta-analyses synthesizing 98 studies have reported that self-compassion is related to decreased psychopathology and increased positive well-being in both adults and adolescents (MacBeth & Gumley, 2012; Marsh, Chan, & MacBeth, 2017; Zessin, Dickhäuser, & Garbade, 2015). Selfcompassion appears to be an important source of strength and resilience when faced with life stressors such as divorce (e.g., Sbarra, Smith, & Mehl, 2012), combat (e.g. Hiraoka et al., 2015) parenting an autistic child (e.g., Wong, Mak, & Liao, 2016), the transition to college (e.g., Terry, Leary, & Mehta, 2012), chronic health issues (e.g., Brion, Leary, & Drabkin, 2014), or adolescent peer victimization (e.g., Jiang et al., 2016). Further, more is becoming known about the beneficial role of self-compassion in terms of health (e.g., Biber & Ellis, 2017), body image and disordered eating (e.g., Braun, Park & Gorin, 2016), motivation (e.g., Breines & Chen, 2012), interpersonal relationships (Neff & Beretvas, 2013) and physiological functioning (e.g., Arch, Landy & Brown, 2016). Self-compassion research is starting to be conducted with more diverse populations such as Iranian Muslims (Ghorbani, Watson, Chen, & Norballa, 2012), post-Mao Beijing older women (Shea, 2014), LGBTQ adults (Greene & Britton, 2015), or survivors of domestic violence (Allen, Robertson, & Patin, 2017). The methodology of self-compassion research is also expanding. While the vast majority of research still employs the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS; Neff, 2003a) to examine self-compassion, which has been translated into 16","[{'authorId': '7167230', 'name': 'K.

The framework described provides essential steps towards exploiting the potency of quantum mechanics in a quantum affective computing paradigm. Further, the emotions of multi-robots in a specified communication scenario are fused using quantum entanglement, thereby reducing the number of qubits required to capture the emotion states of all the robots in the environment, and therefore fewer quantum gates are needed to transform the emotion of all or part of the robots from one state to another. In addition to the mathematical rigours expected of the proposed framework, we present a few simulation-based demonstrations to illustrate its feasibility and effectiveness.

You will be exposed to real-world situations such as loud environments, the rush crowd, work-role conflicts, all of which impact design decisions. A second bodystorming methodology is what we call “strong prototyping” in the space or place in which the product or service will be used. Let’s say you have been hired to build a new handheld device for use on submarines. You should construct and model the hallways, spaces, and structures (out of cardboard perhaps) to simulate a submarine environment. The idea is to test your handheld in the “replicated” environment. Perhaps it doesn’t have all the properties of the actual field setting, but it should consider the more important aspects. Then you can change constraints such as lighting, or how easy it is to walk through differently sized doorways/passageways while trying to use the handheld. The third methodological variant and most popular form An emerging design practice developed by natural extension of the mode of participatory design known as “bodystorming” is often considered a form of prototyping in context, and is enacted instead as a technology directly supporting collaborative embodied cognition. This “art form” of bodystorming, which departs radically from ideational methods, is referred to as “embodied storming” to distinguish it from other forms called bodystorming that are already contested and because it is supported by theories of embodied cognition. Our emphasis on immediacy and tacit experience breaks with the ideational and theatrical modes of acting out technology scenarios. Embodied storming posits that we ought to first create the experience of physical performance, not to ideate but to enact experiential awareness. This orientation postpones the particulars of designed forms, functions, and even ideas. We believe that “premature ideation” exposes participants to the problems of groupthink, the fixation bias known as following Klein’s “garden path” of sense-making [1]. The goal of embodied storming is not just the instrumental formulation of better experience ideas in the context of their use, but we also aim to enact a tangible understanding of the entanglements and actions of human activity in possible future situations. We have found this generative, enacted mode of participant observation creates the conditions for the collective expression of working out problems, of sense-making situations and unmaking them, by performing actions in simulated settings and occasions in real time.","[{'authorId': '32095291', 'name': 'Dennis Schleicher'}, {'authorId': '145090661', 'name': 'Peter H.

However there is still a significant gap about the demographic and other factors that affect teachers’ perceptions of misbehaviors in classrooms. This meta-analysis reviewed the literature in Turkey on student misbehaviors from the views of teachers and demographic factors in theses and published articles between 2000-2012. The sample included 3648 teachers gathered from 16 studies. The results highlight that task avoidance, constant talking with classmates, verbal hostility towards peers and teacher, indifference to study subject during classes, damaging school stuff, and coming late are the most frequent student misbehavior types reported by teachers. Results showed a small relation between perceived student misbehavior and teachers’ teaching field, teacher seniority, educational background of teachers, and number of students in classroom. Gender was not determined as a statistically significant variable in determining teachers’ perceptions of student misbehavior. Practical implications for future research and practices are discussed.

However, while managers do appear to appreciate the importance of talent management, they often fail to manage it effectively, and the linkages between talent management and organizational performance remain unclear. In this invited feature article, I argue that the failure to effectively manage and develop talent can be traced, in part, to a narrow conceptualization of performance in much thinking on talent management. At an organizational level, this means that performance is generally considered solely in terms of shareholder returns while ignoring other stakeholders. This translates into HR systems that fail to effectively align individuals and organizations in the generation of value. This article foregrounds employees as stakeholders and argues that organizations that are defined by a sense of purpose and that prioritize employees as stakeholders generally have higher levels of alignment between organizational and employee goals with more highly motivated employees and ultimately more sustainable performance. Some implications for research on talent management are developed.","[{'authorId': '3317623', 'name': 'D. Collings'}]",137.0,,93.0,Toward Mature Talent Management: Beyond Shareholder Value,2014.0

In 2008, Weeks, Heimberg, and Rodebaugh proposed Fear of Positive Evaluation (FPE) as a second cognitive component in social anxiety. The article presents an overview of FPE, its psycho‐evolutionary theoretical foundation and assessment by the Fear of Positive Evaluation Scale as well as relevant psychometric research on demographic characteristics. The relationship of FPE with a wide range of established dimensions from clinical, personality, and social psychology (i.e., self‐esteem, perfectionism, or quality of life) will be reviewed. The role of FPE for psychological comorbidities such as other anxiety disorders, depression, eating, and substance use disorders as well as for treatment of social anxiety will be discussed. Future research might address questions of causality of FPE relative to related constructs, further data on psychometric properties, as well as on its independence from FNE in longitudinal studies. In sum, FPE seems to be a valid and reliable construct that explains cognitions, emotions, and behavior related to social anxiety at subclinical and clinical levels and therefore enriches the psychometric repertoire in the fields of social psychology, personality, and clinical psychology.","[{'authorId': '3411336', 'name': 'J.

It is important to specify what actions are expected from the robot, verify that the autonomous robot actually achieve these, and validate that the requirements are exactly what the user wants. To this purpose, our activities have been focused on formal verification of autonomous robotics systems, investigating both reliability and robot ethics and deployment of social robots in both constrained and public environments.","[{'authorId': '3419248', 'name': 'Elisa Cucco'}, {'authorId': '2067381131', 'name': 'Fisher'}, {'authorId': '1751408', 'name': 'Louise Dennis'}, {'authorId': '4474343', 'name': 'C.

The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.

The PSRA, which includes seven age-appropriate tasks that tap children's executive control, was administered to 313 preschoolers and then to 261 of these children approximately 3 months later. Teachers reported on children's school readiness (social competence and classroom adjustment) at the end of preschool and kindergarten years, and on academic success in kindergarten. PSRA tasks were examined for ceiling effects at 35–65 months; Pencil Tap, Balance Beam, Toy Wrap and Snack Delay were retained for lack of such effects. Confirmatory factor analyses showed two components at each time point – hot and cool executive control – and cross-time correlations showed significant stability of individual differences. Four-year-old girls and children of higher socioeconomic status outperformed 3-year-old boys and those at socioeconomic risk. Children, especially girls, scored higher on hot executive control. Finally, aspects of executive control differentially predicted teacher-reports of school readiness at both times of assessment, with age, gender and risk status controlled. These selected PSRA tasks, as a shortened battery, have potential for research and applied usage, and findings speak to theoretical understanding of preschoolers' self-regulation.

The author presents recent advances in building an autonomous humanoid robot, named ""Kismet,"" that can engage humans in expressive social interaction. She outlines a set of design issues and a framework that she has found to be of particular importance for sociable robots. Having a human-in-the-loop places significant social constraints on how the robot aesthetically appears, how its sensors are configured, its quality of movement, and its behavior. Inspired by infant social development, psychology, ethology, and evolutionary perspectives, this work integrates theories and concepts from these diverse viewpoints to enable Kismet to enter into natural and intuitive social interaction with a human caregiver, reminiscent of parent-infant exchanges. Kismet perceives a variety of natural social cues from visual and auditory channels, and delivers social signals to people through gaze direction, facial expressions, body posture, and vocalizations. The author presents the implementation of Kismet's social competencies and evaluates each with respect to the following: (1) the ability of naive subjects to read and interpret the robot's social cues; (2) the robot's ability to perceive and appropriately respond to naturally offered social cues; (3) the robot's ability to elicit interaction scenarios that afford rich learning potential; and (4) how this produces a rich, flexible, dynamic interaction that is physical, affective, and social. Numerous studies with naive human subjects are described that provide the data upon which the author bases her evaluations.","[{'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

This is especially true with applied communication research where a theory is not always available to guide the design. A distinction needs to made between manifest and latent (pattern and projective) content. Also, we argue that content analyses need not be limited to theory‐based coding schemes and standards set by experts. When researchers are clear about what kind of content they want to analyze and the role of theory in their studies, they are in a better position to select the most appropriate strategies for demonstrating validity and reliability.","[{'authorId': '2067839227', 'name': 'W.

c07c9fd7f9ba37899b6cb937c57895a225a5ea35,"Assessment of the risk of punch-through failure of spudcan foundations on sand overlying clay requires prediction of the full penetration resistance profile, from touchdown and through punch-through to equilibrium of the vertical resistance at depth in the underlying clay layer. This study uses the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, a large deformation finite element analysis method, to model the complete penetration resistance profile of a spudcan on sand overlying clay. The sand is modeled using the Mohr-Coulomb model, while the clay is modeled using a modified Tresca model to account for strain softening. The numerical method is then used to simulate a series of spudcan penetration tests, performed in a geotechnical centrifuge, on medium dense sand overlying clay. The punch-through behavior observed in the experiments is replicated, and the penetration resistance profiles from numerical analyses are generally a reasonable match to the experimental measure- ments. The influences of the sand layer height to foundation diameter ratio, sand-clay interface shear strength, and strength gradient in clay on the penetration resistance profiles are explored in a complementary parametric study. The penetration resistance in the underlying clay layer is well predicted using a simple linear expression for the bearing capacity factor for the spudcan and underlying sand plug. This expression is combined with an existing failure stress dependent model for predicting peak resistance to form a simplified method for prediction of the full penetration resistance profile. This new method provides estimates of the vertical penetration that the spudcan will run during the punch-through event. It is validated against both medium dense and dense sand centrifuge tests.","[{'authorId': '144277209', 'name': 'P.

It develops hypotheses that relate the intensity of the hypercompetitive environment and a firm's TMT dynamics to its action aggressiveness, or the volume and speed with which a firm engages its rivals. Using a survey-based sample of 104 Taiwanese firms, this study's findings show that the hypercompetitive environment and TMT sociobehavioral integration have direct and interacting effects on firms' action aggressiveness. Moreover, action aggressiveness is an important mediator between TMT integration and firm performance, particularly under hypercompetitive conditions. As such, the study contributes to our understanding of temporary advantage by revealing TMT integration and action aggressiveness as two essential organizational mechanisms for navigating in the hypercompetitive context. Finally, reflective of temporary advantage as a defining feature of hypercompetition, our findings show that performance variation is greater within this context. The article contributes to hypercompetition and competitive dynamics research by providing an integrated perspective of competitive behavior within the broad context of hypercompetitive environment, TMT dynamics, and firm performance.

We review findings suggesting that snakes remain special stimuli for humans. Intense snake fear is prevalent in both humans and other primates. Humans and monkeys learn snake fear more easily than fear of most other stimuli through direct or vicarious conditioning. Neither the elicitation nor the conditioning of snake fear in humans requires that snakes be consciously perceived; rather, both processes can occur with masked stimuli. Humans tend to perceive illusory correlations between snakes and aversive stimuli, and their attention is automatically captured by snakes in complex visual displays. Together, these and other findings delineate an evolved fear module in the brain. This module is selectively and automatically activated by once-threatening stimuli, is relatively encapsulated from cognition, and derives from specialized neural circuitry.","[{'authorId': '2276310', 'name': 'A.

These systems seek to facilitate more natural interactions between humans and machines by favouring direct voice interaction over the use of conventional input devices in order to comprehend verbal information and to make it simpler for human listeners to respond. A few examples include the use of emotion patterns derived from speech in medical applications, dialogue systems for spoken languages such as those used in cell phone call centres, onboard driving systems in automobiles, and the usage of such patterns in other contexts. In the research that has been done on speech emotion recognition (SER), a variety of methods, many of which are considered to be industry standards in speech analysis and classification, have been applied to the process of extracting emotions from signals. The most crucial stages of the speech emotion recognition (SER) process are the phases that deal with the extraction of features and the categorization of features. For the purpose of speech processing, researchers have developed a variety of features, including prosodic features, vocal traction features, and other hybrid features. The second step involves the categorization of features through the application of deep learning methods.

c1bddcf1e3d554ce8379d0f02d896537a94154c7,"Hochschild (1983) introduced the term emotional labour and offered a theoretical and conceptual framework to contextualise the use of this term, though other frameworks have since been proposed (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993; Morris & Feldman, 1996; Grandey, 2000). Generally, emotional labour is seen as a forced affective performance that may result in negative consequences for the performer (Hochschild, 1983), ranging from decreased job satisfaction to burnout. Emotional labour is performed when disparity occurs between workers' felt emotions and displayed emotions in a given occupational and organisational context. The type of emotional labour performed is shaped by the context in which it occurs (James, 1992). Emotional labour is an important concept as it relates to burnout among mental health field workers and has been applied to a range of occupational contexts: the airline industry (Whitelegg, 2002; Williams, 2003), call centre workers (Korczynski, 2003), criminal interrogators (Rafali & Sutton, 1991), legal professions (Harris, 2002; Livley, 2002), teaching (Price, 2001), nursing (Aldridge, 1994), and the medical profession (Larson & Yao, 2005). Although Hochschild (1983) did not apply the concept of emotional labour to mental health professionals, she claimed it would likely be a component within these professions. There are few studies investigating issues of emotional labour among mental health professionals (Mann & Cowburn, 2005; Karabanow, 1999; Yanay & Shahar, 1998), and this article aims to partially address the deficiency by exploring emotional labour in the context of mental health fieldwork at the Auckland branch of a community mental health organisation in New Zealand. Clarifying the role of emotional labour in mental health service delivery, and its relationship to burnout is important in developing proactive support structures for employees. Existing research Two qualitative studies have investigated emotional labour in the contexts and occupations similar to the current research (Karabanow, 1999; Yanay & Shahr, 1998). Karabanow (1999) explored the concept of emotional labour in Canadian workers at a youth shelter. Clear links were shown between organisational demands or display rules placed upon workers' expressions and emotional labour performance. Display rules tend to prescribe the expression of emotions (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1995) and ""specify the range, intensity, duration and object of emotions that are expected to be experienced--or at least displayed."" (Mann, 2006, p. 553). The negative consequences of emotional labour described by Karabanow (1999) were tied to workers' beliefs that, for management, what the workers did was never good enough. Perceived non-appreciation combined with pressure created by display rules produced feelings of always needing to give more. Interestingly, little was discussed around performance of emotional labour with clients or youth at the shelter. Rather, emotional labour seemed to arise in interactions with management and in accordance with the display rules of the organisation. This suggests that emotional labour is not performed only with clients and its negative impact can result from the overall organisational structure. Yanay and Shahr (1998) investigated emotional labour performed by third year psychology students at a residential psychiatric facility in Israel. Feeling rules (display rules) were seen as professional modes of feeling and behaving in relation to residents of the facility. The difficulties students encountered related to the uncertainty of what it was to be a professional. Performance of emotional labour was a constant negotiation between having a 'normal' emotional reaction, like anger and desire to yell at provocations from the residents, and the discourse of appropriate professional feelings and behaviour (Yanay & Shahr, 1998). Thus students tried to control their emotions according to their perceptions of what was professionally appropriate. …","[{'authorId': '2074983200', 'name': 'Y.

The present study aimed to describe the academic achievement of children speaking Spanish and Catalan with developmental language disorder (DLD) during their primary education and to predict their academic outcomes using several processing skills assessed at the beginning of their schooling. To this end, we followed 28 children during their schooling (6–12 years of age). Participants were divided into two groups, one with DLD (n = 14) and a control group (n = 14) paired by age, gender, socio-economic status (SES), family language (L1), and classroom. All participants were assessed through different processing skills with the Spanish version of the NEPSY at the beginning of their schooling (age 6): attention (visual attention, auditory attention, and response set), phonological awareness, verbal short-term memory (sentence repetition, and narrative memory), access to language (semantic verbal fluency and rapid naming), and language comprehension (comprehension of verbal commands). At the end of primary education, schools reported the official academic marks at the 1st cycle (6–8 years), 2nd cycle (8–10 years) and 3rd cycle (10–12 years). Direct scores of the processing skills and academic results were used for statistical analyses. Results showed that children with DLD had more frequent grade retention, and their academic marks were significantly lower than those of their peers in all the cycles and for all academic subjects with a high language dependency (all except physical education and mathematics). Those subjects with lower language dependence did not show significant differences (physical education and mathematics). Rapid naming accounted for most of the variance of academic outcomes, followed by phonological awareness, and language comprehension when both groups were taken together. Only rapid naming accounted for academic results in the DLD group and phonological awareness did so for the control group. In sum, children with DLD experienced more academic difficulties during their primary education. Those children (with and without DLD) who experienced difficulties not only with rapid naming but also with phonological awareness and oral language comprehension at the beginning of their schooling showed a higher probability of academic failure.","[{'authorId': '1402448572', 'name': 'Eva Aguilar-Mediavilla'}, {'authorId': '1402448763', 'name': 'Lucía Buil-Legaz'}, {'authorId': '1414138092', 'name': 'Raúl López-Penadés'}, {'authorId': '1422936321', 'name': 'Victor A.

More specifically, it described the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) scores of adults with acquired hearing impairment. It reported the psychometric properties (construct, concurrent, and predictive validity) of the stages-of-change model in this population. Design: At baseline, 153 adults with acquired hearing impairment seeking help for the first time completed the URICA as well as measures of degree of hearing impairment, self-reported hearing disability, and years since hearing impairment onset. Participants were subsequently offered intervention options: hearing aids, communication programs, and no intervention. Their intervention uptake and adherence were assessed 6 months later and their intervention outcomes were assessed 3 months after intervention completion. First, the stages-of-change construct validity was evaluated by investigating the URICA factor structure (principal component analysis), internal consistency, and correlations between stage scores. The URICA scores were reported in terms of the scores for each stage of change, composite scores, stages with highest scores, and stage clusters (cluster analysis). Second, the concurrent validity was assessed by examining associations between stages of change and degree of hearing impairment, self-reported hearing disability, and years since hearing impairment onset. Third, the predictive validity was evaluated by investigating associations between stages of change and intervention uptake, adherence, and outcomes. Results: First, in terms of construct validity, the principal component analysis identified four instead of three stages (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, and action) for which the internal consistency was good. Most of the sample was in the action stage. Correlations between stage scores supported the model. Cluster analysis identified four stages-of-change clusters, which the authors named active change, initiation, disengagement, and ambivalence. In terms of concurrent validity, participants who reported a more advanced stage of change had a more severe hearing impairment, reported greater hearing disability, and had a hearing impairment for a longer period of time. In terms of predictive validity, participants who reported a more advanced stage of change were more likely to take up an intervention and to report successful intervention outcomes. However, stages of change did not predict intervention adherence. Conclusions: The majority of the sample was in the action stage. The construct, concurrent, and predictive validity of the stages-of-change model were good. The stages-of-change model has some validity in the rehabilitation of adults with hearing impairment. The data support that change might be better represented on a continuum rather than by movement from one step to the next. Of all the measures, the precontemplation stage score had the best concurrent and predictive validity. Therefore, further research should focus on addressing the precontemplation stage with a measure suitable for clinical use.","[{'authorId': '1398058151', 'name': 'Ariane Laplante-Lévesque'}, {'authorId': '3744955', 'name': 'L.

However, whether this could be demonstrated using more realistic facial emotion recognition stimuli and applied to autistic females was unclear. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed online self-report measures of autism spectrum condition severity and alexithymia, and afacial emotion recognition deficit that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions. Higher levels of alexithymia, but not autism spectrum condition severity, were associated with less accurate facial emotion recognition. Difficulty identifying one’s own feelings and externally oriented thinking were the components of alexithymia that were specifically related to facial emotion recognition accuracy. However, alexithymia (and autism spectrum condition severity) was not associated with speed of emotion processing. The findings are primarily discussed with the theoretical view that perceiving and experiencing emotions share the same neural networks, thus being able to recognise one’s own emotions may facilitate the ability to recognise others’. This study is in line with previous similar research on autistic males and suggests impairments in facial emotion recognition in autistic females should be attributed to co-occurring alexithymia. Lay abstract Research with autistic males has indicated that difficulties in recognising facial expressions of emotion, commonly associated with autism spectrum conditions, may instead be due to co-occurring alexithymia (a condition involving lack of emotional awareness, difficulty describing feelings and difficulty distinguishing feelings from physical bodily sensations) and not to do with autism. We wanted to explore if this would be true for autistic females, as well as to use more realistic stimuli for emotional expression. In all, 83 females diagnosed with autism spectrum condition completed self-report measures of autism spectrum condition traits and alexithymia and completed a visual test that assessed their ability to identify multimodal displays of complex emotions.

However, the mechanism by which CSA confers vulnerability to such behaviours remains unclear. CSA may lead to distress and then rumination, which in turn increases risk for engaging in consumption to cope. To test this theory, 603 community participants completed interview and self-report measures of sexual abuse, distress, rumination, and consumptive coping at three time points, one year apart. CSA survivors reported greater levels of distress, rumination and consumption (e.g., of food, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, prescription and recreational drugs) to cope with distress than non-CSA survivors. In addition, results from structural equation modelling indicated that distress and rumination partially mediated the relationship between CSA and consumptive coping. These results suggest that CSA survivors may engage in maladaptive consummatory behaviours to manage distress and the psychological effects of rumination.","[{'authorId': '35058194', 'name': 'Sabina Sarin'}, {'authorId': '1398876599', 'name': 'S.

From formant to concatenative synthesis, the synthesized voice continues to be defined by the same traits we prescribe to ourselves. When the recorded voice is synthesized, does our perception of its new machine embodiment change, and can we consider an alternative, more inclusive form? To begin evaluating the impact of aesthetic design, this study presents a first--step perception test to explore the paralinguistic traits of the synthesized voice. Using a corpus of 13 synthesized voices, constructed from acoustic concatenative speech synthesis, we assessed the response of 23 listeners from differing cultural backgrounds. To evaluate if perception shifts from the defined traits, we asked listeners to assigned traits of age, gender, accent origin, and human--likeness. Results present a difference in perception for age and human--likeness across voices, and a general agreement across listeners for both gender and accent origin. Connections found between age, gender and human--likeness call for further exploration into a more participatory and inclusive synthesized vocal identity.","[{'authorId': '40399407', 'name': 'Alice Baird'}, {'authorId': '113436518', 'name': 'Stina Marie Hasse Jørgensen'}, {'authorId': '1410317787', 'name': 'Emilia Parada-Cabaleiro'}, {'authorId': '2265238', 'name': 'Simone Hantke'}, {'authorId': '1709997', 'name': 'N.

In this paper, we explore issues related to human personal space around robots, beginning with a review of the existing literature in human-robot interaction regarding the dimensions of people, robots, and contexts that influence human-robot interactions. We then present several research hypotheses which we tested in a controlled experiment (N=30). Using a 2 (robotics experience vs. none: between-participants) × 2 (robot head oriented toward a participant's face vs. legs: within-participants) mixed design experiment, we explored the factors that influence proxemic behavior around robots in several situations: (1) people approaching a robot, (2) people being approached by an autonomously moving robot, and (3) people being approached by a teleoperated robot. We found that personal experience with pets and robots decreases a person's personal space around robots. In addition, when the robot's head is oriented toward the person's face, it increases the minimum comfortable distance for women, but decreases the minimum comfortable distance for men. We also found that the personality trait of agreeableness decreases personal spaces when people approach robots, while the personality trait of neuroticism and having negative attitudes toward robots increase personal spaces when robots approach people. These results have implications for both human-robot interaction theory and design.","[{'authorId': '1753156', 'name': 'L. Takayama'}, {'authorId': '2997956', 'name': 'C.

In Italy, triage involves assigning a priority color code to patients arriving at the hospital Emergency Department: red (very critical), yellow (moderately critical), green (not very critical), and white (not critical).


METHODS
This study was aimed at assessing the triage system in the Emergency Department of ""Giannina Gaslini"" Children's Hospital in Genoa, Italy. The authors examined 130 triage forms assigning a yellow code in 2003, in order to determine whether they had been correctly filled in with regard to the detection of vital parameters, identification of main symptoms and color code assignment.


RESULTS
Results showed that vital signs were recorded in 94% of patients, main symptoms were identified in 97%, and a yellow code was assigned according to hospital guidelines in 84%. The percentage of underestimation (3.2%) was higher than that reported in the literature (2%).


CONCLUSIONS
The study shows the need to improve compliance with the guidelines and to evaluate green and white codes.","[{'authorId': '4543957', 'name': 'E. Piccotti'}, {'authorId': '49412215', 'name': 'M.

The index of emotion knowledge represents the child's ability to recognize and label emotion expressions. We administered control and predictor measures when the children were 5 years old and obtained criterion data at age 9. After controlling for verbal ability and temperament, our index of emotion knowledge predicted aggregate indices of positive and negative social behavior and academic competence. Path analysis showed that emotion knowledge mediated the effect of verbal ability on academic competence. We argue that the ability to detect and label emotion cues facilitates positive social interactions and that a deficit in this ability contributes to behavioral and learning problems. Our findings have implications for primary prevention.","[{'authorId': '38430881', 'name': 'C. Izard'}, {'authorId': '4043840', 'name': 'S. Fine'}, {'authorId': '2057191034', 'name': 'D.

This study uses the Moodle system to make up for the shortcomings of learning in a large class, and find out the difference of learning performance and acceptance between traditional learning and digital learning. The study is experimented with the students in the Calculus course. There are two part of research design in the study. The first part corresponds to learning performance, which uses the quasi-experimental method to compare the difference of the experimental group, and the control group. The second part refers to technology acceptance, where the unified theory of acceptance use of technology (UTAUT) is used. With two dimensions: Outcome Expectation and Attainment Value, a new hybrid technology acceptance model is proposed to investigate the students' intentions to use Moodle systems.

In this literature review, the following guiding questions were examined: (a) What is foreign language classroom anxiety? (b) What are the research findings on language anxiety among online learners? (c) What can instructors do to help alleviate their online students' perceived levels of language anxiety? In addition to an exploration of the guiding questions, the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale, which was developed by Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986), is described in detail as well as how language educators can use it as a tool in their own classrooms to measure their students' perceived language anxiety levels. The pedagogical implications include recommended techniques and interventions for helping online language learners feel less isolated, less anxious, and more connected to their teacher and to their peers. Given the large number of students who are currently engaged in online or remote language learning due to COVID‐19, it is important to consider how affective factors, such as anxiety, can impede learning outcomes. Furthermore, language educators and their students were required to transition rapidly to the online environment without sufficient time or preparation for it, which is an additional cause of stress for both students and instructors alike.

Social-scientific theories suggest competing models of human proxemic behavior, but all conclude that individuals' proxemic behavior is shaped by the proxemic behavior of others and the individual's psychological closeness to them. The present study explores whether these models can also explain how people physically and psychologically distance themselves from robots and suggest guidelines for future design of proxemic behaviors for robots. In a controlled laboratory experiment, participants interacted with Wakamaru to perform two tasks that examined physical and psychological distancing of the participants. We manipulated the likeability (likeable/dislikeable) and gaze behavior (mutual gaze/averted gaze) of the robot. Our results on physical distancing showed that participants who disliked the robot compensated for the increase in the robot's gaze by maintaining a greater physical distance from the robot, while participants who liked the robot did not differ in their distancing from the robot across gaze conditions. The results on psychological distancing suggest that those who disliked the robot also disclosed less to the robot. Our results offer guidelines for the design of appropriate proxemic behaviors for robots so as to facilitate effective human-robot interaction.","[{'authorId': '2522465', 'name': 'Jonathan Mumm'}, {'authorId': '145656551', 'name': 'Bilge Mutlu'}]",422.0,,23.0,Human-robot proxemics: Physical and psychological distancing in human-robot interaction,2011.0

Bipolar disorder is associated with positive emotion disturbance, though it is less clear which specific positive emotions are affected.


METHODS
The present study examined differences among distinct positive emotions in recovered bipolar disorder (BD) patients (n = 55) and nonclinical controls (NC) (n = 32) and whether they prospectively predicted symptom severity in patients with BD. At baseline, participants completed self-report measures of several distinct trait positive emotions. Structured assessments of diagnosis and current mood symptoms were obtained for BD participants. At a six-month follow-up, a subset of BD participants' (n = 39) symptoms were reassessed.


RESULTS
BD participants reported lower joy, compassion, love, awe, and contentment compared to NC participants. BD and NC participants did not differ in pride or amusement. For BD participants, after controlling for baseline symptom severity, joy and amusement predicted increased mania severity, and compassion predicted decreased mania severity at the six-month follow-up. Furthermore, amusement predicted increased depression severity and pride predicted decreased severity of depression. Awe, love, and contentment did not predict symptom severity.

Their way of bonding, i.e. their style of attachment, is a consequence of the mental relationship models constructed during their affective experiences. Individuals with insecure attachment report high anxiety and/or high avoidance when establishing interpersonal relationships. These people could benefit above all from learning appropriate strategies for regulating their emotions, and thus increase their level of well-being. This paper studies the relationship between attachment and subjective well-being in Spanish young people, considering emotion regulation as a mediating variable. Participants were 126 young people (61.9% female) aged between 19 and 26 (MAge = 24.16; SDAge = 3.54). The Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire (ECR-S), the Spanish Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) were used. Correlation and mediation analyses were performed using SPSS version 24.0 and PROCESS. The results indicate that emotion regulation mediates the relationship between attachment anxiety and well-being. Avoidance of intimacy is not related to emotion regulation or well-being.

Our aim was to generate a Hebrew translation of the Miller Function and Participation Scales (M-FUN) and assess the validity of U.S. norms for Israeli children. METHOD. All components of the M-FUN were translated, and a pilot study revealed a need for further investigation. The Hebrew M-FUN's fine, gross, and visual-motor (VM) components and M-FUN participation questionnaires were administered to 267 Israeli children (128 boys, 139 girls; mean age = 59.21 mo, standard deviation = 17.84). RESULTS. Significant correlations supported construct validity between age and all motor and participation scores as well as age-group differences. Significant differences between the U.S. and Israeli samples were found only for the VM score. Participation and motor scores were significantly correlated. CONCLUSION. Although VM score results should be interpreted with caution, we provide evidence for use of the fine and gross motor norms and the U.S. criterion-referenced participation scores of the M-FUN with Israeli children.","[{'authorId': '5530266', 'name': 'Tanya Rihtman'}, {'authorId': '5326888', 'name': 'S.

However, the mechanism between these associations has received little attention and it is still unclear. This study has examined 716 Chinese adolescents, 341 were males (47.6%), aged 13 to 18(Mean = 14.58, SD = 1.50), using a cross-sectional survey involving Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction, the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the seven-item Generalized Anxiety (GAD-7) scale, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Correlation analysis, multiple-group analysis and structural equation modeling were carried out in SPSS Statistics version 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and AMOS version 21. Cognitive reappraisal had a significantly negative direct effect on Internet addiction (β = −0.118, p < 0.05). Furthermore, negative emotions mediated the relationships between expression suppression and Internet addiction [β = 0.149, 95% CI = (0.099, 0.212)] and the relationship between cognitive reappraisal and Internet addiction [β = −0.101, 95% CI = (−0.147, −0.065)].

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is currently defined as a disorder with onset during childhood. Although ADHD occurs in adults as well as children, recent debate has focused on whether adult ADHD represents a continuation of a child-onset disorder or if ADHD may, in at least some cases, have an adult onset. We therefore aimed to test the hypothesis of adult-onset ADHD using a sample born relatively recently (1992-1999) in order to minimize confounding by secular changes in diagnostic practices.


METHODS
We identified 74 individuals with a community diagnosis of ADHD first assigned during adulthood. We also identified individuals with childhood (N = 194) and adolescent (N = 394) community diagnoses of ADHD. These groups were compared with a comparison group (N = 14,474) on their childhood ADHD and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and rate of other psychiatric diagnoses during childhood.


RESULTS
Having an adulthood community diagnosis of ADHD was associated with a mean increase in childhood ADHD symptoms of approximately three times that of the comparison group. Individuals with an adult community diagnosis of ADHD also displayed more autistic traits, motor problems, learning difficulties, tics, and oppositional behavior. Forty two percent of these individuals, compared with 1% of comparison cases, had a psychiatric diagnosis other than ADHD as children. In post-hoc analyses of 21 ADHD cases showing few or no ADHD symptoms in childhood, we were unable to detect any other childhood symptomatology in only nine cases, of whom six were female.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that alternative explanations for data that appear to show adult onset ADHD, such as sex biases in diagnostic practices, need rigorous testing before adult onset ADHD can be accepted as a valid clinical construct.","[{'authorId': '145657590', 'name': 'M.

The present study examined change in loneliness in response to the social restriction measures taken to control the coronavirus spread. A nationwide sample of American adults (N = 1,545; 45% women; ages 18 to 98, M = 53.68, SD = 15.63) was assessed on three occasions: in late January/early February 2020 (before the outbreak), in late March (during the President's initial ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" campaign), and in late April (during the ""stay-at-home"" policies of most states). Contrary to expectations, there were no significant mean-level changes in loneliness across the three assessments (d = .04, p > .05). In fact, respondents perceived increased support from others over the follow-up period (d = .19, p < .01). Older adults reported less loneliness overall compared to younger age groups but had an increase in loneliness during the acute phase of the outbreak (d = .14, p < .05). Their loneliness, however, leveled off after the issuance of stay-at-home orders. Individuals living alone and those with at least one chronic condition reported feeling lonelier at baseline but did not increase in loneliness during the implementation of social distancing measures. Despite some detrimental impact on vulnerable individuals, in the present sample, there was no large increase in loneliness but remarkable resilience in response to COVID-19.

Each patient was interviewed four times: three weekly interviews by the first interviewer and one additional interview by the second interviewer. 64 selected sequences where the patients were speaking about psychotic experiences were scored for facial affective behaviour with Emotion Facial Action Coding System (EMFACS). In accordance with previous research, the results show that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia express negative facial affectivity. Facial affective behaviour seems not to be dependent on temporality, since within-subjects ANOVA revealed no substantial changes in the amount of affects displayed across the weekly interview occasions. Whereas previous findings found contempt to be the most frequent affect in patients, in the present material disgust was as common, but depended on the interviewer. The results suggest that facial affectivity in these patients is primarily dominated by the negative emotions of disgust and, to a lesser extent, contempt and implies that this seems to be a fairly stable feature.","[{'authorId': '1404606926', 'name': 'H.

Stimuli consisted of a neutral and two valenced musical excerpts previously reported to generate such states. The neutral excerpt was composed in a minimalist form characterized by simple sonorities, rhythms, and patterns; the positive excerpt had fast tempo and major tones, and the negative one was slower in tempo and had minor tone. Results of 24 participants revealed that positive and negative EIM effectively induced self-reported happy and sad emotions and elicited higher skin conductance levels (SCL). Although self-reported adjectives describing evoked-emotions states changed to neutral after 2 min in the recovery phase, the SCL data suggest longer lasting arousal for both positive and negative emotional states. The implications of these outcomes for musical research are discussed.","[{'authorId': '49353047', 'name': 'F. S.

In this study, responsive joint attention was measured under two conditions in which different agents, a human and a robot, initiated joint attention via video. The participants were 15 children with ASD (mean age: 4.96 ± 1.10 years) and 15 typically developing (TD) children (mean age: 4.53 ± 0.90 years). In addition to analyses of fixation time and gaze transitions, a longest common subsequence approach (LCS) was employed to compare participants’ eye movements to a predefined logical reference sequence. The fixation of TD toward agent’s face was earlier and longer than children with ASD. Moreover, TD showed a greater number of gaze transitions between agent’s face and target, and higher LCS scores than children with ASD. Both groups showed more interests in the robot’s face, but the robot induced a lower proportion of fixation time on the target. Meanwhile participants showed similar gaze transitions and LCS results in both conditions, suggesting that they could follow the logic of the joint attention task induced by the robot as well as human. We have discussed the implications for the effects and applications of social humanoid robots in joint attention interventions.","[{'authorId': '2075436341', 'name': 'Wei Cao'}, {'authorId': '40896782', 'name': 'Wenxu Song'}, {'authorId': '2188213', 'name': 'Xinge Li'}, {'authorId': '40895011', 'name': 'Sixiao Zheng'}, {'authorId': '2116290409', 'name': 'Ge Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2134150879', 'name': 'Yanting Wu'}, {'authorId': '1491630662', 'name': 'Sailing He'}, {'authorId': '1699577', 'name': 'Huilin Zhu'}, {'authorId': '2108143099', 'name': 'Jiajia Chen'}]",19.0,,28.0,Interaction With Social Robots: Improving Gaze Toward Face but Not Necessarily Joint Attention in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder,2019.0

For many students, however, the unfamiliarity of role-playing the client in conjunction with discussing clinical concerns may lead them to become emotionally dysregulated during the social work-client encounter. To explore strategies by which students can maintain emotional regulation when playing the client role, this study garnered the perspectives of Standardized Clients from Canadian medical schools who conduct repeated, simulated performances in the client role. Standardized Clients (N = 116) responded to an online, qualitative survey which explored how they manage their emotions during simulations. Thematic analysis revealed the following regulation strategies: 1) Internal: a) Distance self from the role, b) Immerse in the role, c) Focus on emotions; and 2) External: a) Putting on a performance, and b) The importance of self-care.

Aim: We aimed to find the role of yoga as an antidepressant as well as its action on lowering the serum cortisol levels. Settings and Design: An open-labeled study consisting of three groups (yoga alone, yoga along with antidepressant medication and antidepressant medication alone) was conducted at a tertiary care psychiatry hospital. Methodology: Out-patient depressives who were not suicidal were offered yoga as a possible antidepressant therapy. A validated yoga module was used as therapy taught over a month and to be practiced at home daily. Patients were free to choose the drugs if their psychiatrist advised. Patients (n=54) were rated on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) with serum cortisol measurements at baseline and after 3 months. In 54 patients, assessments and blood test results were both available. 19 each received yoga alone or with drugs and 16 received drugs only. Healthy comparison subjects (n=18) too underwent morning cortisol measurements once. Results: Serum cortisol was higher in depressives compared with controls. In the total sample, the cortisol level dropped significantly at the end of treatment. More patients in the yoga groups had a drop in cortisol levels as compared to drug-only group. In the yoga-only group, the cortisol drop correlated with the drop in HDRS score (antidepressant effect). Conclusion: The findings support that yoga may act at the level of the hypothalamus by its ‘anti-stress’ effects (reducing the cortisol), to bring about relief in depression.","[{'authorId': '3811244', 'name': 'J.

Purpose
The service sector is at an inflection point with regard to productivity gains and service industrialization similar to the industrial revolution in manufacturing that started in the eighteenth century. Robotics in combination with rapidly improving technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), mobile, cloud, big data and biometrics will bring opportunities for a wide range of innovations that have the potential to dramatically change service industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential role service robots will play in the future and to advance a research agenda for service researchers.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper uses a conceptual approach that is rooted in the service, robotics and AI literature.


Findings
The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a definition of service robots, describes their key attributes, contrasts their features and capabilities with those of frontline employees, and provides an understanding for which types of service tasks robots will dominate and where humans will dominate. Second, this paper examines consumer perceptions, beliefs and behaviors as related to service robots, and advances the service robot acceptance model. Third, it provides an overview of the ethical questions surrounding robot-delivered services at the individual, market and societal level.


Practical implications
This paper helps service organizations and their management, service robot innovators, programmers and developers, and policymakers better understand the implications of a ubiquitous deployment of service robots.


Originality/value
This is the first conceptual paper that systematically examines key dimensions of robot-delivered frontline service and explores how these will differ in the future.

c86bbc80e608089ca7b7e5ad62e3ea018ebf0f06,"Deception is part of many economic interactions. Business people, politicians, diplomats, lawyers, and students in the experimental laboratory who make use of private information do not always do so honestly. This observation indicates that behavior often rejects the moral approach to deception. As St. Augustine wrote, “To me, however, it seems certain that every lie is a sin. . . ” (St. Augustine, 421). Later, philosophers like Immanuel Kant (1787) again adopted this uncompromising moral stance when arguing against lying. At the other extreme, economic theory is built on the assumption of “homo economicus,” a figure who acts selfishly and is unconcerned about the well-being of others. An implication of this assumption is that lies will be told whenever it is beneficial for the liar, regardless of their effect on the other party. Another implication is that there is no negative outcome associated with lying per se. This assumption is very useful in many economic models. Consider contract theory, where it is assumed that without an explicit contract, neither side will fulfill its respective obligations. For example, George Akerlof’s (1970) paper on asymmetric information and the market for lemons assumes that sellers of used cars will always lie if it is in their benefit to do so. In the mechanism design literature (e.g., Bengt Holmstrom, 1979), the standard assumption is that people will tell the truth only if this is incentive-compatible given material outcomes. In the literature on tax evasion, the choice of whether to avoid paying taxes is considered a decision under uncertainty; cost is treated as a product of the probability of being caught and the cost of punishment, whereas benefit is simply the money saved by avoiding payment. However, there is no cost associated with the very act of lying (Michael Alingham and Agnar Sandmo, 1972). Another example is the game theoretic treatment of “cheap talk” (Crawford and Joel Sobel, 1982). An intermediate approach is taken by utilitarian philosophers (e.g., Jeremy Bentham, 1789). Utilitarianism prescribes that, when choosing whether to lie, one should weigh benefits against harm, and happiness against unhappiness. As Martin Luther stated, “What harm would it do, if a man told a good strong lie for the sake of the good and for the Christian church. . . a lie out of necessity, a useful lie, a helpful lie, such lies would not be against God, he would accept them.” Similarly to the economic theory approach, this type of calculation implies that lies, apart from their resultant harm and benefit, are in themselves neutral. A lie and a truthful statement that achieve the same monetary payoffs (for both sides) are considered * Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637 (e-mail: uri.gneezy.gsb.uchicago.edu).

I became interested in deception when my father was terminally ill and his physicians created in him a belief that they considered to be untrue. I dedicate this paper to his memory. 1 Important deviations from this assumption in economic modeling are found in Kenneth Arrow’s (1972) discussion of trust, Gary Becker’s (1976) modeling of altruistic preferences, and Akerlof’s (1982) study of the fair-wage hypothesis. For a general discussion, see Becker (1993): “The economic approach I refer to does not assume that individuals are motivated solely by selfishness or material gain. It is a method of analysis, not an assumption about particular motivations. Along with others, I have tried to pry economists away from narrow assumptions about self-interest. Behavior is driven by a much richer set of values and preferences” (p. 385). 2 Note that this does not mean that a completely selfish person will always lie. There may be strategic reasons not to lie. For example, see the David Kreps and Robert Wilson (1982) discussion of reputation and imperfect information; see also Vincent P.

Full coding of utterances with preservation of sequence information is by far the most laborintensive but also the most informative, as a lot of information can be derived from sequence analyses. In that case it is advisable to use a multivariate coding scheme. More simple coding schemes are advised when frequency analyses are applied.","[{'authorId': '13435058', 'name': 'Y.

As individual differences in detecting bodily signals (interoceptive sensitivity, IS) have been associated with the ability of emotion regulation, we aimed at exploring whether IS fosters coping with social exclusion and flexibility in emotion regulation. The first study investigated subjective feelings and behavioral affiliation tendencies in response to ostracism using a cyberball paradigm. Sixty-nine participants were assessed who differed with respect to IS. The second study examined habitual emotion regulation processes focusing on suppression and reappraisal as well as IS in 116 participants. Main results were that the effect of ostracism on distress and behavioral affiliation tendencies were qualified by IS—being ostracized had less impact on participants with stronger IS. Furthermore, Study 2 revealed that IS was associated with habitually stronger emotion regulation strategies. We conclude that having access to bodily signals helps (IS) reducing aversive states provoked by social exclusion, probably due to the fact that IS is associated with emotion regulation strategies.","[{'authorId': '144796987', 'name': 'O.

In the second set of experiments we simplify and control the facial cues by substituting schematic line drawings that resemble the ubiquitous “happy face”.

There have been limited studies on the prevalence of alexithymia in patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) in various ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Objective: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of alexithymia in patients with MUPS and examine their socio-demographic data. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 196 patients with MUPS were recruited from tertiary care internal medicine and neuropsychiatry clinics during the first quarter of 2019. Patients completed a structured interview; socio-demographic and medical history data were collected. Somatic symptom severity was assessed using the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15). Alexithymia was assessed using the Arabic version of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: General fatigue was the most common complaint observed, followed by headache and dyspepsia. In addition, 73.5% of patients had a high Patient Health Questionnaire score, 17.9% had somatic symptoms of medium severity, while 8% and 0.5% had low and marginal somatic symptoms, respectively. Alexithymia was presented in 49.5%, 22.9% had no alexithymia, and 27.6% had borderline/intermediate alexithymia.A weak positive correlation (r<0.4) was found between somatic symptom severity and alexithymic psychopathology (r=0.277;p<0.05).

c9b9a8f38ba4f1fcd9734eea7f91ca6dd42f0acf,"Health behavior change (HBC) refers to facilitating changes to habits and/or behavior related to health. In healthcare practice, it is quite common that the interactions between practitioner and patient involve conversations related to HBC. This could be mainly in relation to the practitioner trying to directly persuade the patients to make some changes in their health behavior. However, the patients may not be motivated to do so as they do not see this change as important. For this reason, direct persuasion may result in a breakdown of communication. In such instances, alternative approaches and means of indirect persuasion, such as empowering the patient and their family members, could be helpful. Furthermore, there are several models and/or theories proposed which explain the health behavior and also provide a structured framework for health behavior change. Many such models/approaches have been proven effective in facilitating HBC and health promotion in areas such as cessation of smoking, weight loss and so on. This paper provides an overview of main models/theories related to HBC and some insights into how these models/approaches could be adapted to facilitate behavior change in hearing healthcare, mainly in relation to: i) hearing help-seeking and hearing-aid uptake; and ii) hearing conservation in relation to music-induced hearing loss (MIHL).

c9cfa984f884ae887d5545e5b1fc2584d7d9c881,"This study examined the correlates and predictors of conflict resolution styles in a sample of urban seventh and eighth graders. Girls were found to rely on verbal assertion more frequently and aggressiveness less frequently than boys in the sample. Self-efficacy and self-control were found to be significant predictors of conflict resolution styles. Implications for school-based preventive interventions are discussed. ********** During adolescence, physical and cognitive changes occur that have dramatic implications for physiological maturation, intellectual, social, and emotional development. In terms of social and emotional development, skills associated with social competence are learned. Social competence refers to the range of interpersonal skills that help children integrate feelings, thinking, and action in order to achieve specific social and interpersonal goals (Caplan et al., 1992; Catalano, Berglund, Ryan, Lonczak, & Hawkins, 1998). Examples of such skills include encoding and interpreting relevant social cues, anticipating consequences to one's actions, and generating effective solutions to interpersonal problems (Elias, Gara, Schuyler, Branden-Muller, & Sayette, 1994). Promoting social competencies has been demonstrated as primary means of preventing psychosocial problems such as delinquency and drug use (Catalano et al., 1998; Chung & Elias, 1996; Durlak, 1980) and increasing academic achievement (Johnson, Johnson, & Dudley, 1992). Additionally, research on youth violence has revealed that violent adolescents often have deficits in social problem-solving skills (Dodge & Frame, 1982; Farrington, 1991) and hold beliefs and attitudes supportive of aggression (Guerra, Huesmann, & Hanish, 1995). In fact, teaching conflict resolution skills has been a major component of a variety of violence reduction programs in schools (Guiliano, 1994; Johnson, Johnson, Dudley, & Acikgoz, 1994; Tolan & Guerra, 1994). Thus, since the majority of homicides and violent injuries involving adolescents occur among friends and acquaintances rather than strangers (Hammond & Yung, 1993), it is critical to understand the development of conflict resolution skills in youth. Studies of conflict resolution skills and styles in youth are few. However, most have examined conflict within school settings. For example, DeCecco and Richards (1974) interviewed junior high and high school students about their perceptions of common social conflicts. They found that negotiation approaches to conflict were rare and, instead, avoidant or aggressive approaches to conflict were most commonly utilized. Interestingly, students estimated that over 90% of their conflicts remained unresolved or were resolved destructively regardless of the style utilized. Johnson et al. (1994) assessed children and adolescents' conflict resolution styles within the school context and found that telling teachers about the conflict was most common and both avoidant (i.e., passivity) and a request for change (i.e., assertiveness) were the next most frequently utilized styles. Verbal and physical force were rarely used. However, the samples studied in the aforementioned projects were predominantly middle class with no report of the ethnicity of their samples. Hence, it is difficult to know how relevant these findings are to diverse youth. How do youth develop conflict resolution skills? Conflict resolution skills, like all social competencies, are influenced by individual traits such as temperament, family traits such as parenting styles, peer factors such as pressures to adhere to group norms, and cultural factors such as gender and ethnic socialization (Brofenbrenner, 1986; Lind, Huo, & Tyler, 1994; Turner, Norman, & Zunz, 1995). Research has suggested that a child's sociocultural context is critically connected to preferred conflict resolution styles. For example, Lind et al. found that both gender and ethnicity influenced adolescents' preferences for conflict resolution styles such as persuasion and negotiation. …","[{'authorId': '39926007', 'name': 'Elizabeth M.

These measures are shown to possess desirable properties. The asymptotic distributions of the measures for samples from a multivariate normal population are derived and a test of multivariate normality is proposed. The effect of nonnormality on the size of the one-sample Hotelling's T2 test is studied empirically with the help of these measures, and it is found that Hotelling's T2 test is more sensitive to the measure of skewness than to the measure of kurtosis. measures have proved useful (i) in selecting a member of a family such as from the Karl Pearson family, (ii) in developing a test of normality, and (iii) in investigating the robustness of the standard normal theory procedures. The role of the tests of normality in modern statistics has recently been summarized by Shapiro & Wilk (1965). With these applications in mind for the multivariate situations, we propose measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis. These measures of skewness and kurtosis are developed naturally by extending certain aspects of some robustness studies for the t statistic which involve I1 and 32. It should be noted that measures of multivariate dispersion have been available for quite some time (Wilks, 1932, 1960; Hotelling, 1951). We deal with the measure of skewness in ? 2 and with the measure of kurtosis in ? 3. In ? 4 we give two important applications of these measures, namely, a test of multivariate normality and a study of the effect of nonnormality on the size of the one-sample Hotelling's T2 test. Both of these problems have attracted attention recently. The first problem has been treated by Wagle (1968) and Day (1969) and the second by Arnold (1964), but our approach differs from theirs.","[{'authorId': '3209910', 'name': 'K.

However, the mechanisms underlying a potential relationship between brain integrity and mood remain unclear. The current study is aimed at examining the association between amygdala shape, mood state, and postconcussion symptoms in collegiate football players. Thirty members of 1 football team completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the postconcussion symptom scale (PCSS), and an MRI protocol during preseason camp. T1-weighted images were acquired and three-dimensional amygdala and probabilistic maps were created for shape analysis. Correlation analyses between POMS and PCSS and the relationship between POMS and amygdala shape were completed. In the amygdala, the left laterobasal subregion showed a positive relationship with the POMS total score and subscales scores. No significant relationship between PCSS and amygdala shape was found. Significant positive correlations were found between POMS subscales and PCSS. These results indicate that amygdala structure may be more closely associated with negative mood states than postconcussion symptoms. These findings suggest that premorbid individual differences in effect may provide critical insight into the relationship between negative mood and outcomes in collegiate football players with SRC.","[{'authorId': '6420182', 'name': 'H.

The results suggest that people with ASC may process emotional voices in an atypical fashion already at the automatic stage. This processing abnormality can facilitate diagnosing ASC and enable social deficits in people with ASC to be predicted.","[{'authorId': '2016100', 'name': 'Yang-Teng Fan'}, {'authorId': '2330020', 'name': 'Yawei Cheng'}]",53.0,,71.0,Atypical Mismatch Negativity in Response to Emotional Voices in People with Autism Spectrum Conditions,2014.0

The present study investigated in four countries the development of teachers’ SEL, through which people develop their social and emotional intelligence, by using internationally widely-used Lions Quest (LQ) teacher workshops as an intervention. Possible changes in teachers’ attitudes, values, knowledge, and skills during the LQ were explored. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted using data from the pre-test responses of two countries. This analysis produced three factors. The created factor structure was further confirmed using pre-test data from another two countries. Repeated measures ANOVA (GLM), giving its ability to perform overall comparisons in one step, and the specified follow-up comparisons were used to examine the gain scores between and within groups, and to statistically control for some characteristics. The results showed that the teachers perceived the importance of the LQ goals as more important after participating in the LQ teachers’ workshop. In addition, they felt more competence in implementing the LQ content in their classrooms. Further, teachers valued the LQ higher after the workshop. In the comparison group, however, no changes were found. In conclusion, LQ appears to fulfill the expectations of supporting teachers in implementing LQ content, including 21st skills and SEL, in the classroom.","[{'authorId': '114901655', 'name': 'Markus Talvio'}, {'authorId': '113834224', 'name': 'Minna Berg'}, {'authorId': '7151418', 'name': 'Topi Litmanen'}, {'authorId': '3029006', 'name': 'K.

According to the non-associative theory, a contemporary approach to the etiology of anxiety, children develop fears of certain stimuli (e.g., heights and strangers) that protect them from situations they are not mature enough to cope with, naturally through infancy. Risky play is a set of motivated behaviors that both provide the child with an exhilarating positive emotion and expose the child to the stimuli they previously have feared. As the child's coping skills improve, these situations and stimuli may be mastered and no longer be feared. Thus fear caused by maturational and age relevant natural inhibition is reduced as the child experiences a motivating thrilling activation, while learning to master age adequate challenges. It is concluded that risky play may have evolved due to this anti-phobic effect in normal child development, and it is suggested that we may observe an increased neuroticism or psychopathology in society if children are hindered from partaking in age adequate risky play.","[{'authorId': '3909009', 'name': 'E.

cb5c440ce4cdfbda3ad2fb197f5d4a247fdaf005,"Significance Emotions coordinate our behavior and physiological states during survival-salient events and pleasurable interactions. Even though we are often consciously aware of our current emotional state, such as anger or happiness, the mechanisms giving rise to these subjective sensations have remained unresolved. Here we used a topographical self-report tool to reveal that different emotional states are associated with topographically distinct and culturally universal bodily sensations; these sensations could underlie our conscious emotional experiences. Monitoring the topography of emotion-triggered bodily sensations brings forth a unique tool for emotion research and could even provide a biomarker for emotional disorders. Emotions are often felt in the body, and somatosensory feedback has been proposed to trigger conscious emotional experiences. Here we reveal maps of bodily sensations associated with different emotions using a unique topographical self-report method. In five experiments, participants (n = 701) were shown two silhouettes of bodies alongside emotional words, stories, movies, or facial expressions. They were asked to color the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing while viewing each stimulus. Different emotions were consistently associated with statistically separable bodily sensation maps across experiments. These maps were concordant across West European and East Asian samples. Statistical classifiers distinguished emotion-specific activation maps accurately, confirming independence of topographies across emotions. We propose that emotions are represented in the somatosensory system as culturally universal categorical somatotopic maps. Perception of these emotion-triggered bodily changes may play a key role in generating consciously felt emotions.","[{'authorId': '2036051', 'name': 'L.

cb5e59cbf394cf825746d0b5631007de21f2c417,"Background: One widespread view holds that vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) is linked to overall increases in negative emotionality. In contrast, cognitive attribution theories emphasize the importance of blaming oneself rather than others for negative events. Thus far, the contrasting predictions of these models have not been directly compared. Following the attributional perspective, we tested the hypothesis that people with remitted MDD show no overall bias towards negative emotions, but a selective bias towards self-blaming emotions relative to those emotions associated with blaming others. Sampling and Methods: We compared a remitted MDD and a control group on a novel experimental test that allowed us to directly compare proneness to specific emotions associated with different types of self-blame (guilt, shame, self-contempt/disgust) and blame of others (other-indignation/anger, other-contempt/disgust) whilst controlling for negative valence and medication status, and excluding comorbidity. Results: In agreement with our hypothesis, individuals with remitted MDD exhibited an increased self-contempt bias (difference between contempt/disgust towards self and others) but no increased proneness to any other negative emotion or overall increases in perceived negative valence of stimuli. Moreover, the remitted MDD group exhibited reduced contempt/disgust towards others. Conclusions: Our results corroborate the prediction that vulnerability to MDD is associated with an imbalance of specific self- and other-blaming emotions rather than a general increase in negative emotions. Based on the composition of our sample, we speculate that self-contempt bias may be particularly characteristic of melancholic MDD subtypes and could be useful for stratification of depression in the future.","[{'authorId': '48330056', 'name': 'Sophie Green'}, {'authorId': '2529727', 'name': 'J.

Prior to its introduction, the predominant theoretical approaches to CMC predicted that the relative lack of nonverbal cues in CMC compared with face-to-face (FtF) communication would reduce the socioemotional quality of communication online. The social information processing (SIP) theory, in particular, articulated assumptions about the CMC medium, the relationships between nonverbal and verbal cue systems, and users’ adaptation to media that represented a significant departure from other prevalent models at the time it was introduced. Premises of the social information processing theory became the basis for several models to follow, including the hyperpersonal model of CMC. Both approaches to CMC focus on message qualities and how the characteristics of the CMC channel (such as the lack of most nonverbal cues, and, at times, the asynchronous nature of messaging systems) interact with interpersonal goals and strategies, resulting in systematic patterns of interaction via mediated channels. They each involve a high degree of human agency and depict how users appropriate the channel and its technological characteristics to suit their communicative purposes. They depict CMC users as more or less creative and opportunistic rather than as passive adopters of a relatively restricted medium.

A clear view of these distinctions has permitted development of a research literature aimed at evaluating the differential associations of shame and guilt with depressive symptoms. This study quantitatively summarized the magnitude of associations of shame and guilt with depressive symptoms. Two hundred forty-two effect sizes were obtained from 108 studies employing 22,411 participants. Shame showed significantly stronger associations with depressive symptoms (r = .43) than guilt (r = .28). However, the association of shame and depressive symptoms was statistically indistinguishable from the associations of 2 maladaptive variants of guilt and depressive symptoms (contextual-maladaptive guilt, involving exaggerated responsibility for uncontrollable events, r = .39; generalized guilt, involving ""free-floating"" guilt divorced from specific contexts, r = .42). Other factors also moderated the effects. External shame, which involves negative views of self as seen through the eyes of others, was associated with larger effect sizes (r = .56) than internal shame (r = .42), which involves negative views of self as seen through one's own eyes. Depressive symptom measures that invoked the term guilt yielded stronger associations between guilt and depressive symptoms (r = .33) than depressive symptom measures that did not (r = .21). Age, sex, and ethnicity (proportion of Whites to Asians) did not moderate the effects.

We explore feasibility and acceptability of integrating SR technology into pediatric health care. BrightcoveDefaultPlayer10.1542/6138651198001PEDS-VA_2018-1511 Video Abstract BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Social robots (SRs) are increasingly present in medical and educational contexts, but their use in inpatient pediatric settings has not been demonstrated in studies. In this study, we aimed to (1) describe the introduction of SR technology into the pediatric inpatient setting through an innovative partnership among a pediatric teaching hospital, robotics development, and computational behavioral science laboratories and (2) present feasibility and acceptability data. METHODS: Fifty-four children ages 3 to 10 years were randomly exposed to 1 of 3 interventions: (1) interactive SR teddy bear; (2) tablet-based avatar version of the bear; or (3) plush teddy bear with human presence. We monitored intervention enrollment and completion patterns, obtained qualitative feedback on acceptability of SR use from child life–specialist stakeholders, and assessed children’s positive and negative affect, anxiety, and pain intensity pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: The intervention was well received and appeared feasible, with 93% of those enrolled completing the study (with 80% complete parent data). Children exposed to the SR reported more positive affect relative to those who received a plush animal. SR interactions were characterized by greater levels of joyfulness and agreeableness than comparison interventions. Child life specialist stakeholders reported numerous potential benefits of SR technology in the pediatric setting. CONCLUSIONS: The SR appears to be an engaging tool that may provide new ways to address the emotional needs of hospitalized children, potentially increasing access to emotionally targeted interventions. Rigorous development and validation of SR technology in pediatrics could ultimately lead to scalable and cost-effective tools to improve the patient care experience.","[{'authorId': '2394873', 'name': 'D.

Methods: Reports (n = 97) were identified through systematic, computerized literature searching up to February 2015. Treatment versus control outcomes were summarized by random-effects meta-analyses. Results: In 45 reports of 72 trials (n = 14 450 subjects) lasting 33.4 weeks, antidepressants were more effective than placebos in preventing relapses (response rates [RR] = 1.90, confidence interval [CI]: 1.73–2.08; NNT = 4.4; p < 0.0001).

In 17 reports of 22 trials (n = 1 969) lasting 23.7 months, psychosocial interventions yielded inconsistent or inconclusive results. Conclusions: Despite evidence of the efficacy of drug treatment compared to placebos or other controls, the findings further underscore the substantial, unresolved morbidity in treated MDD patients and strongly encourage further evaluations of specific, improved individual and combination therapies (pharmacological and psychological) conducted over longer times, as well as identifying clinical predictors of positive or unfavorable responses and of intolerability of long-term treatments in MDD.","[{'authorId': '35624862', 'name': 'K.

Structured observations of a group of 38 adolescents with ASD drawn from 12 mainstream secondary schools were conducted over a two-day period and data compared with those of school, age, and gender matched comparison groups of 35 adolescents with dyslexia and 38 with no identified special educational needs (the ASD and dyslexia groups were also matched on SEN provision). Frequency and duration of peer interaction behaviours were coded. In terms of duration, multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) indicated that participants with ASD spent more time engaged in solitary behaviours, less time engaged in co-operative interaction with peers, and more time engaging in reactive aggression towards peers than either comparison group. In terms of frequency, similar patterns emerged, but additionally participants with ASD engaged in fewer instances of rough/vigorous play, and were subject to more instances of social initiation and instrumental verbal aggression by peers than either comparison group. The findings of the current study support the authors’ theoretical model of peer group interaction processes for individuals with ASD, and have implications for both social skills training and the development of peer awareness and sensitivity. Limitations are noted.","[{'authorId': '47404870', 'name': 'N. Humphrey'}, {'authorId': '6188169', 'name': 'W.

In this study, the authors' aims were to (a) determine the longitudinal relationships between baseline hearing status and 4-year follow-up depression and loneliness in an older population and (b) investigate possible differences across subgroups in these relationships.


METHOD
The authors used data from 2 waves of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (4-year follow-up, baseline ages 63-93 years). Sample sizes were 996 (self-report analyses) and 830 (speech-in-noise test analyses). The authors used multiple linear regression analyses to assess the associations between baseline hearing status and 4-year follow-up of depression, social loneliness, and emotional loneliness. Hearing was measured by self-report and by a speech-in-noise test. Age, gender, hearing aid use, baseline depression or loneliness, and relevant confounders and effect modifiers were incorporated.


RESULTS
Both hearing measures showed significant associations with loneliness (p < .05), but these effects were confined to specific subgroups of older persons. For instance, adverse effects were confined to nonusers of hearing aids (self-report, social loneliness model) and men (self-report and speech-in-noise test, emotional-loneliness model). No significant effects appeared for depression.


CONCLUSION
Significant adverse effects of poor hearing on loneliness were found for specific subgroups of older persons. In future research, investigators should further examine the subgroup effects observed. Eventually, this may contribute to the development of tailored prevention programs.","[{'authorId': '5085119', 'name': 'M. Pronk'}, {'authorId': '4737042', 'name': 'D.

However, there remain research issues and challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential benefits of robot-assisted therapy. This systematic review categorizes and summarizes the literature related to robot educational/training interventions and provides a conceptual framework for collecting and classifying these articles. The challenges identified in this review are classified into four levels: robot-level, algorithm-level, experimental-research-level, and application-level challenges. The review highlights possible future research directions and offers crucial insights for researchers interested in using robots in therapy. The most relevant findings suggest that robot-assisted therapy has the potential to improve social interaction, communication, and emotional regulation skills in children with ASD. Addressing these challenges and seeking new research avenues will be critical to advancing the field of robot-assisted therapy and improving outcomes for children with ASD.

In this paper, we provide a method for observing intention and embodied practice using surface electromyography (sEMG) to detect muscular activation, in particular with the laryngeal muscles. Through sensing the electrical neural impulses causing muscular contraction, sEMG provides a unique measurement of user intention, where other sensors reflect the results of movement. In this way, we are able to measure movement in preparation, vocalised singing, and in the use of imagery during mental rehearsal where no sound is produced. We present a circuit developed for use with the low voltage activations of the laryngeal muscles; in sonification of these activations, we further provide feedback for vocalists to investigate and experiment with their own intuitive movements and intentions for creative vocal practice.","[{'authorId': '2049486970', 'name': 'Courtney N.

This mimicry, also called entrainment, is associated with rapport and smoother social interaction. Because rapport in learning scenarios has been shown to lead to improved learning outcomes, we examined whether enabling a social robotic learning companion to perform rapport-building behaviors could improve children's learning and engagement during a storytelling activity. We enabled the social robot to perform two specific rapport and relationship-building behaviors: speech entrainment and self-disclosure (shared personal information in the form of a backstory about the robot's poor speech and hearing abilities). We recruited 86 children aged 3–8 years to interact with the robot in a 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental study testing the effects of robot entrainment Entrainment vs. No entrainment and backstory about abilities Backstory vs. No Backstory. The robot engaged the children one-on-one in conversation, told a story embedded with key vocabulary words, and asked children to retell the story. We measured children's recall of the key words and their emotions during the interaction, examined their story retellings, and asked children questions about their relationship with the robot. We found that the robot's entrainment led children to show more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions. Children who heard the robot's backstory were more likely to accept the robot's poor hearing abilities. Entrainment paired with backstory led children to use more of the key words and match more of the robot's phrases in their story retells. Furthermore, these children were more likely to consider the robot more human-like and were more likely to comply with one of the robot's requests. These results suggest that the robot's speech entrainment and backstory increased children's engagement and enjoyment in the interaction, improved their perception of the relationship, and contributed to children's success at retelling the story.","[{'authorId': '2716110', 'name': 'J.

The meta-emotion interview-parent version was coded for maternal emotion coaching. Mothers also completed measures that assessed their child abuse potential and abuse-related behaviors as well as children's emotion regulation. Findings indicated that maltreated children demonstrated fewer adaptive emotion regulation skills and more emotion dysregulation than non-maltreated children. In addition, maltreating mothers engaged in less validation and emotion coaching and more invalidation in response to children's emotion than non-maltreating mothers.

Fifty-one percent of participants reported high levels of STS. Data analysed using hierarchical multiple regression revealed that age, surface acting, and expressive suppression significantly predicted STS. Deep acting predicted STS only for those participants who reported high levels of STS. Cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression did not moderate the relationship between emotional labour and STS. Limitations of the study mainly relate to its small sample size.

Using field data from 2 diverse samples of working adults, we explore a causal model of the effects of turnover intentions on employee behavior while they remain with the organization, focusing specifically on organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) and deviance behaviors (DBs). Utilizing expectancy theory as an explanatory framework, we argue that turnover intentions result in high levels of transactional contract orientation and low levels of relational contract orientation, which in turn lead to a decrease in the incidence of OCBs and an increase in the incidence of DBs. We first used a pilot study to investigate the direction of causality between turnover intentions and psychological contract orientations. Then, in Study 1, we tested our mediated model using a sample of employees from a large drug retailing chain. In Study 2, we expanded our model by arguing that the mediated effects are much stronger when the organization is deemed responsible for potential exit. We then tested our full model using a sample of employees from a large state-owned telecommunications corporation in China. Across both studies, results were generally consistent and supportive of our hypotheses. We discuss the implications of our findings for future theory, research, and practice regarding the management of both the turnover process and discretionary behaviors at work.

The antecedent to self-compassion is suffering, experienced in six possible realms: an event, a situation, an emotional response, a psychological state, spiritual alienation, or a physical response to illness or pain. Suffering has three dimensions: intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual. Suffering manifests as a pattern of decreased self-care, decreased ability to relate to others, and diminished autonomy. The attributes of self-compassion are self-kindness, mindfulness, commonality, and wisdom. The consequences of self-compassion are the opposite of the antecedent: self-compassion manifests as a pattern of increased self-care capacity, compassion for others, and increased relatedness, autonomy, and sense of self.

This study examined changes in and predictors of adolescent mental health from before to during the COVID‐19 pandemic in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States. Methods Participants include 238 adolescents (132 males; ages 15–17; 118 with ADHD). Parents and adolescents provided ratings of mental health symptoms shortly before the COVID‐19 pandemic and in spring and summer 2020. Results Adolescents on average experienced an increase in depression, anxiety, sluggish cognitive tempo, inattentive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms from pre‐COVID‐19 to spring 2020; however, with the exception of inattention, these symptoms decreased from spring to summer 2020. Adolescents with ADHD were more likely than adolescents without ADHD to experience an increase in inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms. Adolescents with poorer pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation abilities were at‐risk for experiencing increases in all mental health symptoms relative to adolescents with better pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation abilities. Interactive risk based on ADHD status and pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation abilities was found for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, such that adolescents with ADHD and poor pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation displayed the highest symptomatology across timepoints. Lower family income related to increases in inattention but higher family income related to increases in oppositional/defiant symptoms. Conclusions The early observed increases in adolescent mental health symptoms during the COVID‐19 pandemic do not on average appear to be sustained following the lift of stay‐at‐home orders, though studies evaluating mental health across longer periods of time are needed. Emotion dysregulation and ADHD increase risk for sustained negative mental health functioning and highlight the need for interventions for these populations during chronic stressors. Results and clinical implications should be considered within the context of our predominately White, middle class sample.","[{'authorId': '2517546', 'name': 'R.

To review deficits in emotional processing and social cognition potentially contributing to the dysfunctional emotion regulation and difficulties with interpersonal relationships observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and to provide directions for future research.


METHOD
First is presented a review of emotional and social-cognitive impairments in recently detoxified AUD individuals that include alexithymia, difficulties in decoding others' emotions, and reduced theory of mind and empathy skills. Social cognition disorders in AUD pose different issues discussed, such as whether (1) these deficits are consequences of excessive alcohol consumption or premorbid risk factors for addiction, (2) emotional and social impairments impede positive treatment outcome, (3) recovery of social abilities is possible with sustained abstinence, and (4) AUD patients are unaware of their emotional and social dysfunctions. Finally, current knowledge on structural and functional brain correlates of these deficits in AUD are reviewed.


RESULTS
Emotional and social-cognitive functions affected in AUD can potentially compromise efforts to initiate and maintain abstinence by hampering efficacy of clinical treatment. Such dysfunction can obstruct efforts to enable or reinstate higher-order abilities such as emotional self-regulation, motivation to change, success in interpersonal/social interactions, and emotional insight and awareness of social dysfunctions (i.e., accurate metacognition).


CONCLUSIONS
The present review highlights the need to account for emotional processing and social cognition in the evaluation and rehabilitation of alcohol-related neurocognitive disorders and to consider psychotherapeutic treatment involving remediation of emotional and social skills as implemented in psychiatric and neurological disorders.

cea30291d4dd43f77d5f2714f17401366aa6a01c,"ABSTRACT Studies of cooperative learning have focused largely on specific interventions within individual modules. The aim of this paper is to examine the student perceptions of their cumulative experiences at the end of a four-year undergraduate programme, during which cooperative learning work was implemented in a piecemeal manner, and explore how gender and academic ability impact on those experiences. Data was collected using a survey methodology. Students emphasised the process of cooperative learning, including peer learning and social support, rather than the deliverable outputs of group work. Both male and female students reported difficulties, such as dysfunctional interpersonal relationships and organisational challenges; however, these appear to have had a stronger impact on female students. Academic ability influenced the type of benefit students perceived as gained, with higher academic ability students emphasising social aspects and leadership skills. The results suggest that repeated exposure to cooperative learning had benefits, in terms of social benefits, peer learning and transferable skills, even where the manner of its implementation did not conform to the ideal framework for cooperative learning.","[{'authorId': '33688132', 'name': 'M.

This study tested one possibility – that poorer sleep impairs emotion regulation (ER), which over time leads to increased depressive symptoms. Our sample contained individuals with a wide range of depression symptoms (current depression, N = 54, remitted depression, N = 36, and healthy control, N = 53), who were followed clinically over six months and reassessed for changes in depressive symptom levels. As predicted, maladaptive ER mediated both cross-sectional and prospective relationships between poor sleep quality and depression symptoms. In contrast, an alternative mediator, physical activity levels, did not mediate the link between sleep quality and depression symptoms. Maladaptive ER may help explain why sleep difficulties contribute to depression symptoms; implications for interventions are discussed.","[{'authorId': '1400149893', 'name': ""K.

Autism is the most characteristic and best studied PDD. We are investigating the use of mobile robotic toys that can move in the environment and interact in various manners (vocal messages, music, visual cues, movement, etc.) with children with autism. The hypothesis is that mobile robots can serve as an appropriate pedagogical tool to help children with PDD develop social skills because they are more predictable and less intimidating. The objective is to see how such devices can be used to capture the child's attention and contribute to helping him or her develop social skills.

Excessive Internet use could result from other conditions such as gambling disorder. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of impulsive–compulsive comorbidities on the presentation of PIU, defined using Young’s Diagnostic Questionnaire. Methods A total of 123 adults aged 18–29 years were recruited using media advertisements, and attended the research center for a detailed psychiatric assessment, including interviews, completion of questionnaires, and neuropsychological testing. Participants were classified into three groups: PIU with no comorbid impulsive/compulsive disorders (n = 18), PIU with one or more comorbid impulsive/compulsive disorders (n = 37), and healthy controls who did not have any mental health diagnoses (n = 67). Differences between the three groups were characterized in terms of demographic, clinical, and cognitive variables. Effect sizes for overall effects of group were also reported. Results The three groups did not significantly differ on age, gender, levels of education, nicotine consumption, or alcohol use (small effect sizes). Quality of life was significantly impaired in PIU irrespective of whether or not individuals had comorbid impulsive/compulsive disorders (large effect size). However, impaired response inhibition and decision-making were only identified in PIU with impulsive/compulsive comorbidities (medium effect sizes). Discussion and conclusions Most people with PIU will have one or more other impulsive/compulsive disorders, but PIU can occur without such comorbidities and still present with impaired quality of life. Response inhibition and decision-making appear to be disproportionately impacted in the case of PIU comorbid with other impulsive/compulsive conditions, which may account for some of the inconsistencies in the existing literature. Large scale international collaborations are required to validate PIU and further assess its clinical, cognitive, and biological sequelae.","[{'authorId': '145109954', 'name': 'S.

Given that academic difficulties experienced by children are traceable to problems in underachievement that begin during the first years of early schooling, a thorough understanding of the transition-to-school process is needed. We suggest two principal assumptions in examining this transition-to-kindergarten period. First, multiple risk factors associated with certain child, family, and child care characteristics are expected to predict early school experience, both in and out of the classroom, and, thereby, social and academic success and failure in the early school years. Secondly, it is expected that day-to-day experiences in the classroom and on the playground will exacerbate or mitigate risk, resulting in some children performing better than would otherwise be expected and others functioning worse than anticipated.

The eight‐session intervention program was based on the discrete trial teaching protocol and focused on two basic social skills: eye contact and facial emotion recognition. The robotic interactions occurred in four modules: training element query, recognition of human activity, coping‐mode selection, and follow‐up action. Children with ASD who were between 4 and 7 years old and who had verbal IQ ≥ 60 were recruited and randomly assigned to the treatment group (TG, n = 8, 5.75 ± 0.89 years) or control group (CG, n = 7; 6.32 ± 1.23 years). The therapeutic robot facilitated the treatment intervention in the TG, and the human assistant facilitated the treatment intervention in the CG. The intervention procedures were identical in both groups. The primary outcome measures included parent‐completed questionnaires, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and frequency of eye contact, which was measured with the partial interval recording method. After completing treatment, the eye contact percentages were significantly increased in both groups. For facial emotion recognition, the percentages of correct answers were increased in similar patterns in both groups compared to baseline (P > 0.05), with no difference between the TG and CG (P > 0.05). The subjects’ ability to play, general behavioral and emotional symptoms were significantly diminished after treatment (p < 0.05). These results showed that the robot‐facilitated and human‐facilitated behavioral interventions had similar positive effects on eye contact and facial emotion recognition, which suggested that robots are useful mediators of social skills training for children with ASD.

This increase has been derived by the evolvement in the computational capabilities, communication systems, and the information systems of the manufacturing systems which is reflected in the concept of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the robotics systems are continuously required to address new challenges in the industrial and manufacturing domain, like keeping humans in the loop, among other challenges. Briefly, the keeping humans in the loop concept focuses on closing the gap between humans and machines by introducing a safe and trustworthy environment for the human workers to work side by side with robots and machines. It aims at increasing the engagement of the human as the automation level increases rather than replacing the human, which can be nearly impossible in some applications. Consequently, the collaborative robots (Cobots) have been created to allow physical interaction with the human worker. However, these cobots still lack of recognizing the human emotional state. In this regard, this paper presents an approach for adapting cobot parameters to the emotional state of the human worker. The approach utilizes the Electroencephalography (EEG) technology for digitizing and understanding the human emotional state. Afterwards, the parameters of the cobot are instantly adjusted to keep the human emotional state in a desirable range which increases the confidence and the trust between the human and the cobot. In addition, the paper includes a review on technologies and methods for emotional sensing and recognition. Finally, this approach is tested on an ABB YuMi cobot with commercially available EEG headset.","[{'authorId': '2078623862', 'name': 'Aitor Toichoa Eyam'}, {'authorId': '2161838', 'name': 'Wael M.

The proposed features are shown to be considerably more robust against additive background noise than standard mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients on two different recognition tasks.

Results showed that deviant peer affiliation mediated the relationship between ADHD and substance use, suggesting that children with ADHD are more likely than children without ADHD to become involved with deviant peers and, as a result, more likely to use substances. Moreover, the relationship between deviant peer affiliation and substance use was stronger for adolescents with ADHD, suggesting that once they are immersed in a deviant peer group, adolescents with ADHD are more vulnerable to the negative social influences of that group. This study is the first step in identifying high-risk pathways from childhood ADHD to substance use in adolescence.","[{'authorId': '3295464', 'name': 'Michael P Marshal'}, {'authorId': '4595013', 'name': 'B.

The ACE is a group program that runs for 2 hr per week for 5 wk. Design: In this double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 178 older people with, on average, mild to moderate hearing impairment were randomly allocated to one of two groups. Approximately half had been fitted with hearing aid/s in the past. One group (N = 78) undertook a placebo social program for the first 5 wk, followed by the ACE program. They were assessed before the social program, immediately after it, and then again immediately post-ACE. The other group (N = 100) undertook the ACE program only and were assessed before and after ACE. In addition, 167 participants were reassessed 6 mo after completing ACE. Assessments were all self-report and included two sets of measures: 1) those administered both before and after the program—the Hearing Handicap Questionnaire, the Quantified Denver Scale of Communicative Function, the Self-Assessment of Communication, the Ryff Psychological Well-Being Scale, the Short-Form 36 health-related quality of life measure; and 2) those administered postprogram only—the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement, the International Outcome Inventory—Alternative Interventions, and a qualitative questionnaire. All assessments were conducted by a researcher blinded to participants' group membership. The relationships between participant response to the ACE program and a number of client-related factors were also investigated. These factors were the participants' age, gender, hearing loss, hearing aid use, attitudes to hearing impairment (as measured using the Hearing Attitudes to Rehabilitation Questionnaire) and the involvement of significant others. Results: For those participants who completed the social program initially, significant improvements were found on the Quantified Denver Scale of Communicative Function and on the Mental Component Score of the Short-Form 36 only, when pre- and postprogram scores were compared. For those who completed the ACE program, there were significant pre-to-post improvements on the Hearing Handicap Questionnaire, the Quantified Denver Scale of Communicative Function, the Self-Assessment of Communication, and the Ryff Psychological Well-Being Scale. These improvements after ACE were maintained at 6 mo. Higher scores on the Hearing Attitudes to Rehabilitation Questionnaire before the ACE program were associated with greater positive change on a number of the pre-post program measures. Using the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement, 75% of participants reported some improvement on the primary goal they wished to achieve with the ACE. Positive outcomes were also recorded with the International Outcome Inventory–Alternative Interventions. Conclusions: This research study provides evidence for the effectiveness of the ACE program and indicates that such communication programs have an important place in the audiological rehabilitation of older adults. They should be considered as an alternative or a supplement to traditional interventions such as hearing aid fitting.","[{'authorId': '3744955', 'name': 'L.

Historically known as secondary traumatic stress (STS), this reaction occurs through repeatedly hearing the details of traumatic events experienced by others. Professionals who work therapeutically with trauma victims may be at particular risk for this exposure. This meta-analysis of 38 published studies examines 17 risk factors for STS among professionals indirectly exposed to trauma through their therapeutic work with trauma victims. Small significant effect sizes were found for trauma caseload volume (r = .16), caseload frequency (r = .12), caseload ratio (r = .19), and having a personal trauma history (r = .19). Small negative effect sizes were found for work support (r = -.17) and social support (r = -.26). Demographic variables appear to be less implicated although more work is needed that examines the role of gender in the context of particular personal traumas. Caseload frequency and personal trauma effect sizes were moderated by year of publication. Future work should examine the measurement of STS and associated impairment, understudied risk factors, and effective interventions.","[{'authorId': '2053569732', 'name': 'J.

d20fd51374bc17aca5994f9e8c1e096eba48c6be,"In this commentary, we describe how language used to communicate about autism within much of autism research can reflect and perpetuate ableist ideologies (i.e., beliefs and practices that discriminate against people with disabilities), whether or not researchers intend to have such effects. Drawing largely from autistic scholarship on this subject, along with research and theory from disability studies and discourse analysis, we define ableism and its realization in linguistic practices, provide a historical overview of ableist language used to describe autism, and review calls from autistic researchers and laypeople to adopt alternative ways of speaking and writing. Finally, we provide several specific avenues to aid autism researchers in reflecting on and adjusting their language choices. Lay summary Why is this topic important? In the past, autism research has mostly been conducted by nonautistic people, and researchers have described autism as something bad that should be fixed. Describing autism in this way has negative effects on how society views and treats autistic people and may even negatively affect how autistic people view themselves. Despite recent positive changes in how researchers write and speak about autism, “ableist” language is still used. Ableist language refers to language that assumes disabled people are inferior to nondisabled people. What is the purpose of this article? We wrote this article to describe how ableism influences the way autism is often described in research. We also give autism researchers strategies for avoiding ableist language in their future work. What is the perspective of the authors? We believe that ableism is a “system of discrimination,” which means that it influences how people talk about and perceive autism whether or not they are aware of it, and regardless of whether or not they actually believe that autistic people are inferior to nonautistic people. We also believe that language choices are part of what perpetuates this system. Because of this, researchers need to take special care to determine whether their language choices reflect ableism and take steps to use language that is not ableist. What is already known about this topic? Autistic adults (including researchers and nonresearchers) have been writing and speaking about ableist language for several decades, but nonautistic autism researchers may not be aware of this work. We have compiled this material and summarized it for autism researchers. What do the authors recommend? We recommend that researchers understand what ableism is, reflect on the language they use in their written and spoken work, and use nonableist language alternatives to describe autism and autistic people. For example, many autistic people find terms such as “special interests” and “special needs” patronizing; these terms could be replaced with “focused interests” and descriptions of autistic people's specific needs. Medicalized/deficit language such as “at risk for autism” should be replaced by more neutral terms such as “increased likelihood of autism.” Finally, ways of speaking about autism that are not restricted to particular terms but still contribute to marginalization, such as discussion about the “economic burden of autism,” should be replaced with discourses that center the impacts of social arrangements on autistic people. How will these recommendations help autistic people now or in the future? Language is a powerful means for shaping how people view autism. If researchers take steps to avoid ableist language, researchers, service providers, and society at large may become more accepting and accommodating of autistic people.","[{'authorId': '1403169986', 'name': 'Kristen Bottema‐Beutel'}, {'authorId': '38961667', 'name': 'Steven K.

A sample of 341 preschoolers was observed, and direct assessments and teacher reports of self-regulation were obtained in the fall and spring of the preschool year. Research Findings: Children's positive engagement with teachers was related to gains in compliance/executive function, and children's active engagement with tasks was associated with gains in emotion regulation across the year. Engaging positively with teachers or peers was especially supportive of children's gains in task orientation and reductions in dysregulation. Practice or Policy: Results are discussed in relation to Vygotsky's developmental theory, emphasizing that psychological processes are developed in the context of socially embedded interactions. Systematically observing how a child interacts with peers, teachers, and learning tasks in the preschool classroom has the potential to inform the creation of professional development aimed at supporting teachers in fostering individual children's development within the early education environment.","[{'authorId': '5387810', 'name': 'Amanda P.

Despite its importance, societies not always are well equipped with contexts for creativity stimulation; as a consequence, a major decline in creative abilities occurs at the age of 7 years old. We investigated the effectiveness of using a robotic system named YOLO as an intervention tool to stimulate creativity in children. During the intervention, children used YOLO as a character for their stories and through the interaction with the robot, creative abilities were stimulated. Our study (n=62) included 3 experimental conditions: i) YOLO displayed behaviors based on creativity techniques; ii) YOLO displayed behaviors based on creativity techniques plus social behaviors; iii) YOLO was turned off, not displaying any behaviors. We measured children’s creative abilities at pre- and post-testing and their creative process through behavior analysis. Results showed that the interaction with YOLO contributed to higher creativity levels in children, specifically contributing to the generation of more original ideas during story creation.

Social robots are being explored as a possible tool to reduce anxiety and distress in children attending a clinical or hospital environment. Social robots are designed to communicate and interact through movement, music and speech. Objective This systematic review aims at assessing the current evidence on the types of social robots used and their impact on children’s anxiety or distress levels when visiting the hospital for outpatient appointments or planned admissions. Methods Databases such as MEDLINE, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PsychINFO and Google Scholar were queried for papers published between January 2009 and August 2020 reporting the use of social robots interacting with children in hospital or clinical environments. Results A total of 10 studies were located and included. Across these 10 studies, 7 different types of robots were used. Anxiety and distress were found to be reduced in the children who interacted with a social robot. Conclusions Overall, the evidence suggests that social robots hold a promising role in reducing levels of anxiety or distress in children visiting the hospital. However, research on social robots is at an early stage and requires further studies to strengthen the evidence base.

It is unclear how relapse affects brain morphologic features during the course of MDD. Objective To use structural magnetic resonance imaging to identify morphologic brain changes associated with relapse in MDD. Design, Setting, and Participants In this longitudinal case-control study, patients with acute MDD at baseline and healthy controls were recruited from the University of Münster Department of Psychiatry from March 21, 2010, to November 14, 2014, and were reassessed from November 11, 2012, to October 28, 2016. Depending on patients’ course of illness during follow-up, they were subdivided into groups of patients with and without relapse. Whole-brain gray matter volume and cortical thickness of the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and insula were assessed via 3-T magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 2 years later. Main Outcomes and Measures Gray matter was analyzed via group (no relapse, relapse, and healthy controls) by time (baseline and follow-up) analysis of covariance, controlling for age and total intracranial volume. Confounding factors of medication and depression severity were assessed. Results This study included 37 patients with MDD and a relapse (19 women and 18 men; mean [SD] age, 37.0 [12.7] years), 23 patients with MDD and without relapse (13 women and 10 men; mean [SD] age, 32.5 [10.5] years), and 54 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (24 women and 30 men; mean [SD] age, 37.5 [8.7] years). A significant group-by-time interaction controlling for age and total intracranial volume revealed that patients with relapse showed a significant decline of insular volume (difference, −0.032; 95% CI, −0.063 to −0.002; P = .04) and dorsolateral prefrontal volume (difference, −0.079; 95% CI, −0.113 to −0.045; P < .001) from baseline to follow-up. In patients without relapse, gray matter volume in these regions did not change significantly (insula: difference, 0.027; 95% CI, −0.012 to 0.066; P = .17; and dorsolateral prefrontal volume: difference, 0.023; 95% CI, −0.020 to 0.066; P = .30). Volume changes were not correlated with psychiatric medication or with severity of depression at follow-up. Additional analysis of cortical thickness showed an increase in the anterior cingulate cortex (difference, 0.073 mm; 95% CI, 0.023-0.123 mm; P = .005) and orbitofrontal cortex (difference, 0.089 mm; 95% CI, 0.032-0.147 mm; P = .003) from baseline to follow-up in patients without relapse. Conclusion and Relevance A distinct association of relapse in MDD with brain morphologic features was revealed using a longitudinal design. Relapse is associated with brain structures that are crucial for regulation of emotions and thus needs to be prevented. This study might be a step to guide future prognosis and maintenance treatment in patients with recurrent MDD.","[{'authorId': '6349695', 'name': 'D. Zaremba'}, {'authorId': '6219355', 'name': 'K.

Our semi-autonomous system involves a human operator who makes correct responses and provides easily understandable answers to the children's questions during storytelling. We develop a gaze model for the natural and autonomous gaze behaviors of a reader robot by considering multiple listeners and a storytelling object (a display that shows images). We conducted an experiment with 16 children to investigate whether they preferred storytelling with/without the listener robot and the changes of speech activities during the storytelling. Children preferred storytelling with the listener robot to storytelling without it. Their speech activities decreased when the listener robot was involved in the storytelling.","[{'authorId': '1381124516', 'name': 'Yumiko Tamura'}, {'authorId': '2608887', 'name': 'Mitsuhiko Kimoto'}, {'authorId': '34656564', 'name': 'M.

The day-to-day manager of disease is the patient who undertakes actions with the guidance of a clinician. The ability of the patient to control the illness through an effective therapeutic plan is significantly influenced by social and behavioral factors.

Asthma serves as a case for exploration of the model. Findings from a 5-year study of 637 children with asthma and their care-taking parents supported that the self-regulation elements of the model were reasonably stable over time and baseline values were predictive of important disease management outcomes.,"[{'authorId': '2687960', 'name': 'N.

Co-teaching has emerged as a supportive framework that uses principles of social justice in building inclusive nurturing environments, yielding positive student outcomes in social as well as academic areas of education. The authors explored the use of co-teaching within a laboratory school setting by analyzing experiences between general education faculty and not only special education faculty but also preservice teachers. Research has found that co-teaching to support preservice and early-career teachers is a natural outgrowth of the special education and general education partnerships created in the co-taught classroom when an intern is placed in such a setting. When used with fidelity, co-teaching is an instructional option that plays an integral part in building effective and efficient ways to foster student learning while enhancing classroom community. Co-teaching can be a powerful mechanism that supports sharing of responsibility and accountability for student achievement, as well as social, emotional, and behavioral growth. A child-centered philosophy was perceived as important to both preservice and co-teachers because of the individual factors that guided practice. With strong leadership from school administrators, commitment and flexibility on the part of classroom teachers, and skills of colleagues, preservice teachers report outstanding growth. Co-teaching, carefully implemented, can foster a nurturing classroom culture and support preservice teachers as they apply knowledge and skills in a constant reflective process, which benefits all teachers and students.","[{'authorId': '119752661', 'name': 'Tammy Barron'}, {'authorId': '65772647', 'name': 'Holly H.

Hence, valid instruments are needed to screen for depression in this subpopulation. In this study, the predictive validity of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) for the presence of a depressive disorder was investigated in SUD inpatients. Furthermore, differences between DASS-21 scores at intake and those recorded one week after inpatient detoxification were assessed in order to determine the measurement point of the assessment of the DASS-21 leading to the best predictive validity. The DASS-21 was administered to 47 patients at intake and shortly after inpatient detoxification. The results of the DASS-21 were compared to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), which served as the gold standard. Levels of sensitivity and specificity of 78–89% and 71–76% were found for the DASS-21 assessed after detoxification, satisfactorily predicting depression as diagnosed with the MINI. Total DASS-21 scores as well as the DASS subscale for depression were significantly reduced at the second measurement, compared to the DASS at intake. We conclude that the DASS-21 may be a suitable instrument to screen for depressive disorders in SUD patients when administered (shortly) after detoxification.

People who present manifestations of hearing loss are often perceived by others to be cognitively diminished, less able, and socially incompetent. In order to avoid being identified as a member of a stigmatized group, individuals with hearing loss may choose not to seek health services or fail to comply with recommended treatments. The purpose of this study was to better understand how stigma impacted upon the help-seeking activities of adults with an acquired hearing loss. Ten people who had hearing loss, and were members of peer-support groups participated in audio-recorded semi-structured interviews. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using thematic analyses. Analyses revealed that lasting decisions about hearing loss management were made following ‘critical junctures’, when the negative stress found in the respondent's social and physical environment far outweighed positive energy, or when the positive energy found in the respondent's environment far outweighed the negative stress. The time course development of these processes is described. Sumario Existen estigmas asociados con muchas condiciones crónicas de salud que aparecen en la edad adulta. La gente que presenta manifestaciones de pérdida auditiva a menudo son percibidas por los demás como disminuidos cognitivamente, menos capaces, y socialmente incompetentes.

d559b4460eddd359286397bab6ae8a95d8604bf8,"Objective Pedestrian injuries are among the most common cause of death and serious injury to children. A range of risk factors, including individual differences and traffic environment factors, has been investigated as predictors of children’s pedestrian behaviours. There is little evidence examining how risk factors might interact with each other to influence children’s risk, however. The present study examined the independent and joint influences of individual differences (sex and sensation seeking) and traffic environment factors (vehicle speeds and inter-vehicle distances) on children’s pedestrian safety. Methods A total of 300 children aged 10–13 years were recruited to complete a sensation-seeking scale, and 120 of those were selected for further evaluation based on having high or low sensation-seeking scores in each gender, with 30 children in each group. Children’s pedestrian crossing behaviours were evaluated in a virtual reality traffic environment. Results Children low in sensation seeking missed more opportunities to cross and had longer start gaps to enter the roadway compared with those high in sensation seeking, and these effects were more substantial when vehicles were spread further apart but travelling slowly. Interaction effects between inter-vehicle distance and vehicle speed were also detected, with children engaging in riskier crossings when the car was moving more quickly and the vehicles were spread further than when the vehicles were moving quickly but were closer together. No sex differences or interactions emerged.

The World Health Organization highlighted how the lockdown had negative consequences on psychological well-being, especially for children. The present study aimed to investigate parental correlates of children’s emotion regulation during the COVID-19 lockdown. Within the Social Cognitive Theory framework, a path model in which parenting self-efficacy and parental regulatory emotional self-efficacy mediated the relationship between parents’ psychological distress and both children’s emotional regulation, and children’s lability/negativity, was investigated. A total of 277 parents of children aged from 6 to 13 years completed an online survey that assessed their psychological distress, regulatory emotional self-efficacy, and parenting self-efficacy. Parents reported also children’s emotional regulation and lability/negativity. A structural equation model (SEM) using MPLUS 8.3 was tested. Results showed that the hypothesized model exhibited excellent fit, chi-square (83) = 140.40, p < 0.01, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96, SRMR = 0.04. The influences of parents’ psychological distress and parents’ regulatory emotional self-efficacy on children’s emotional regulation and lability/negativity were mediated by parenting self-efficacy. The mediation model was invariant across children’s biological sex and age, and geographical residence area (high risk vs. low risk for COVID-19). Results suggested how parents’ beliefs to be competent in managing parental tasks might be a protective factor for their children’s emotional well-being. Implications for intervention programs are discussed.","[{'authorId': '47213442', 'name': 'Mara Morelli'}, {'authorId': '11876815', 'name': 'E. Cattelino'}, {'authorId': '3157079', 'name': 'R.

Negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (SZ) remain unmet treatment needs as they are highly prevalent, associated with poor functional outcomes, and resistant to pharmacologic treatment. The current pilot randomized controlled trial examined the efficacy of an integrated Cognitive-Behavioral Social Skills Training and Compensatory Cognitive Training (CBSST-CCT) intervention compared to Goal-focused Supportive Contact (SC) on negative symptoms and cognitive performance.


METHODS
Fifty-five adults with SZ or schizoaffective disorder with moderate-to-severe negative symptoms were randomized to receive 25 twice-weekly, 1-h manualized group sessions (12.5 weeks total duration) of either CBSST-CCT or SC delivered by master's level clinicians in five community settings. Assessments of negative symptom severity (primary outcomes) and neuropsychological performance, functional capacity, social skills performance, and self-reported functional ability/everyday functioning, psychiatric symptom severity, and motivation (secondary outcomes) were administered at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Mixed-effects models using baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment data demonstrated significant CBSST-CCT-associated effects on negative symptom severity, as assessed by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (p = .049, r = 0.22), with improvements in diminished motivation driving this effect (p = .037, r = 0.24). The CBSST-CCT group also demonstrated improved verbal learning compared to SC participants (p = .026, r = 0.36). The effects of CBSST-CCT appeared to be durable at 6-month follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
CBSST-CCT improved negative symptom severity and verbal learning in high-negative-symptom individuals relative to SC. CBSST-CCT warrants larger investigations to examine its efficacy in treating negative symptoms, along with other symptoms, cognition, and, ultimately, real-world functional outcomes.

Neuropsychiatry, Neuropsychology, and Behavioral Neurology, 1, 171–176] introduced a dichotic listening task that allowed for the assessment of linguistic and prosodic processing asymmetries using the same stimuli. The task produces a robust right ear advantage (REA) for linguistic processing (identifying a target word), and a left ear advantage for emotional processing (identifying a target prosody). Here, we adapted this paradigm to determine whether and how the presence of emotional prosody might modulate hemispheric asymmetry for linguistic processing. Participants monitored for a target word among dichotic stimuli consisting of two different words, but spoken in the same emotional prosody—neutral, angry, happy, sad, or fearful. A strong REA was observed when the words were spoken in neutral prosody, which was attenuated for all the emotional prosodies. There were no differences in the ear advantage as a function of valence or discrete emotion, indicating that all emotions had similar effects. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the right hemisphere is better able to process speech when it carries emotional prosody. Implications for understanding of right hemisphere language functions are discussed.","[{'authorId': '4441439', 'name': 'Hazel K. Godfrey'}, {'authorId': '2829905', 'name': 'Gina M.

By measuring emotional signals and providing affective neurofeedback, people can be better aware of their emotional state in real time. However, such direct mapping does not necessarily motivate people's emotion regulation effort. We introduce two levels of emotion feedback: an augmentation level that indicates direct feedback mapping and an intervention level which means feedback output is dynamically adapted with the regulation process. For the purpose of emotion regulation, this research summarizes the framework of emotion feedback design by adding new components that involve feature wrapping, mapping to output representation and interactive interface representation. By this means, the concept of intelligent emotion feedback is illustrated that not only enhances emotion regulation motivation but also considers subject and trial variability based on individual calibration and learning. An affective Brain-computer Interface technique is used to design the prototype among alternatives.

In the present study, we examine to which extent covert intrapersonal actions (cognitions both related and unrelated to the emotion-eliciting stimulus) as well as overt interpersonal actions (social sharing) account for this variability in emotion duration. Participants were asked to report the duration of their anger, sadness, joy, and gratitude episodes on a daily basis during five days. Furthermore, information was collected with regard to their cognitions during the episodes and their social sharing behavior. Discrete-time survival analyses revealed that for three of the four emotions under study, stimulus-related cognitions with the same valence as the emotion lead to a prolongation of the episode; in contrast, both stimulus-related and stimulus-unrelated cognitions with a valence opposite to the emotion lead to a shortening. Finally, for the four emotions under study, social sharing was associated with a prolongation.

d70545d109f520c867472826a2f15cacff80c4b8,"Animals respond to stress by activating a wide array of behavioral and physiological responses that are collectively referred to as the stress response. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays a central role in the stress response by regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In response to stress, CRF initiates a cascade of events that culminate in the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. As a result of the great number of physiological and behavioral effects exerted by glucocorticoids, several mechanisms have evolved to control HPA axis activation and integrate the stress response. Glucocorticoid feedback inhibition plays a prominent role in regulating the magnitude and duration of glucocorticoid release. In addition to glucocorticoid feedback, the HPA axis is regulated at the level of the hypothalamus by a diverse group of afferent projections from limbic, mid-brain, and brain stem nuclei. The stress response is also mediated in part by brain stem noradrenergic neurons, sympathetic andrenornedullary circuits, and parasympathetic systems. In summary, the aim of this review is to discuss the role of the HPA axis in the integration of adaptive responses to stress. We also identify and briefly describe the major neuronal and endocrine systems that contribute to the regulation of the HPA axis and the maintenance of homeostasis in the face of aversive stimuli.","[{'authorId': '2110509254', 'name': 'Sean M Smith'}, {'authorId': '20727401', 'name': 'W.

 Though substantial research has been dedicated towards using technology to improve education, no current methods are as effective as one-on-one tutoring. A critical, though relatively understudied, aspect of effective tutoring is modulating the student's affective state throughout the tutoring session in order to maximize long-term learning gains. We developed an integrated experimental paradigm in which children play a second-language learning game on a tablet, in collaboration with a fully autonomous social robotic learning companion. As part of the system, we measured children's valence and engagement via an automatic facial expression analysis system. These signals were combined into a reward signal that fed into the robot's affective reinforcement learning algorithm. Over several sessions, the robot played the game and personalized its motivational strategies (using verbal and non-verbal actions) to each student. We evaluated this system with 34 children in preschool classrooms for a duration of two months. We saw that (1) children learned new words from the repeated tutoring sessions, (2) the affective policy personalized to students over the duration of the study, and (3) students who interacted with a robot that personalized its affective feedback strategy showed a significant increase in valence, as compared to students who interacted with a non-personalizing robot. This integrated system of tablet-based educational content, affective sensing, affective policy learning, and an autonomous social robot holds great promise for a more comprehensive approach to personalized tutoring.

The aim of proposed solution is to improve the interaction among humans and computers. The emotion recognition system must be capable of recognizing at least six basic emotions (happiness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, sadness) and the neutral circumstances. The proposed system has two subsystems Gender Recognition (GR) and Emotion Recognition (ER) and also distinguishes a single emotion versus all the others. An appropriate emotion recognition method is applied after extracting features like pitch, energy and MFCC having emotional information. The performance in terms of accuracy is shown in results. The highlight of result is that a prior knowledge about the gender of speaker increases the performance of proposed system. Proposed approach has been implemented by using Naive Bayes method. This is a simple and efficient classification approach. It has easy learning on large speech databases and its accuracy as compared to other approaches is reasonably good. In future this system can be implemented over mobile devices such as smart phones.","[{'authorId': '1398911661', 'name': 'Vinay'}, {'authorId': '47924980', 'name': 'Shilpi Gupta'}, {'authorId': '5294180', 'name': 'Anu Mehra'}]",16.0,,26.0,Gender specific emotion recognition through speech signals,2014.0

To identify the mechanisms involved in the association between self-compassion and depression, we examined whether adaptive emotion regulation would mediate the relationship between self-compassion and depression in individuals with unipolar depression. Furthermore, we explored which specific emotion regulation skills would be most important in this relationship.


DESIGN AND METHOD
Sixty-nine individuals with unipolar depression were assessed with the Self-Compassion Scale and the Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire at baseline and with the Beck Depression Inventory-II 1 week later.


RESULTS
The results showed that successful application of emotion regulation skills mediates the association between self-compassion and depression. Among eight specific emotion regulation skills, only the ability to tolerate negative emotions was identified as a significant mediator in the self-compassion-depression relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings provide preliminary evidence that systematically fostering self-compassion might help depressed individuals cope with their symptoms by enhancing their abilities to tolerate undesired emotions.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
Systematically fostering self-compassion through specific compassion-focused interventions might facilitate a reduction in depressive symptoms by improving the person's emotion regulation abilities, especially by improving his or her ability to tolerate negative emotions. Hence, compassion-focused interventions might be particularly promising in depressed patients with a tendency to avoid negative emotions and deficits in tolerating them.","[{'authorId': '40069111', 'name': 'Alice Diedrich'}, {'authorId': '48198809', 'name': 'J.

They're learning how to handle new demands in school and social life while dealing with new, intense emotions (both positive and negative), and they're increasingly feeling that they should do so without adult guidance. Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs are one way to help them navigate these difficulties.SEL programs try to help adolescents cope with their difficulties more successfully by improving skills and mindsets, and they try to create respectful school environments that young people want to be a part of by changing the school's climate. In this article, David Yeager defines those terms and explains the changes that adolescents experience with the onset of puberty. Then he reviews a variety of SEL programs to see what works best with this age group.On the positive side, Yeager finds that effective universal SEL can transform adolescents' lives for the better. Less encouragingly, typical SEL programs—which directly teach skills and invite participants to rehearse those skills over the course of many classroom lessons—have a poor track record with middle adolescents (roughly age 14 to 17), even though they work well with children.But some programs stand out for their effectiveness with adolescents. Rather than teaching them skills, Yeager finds, effective programs for adolescents focus on mindsets and climate. Harnessing adolescents' developmental motivations, such programs aim to make them feel respected by adults and peers and offer them the chance to gain status and admiration in the eyes of people whose opinions they value.","[{'authorId': '34677298', 'name': 'D.

d9829267dee7ce591dbc83820ab31f025c755e12,"With robotics rapidly advancing, more effective human-robot interaction is increasingly needed to realize the full potential of robots for society. While spoken language must be part of the solution, our ability to provide spoken language interaction capabilities is still very limited. The National Science Foundation accordingly convened a workshop, bringing together speech, language, and robotics researchers to discuss what needs to be done. The result is this report, in which we identify key scientific and engineering advances needed. 
Our recommendations broadly relate to eight general themes. First, meeting human needs requires addressing new challenges in speech technology and user experience design. Second, this requires better models of the social and interactive aspects of language use. Third, for robustness, robots need higher-bandwidth communication with users and better handling of uncertainty, including simultaneous consideration of multiple hypotheses and goals. Fourth, more powerful adaptation methods are needed, to enable robots to communicate in new environments, for new tasks, and with diverse user populations, without extensive re-engineering or the collection of massive training data. Fifth, since robots are embodied, speech should function together with other communication modalities, such as gaze, gesture, posture, and motion. Sixth, since robots operate in complex environments, speech components need access to rich yet efficient representations of what the robot knows about objects, locations, noise sources, the user, and other humans. Seventh, since robots operate in real time, their speech and language processing components must also. Eighth, in addition to more research, we need more work on infrastructure and resources, including shareable software modules and internal interfaces, inexpensive hardware, baseline systems, and diverse corpora.","[{'authorId': '2372948', 'name': 'M.

This qualitative study undertaken in Ontario, Canada, examined Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) students’ perceptions of interviewing. Individual interviews were conducted with second-year BSW students (n = 17) following their completion of an interviewing course. The following six themes emerged as to how students perceived learning interviewing skills: 1) emotional responses; 2) physiological responses; 3) psychological responses; 4) coping strategies; 5) the need for constructive criticism; and 6) the role of the course instructor. The study suggests that instructors normalize the presence of negative emotions and provide more structure and instructions for giving and receiving feedback when using role-plays.","[{'authorId': '8322149', 'name': 'Lea Tufford'}, {'authorId': '2065121642', 'name': 'C.

Some people are becoming preoccupied with the Internet, are unable to control their use, and are jeopardizing employment and relationships. The concept of ""Internet addiction"" has been proposed as an explanation for uncontrollable, damaging use of this technology. Symptoms of excessive Internet use are compared to the criteria used to diagnose other addictions. In particular, pathological gambling is compared to problematic Internet use because of overlapping criteria. This article suggests some modifications to the diagnostic criteria that has been commonly proposed for Internet addiction.","[{'authorId': '2253237', 'name': 'Keith W.

Thirty-eight school-aged children with DLD and thirty-eight age/sex-matched TD children completed a CSSL eye-tracking experiment. Participants’ responses show that children with DLD had significantly poorer accuracy compared to TD children. However, both groups performed above chance.

To investigate burnout among nurses from Australia and China and explore the effects of resilience and turnover intention on nurse burnout between the two countries.


BACKGROUND
Nursing shortages and burnout have become serious problems worldwide in recent years. In both developed and developing countries, such as Australia and China, nurse burnout levels are high and therefore attract concern from nurse managers, hospital administrators, nurse educators and researchers. However, few studies have been conducted exploring the differences in burnout and its predictors between Australian and Chinese nurses, particularly investigating the differences in the effect sizes of the predictors.


DESIGN
A comparative cross-sectional design was employed.


METHODS
A total of 100 Australian nurses and 197 Chinese nurses participated in the study. Australian participants completed an online questionnaire, while Chinese participants completed a hardcopy questionnaire. Burnout, resilience and turnover intention were measured.


RESULTS
Burnout was worse for Australian participants than Chinese participants. Only having turnover intention significantly predicted burnout in Australian participants, while low resilience, having turnover intention and low level of regular exercise strongly predicted burnout in Chinese participants. The effect size of turnover intention on burnout in the Australian group was almost twice that of the Chinese group.


CONCLUSION
The findings of this study show that there are differences in burnout between Australian and Chinese nurses. The effects of resilience and turnover intention on burnout between the two groups are also identified.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The differences in nurse burnout and the effects of resilience and turnover intention on burnout should be better understood by nurse managers from Australia and China. Moreover, developing effective strategies relevant to their own country to reduce nurse burnout is recommended.","[{'authorId': '48302325', 'name': 'Yu-Fang Guo'}, {'authorId': '7778013', 'name': 'V.

This systematic review deals with the overlaps and differences among the many different terminologies and definitions of self-regulation in childhood and the association with preschooler’s social-emotional and behavioural development. A systematic literature search in bibliographic databases identified 22 studies, published between 2011 and 2017, which met further inclusion criteria. Our review revealed considerable similarities and differences regarding definitions, core components, and measurements of self-regulation. Results regarding preschooler’s social-emotional and behavioural outcomes were heterogeneous, but overall the significance of children’s level of self-regulation was emphasized. In order to make clear statements about the impact on children’s development, self-regulation must be defined uniformly. This study indicates the need for an integrative model for self-regulation in childhood, considering dimensionality, individual components, and its organization.","[{'authorId': '2060612544', 'name': 'Annika Rademacher'}, {'authorId': '5909937', 'name': 'Ute Koglin'}]",27.0,,99.0,The concept of self-regulation and preschoolers’ social-emotional development: a systematic review,2019.0

We also investigated if the treatment increased knowledge and awareness of emotions and their functions, increased emotion regulation skills and decreased self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. Six skills training groups were piloted with a total of 20 adolescents and 21 adults. The treatment consisted of five sessions dealing with psychoeducation about emotions and emotion regulation skills training. Paired-samples t test was used to compare differences between before-and-after measures for adolescents and parents separately. The primary outcome measure, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, showed significant improvement after treatment for both adolescents and parents. For adolescents, measures of alexithymia were significantly reduced. Also, emotional awareness was significantly increased. Measures of depression and anxiety did not change.

dc48c6b4021dfbb5d7ba16032ca3ecb7777cb7ab,"This article explores the possibility that romantic love is an attachment process--a biosocial process by which affectional bonds are formed between adult lovers, just as affectional bonds are formed earlier in life between human infants and their parents. Key components of attachment theory, developed by Bowlby, Ainsworth, and others to explain the development of affectional bonds in infancy, were translated into terms appropriate to adult romantic love. The translation centered on the three major styles of attachment in infancy--secure, avoidant, and anxious/ambivalent--and on the notion that continuity of relationship style is due in part to mental models (Bowlby's ""inner working models"") of self and social life. These models, and hence a person's attachment style, are seen as determined in part by childhood relationships with parents. Two questionnaire studies indicated that relative prevalence of the three attachment styles is roughly the same in adulthood as in infancy, the three kinds of adults differ predictably in the way they experience romantic love, and attachment style is related in theoretically meaningful ways to mental models of self and social relationships and to relationship experiences with parents. Implications for theories of romantic love are discussed, as are measurement problems and other issues related to future tests of the attachment perspective.","[{'authorId': '3641452', 'name': 'C.

Methods A group of 935 students aged between 18 and 45 years (509 females and 426 males) was recruited from different universities in Istanbul. SAs, alexithymia and social media use were assessed using the Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Version (SAS-SV), Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), and ad-hoc questions regarding social media use. Results The mean age of participants was 21.89±3.27 years and 509 of participants were female (54.4%). 455 (48.6%) participants were placed in the “SA” and 198 (21.2%) in the “alexithymia” categories. The study found a high level of positive correlation (p<0.001) between both subscale and total TAS-20 scores and SAS-SV scores.

dc6a5d898996f2c221752806aeab449c24c9b1b7,"Emotions seem to come and go as they please. However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

dd08ee72ec20d789df2f8657139d2dc048d5f955,"ABSTRACT Virtual reality (VR) platforms act as a potentially transformative tool in learning and teaching. The aim of this study was to examine pre-service teachers’ (PST) perceptions about VR, inclusive of their beliefs about its capacity to be used as a teaching and learning tool. A case-study, conducted at an urban university in Australia involved a sample of n = 41. Participants’ positive perceptions of VR in their teaching relate to its potential to engage learners, the immersive potential of the platform and the scope of VR to offer students experiences they might otherwise not have with other learning tools. Concerns expressed by PSTs include their relatively low self-efficacy to use VR in their teaching, monitoring-related matters, financial cost and implementing the technology in a safe and supportive way. There was a significant difference in PSTs’ amount of self-efficacy to teach using VR when compared to their overall confidence to use digital technologies. PSTs typically had greater awareness of the immersive and engagement potential of VR and less awareness about its potential to foster and promote collaborative learning. This paper contributes to an emerging discourse regarding the possible applications of VR in educational environments and particularly in relation teacher-educator contexts.","[{'authorId': '153016337', 'name': 'G.

Cognitive ability was negatively related to physical ability and grit. While cognitive ability predicted academic and military grades, the noncognitive attributes of physical ability and grit were more prognostic of other achievement outcomes, including successful completion of initiation training and 4-y graduation. When predicting success, how important are personal attributes other than cognitive ability? To address this question, we capitalized on a full decade of prospective, longitudinal data from n = 11,258 cadets entering training at the US Military Academy at West Point. Prior to training, cognitive ability was negatively correlated with both physical ability and grit. Cognitive ability emerged as the strongest predictor of academic and military grades, but noncognitive attributes were more prognostic of other achievement outcomes, including successful completion of initiation training and 4-y graduation. We conclude that noncognitive aspects of human capital deserve greater attention from both scientists and practitioners interested in predicting real-world success.","[{'authorId': '5720574', 'name': 'A.

The relationship between schizophrenia symptoms, insight and cognitive domains remains controversial. We aimed to study these relations in a sample of Egyptian patients with schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 109 patients with schizophrenia were assessed using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.)) Axis I diagnosis (SCID-I), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Scale to Assess Unawareness of Medical Disorder (SUMD). Cognitive functions were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS). The cognitive functions would be distributed to cover six cognitive domains: attention/vigilance speed of processing, verbal learning, visual learning, working memory and reasoning/problem solving. Results: There was a significant correlation between all cognitive domains (except attention) and PANSS subscales. PANSS negative and general psychopathology subscales were significantly correlated with five cognitive domains: speed of processing, verbal learning, visual learning, working memory and reasoning/problem solving. PANSS negative subscale was significantly correlated with verbal learning (verbal paired association 1) and visual learning (visual paired association 1). There was a significant correlation between all cognitive domains and SUMD, except verbal and visual learning domains assessed by verbal and visual paired association 1 subtests, as well as attention assessed by failure to maintain set subtest. Only visual learning (trials administered), working memory (percentage error), and processing speed (perseverative responses, and trials to complete first category) were significantly negatively correlated to SUMD. Conclusion: Cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia is most likely to underlie negative symptoms, general psychopathology symptoms and poor insight, suggesting that treatment strategies minimizing these symptoms would improve cognitive impairment.","[{'authorId': '80739224', 'name': 'A.

However, risk and protective factors contributing to these problems are currently underspecified. Aims The current longitudinal study examined the role of emotion‐regulation (ER) strategies in the severity of depressive symptoms in children with and without DLD, taking into account the severity of communication problems of children with DLD. Methods & Procedures We followed clinically referred children with DLD (n = 114, 49% girls) and without DLD (n = 214, 58% girls) between the ages of 8 and 16 years across an 18‐month period. Participants completed self‐report questionnaires at three time points. Parents of children with DLD reported on their child's communication problems. Outcomes & Results Multilevel analyses confirmed higher levels of depressive symptoms in youngsters with DLD compared with peers without DLD, with a decrease across time in the DLD group. In both groups, higher levels of approach and increasing avoidant strategies aimed at distraction or trivializing a problem explained lower depressive symptoms, whereas more worry and externalizing strategies contributed to more depressive symptoms. Within the DLD group, semantic language problems were associated with higher depressive symptoms. However, this relation was mediated by the tendency to worry or use externalizing strategies. Conclusions & Implications Results suggest that interventions for children with DLD should focus on enhancing their adaptive ER strategies to help them cope with daily stressors just as in the general population.","[{'authorId': '51063748', 'name': 'Neeltje P. van den Bedem'}, {'authorId': '5956483', 'name': 'J.

ddd57e5807816291443bb99ffb6d70b0373dc866,"Prosody is an important tool of human communication, carrying both affective and pragmatic messages in speech. Prosody recognition relies on processing of acoustic cues, such as the fundamental frequency of the voice signal, and their interpretation according to acquired socioemotional scripts. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show deficiencies in affective prosody recognition. These deficiencies have been mostly associated with general difficulties in emotion recognition. The current study explored an additional association between affective prosody recognition in ASD and auditory perceptual abilities. Twenty high‐functioning male adults with ASD and 32 typically developing male adults, matched on age and verbal abilities undertook a battery of auditory tasks. These included affective and pragmatic prosody recognition tasks, two psychoacoustic tasks (pitch direction recognition and pitch discrimination), and a facial emotion recognition task, representing nonvocal emotion recognition. Compared with controls, the ASD group demonstrated poorer performance on both vocal and facial emotion recognition, but not on pragmatic prosody recognition or on any of the psychoacoustic tasks. Both groups showed strong associations between psychoacoustic abilities and prosody recognition, both affective and pragmatic, although these were more pronounced in the ASD group. Facial emotion recognition predicted vocal emotion recognition in the ASD group only. These findings suggest that auditory perceptual abilities, alongside general emotion recognition abilities, play a significant role in affective prosody recognition in ASD.

ddeb34dc450a7cdc9fd11cdb896b266be9fa1f05,"Problem/Condition Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Period Covered 2016. Description of System The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an active surveillance program that provides estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years whose parents or guardians live in 11 ADDM Network sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). Surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase involves review and abstraction of comprehensive evaluations that were completed by medical and educational service providers in the community. In the second phase, experienced clinicians who systematically review all abstracted information determine ASD case status. The case definition is based on ASD criteria described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Results For 2016, across all 11 sites, ASD prevalence was 18.5 per 1,000 (one in 54) children aged 8 years, and ASD was 4.3 times as prevalent among boys as among girls. ASD prevalence varied by site, ranging from 13.1 (Colorado) to 31.4 (New Jersey). Prevalence estimates were approximately identical for non-Hispanic white (white), non-Hispanic black (black), and Asian/Pacific Islander children (18.5, 18.3, and 17.9, respectively) but lower for Hispanic children (15.4). Among children with ASD for whom data on intellectual or cognitive functioning were available, 33% were classified as having intellectual disability (intelligence quotient [IQ] ≤70); this percentage was higher among girls than boys (40% versus 32%) and among black and Hispanic than white children (47%, 36%, and 27%, respectively). Black children with ASD were less likely to have a first evaluation by age 36 months than were white children with ASD (40% versus 45%). The overall median age at earliest known ASD diagnosis (51 months) was similar by sex and racial and ethnic groups; however, black children with IQ ≤70 had a later median age at ASD diagnosis than white children with IQ ≤70 (48 months versus 42 months). Interpretation The prevalence of ASD varied considerably across sites and was higher than previous estimates since 2014. Although no overall difference in ASD prevalence between black and white children aged 8 years was observed, the disparities for black children persisted in early evaluation and diagnosis of ASD. Hispanic children also continue to be identified as having ASD less frequently than white or black children. Public Health Action These findings highlight the variability in the evaluation and detection of ASD across communities and between sociodemographic groups. Continued efforts are needed for early and equitable identification of ASD and timely enrollment in services.","[{'authorId': '3511870', 'name': 'M. Maenner'}, {'authorId': '153669206', 'name': 'K.

Hearing loss is a risk factor for social isolation and loneliness. We investigated the buffering effects of hearing aid use on perceived social and emotional loneliness.


METHOD
Forty older adults participated. Prior to and following the hearing aid fitting, participants completed the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (De Jong Gierveld & Kamphuis, 1985); a change in feelings of loneliness following hearing aid use was the outcome indicator.


RESULTS
There was a significant decline in perceptions of loneliness following 4 to 6 weeks of hearing aid use. A dose effect emerged with persons with moderate-to-severe hearing loss experiencing the greatest reduction in perceived loneliness with hearing aid use.


CONCLUSION
Associated with poorer health status and higher consumption of health care services, perceived loneliness is a challenge to treat. Hearing aid use appears to be a buffer against the experience of loneliness.","[{'authorId': '49591961', 'name': 'B.

Instead, many robots built in recent years have faces that are rendered onto a screen. This gives great flexibility in what a robot’s face can be and opens up a new design space with which to establish a robot’s character and perceived properties. Despite the prevalence of robots with rendered faces, there are no systematic explorations of this design space. Our work aims to fill that gap. We conducted a survey and identified 157 robots with rendered faces and coded them in terms of 76 properties. We present statistics, common patterns, and observations about this data set of faces. Next, we conducted two surveys to understand people’s perceptions of rendered robot faces and identify the impact of different face features. Survey results indicate preferences for varying levels of realism and detail in robot faces based on context, and indicate how the presence or absence of specific features affects perception of the face and the types of jobs the face would be appropriate for.","[{'authorId': '36104366', 'name': 'Alisa Kalegina'}, {'authorId': '39449608', 'name': 'G.

Results were summarized by narrative review and meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Self-regulation outcomes in children and adolescents. Results This review identified 17 cluster randomized trials and 32 randomized clinical trials evaluating self-regulation interventions, which included a total of 23 098 participants ranging in age from 2 to 17 years (median age, 6.0 years). Consistent improvement in self-regulation was reported in 16 of 21 curriculum-based interventions (76%), 4 of the 8 mindfulness and yoga interventions (50%), 5 of 9 family-based programs (56%), 4 of 6 exercise-based programs (67%), and 4 of 6 social and personal skills interventions (67%), or a total of 33 of 50 interventions (66%). A meta-analysis evaluating associations of interventions with self-regulation task performance scores showed a positive effect of such interventions with pooled effect size of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.32-0.53). Only 24 studies reported data on distal outcomes (29 outcomes). Positive associations were reported in 11 of 13 studies (85%) on academic achievement, 4 of 5 studies on substance abuse (80%), and in all studies reporting on conduct disorders (n = 3), studies on social skills (n = 2), studies on depression (n = 2), studies on behavioral problems (n = 2), and study on school suspensions (n = 1). No effect was seen on 2 studies reporting on academic achievement, 1 study reporting on substance abuse, and 1 additional study reporting on psychological well-being. Conclusions and Relevance A wide range of interventions were successful in improving self-regulation in children and adolescents. There was improvement in distal academic, health, and behavioral outcomes in most intervention groups compared with controls.","[{'authorId': '47820579', 'name': 'A.

There has been widespread and growing use of this approach within medical settings in the last 20 years, and many claims have been made regarding its efficacy. This article will provide a critical evaluation of the available state of knowledge regarding MBSR and suggestions for future research. Methods A review of the current literature available within the medical and social sciences was undertaken to provide an evaluation regarding what we know about the construct of mindfulness, the effectiveness of MBSR, and mechanisms of action. Results There has been a paucity of research and what has been published has been rife with methodological problems. At present, we know very little about the effectiveness of this approach. However, there is some evidence that suggests that it may hold some promise. Conclusions The available evidence does not support a strong endorsement of this approach at present.

The vulnerability-stress model of psychotic disorders describes, in essence, an interaction between personal vulnerability and environmental stressors. The present study investigated this interaction and studied emotional reactivity to daily life stress as a vulnerability marker for psychotic illness.


METHODS
Patients with psychotic illness (n = 42), their first-degree relatives (n = 47), and control subjects (n = 49) were studied with the Experience Sampling Method (a structured diary technique assessing thoughts, current context, and mood in daily life) to assess (1) appraised subjective stress of daily events and smaller disturbances in daily life and (2) emotional reactivity conceptualized as changes in both negative affect and positive affect.


RESULTS
Multilevel regression analyses showed that an increase in subjective stress was associated with an increase in negative affect and a decrease in positive affect in all groups. However, the groups differed quantitatively in their pattern of reactions to stress. Patients with psychotic illness reacted with more intense emotions to subjective appraisals of stress in daily life than control subjects. The decrease in positive affect in the relatives was similar to that of the patients, while the increase in negative affect in this group was intermediary to that of patients and control subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
Higher levels of familial risk for psychosis were associated with higher levels of emotional reactivity to daily life stress in a dose-response fashion. Subtle alterations in the way persons interact with their environment may constitute part of the vulnerability for psychotic illness.","[{'authorId': '1395869009', 'name': 'I.

e0011a89a79b6a71997f941532c97cfa6c3a34e4,"Recently, early childhood educators and policy makers have placed an increased emphasis on assessing emotional development in young children who are considered educationally at-risk. (Department of Health and Human Services Administration on Children, Youth, and Families/Head Start Bureau, 2000). The desire to assess emotional development is not surprising given that children's skill in understanding others' emotions appears closely tied to their ability to establish and maintain positive social relationships with others in the school years and throughout life. Specifically, researchers have found that young children who have better developed emotion recognition and emotional perspective-taking abilities demonstrate higher levels of prosocial behavior and are more popular with their peers (Denham, 1986; Denham, McKinley, Couchoud, & Holt, 1990; Leppanen & Hietanen, 2001). Other research has linked emotion recognition and understanding with high levels of pretend play and behavioral and emotional competence with peers (Carlo, Knight, Eisenberg, & Rotenberg, 1991; Lindsey & Colwell, 2003). In contrast, children who are poor at emotion recognition and emotional perspective-taking are at increased risk of being disliked by their peers (Denham et al.; Leppanen & Hietanen, 2001), are rated by teachers as being more socially withdrawn (Strand, Cerna, & Downs, in press), and are at risk for the numerous negative educational and psychosocial outcomes long known to be associated with peer rejection (Asher & Wheeler, 1985; Asher & Coie, 1990; Ladd, 1990). Although results such as these have suggested that emotion understanding in general, and emotion recognition in particular, are important developmental variables, there is limited information available regarding the effectiveness of attempts to manipulate emotion recognition skill in individuals who have disabilities. Research with adults has generally indicated that interventions can successfully improve the emotion recognition ability of those who have learning disabilities, (McKenzie, Matheson, McKaskie, Hamilton, & Murray, 2000), intellectual disabilities (McAlpine, Singh, Ellis, & Kendall, 1992; Rydin-Owen, Drake, & Bratt, 1999), high-functioning autism (Bolte, Hubl, Feineis-Matthews, Dierks, & Poutska, 2006), or acquired brain injury (Guercio, Podolska-Schroeder, & Rehfeldt, 2004). However, studies focused on children have been less consistent. For example, Dyck and Denver (2003) reported no improvements in emotion recognition skill for deaf children exposed to an 11-lesson psychoeducational program. In contrast, Stewart and Singh (1995) found that teaching via directed rehearsal led to significant gains in basic emotion recognition skill in a study of boys with mental retardation. Emotion recognition has long been thought to be impaired in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD; Hobson, Ouston, & Lee, 1989), so it is not surprising that some researchers have examined the effectiveness of emotion recognition training with this population. As has been the case in children with other disabilities, the results have been equivocal. Using a computer training program, LaCava, Golan, Baron-Cohen, and Myles (2007) found significant gains in emotion recognition skill in children with ASD. However, Silver and Oakes (2001) reported that computer training did not lead to significant emotion recognition gains in adolescents with ASD compared to controls. Other research has shown that children with autism exposed to behavioral interventions may develop advanced emotion understanding abilities (e.g., the understanding of desire-based emotions in others) but may still have difficulties with basic emotion recognition (Downs & Smith, 2004). It is interesting to note that none of the studies cited above attempted to teach emotion recognition skills to preschoolers, even though the developmental literature suggests that the preschool years are typically a time of significant growth in this ability (Denham, 1998). …","[{'authorId': '47971993', 'name': 'Andrew M.

Siri brought the potential of spoken language technology to the attention of the wider general public, and speech finally became “mainstream”. This meant that ordinary people suddenly had an informed opinion about the merits (or otherwise) of using their voice to access information, send messages and control their smart devices. So, this paper presents the results of two surveys that were conducted in order to find out what ordinary people think about contemporary spoken language technology. The first used a modified version of the surveys conducted every six years at the IEEE ASRU series of workshops, and the second addressed questions about the awareness and usage of speech technology by members of the general public. The overall results suggest that ordinary people are more optimistic than the experts about what spoken language technology might have to offer, but usage patterns reveal that the majority of end users still prefer typing to talking, with accuracy, privacy and online accessibility cited as the main impediments to wider take-up.","[{'authorId': '145914568', 'name': 'Roger K.

During recent decades, self-regulated learning (SRL) has become a major research field. SRL successfully integrates the cognitive and motivational components of learning. Self-regulation is usually seen as an individual process, with the social aspects of regulation conceptualized as one aspect of the context. However, recent research has begun to investigate whether self-regulation processes are complemented by socially shared regulation processes.


AIMS
The presented study investigated what kind of socio-emotional challenges students experience during collaborative learning and whether the students regulate the emotions evoked during these situations. The interplay of the emotion regulation processes between the individual and the group was also studied.


SAMPLE
The sample for this study was 63 teacher education students who studied in groups of three to five during three collaborative learning tasks.


METHOD
Students' interpretations of experienced social challenges and their attempts to regulate emotions evoked by these challenges were collected following each task using the Adaptive Instrument for the Regulation of Emotions.


RESULTS
The results indicated that students experienced a variety of social challenges. Students also reported the use of shared regulation in addition to self-regulation. Finally, the results suggested that intrinsic group dynamics are derived from both individual and social elements of collaborative situations.


CONCLUSION
The findings of the study support the assumption that students can regulate emotions collaboratively as well as individually. The study contributes to our understanding of the social aspects of emotional regulation in collaborative learning contexts.","[{'authorId': '2445256', 'name': 'H.

In particular, the issue of unpaid internships has been the source of legislative, judicial and ethical debate. Some have criticised colleges and universities for promoting an expansion of internships for undergraduate students – with little regard for internship characteristics such as compensation, quality of supervision and work activities. Meanwhile, there is a paucity of research examining the role internship characteristics, such as compensation, supervisor behaviours and work design have on internship efficacy. Based on a survey of undergraduate students in the US, the results showed that supervisor mentoring, the developmental value of the internship and the job pursuit intentions of the intern with the host employer were lower for those reporting on their unpaid internship vs. paid internship. Meanwhile, supervisor support and supervisor mentoring are significant predictors of internship efficacy regardless of internship compensation, while work design has much less of an impact on internship efficacy.

This framework is exemplified and interrogated through two cases of authentic feedback practice, one in the subject of digital media in an Australian university, the other focussed on bedside rounds in medicine at a university in Hong Kong. The framework enables the identification of both highly authentic aspects of feedback, and aspects that could be made more authentic.

e1c16a276f08858ccad20e9e2ca188726fffefad,"Self-regulated learning (SRL) includes the cognitive, metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy, volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has become one of the most important areas of research within educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne and Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and Miller. First, each model is explored in detail in the following aspects: (a) history and development, (b) description of the model (including the model figures), (c) empirical support, and (d) instruments constructed based on the model. Then, the models are compared in a number of aspects: (a) citations, (b) phases and subprocesses, (c) how they conceptualize (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion, (d) top–down/bottom–up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In the discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are extracted. Further, four future lines of research are proposed. The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the SRL models form an integrative and coherent framework from which to conduct research and on which students can be taught to be more strategic and successful. Second, based on the available meta-analytic evidence, there are differential effects of SRL models in light of differences in students’ developmental stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and teachers need to start applying these differential effects of the SRL models and theories to enhance students’ learning and SRL skills.","[{'authorId': '2476864', 'name': 'E.

In the specific context of voluntary medical checkups, we examined sample dyads (ARHL individual and the caregiver) to determine whether QoL of patients and caregivers is influenced by coping strategies implemented either by themselves or their relatives. Methods This was a cross-sectional study with a descriptive/correlative design performed in a French preventive health center (Regional Institute for Prevention of Aging, Marseille, France) for the beneficiaries of pension funds of private sector employees. The samples included beneficiary–caregiver dyads. The beneficiaries had bilateral (mild to moderately severe) ARHL. Self-reported data were collected as follows: QoL using the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire, coping strategies using the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Scale, and anxiety and mood using visual analog scales. Results The final sample comprised 44 beneficiaries and 44 caregivers. The caregiver was the partner of the beneficiary in 73% of cases. The QoL scores of the social dimension were significantly lower for beneficiaries and caregivers compared with French age- and sex-matched controls. Among beneficiaries and caregivers, coping strategies based on problem solving were the most commonly used strategies. The use of positive thinking strategies was associated with higher QoL scores. The more one member of the dyad used an avoidance coping strategy, the more the other member used a positive thinking strategy. Conclusion This study emphasizes that QoL of individuals with age-related hearing impairment and their natural caregivers is related to the coping strategies that they use. This finding suggests that targeted interventions should be offered to help individuals who experience emotional difficulties to implement more efficient coping strategies.","[{'authorId': '8600125', 'name': 'S.

This scale facilitates the understanding of the disorders underlying emotional dysregulation. However, its length may require a shorter version to create more flexible study protocols. The original scale has demonstrated good psychometric properties and has been shown to be a useful measurement instrument for emotion regulation.

Based on the strongest items from the six-factor structure, a 20-item form of the DERS was obtained, and reliability analysis showed good results both on scales and factors. In Study 2 , the DERS-20 was administered to n = 262 subjects who also completed the DERS-36, the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), the Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) to examine the construct validity.

A multidisciplinary understanding of this ability is timely and can strengthen theory and practice. The present review aims to inform educators on what cognitive neuroscience can teach us about self-regulation. To do so, we will focus on a decade-long research program examining children with disruptive behavior problems and their peers, and ask whether neural measures of self-regulation can (a) covary with individual differences in behavioral measures of self-regulation, (b) trace developmental patterns, and (c) predict or trace behavioral change with successful treatment of disruptive behavior problems. We show that several studies begin to converge on a set of neural measures derived from the prefrontal cortex that can be consistently linked to processes of self-regulation. Next, we will discuss what these measures mean from a cognitive neuroscience perspective and how this knowledge could influence and/or support psychological models relevant to education.","[{'authorId': '2091679', 'name': 'S.

The present study aims to examine for the first time the emotional impact of the quarantine on children and adolescents from Italy and Spain, two of the countries most affected by COVID-19. Participants were 1,143 parents of Italian and Spanish children aged 3 to 18 years who completed a survey providing information about how the quarantine affects their children and themselves, compared to before the home confinement. Results show that 85.7% of the parents perceived changes in their children’s emotional state and behaviors during the quarantine. The most frequent symptoms were difficulty concentrating (76.6%), boredom (52%), irritability (39%), restlessness (38.8%), nervousness (38%), feelings of loneliness (31.3%), uneasiness (30.4%), and worries (30.1%). Spanish parents reported more symptoms than Italians. As expected, children of both countries used monitors more frequently, spent less time doing physical activity, and slept more hours during the quarantine. Furthermore, when family coexistence during quarantine became more difficult, the situation was more serious, and the level of stress was higher, parents tended to report more emotional problems in their children. The quarantine impacts considerably on Italian and Spanish youth, reinforcing the need to detect children with problems as early as possible to improve their psychological well-being.","[{'authorId': '4117334', 'name': 'M.

Robots are being developed for feeding, washing, lifting, carrying and mobilising the elderly as well as monitoring their health. They are also being proposed as a substitute for companionship. While these technologies could accrue major benefits for society and empower the elderly, we must balance their use with the ethical costs. These include a potential reduction in human contact, increased feeling of objectification and loss of control, loss of privacy and personal freedom as well as deception and infantilisation. With appropriate guidelines in place before the introduction of robots en masse into the care system, robots could improve the lives of the elderly, reducing their dependence and creating more opportunities for social interaction.

The ability to learn new words is critical in the development of oral and written language, and significantly impacts engagement in social, academic and vocational situations. Many studies have evaluated the word-learning process in people with developmental language disorder (DLD). However, methodologies for assessment are heterogeneous, creating difficulties in synthesizing findings and identifying gaps in the knowledge base.


AIMS
To scope systematically the literature and identify key methodological parameters considered in evaluations of word learning in people with DLD; and to identify gaps in the literature to guide further research in this area.


METHODS & PROCEDURES
Twelve databases were searched and a total of 70 studies that met eligibility criteria were identified. The studies were evaluated according to key parameters that researchers varied in their word-learning methodologies.


MAIN CONTRIBUTION
Most research has focused on word learning in the oral modality, and specifically in children with DLD. Fewer studies have explored word learning in adults and adolescents with DLD, and in the written modality. Depending on the research question and theoretical perspective driving the investigation, methodologies for assessing word learning considered a range of parameters, including words being learned, learning context and cues to support learning in the tasks.


CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS
This review aggregates a variety of methods used previously to assess word learning. Findings highlight the need for further research to explore areas such as: the learning of varied word types (e.g., adjectives and adverbs); learning in the written modality; and word learning (both oral and written) in adolescents and adults with DLD.","[{'authorId': '144311525', 'name': 'E.

Interestingly, there seems to be considerable variation both in the strategies people use to regulate emotions and in the success of these emotion regulation efforts. The Selection, Optimization, and Compensation with Emotion Regulation framework suggests that variation in the resources required for particular emotion regulation strategies may be a crucial determinant of emotion regulation use and success within individuals across situations, between individuals, and between groups of individuals. In this review, we consider the ways in which two resources for emotion regulation (working memory and social support) might differ among three groups, namely adolescents, older adults, and adults with major depressive disorder. We link these between-group differences in resources to differences in emotion regulation and make suggestions for future research.","[{'authorId': '51042018', 'name': 'Philipp C.

The educational-therapeutic interventions were conducted in an eleven-session case study program on three high-functioning and one low-functioning children with autism taking into consideration the children’s, parents’, and therapists’ experience during the program. The results indicated that as a tool and facilitator, the NAO robot does have the ability to teach musical notes/rhythms to the participants with high-functioning autism. It was also observed that the severity of the participants’ autism as well as the stress of the parents decreased somewhat during these sessions. Furthermore, noticeable improvements were seen in social/cognitive skills of all four participants; as well as the positive effect of this program on fine motor imitation skills of two subjects after the interventions.

The CBQ is a caregiver report measure designed to provide a detailed assessment of temperament in children 3 to 7 years of age. Individual differences are assessed on 15 primary temperament characteristics: Positive Anticipation, Smiling/Laughter, High Intensity Pleasure, Activity Level, Impulsivity, Shyness, Discomfort, Fear, Anger/Frustration, Sadness, Soothability, Inhibitory Control, Attentional Focusing, Low Intensity Pleasure, and Perceptual Sensitivity. Factor analyses of CBQ scales reliably recover a three-factor solution indicating three broad dimensions of temperament: Extraversion/Surgency, Negative Affectivity, and Effortful Control. This three-factor solution also appears to be reliably recovered in ratings of children in other cultures (e.g., China and Japan). Evidence for convergent validity derives from confirmation of hypothesized relations between temperament and socialization-relevant traits. In addition, parental agreement on CBQ ratings is substantial. The CBQ scales demonstrate adequate internal consistency, and may be used in studies requiring a highly differentiated yet integrated measure of temperament for children in this age range.","[{'authorId': '4597920', 'name': 'M.

A crucial aspect in achieving this goal is the robot’s capability to infer and interpret human emotions. Thanks to its design and open programming platform, the NAO humanoid robot is one of the most widely used agents for human interaction. As with person-to-person communication, facial expressions are the privileged channel for recognizing the interlocutor’s emotional expressions. Although NAO is equipped with a facial expression recognition module, specific use cases may require additional features and affective computing capabilities that are not currently available. This study proposes a highly accurate convolutional-neural-network-based facial expression recognition model that is able to further enhance the NAO robot’ awareness of human facial expressions and provide the robot with an interlocutor’s arousal level detection capability. Indeed, the model tested during human–robot interactions was 91% and 90% accurate in recognizing happy and sad facial expressions, respectively; 75% accurate in recognizing surprised and scared expressions; and less accurate in recognizing neutral and angry expressions. Finally, the model was successfully integrated into the NAO SDK, thus allowing for high-performing facial expression classification with an inference time of 0.34 ± 0.04 s.","[{'authorId': '46505439', 'name': 'C.

In the present review it has been addressed the issue of whether some forms of emotion regulation are healthier than others by focusing on two commonly used emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal (changing the way one thinks about potentially emotion-eliciting events) and expressive suppression (changing the way one behaviorally responds to emotion-eliciting events). In the first section, experimental findings showing that cognitive reappraisal has a healthier profile of short-term affective, cognitive, and social consequences than expressive suppression are briefly reported. In the second section, individual-difference findings are reviewed showing that using cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions is associated with healthier patterns of affect, social functioning, and well-being than is using expressive suppression.

However, only a handful of studies have implemented wellbeing interventions online, and those studies have largely done so in a way that prioritizes experimental control over realism and scalability. We sought to take existing wellbeing interventions with established efficacy and to evaluate their impact when translated into a format that is publicly accessible, scalable, and designed with the goal of engaging users. Participants in this fully online trial were first-time registrants of the Happify platform, a fully automated web and mobile wellbeing intervention grounded in positive psychology, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and mindfulness-based stress reduction, which has offered wellbeing programs to over 3 million registrants to date. Consenting participants were randomly assigned to access the full Happify platform or a psychoeducation comparison condition and further categorized by their usage during the study: recommended usage (a minimum of 2-3 activities per week) or low usage (usage less than the recommended level). Participants were assessed on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a composite measure of resilience at baseline and 8 weeks later. Participants who used Happify at the recommended level reported fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms and greater resilience after 8 weeks than participants who used Happify at a low level or participants who used the psychoeducation condition at any level. The Happify group also experienced greater rates of reduction in depression and anxiety symptom severity category, and had a greater net benefit (% users who improved minus % users who deteriorated), compared to the other groups. The results of this study suggest a successful first attempt at implementing and scaling a comprehensive package of lab-tested wellbeing interventions without losing efficacy.","[{'authorId': '152293353', 'name': 'A.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare.

e494742fcc9a13a5c2fe88d55b2d5a386df8387b,"Purpose 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of occupational disidentification through the lens of conservation of resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1989, 1998). Occupational disidentification is conceptualized as a coping strategy, or an investment of resources to cope with poor perceived prestige of the occupation, which represents a threat to an individual’s resource: one’s self-esteem. However, occupational disidentification, as an avoidance coping strategy, generates a loss of cognitive and emotional resources leading to emotional exhaustion and, in turn, departure from the organization. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The research hypotheses are tested among two samples of employees working in health and social services (Study 1, N=544), and in home care services (Study 2, N=113). Measures of employees’ attitudes were collected at the same time, and turnover was collected 18 months (Study 1) and 12 months (Study 2) later. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
Research hypotheses are all supported. Occupational disidentification partially mediates the occupational prestige-emotional exhaustion relationship, and emotional exhaustion partially mediates the occupational disidentification-turnover intention relationship. Perceived organizational support moderates the negative relationship between perceived occupational prestige and occupational disidentification. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
The main contribution of this study is the conceptualization of occupational disidentification within the theoretical framework of COR. In that vein, the study provides: a deeper understanding of the mechanisms explaining and buffering occupational disidentification, and empirical evidence of the key role of emotional exhaustion to explain the consequences of occupational disidentification.","[{'authorId': '4300057', 'name': 'Kathleen Bentein'}, {'authorId': '32018872', 'name': 'Sylvie Guerrero'}, {'authorId': '2084271916', 'name': 'Geneviève Jourdain'}, {'authorId': '50354224', 'name': 'Denis Chênevert'}]",18.0,,48.0,Investigating occupational disidentification: a resource loss perspective,2017.0

Robot-assisted Therapy (RAT) can improve the behavior of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a spontaneous and entertaining way. There are no previous experiences of this type of inter vention in our country.


OBJECTIVE
To describe a clinical experience of using RAT and its impact on the behaviors of a group of children with ASD, in a therapeutic context.


PATIENTS AND METHOD
Quasi experimental clinical experience type study. 4 children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD were selected, supported by the ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule); aged between 9 and 13 years, and normal IQ according to the WISC-III (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children). This study was approved by the Central Metropolitan Ethics Committee. Patients attended 10 structured robot-as sisted therapy sessions, working collaboratively in pairs. Workshop attendance and parent and child satisfaction were evaluated through surveys, the adaptive behavior with the Vineland scale, and so cial interaction with video coding guidelines.


RESULTS
Patients presented a very good adherence and satisfaction with the activity. There was an improvement in socialization behaviors and social age. Video-coding showed an increase in social interaction and improvement in the behavior of the pa tients after attending workshops.


CONCLUSIONS
We observed that the experience with RAT, adapted to the context of a Chilean public health center, was highly attractive and beneficial for patients with ASD, improving core symptoms such as difficulties in social interaction and behavioral problems.","[{'authorId': '2081550381', 'name': 'C.

However, only recently have early childhood researchers begun to investigate the contributions of parenting variables to EF. In this article, we review this emerging evidence as it pertains to (a) the parenting behaviors associated with EF, (b) the risk and protective factors that moderate these associations, and (c) the mechanisms through which parenting apparently operates on emerging EF. We also discuss directions for research on transactional parent–child dynamics, experimental tests of causation, and differential susceptibility to environmental influences.","[{'authorId': '1423460523', 'name': 'Tracey Fay-Stammbach'}, {'authorId': '2042554', 'name': 'D.

However, most studies have tended to focus on the negative impact of the work, the quantitative evidence has been inconsistent, and the research has primarily been conducted outside the United Kingdom. Objectives This study aimed to assess the prevalence of, and identify predictor variables for, compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress in a group of UK therapists (N=253) working with adult trauma clients. Method An online questionnaire was developed which used The Professional Quality of Life Scale (Version 5) to assess compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress and collect demographics and other pertinent information. Results Whilst the majority of therapists scored within the average range for compassion satisfaction and burnout, 70% of scores indicated that therapists were at high risk of secondary traumatic stress. Maturity, time spent engaging in research and development activities, a higher perceived supportiveness of management, and supervision predicted higher potential for compassion satisfaction. Youth and a lower perceived supportiveness of management predicted higher risk of burnout. A higher risk of secondary traumatic stress was predicted in therapists engaging in more individual supervision and self-care activities, as well as those who had a personal trauma history. Conclusions UK therapists working with trauma clients are at high risk of being negatively impacted by their work, obtaining scores which suggest a risk of developing secondary traumatic stress. Of particular note was that exposure to trauma stories did not significantly predict secondary traumatic stress scores as suggested by theory. However, the negative impact of working with trauma clients was balanced by the potential for a positive outcome from trauma work as a majority indicated an average potential for compassion satisfaction.","[{'authorId': '1400842394', 'name': 'Ekundayo A.

Emotional regulation and psychological distress are directly linked as psychological distress takes place when an individual has difficulties with regulating their emotions.

A sample of 155 men in the age range of 18 to 55(M=30.39, SD=7.97) was drawn from government hospitals admitted for the treatment of the substance-related disorders through purposive sampling. Demographic information sheet, Drug History Performa, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-42 (DASS 42), and Emotional Regulation scale were used to collect data. Descriptive analysis, for demographic and social variables, depicted most of the participants belonged to a lower socioeconomic class. The mean duration of drug addiction was 12 years (SD =2.45). Most of the participants were multiple drug abusers. Peer pressure, failure in love affairs, and stress were reasons for drug addiction while reasons for relapse were peer pressure along with withdrawal symptoms and cessation of treatment. Descriptive analysis revealed that expressive-suppression emotional regulation strategies were common in study participants. Pearson product-moment correlational analysis demonstrates a significant positive relationship between psychological distress and expressive-suppression emotional regulation.  In the present population, both social (peer pressure and bad company of friends) and psychological (stress, loneliness, curiosity and  failure in love affair) factors are proven related to drug addiction problems. It is important to consider them for assessment as well as therapeutic intervention plans for patients with substance-related disorders.","[{'authorId': '2149042712', 'name': 'Dr Saima Majeed'}, {'authorId': '2174626271', 'name': 'Komal Nayyar'}, {'authorId': '2174628794', 'name': 'Dr Altaf Qadir Khan'}]",0.0,{'name': 'Journal of Professional &amp; Applied Psychology'},29.0,"Psychological Distress, Emotional Regulation, and Demographic Profile of Patients with Substance-Related Disorders",2022.0

Moreover, country-level emotion regulation was significantly correlated with country-level indices of both positive and negative adjustment.","[{'authorId': '145413880', 'name': 'D.

It was found that the girls have relatively little understanding of their negative internal states and/or are unable to express them to others, especially to fathers. They have few successful strategies for regulating negative emotions in themselves and others and are unaware of alternative strategies. This dysregulatory pattern likely prevents them from learning more appropriate ways of expressing and constructively handling their negative emotions that are necessary for healthy adjustment.

Its receptor is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS) and in β-cells in the pancreatic Islets. We have already demonstrated that the intracerebroventricular administration of DHA or GW9508, a GPR40/FFAR1 agonist, suppresses formalin-induced pain behavior. It also attenuates complete Freund's adjuvant-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, suggesting that these effects occur by increasing β-endorphin release from propiomelanocortin neurons. Furthermore, we found that the brain GPR40/FFAR1 signaling may involve in the regulation of the descending pain control system, whereas the deletion of GPR40/FFAR1 might exacerbate mechanical allodynia in postoperative pain. Therefore, it is possible that the brain n-3 fatty acid-GPR40/FFAR1 signaling may play a key role in the modulation of the endogenous pain control system and emotional function. Here, we discuss the role of brain n-3 fatty acids-GPR40/FFAR1 signaling in a pain, and we review the current status and future prospects of the brain GPR40/FFAR1.","[{'authorId': '2508084', 'name': 'K.

Twenty-eight bilingual adolescents with and without DLD in typical schools were followed from childhood to adolescence. At age five, language and cognitive variables were assessed. In addition, language, behavior, emotional and school adjustment, and socioeconomic and family aspects were evaluated at age 12. Results reveal that adolescents with DLD show poorer school adjustment and less adaptive skills when evaluated by their tutors, and a larger index of emotional problems when self-assessed. Moreover, family involvement, but not socioeconomic status (SES), emerged as a protective factor since it was related to behavioral, emotional, and school adjustment, a result that was further confirmed by structural equation modeling. Therefore, a more global approach involving individuals, schools and families is needed to provide adolescents with DLD adequate support.

The results showed that females reported more usage of Rumination while strategies of Positive refocusing, Refocus on planning and Positive reappraisal were often used by males. Also multiple regression analysis in females showed that Rumination predicted life satisfaction negatively and strategies of Positive reappraisal and putting into perspective, predicted life satisfaction positively, whereas in males strategies of Positive reappraisal and Refocus on planning predicted life satisfaction positively. The results demonstrated that there were some differences between males and females in selecting cognitive emotion regulation strategies and also a number of these strategies have a crucial role in predicting life satisfaction.

Although several strategies and technological approaches have been proposed for emotion regulation, they often require conscious attention and effort. This often limits their efficacy in practice. In this paper, we propose a different approach inspired by self-perception theory: noticing that people are often reacting to the perception of their own behavior, we artificially change their perceptions to influence their emotions. We conducted two studies to evaluate the potential of this approach by automatically and subtly altering how people perceive their own voice. In one study, participants that received voice feedback with a calmer tone during relationship conflicts felt less anxious. In the other study, participants who listened to their own voices with a lower pitch during contentious debates felt more powerful. We discuss the implications of our findings and the opportunities for designing automatic and less perceptible emotion regulation systems.","[{'authorId': '38412999', 'name': 'J.

e729fbd41a6fa492100aea0bbc43402a36c2da0b,"Abstract Objective: This study explored the psychological process from avoidance to acceptance in adults with acquired hearing impairment. Study design: A descriptive qualitative interview study was conducted in Sweden in 2010. Participants were 18 adults with an acquired sensorineural hearing impairment aged 50–70 years, who had recently obtained hearing aids at the Audiology Clinic of the Örebro University Hospital. The sample included both first-time hearing aid users (n = 10) and experienced hearing aid users (n = 8). Each participant took part in one semi-structured interview. Qualitative content analysis was performed on the manifest content of the interview transcripts. Results: Participants described the process from avoidance to acceptance as a slow and gradual process rooted in the awareness of the frequency and severity of hearing disability and of its psychological consequences. Facilitators included adaptive coping mechanisms, other people's comments and positive experiences, accessibility of help-seeking and routine health assessments. In contrast, barriers included maladaptive coping mechanisms and stigma. Conclusions: Participants described the process of acceptance as a personal process that involved, to some extent, their social network of family, friends and colleagues. It was also a trade-off between the consequences of untreated hearing impairment and the threat to normal identity that, through stigma, hearing impairment carries. Further studies are needed to fully investigate the role of access to information on hearing impairment acceptance. How professionals and society can facilitate the process of acceptance should also be a focus of future research efforts.","[{'authorId': '4522420', 'name': 'Gunilla Wänström'}, {'authorId': '38275523', 'name': 'M.

We describe a continuing body of research that identifies factors impacting a human's level of trust in a robotic teammate. The factors identified to date can be categorized as human influences (e.g., individual differences in terms of personality, experience, culture), machine influences (e.g., robotic platform, robot performance in terms of levels of automation, failure rates, false alarms), and environmental influences (e.g. task type, operational environment, shared mental models).

In our previous work on the PHysical Assistant RObot System (PHAROS), we developed a system that proposed and monitored physical activities. The system used a social robot to analyse, by means of computer vision, the exercise a person was doing. Then, a recommender system analysed the exercise performed and indicated what exercise to perform next. However, the system needed certain improvements. On the one hand, the vision system captured the movement of the person and indicated whether the exercise had been done correctly or not. On the other hand, the recommender system was based purely on a ranking system that did not take into account temporal evolution and preferences. In this work, we propose an evolution of PHAROS, PHAROS 2.0, incorporating improvements in both of the previously mentioned aspects. In the motion capture aspect, we are now able to indicate the degree of completeness of each exercise, identifying the part that has not been done correctly, and a real-time performance correction. In this way, the recommender system receives a greater amount of information and so can more accurately indicate the exercise to be performed. In terms of the recommender system, an algorithm was developed to weigh the performance, temporal evolution and preferences, providing a more accurate recommendation, as well as expanding the recommendation to a batch of exercises, instead of just one.","[{'authorId': '1403843587', 'name': 'Ester Martínez-Martín'}, {'authorId': '143646101', 'name': 'Ângelo Costa'}, {'authorId': '144058275', 'name': 'M.

To challenge this view, we conducted two multimethod (quantitative/qualitative) experimental studies in the context of entrepreneurial team decision-making to examine whether and how an ethical champion can shape team decision ethicality and whether ethical champions experience interpersonal costs. In Study 1, we found that confederate ethical champions influenced team decisions to be more ethical by increasing team ethical awareness. Focusing on the emotional expressions of ethical champions, we found that sympathetic and angry ethical champions both increased team decision ethicality but that angry ethical champions were more disliked. Analysis of team interaction videos further revealed moral disengagement in team discussions and the emergence of nonconfederate ethical champions who used business frames to argue for the ethical decision. Those emergent phenomena shifted our focus, in Study 2, to how ethical champions framed the issues and the mediating processes involved. We found that ethical champions using ethical frames not only increased team ethical awareness but also consequently reduced team moral disengagement, resulting in more ethical team decisions. Ethical champions using business frames also improved team decision ethicality, but by increasing the perceived business utility of the ethical decision.

Innovative technology, such as socially assistive robots, has shown to be a viable method for Autism therapy. This paper presents a novel robot-based music-therapy platform for modeling and improving the social responses and behaviors of children with ASD. Our autonomous social interactive system consists of three modules. Module one provides an autonomous initiative positioning system for the robot, NAO, to properly localize and play the instrument (Xylophone) using the robot’s arms. Module two allows NAO to play customized songs composed by individuals. Module three provides a real-life music therapy experience to the users. We adopted Short-time Fourier Transform and Levenshtein distance to fulfill the design requirements: 1) “music detection” and 2) “smart scoring and feedback”, which allows NAO to understand music and provide additional practice and oral feedback to the users as applicable. We designed and implemented six Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) sessions including four intervention sessions. Nine children with ASD and seven Typically Developing participated in a total of fifty HRI experimental sessions. Using our platform, we collected and analyzed data on social behavioral changes and emotion recognition using Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals. The results of our experiments demonstrate most of the participants were able to complete motor control tasks with 70% accuracy. Six out of the nine ASD participants showed stable turn-taking behavior when playing music. The results of automated emotion classification using Support Vector Machines illustrates that emotional arousal in the ASD group can be detected and well recognized via EDA bio-signals. In summary, the results of our data analyses, including emotion classification using EDA signals, indicate that the proposed robot-music based therapy platform is an attractive and promising assistive tool to facilitate the improvement of fine motor control and turn-taking skills in children with ASD.","[{'authorId': '3018638', 'name': 'Huanghao Feng'}, {'authorId': '145531712', 'name': 'M.

Although neuroscientific research has revealed experience-dependent brain changes across the life span in sensory, motor, and cognitive domains, plasticity relating to social capacities remains largely unknown. To investigate whether the targeted mental training of different cognitive and social skills can induce specific changes in brain morphology, we collected longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data throughout a 9-month mental training intervention from a large sample of adults between 20 and 55 years of age. By means of various daily mental exercises and weekly instructed group sessions, training protocols specifically addressed three functional domains: (i) mindfulness-based attention and interoception, (ii) socio-affective skills (compassion, dealing with difficult emotions, and prosocial motivation), and (iii) socio-cognitive skills (cognitive perspective-taking on self and others and metacognition). MRI-based cortical thickness analyses, contrasting the different training modules against each other, indicated spatially diverging changes in cortical morphology. Training of present-moment focused attention mostly led to increases in cortical thickness in prefrontal regions, socio-affective training induced plasticity in frontoinsular regions, and socio-cognitive training included change in inferior frontal and lateral temporal cortices. Module-specific structural brain changes correlated with training-induced behavioral improvements in the same individuals in domain-specific measures of attention, compassion, and cognitive perspective-taking, respectively, and overlapped with task-relevant functional networks. Our longitudinal findings indicate structural plasticity in well-known socio-affective and socio-cognitive brain networks in healthy adults based on targeted short daily mental practices. These findings could promote the development of evidence-based mental training interventions in clinical, educational, and corporate settings aimed at cultivating social intelligence, prosocial motivation, and cooperation.","[{'authorId': '3226086', 'name': 'S.

Data were collected from 206 adolescents (10-18 years of age, M age = 13.37). Electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration data were collected from adolescents, and RSA values and respiration rates were computed. Adolescents reported on their own emotion regulation, prosocial behavior, and aggressive behavior. Multilevel latent growth modeling was employed to capture RSA responses across time (i.e., linear and quadratic changes; time course approach), and adolescent emotion regulation and adjustment variables were included in the model to test their links to RSA responses. Results indicated that high RSA baseline was associated with more adolescent prosocial behavior. A pattern of initial RSA decreases (RSA suppression) in response to angry event recall and subsequent RSA increases (RSA rebound) were related to better anger and sadness regulation and more prosocial behavior. However, RSA was not significantly linked to adolescent aggressive behavior. We also compared the time course approach with the conventional linear approach and found that the time course approach provided more meaningful and rich information.

e92cb457d7e8c5994a2b202eef5b592f7daebdd0,"During the past decades, the interplay between humans and robots has been investigated in the field of human-robot interaction (HRI). This research has provided fascinating results on the spectrum and forms of engagement between humans and robots and on the various behaviors displayed by robots aimed at interacting with and influencing humans (Tsarouchi et al., 2016; Ahmad et al., 2017; Saunderson and Nejat, 2019a). Yet, crucial questions regarding how humans want to interact with and be influenced by robots are sidestepped in this research, falling for what could be called a robotistic fallacy. This article outlines some of the current findings on HRI to then critically assess the broader implications of HRI and key questions that must be asked in this context. Social robots, i.e., robots that engage on a social level with humans, are expected to increasingly assist and support humans in workplace environments, healthcare, entertainment, training and education, and other fields (Ahmad et al., 2017; Richert et al., 2018; Pepito et al., 2020). By using an interdisciplinary approach that involves behavioral studies and cognitive and social neuroscience, recent research on social cognition and HRI investigates how humans perceive, interact with and react to robots in social contexts (Cross et al., 2019; Henschel et al., 2020). Especially in the context of possible future uses in healthcare or geriatric care, the importance of developing robots with which humans can easily and naturally interact has been stressed (Pepito et al., 2020; Wykowska 2020). Henschel et al. (2020) argue that research into and knowledge of the neurocognitive mechanisms involved in human-robot interaction will supply critical insights for optimizing social interaction between humans and robots which will in turn help to develop socially sophisticated robots. They write (Henschel et al., 2020, p. 373): “Robots that respond to and trigger human emotions not only enable closer human-machine collaboration, but can also spur human users to develop long-term social bonds with these agents.” This approach suggests using cognitive neuroscience to build robots that humans are likely to emotionally interact with, an approach that can be seen as an extension of affective computing (Scheutz, 2011; McDuff and Czerwinski, 2018). In this, the focus is on building social robots so that HRI resembles human-human interaction (HHI). A question rarely asked though, is how humans would like to interact with robots and what sort of robots humans would like to interact with. For example, Wiese et al. (2017) argue that in order for humans to interact intuitively and socially with robots, robots need to be designed in a way that humans perceive them as intentional agents, i.e., as agents with mental states.

To discuss social support among women with breast cancer in rural communities in southern Thailand.


DESIGN
Qualitative research that allowed researchers to understand the lived experiences of women living with breast cancer and social support.


METHODS
In-depth interviewing and drawing methods were adopted with 20 women with breast cancer. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data.


FINDINGS
Most women with breast cancer received three types of social support: emotional support, tangible support, and informational support. Most support came from family members and relatives. Religion was also a form of social support for women. Many women, however, received insufficient social support from healthcare providers. This reduced their capacity to manage their illness, thus impacting their well-being.


CONCLUSIONS
Various forms of support are essential for women with breast cancer so that they can better cope with their condition.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Nurses and other health professionals are an important source of social support for women with breast cancer. Through having an understanding of and being sensitive to these women's experiences, culture, and challenges, nurses and healthcare professionals can provide more individualized support and care to women during a vulnerable period of their life. We contend that the cultural perspectives of patients are crucial in nursing science. Nurses need to appreciate the importance of culture for the support of patients with breast cancer.","[{'authorId': '14827948', 'name': 'D. Suwankhong'}, {'authorId': '5600298', 'name': 'P.

We examined reciprocal effects between parents and children, mothers’ versus fathers’ unique roles in emotion regulation development, and sex differences. Multi-informant data allowed us to compare effects of adolescent-perceived and parent-reported parenting. Finally, innovative analyses allowed us to disentangle between-family differences from within-family predictive processes. Parenting and emotion regulation were associated at the between-family and within-family levels, especially according to adolescent reports. Support primarily played a role between mothers and adolescents, and perceived behavioral control between fathers and adolescents. Sex moderation revealed that support played a more prominent role in mother–daughter than mother–son relationships, and that daughters experienced greater behavioral control. Child effects outnumbered parent effects, which might reflect the increasing equality of adolescent–parent relationships. Finally, adolescent-perceived parenting was a stronger correlate of emotion regulation than parent-reports, suggesting that adolescents’ perceptions are a relevant source of information for research and practice. Consistent with the self-determination theory perspective on parenting, emotion regulation flourished when adolescents felt like mothers provided support, and fathers loosened behavioral control. These results are in line with the notion that mother–child relationships are supportive attachment relationships, whereas fathers provide “activation” relationships, challenging adolescents to regulate emotions autonomously by providing less explicit structure.","[{'authorId': '5905731', 'name': 'C.

Methods An internet-based survey of 2,400 Japanese people was conducted in two phases: early phase (baseline survey: February 25–27, 2020) and community-transmission phase (follow-up survey: April 1–6, 2020). The presence of severe psychological distress (SPD) was measured using the Kessler’s Six-scale Psychological Distress Scale. The difference of SPD percentages between the two phases was examined. Mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the factors associated with the change of SPD status between the two phases. Results Surveys for both phases had 2,078 valid respondents (49.3% men; average age, 50.3 years). In the two surveys, individuals with SPD were 9.3% and 11.3%, respectively, demonstrating a significant increase between the two phases (P = 0.005). Significantly higher likelihood to develop SPD were observed among those in lower (ie, 18,600–37,200 United States dollars [USD], odds ratio [OR] 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–3.46) and the lowest income category (ie, <18,600 USD, OR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.16–3.86). Furthermore, those with respiratory diseases were more likely to develop SPD (OR 2.56; 95% CI, 1.51–4.34). Conclusions From the early to community-transmission phases of COVID-19, psychological distress increased among the Japanese. Recommendations include implementing mental health measures together with protective measures against COVID-19 infection, prioritizing low-income people and those with underlying diseases.","[{'authorId': '2780427', 'name': 'Hiroyuki Kikuchi'}, {'authorId': '32255453', 'name': 'Masaki Machida'}, {'authorId': '47807916', 'name': 'I.

After 12 weeks, participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale and Subjective Happiness Scale. Participants with higher EI reported less perceived stress and higher levels of life satisfaction and happiness. The results of this study suggest that perceived stress mediates the relationship between EI and well-being indicators, specifically life satisfaction and happiness. These findings suggest an underlying process by which high emotional intelligence may increase well-being in female students in nursing and allied health sciences by reducing the experience of stress.

To survey teachers' beliefs about mental health service needs in inner city elementary schools.


METHOD
A total of 119 teachers from six elementary schools in a major city in the midwestern United States were surveyed to assess their beliefs about the major mental health problems facing their schools, the major barriers to surmounting those problems, their preferences for mental health topics for in-service education, and their education, experience, knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy pertaining to mental health issues.


RESULTS
Disruptive behavior was endorsed by approximately 50% of teachers as the largest mental health problem facing their schools, and lack of information/training was endorsed as the greatest barrier to surmounting mental health problems. The highest-rated topics for in-service education were disruptive behavior disorders and implementing behavior plans. Although most teachers had taught students with mental health problems, most had had little education in mental health and little consultation with mental health professionals. Correspondingly, teachers' knowledge about mental health issues was limited, and they did not feel confident about their ability to manage mental health problems in their classrooms.


CONCLUSIONS
Teachers would benefit from education, training, and consultation from mental health professionals if they serve as effective gatekeepers to mental health services.","[{'authorId': '8849294', 'name': 'H.

The BCW involves eight steps across three stages: (1) understanding the behaviour, (2) identifying intervention options, and (3) identifying content and implementation options. Study Sample The data in Stage 1 comprised of 13 interviews with clinic staff. The research team drew on their own expertise and empirical research to complete Stages 2 and 3. Results A two-phase, face-to-face intervention was developed to change clinic staff’ behaviours to address two problem behaviours: (1) increase family member attendance to adult audiology appointments; and (2) increase family member involvement within appointments. Three target behaviours were chosen for the intervention to address the two problem behaviours. A variety of intervention functions and behaviour change techniques were incorporated into the intervention. Conclusion The BCW provided a useful framework for developing a whole-of-clinic intervention to increase family member attendance and involvement in adult audiology appointments.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of bipolar disorder in the context of maintenance pharmacotherapy.


METHOD
Eighty-two bipolar outpatients were followed prospectively for a mean of 4.3 years (minimum of 2 years); symptom rating and psychosocial outcome scales were used, and pharmacotherapy was rated on a 5-point scale.


RESULTS
Despite continual maintenance treatment, survival analysis indicated a 5-year risk of relapse into mania or depression of 73%. Of those who relapsed, two-thirds had multiple relapses. Relapse could not be attributed to inadequate medication. Even for those who did not relapse, considerable affective morbidity was observed. A measure of cumulative affective morbidity appeared to be a more sensitive correlate of psychosocial functioning than was the number of relapses. Poor psychosocial outcome paralleled poor syndromal course. Poor psychosocial functioning, especially occupational disruption, predicted a shorter time to relapse. Depressions were most strongly related to social and family dysfunction.


CONCLUSIONS
Even aggressive pharmacological maintenance treatment does not prevent relatively poor outcome in a significant number of bipolar patients.","[{'authorId': '5210378', 'name': 'M.

Although self-compassion has been studied primarily in healthy populations, one particularly compelling clinical context in which to examine self-compassion is social anxiety disorder (SAD). SAD is characterized by high levels of negative self-criticism as well as an abiding concern about others’ evaluation of one's performance. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that: (1) people with SAD would demonstrate less self-compassion than healthy controls (HCs), (2) self-compassion would relate to severity of social anxiety and fear of evaluation among people with SAD, and (3) age would be negatively correlated with self-compassion for people with SAD, but not for HC. As expected, people with SAD reported less self-compassion than HCs on the Self-Compassion Scale and its subscales. Within the SAD group, lesser self-compassion was not generally associated with severity of social anxiety, but it was associated with greater fear of both negative and positive evaluation. Age was negatively correlated with self-compassion for people with SAD, whereas age was positively correlated with self-compassion for HC. These findings suggest that self-compassion may be a particularly important target for assessment and treatment in persons with SAD.","[{'authorId': '4534592', 'name': 'K.

Moreover, studies showed that emotion regulation and empathy are related with increased autonomic activation.

Healthy adults viewed a series of short videos illustrating a target who was expressing positive, negative, or no emotions during a social situation (Positive, Negative, or Neutral Social Scenes). Prior to each video, participants were instructed to reappraise their own emotions (Up-regulation, Down-regulation, or No-regulation). To assess autonomic activation, RR intervals (RRI), high frequency (HF) components of heart rate variability (HRV), and electrodermal activity phasic responses (EDRs) were calculated. Situational empathy was measured through a visual analogue scale. Participants rated how empathic they felt for a specific target. Up- and Down-regulation were related to an increase and a decrease in situational empathy and an increase in RRI and HF, respectively, compared to the control condition (No-regulation). This suggests increased activity of the parasympathetic branch during emotion regulation of situational empathic responses. Positive compared to Negative Social Scenes were associated with decreased situational empathy, in addition to a slightly but non-significantly increased HF. Altogether, this study demonstrates that emotion regulation may be associated with changes in situational empathy and autonomic responses, preferentially dominated by the parasympathetic branch and possibly reflecting an increase of regulatory processes. Furthermore, the current study provides evidence that empathy for different emotional valences is associated with distinct changes in situational empathy and autonomic responses.","[{'authorId': '74158235', 'name': 'Josiane Jauniaux'}, {'authorId': '83164262', 'name': 'Marie-Hélène Tessier'}, {'authorId': '1415310707', 'name': 'Sophie Regueiro'}, {'authorId': '6654704', 'name': 'F.

Given their empathetic engagement with traumatized victims, they may experience severe emotional reactions such as terror, grief, and rage. Empirical evidence identifies these emotional reactions as “traumatic stress” including burnout, Traumatic Countertransference (TC), Vicarious Trauma (VT), and Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS)/Compassion Fatigue (CF). In this study, the history and definition of each traumatic stress are examined, and differences among them are explored. Preventive strategies for reducing traumatic stress in mental health professionals are discussed.","[{'authorId': '31466426', 'name': 'Hanae Kanno'}, {'authorId': '115513902', 'name': 'Martha M.

ebbd8f4f61c50d7ce6813828ff8443d7394b8387,"BACKGROUND
Human service professionals are concerned with the intervention and empowerment of vulnerable social populations. The human service industry is laden with employment-related stressors and emotionally demanding interactions, which can lead to deleterious effects, such as burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Little attention has been given to developing knowledge of what might enable human service workers to persist and thrive. Cultivating and sustaining resilience can buffer the impact of occupational stressors on human service professionals. One of the psychological factors associated with cultivating resilience is mindfulness.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this current research is to improve our understanding of the relationship between resilience, mindfulness, burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and psychological distress among human service professionals.


METHODS
The current study surveyed 133 human service professionals working in the fields of psychology, social work, counseling, youth and foster care work to explore the predictive relationship between resilience, mindfulness, and psychological distress.


RESULTS
The results showed that higher levels of resilience were a significant predictor of lower levels of psychological distress, burnout and secondary traumatic stress. In addition, higher levels of mindfulness were a significant predictor of lower levels of psychological distress and burnout.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that cultivating resilience and mindfulness in human service professionals may assist in preventing psychological distress burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Limitations of this study are discussed together with implications for future research.","[{'authorId': '15052383', 'name': 'Rachel Harker'}, {'authorId': '30785656', 'name': 'Aileen M Pidgeon'}, {'authorId': '20697601', 'name': 'F.

Qualitative analyses were conducted based on videotaped observations of groups across a series of three mathematics tasks. Variation in the quality of social regulation as a function of group processes (positive and negative socioemotional interactions, collaborative and non-collaborative interactions) was also considered. Findings suggested that the synergy among the social regulatory processes of planning, monitoring, and behavioral engagement was important for differentiating quality variation between groups. Positive socioemotional interactions and collaboration also appeared to facilitate higher quality social regulation. Implications for comprehensively supporting high quality social regulation, alongside positive socioemotional interactions and collaboration, in small group contexts are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2831367', 'name': 'Toni Kempler Rogat'}, {'authorId': '1403711756', 'name': 'Lisa Linnenbrink-Garcia'}]",250.0,,44.0,Socially Shared Regulation in Collaborative Groups: An Analysis of the Interplay Between Quality of Social Regulation and Group Processes,2011.0

It was found that approach, relative to avoidance-related anticipatory states, produced greater relative right (diminished relative left) hemispheric activation. Experiment 3 additionally demonstrated that this pattern of activation was reversed when approach and avoidance states were not merely anticipatory but were also emotionally arousing. Finally, Experiment 4 replicated earlier findings demonstrating an influence of approach and avoidance anticipatory states on creativity and analytical problem solving (R. S. Friedman & J.

However, few have ever discussed specific psychological factors and characteristics having such influences. Based on the self-efficacy theory and the social identity theory, this paper has proposed, from the perspective of social cognition, that emotional regulation self-efficacy influences the moral decision-making of the new generation of employees and that the mediating effect of interpersonal trust and the regulating effect of communication also play a role in the decision-making process. This study has designed a “red-blue experiment” based on the complete static information model in the non-cooperative game theory so as to conduct an experimental and qualitative analysis for the new generation of employees and to explore the characteristics of psychological process, self-efficacy, and moral decision-making of the experimental population. Through analysis of the 138 data sources collected from the experiment, the results showed that emotional self-efficacy had a significant positive effect on moral decision-making (p < 0.01), emotional self-efficacy had a significant positive effect on interpersonal trust (r = 0.560, p < 0.01), and interpersonal trust had a significant positive effect on moral decision-making (r = 0.290, p < 0.01). The mediating effect was 0.163. The interaction terms of emotional regulation self-efficacy and communication effect had a significant negative effect on interpersonal trust (r = −0.221, p < 0.01). All the hypotheses proposed in this study are supported by experimental data and reveal the psychological mechanism of moral decision-making in the new generation of employees. The study has further shown that the moral education of the new generation of employees needs to focus on improving emotional regulation self-efficacy and enhancing interpersonal trust, which provides theoretical support for the moral education methods and paths of the new generation of employees.","[{'authorId': '2156640609', 'name': 'Bo Liu'}, {'authorId': '152233495', 'name': 'tai-seok Yang'}, {'authorId': '2090447398', 'name': 'Wei Xie'}]",1.0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health', 'volume': '19'}",40.0,Emotional Regulation Self-Efficacy Influences Moral Decision Making: A Non-Cooperative Game Study of the New Generation of Employees,2022.0

The study included 173 consecutive adult patients (104 men and 69 women) with a need for audiological rehabilitation including HA-fitting. Use of communication strategies (Communication Strategies Scale, CSS), experience of activity limitation and participation restriction (Hearing Disability and Handicap Scale, HDHS), and general psychological well-being (Psychological General Well-being scale, PGWB) were assessed by self-report inventories. The hospital records, reviewed 1.5 years after the first consultation, showed that 39 patients (25 men and 14 women, 23%) had not accepted a hearing aid. In crude and adjusted logistic regression analyses a low report (high scores) of maladaptive behaviour in communication was associated with a three-times higher odds for rejecting a hearing aid, while a highly perceived activity limitation and participation restriction were related to lower odds for rejection.

We presume that specific situational and dispositional an- tecedents of social anxiety operate by influencing people's motivation to impress others and their expectations of satisfactorily doing so. In contrast to drive models of anxiety but consistent with social learning theory, it is argued that the cognitive state of the individual mediates both affective arousal and behavior. The tradi- tional inverted-U relation between anxiety and performance is reexamined in this light.

It was argued that the large overlap between these three disorders may be partially explained by common underlying attention and behaviour control deficits. Fourteen clinically referred adolescents suffering from externalizing disorders followed mindfulness training in a group format. Parallel, their parents received mindful parenting training. Adolescents and their parents were measured before and after waitlist, after 8-week training, and at 8-week follow-up. No improvement occurred during waitlist on most variables. After mindfulness training, children self-reported substantial improvement on personal goals, internalizing and externalizing complaints, attention problems, happiness, and mindful awareness, and performed better on a sustained attention test. Likewise, parents reported improvement on children's goals, externalizing and attention problems, self-control, attunement to others and withdrawal. In addition, parents improved on their own goals. Improvement was maintained 8 weeks after the training. Consistent with mindfulness theory, increased child awareness after training predicted longer-term improvement in parent-rated child symptoms. Concomitant parent and child mindfulness training appears to be a promising approach for clinic-referred adolescents with attention and impulsivity problems.","[{'authorId': '6796060', 'name': 'S.

Universities have to be active in all manner of ways – insofar as we can attribute actions to large complex institutions – but ‘activist’? An activist is someone who takes up the cudgels in a cause, who contends against an enemy and demonstrates for and even fights for a cause. Students may be activists in movements of radical politics and can be seen resisting and even attacking the forces of the state. But what might it mean for their university, indeed any university, to be an activist university? I argue that the term ‘the activist university’ opens to different meanings. The concept of the activist university is a space in which alternative interpretations jostle with each other. These different readings are expressive of competing senses of the responsibilities of the university and its place in society. Academic activism lends itself to a panoply of stances. Nevertheless, I argue that academic activism is a universal category that gains its fullest realization when it is exhibited in a situation of epistemic injustice and is an expression of epistemic agency.","[{'authorId': '97870972', 'name': 'R.

This study aimed to explore whether various factors known to predict distress in normal contexts (e.g. social connectedness, emotional‐regulation strategies, and health‐related behaviors) are associated with daily distress under lockdown conditions. A time‐based diary study evaluated how perceived social connectedness, health‐promoting, and risk behaviors predicted within‐person and between‐person psychological distress. One hundred and nine adults completed surveys on these variables daily for 15 days while under stringent COVID‐19 lockdown in Colombia. Emotional suppression and reappraisal were measured at the start of the study to explore whether they predicted distress. Distress was lower on the days that people experienced greater social connectedness (within‐person analyses) but was not significantly predicted by between‐participant differences in emotional regulation. Health‐promoting behaviors such as exercising and meaningful activity were associated with lower distress, while watching COVID‐19 news and eating high‐calorie food were associated with higher distress. Looking at individual dynamics provides meaningful insights on daily behaviors associated with distress that might improve people's wellbeing during lockdown, such as social connectedness, meaningful activity, nutrition, exercise, and minimizing news exposure. Future research with alternative designs will enable causal conclusions to be drawn.","[{'authorId': '1406761396', 'name': 'Amanda M. Muñoz-Martínez'}, {'authorId': '4778064', 'name': 'I.

Social robots dedicated to assisting persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are rarely used in clinics. In a collaborative effort to bridge the gap between innovation in research and clinical practice, a team of engineers, clinicians and researchers working in the field of psychology developed and tested a robot-assisted educational intervention for children with low-functioning ASD (N = 20) A total of 14 lessons targeting requesting and turn-taking were elaborated, based on the Pivotal Training Method and principles of Applied Analysis of Behavior. Results showed that sensory rewards provided by the robot elicited more positive reactions than verbal praises from humans. The robot was of greatest benefit to children with a low level of disability. The educators were quite enthusiastic about children's progress in learning basic psychosocial skills from interactions with the robot. The robot nonetheless failed to act as a social mediator, as more prosocial behaviors were observed in the control condition, where instead of interacting with the robot children played with a ball. We discuss how to program robots to the distinct needs of individuals with ASD, how to harness robots' likability in order to enhance social skill learning, and how to arrive at a consensus about the standards of excellence that need to be met in interdisciplinary co-creation research. Our intuition is that robotic assistance, obviously judged as to be positive by educators, may contribute to the dissemination of innovative evidence-based practice for individuals with ASD.","[{'authorId': '2607018', 'name': 'V.

However, there has been little direct evidence of any association due to the paucity of longitudinal studies reporting mental health before and during the lockdown. This present study provides the first longitudinal examination of changes in childhood mental health, a key component of an urgently needed evidence base that can inform policy and practice surrounding the continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Mental health assessments on 168 children (aged 7.6–11.6 years) were taken before and during the UK lockdown (April–June 2020). Assessments included self-reports, caregiver reports, and teacher reports. Mean mental health scores before and during the UK lockdown were compared using mixed linear models. Results A significant increase in depression symptoms during the UK lockdown was observed, as measured by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) short form. CIs suggest a medium-to-large effect size. There were no significant changes in the RCADS anxiety subscale and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional problems subscale. Conclusions During the UK lockdown, children’s depression symptoms have increased substantially, relative to before lockdown. The scale of this effect has direct relevance for the continuation of different elements of lockdown policy, such as complete or partial school closures. This early evidence for the direct impact of lockdown must now be combined with larger scale epidemiological studies that establish which children are most at risk and tracks their future recovery.","[{'authorId': '48489662', 'name': 'G.

The present research program analyzed the nature of this type of future-oriented self-control and the psychological processes that underlie it. Enduring individual differences in self-control were found as early as the preschool years. Those 4-year-old children who delayed gratification longer in certain laboratory situations developed into more cognitively and socially competent adolescents, achieving higher scholastic performance and coping better with frustration and stress. Experiments in the same research program also identified specific cognitive and attentional processes that allow effective self-regulation early in the course of development. The experimental results, in turn, specified the particular types of preschool delay situations diagnostic for predicting aspects of cognitive and social competence later in life.","[{'authorId': '2868716', 'name': 'W.

Aim: This study was conducted to investigate the differences in social appearance anxiety and self-esteem scores in physical disabled athletes and non-disabled athletes. Materials and Methods: One hundred and forty-eight physical disabled athletes and 60 non-disabled athletes participated in the study. The Turkish versions of the Social Appearance Anxiety Scale and Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale was used to assess the points associated with social appearance anxiety and self-esteem. Results: Disabled athletes had higher self-esteem and social appearance anxiety scores compared to non-disabled athletes. Also, disabled athletes having medal had decreased self-esteem and social appearance anxiety scores compared to disabled athletes not having medal. These results suggest that physical activity can improve mental health in especially successful athletes. Also, the self-esteem scores had positive correlation with the social appearance anxiety score in total sample, as well as in disabled athletes and non-disabled athletes. Conclusion: The higher self-esteem and social appearance anxiety scores in disabled athletes may be related to the higher depression, anxiety and psychological stress in athletes compared to non-athletes. These results suggest that physical activity can improve mental health in only top successful athletes.","[{'authorId': '49600258', 'name': 'Havva Demi̇rel'}]",8.0,,33.0,Social Appearance Anxiety and Rosenberg Self-esteem Scores in Young Physical Disabled Athletes,2019.0

Analyses revealed that sociodramatic play predicted children’s emotional expressiveness, emotion knowledge, and emotion regulation 1 year later, after controlling for Year 1 ASC skills. Rough-and-tumble play predicted children’s emotional expressiveness and emotion regulation 1 year later, whereas exercise play predicted only emotion regulation. Some associations between sociodramatic play and rough-and-tumble play and children’s ASC were moderated by gender.","[{'authorId': '7020927', 'name': 'Eric W.

However, this may not hold true for all individuals. We offer subordinate and supervisor political skill, the ability to understand interactions at work and to use that understanding to effectively influence others, as possible moderators. Specifically, this study investigates the impact of both employees’ self-rated political skill and their managers’ political skill on job satisfaction, job performance, and manager-rated commitment. We examined these relationships in an organizational sample of 106 matched dyadic pairs and found mixed support for the joint moderating effect of self and manager political skill on the politics perceptions-outcome relationships.

The authors investigated the temperamental dispositions of fifty-three 3-year-old children (27 boys, 26 girls) and their behavioral responses to several challenging tasks (i.e., stranger-approach situation, busy-caregiver paradigm, and delay-of-gratification task). Results indicated that both situational context and temperamental reactivity influenced the type of emotion-regulatory strategy used and that those relationships were best understood within a developmental framework. Moreover, the authors found that girls displayed more comforting strategies, suggesting that gender differences in emotion regulation may exist.","[{'authorId': '50522252', 'name': 'Laura K.

ef57b243750b9fcb5183638b1db1206a8fdda357,"In the past decade there has been a rapid advance in the use of virtual reality (VR) technologies for leisure, training and education. VR is argued to offer particular benefits for children on the autism spectrum, chiefly because it can offer simulations of authentic real-world situations in a carefully controlled and safe environment. Given the real world social difficulties experienced by children on the spectrum, this technology has therefore been argued to offer distinct advantages and benefits for social and life skills training compared to other approaches. Whilst there has been some progress in testing the relevance and applicability of VR for children on the autism spectrum in educational contexts, there remains a significant challenge in developing robust and usable technologies that can really make a difference in real world classrooms. This article considers the evidence that has been published over the past 10 years to assess how the potential of VR has been explored in practice and reflect on the current state-of-the-art in this field.","[{'authorId': '144674468', 'name': 'S.

ef7fe9588e9706ddee744837e875ad5e8ebdf827,"Introduction Adults often perceive young children’s play fighting and use of war toys as violent or aggressive behaviour rather than beneficial to their development. Movies (e.g., Star Wars), books (e.g., Harry Potter), national figures (e.g. military forces), community helpers (e.g., police officers), professional sports (e.g., rugby) and commercial toys (e.g., Nerf guns) influence young children’s desire to engage in such play. In spite of that, educational programs often either discourage or ban this controversial form of play resulting in contrasting societal messaging for young children related to the appropriateness of play fighting and war toys. For example, fencing, an international sport, where those who excel are awarded medals, features three types of bladed weapons maneuvered in actions representative of fighting. Further, police officers use stun guns, firearms, and tear gas, yet are often recognized as instrumental for any society seeking to protect citizens. A closer look at the characteristics of children’s play fighting and use of war toys will indicate that the behaviour is voluntary, choreographed, enjoyable and usually proceeds with caution and care.","[{'authorId': '38670289', 'name': 'Jennifer L.

Spanning decades of research activity, the scholarly literature on CSR has been dominated by meso- and macro-level perspectives, such as studies within corporate strategy that examine relationships between firm-level indicators of social/environmental performance and corporate financial performance. In recent years, however, there has been an explosion of micro-oriented CSR research conducted at the individual level of analysis, especially with respect to studies on how and why job seekers and employees perceive and react to CSR practices. This micro-level focus is reflected in 12 articles published as a Research Topic collection in Frontiers in Psychology (Organizational Psychology Specialty Section) titled “CSR and organizational psychology: Quid pro quo.” In the present article, the authors summarize and integrate findings from these Research Topic articles. After describing some of the “new frontiers” these articles explore and create, the authors strive to fulfill a “quid pro quo” with some of the meso- and macro-oriented CSR literatures that paved the way for micro-CSR research. Specifically, the authors draw on insights from the Research Topic articles to inform a multilevel model that offers multiple illustrations of how micro-level processes among individual stakeholders can explain variability in meso (firm)-level relationships between CSR practices and corporate performance.

One way to overcome these problems is the loading of ginger extract in polymer carriers. The aim of this study was characterization and evaluation of the loading and releasing of ginger extract from hyaluronic acid nanocapsules for medical applications. Methods: In this applied study, ginger extract as a pain-relieving drug was loaded in hyaluronic acid nanocapsules. The hyaluronic acid nanocapsules containing ginger extract were fabricated by emulsion method. The surface morphology, particle size and zeta potential, surface roughness and functional groups on the sample surface were evaluated by field emission electron microscopy (FESEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. The stability and ginger release from nanocapsules were also determined via DLS and HPLC, respectively. The toxicity and fibroblast cells viability of ginger extract encapsulated in hyaluronic acid were evaluated by MTT assay. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 Software. The t-Student test was performed for statistical comparison of data and statistically significant was P < 0.05. Results: The ginger entrapment efficiency (EE %) in nanocapsules was 74%. The average particle diameter and charge surface of the samples were calculated 413 nm and -10 mV, respectively. The negative charge of samples showed the stability of samples without agglomeration. Therefore, the surface morphology of the samples was observed as relatively spherical particles. In vitro test showed 95% fibroblast cell growth and proliferation on nanocapsules compared to the control sample (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The hyaluronic acid nanocapsules have a great potential for delivery of ginger extract in the area of pain and inflammation.","[{'authorId': '2181655080', 'name': 'Marjan Ashegh Moalla'}, {'authorId': '37175848', 'name': 'M.

f0b4edfb3eaf83bc12571138c9719fecf5dbedb0,"Carolyn Saarni’s book is one of a very practical series of titles by Guilford Press examining emotional and social development. The author stated a number of goals for the book including: writing about emotional development in mid-childhood and adolescence, examining emotion as a part of culture, and establishing a pattern of studying emotion within the lives of children. The book was organized into three parts: research and theories of emotional competence; skill levels of emotional competence and the clinical application of emotional competence. 
 
In the first part, Dr. Saarni defined emotional competence as the functional capacity wherein a human can reach their goals after an emotion-eliciting encounter. She defined emotion as a building block of self-efficacy. She described the use of emotions as a set of skills achieved which then lead to the development of emotional competence. Attainment of the skills of emotional competence is crucial to self-efficacy. Dr. Saarni outlined her theoretical position in relation to theories of emotion and social learning and cognitive development. Her approach to theory in each of these fields was integrative and focussed on self-development with a strong social-contructivist perspective. I enjoyed the culture and folk theories of emotional regulation in chapter three. Also, chapter three contained an interesting section on parent and peer influences on emotional regulation, very useful for child psychiatrists who work to discern abnormal emotional regulation and mood patterns in context. 
 
The bulk of the book was devoted to the eight emotional competence skills: 
 
 
Awareness of one’s own emotions, 
 
 
Ability to discern and understand other’s emotions, 
 
 
Ability to use the vocabulary of emotion and expression, 
 
 
Capacity for empathic involvement, 
 
 
Ability to differentiate subjective emotional experience from external emotion expression, 
 
 
Adaptive coping with aversive emotions and distressing circumstances, 
 
 
Awareness of emotional communication within relationships, and 
 
 
Capacity for emotional self-efficacy. 
 
 
 
Skills one through six are based on developmental research on emotions but the final two skills are based on her experience as a clinical developmental psychologist. Each chapter contained organizing subtitles and ended with culture, developmental stage and gender information. In keeping with her leanings to Lewis and Michaelson, her most basic skill, ‘awareness of one’s own emotions,’ is one that requires cognitive ability. She stipulated that, to accomplish the first skill, (Lewis’ argument) the child must know how the body feels to have an emotion. A child needs to be age four or five to demonstrate this skill reliably. Of all the skills, skill four, the capacity for empathic involvement appears to be an outlier. While the material she presented was interesting to read, the role of empathy as a skill of emotional competence wasn’t argued convincingly. On the other hand, skill 7 had a great deal of face validity. It suggested that there is a skill of emotional meta-communication. 
 
A strength of the book is its comprehensive examination of the skills she proposed. She covered many practical issues in emotional competence. The book conveyed a strong sense of children in their world and thus it was easy and enjoyable to read. A limitation of the book related to Dr. Saarni’s description of the differences between the theoretical models and how she applied them. There is a distinct difference between the social constructivists and functionalists. If child psychiatrists or residents are not familiar with the difference, this book will confuse their understanding. The former see emotions as arising from the development of cognition and the latter see emotion as not developmentally dependent upon cognition, rather, an organizing principle in development in its own right. Despite this, the effort and breadth of the treatment of emotional competence as illustrated in this book makes it well worth the read.","[{'authorId': '50285664', 'name': 'E.

Comorbidities with mood disorders, impulsiveness, personality traits, and impairments in cognitive function have also been frequently investigated. However, it is currently uncommon to study this disorder in individuals without comorbid substance abuse; therefore, the primary aim of our study was to compare the psychological profile of individuals with GD with and without substance use disorder. A total of 60 participants (100% male), including 20 individuals with GD, 20 substance-dependent gamblers (SDGs), and 20 healthy controls (HCs), were assessed with several clinical measures to investigate impulsivity, hostility, mood, and personality traits, as well as with cognitive tasks (i.e., decision-making tasks). Our results showed differences in both experimental groups compared with the HC group in mood disorders, impulsivity, and hostility traits. The ‘‘pure’’ GD group differed from the SDG group only in characteristics related to mood disorders (e.g., State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y2, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and assault dimension), whereas greater impairment in decision making processes related to risky choices was shown in the SDG group. This study suggests the importance of studying pure GD to clarify the underlying mechanisms without the neurotoxic effects of the substances.

However, the number of validated instruments assessing addiction to social networking sites (SNSs) remains few, and none have been validated in the Italian language. Consequently, this study tested the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS), as well as providing empirical data concerning the relationship between attachment styles and SNS addiction. Methods A total of 769 participants were recruited to this study. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multigroup analyses were applied to assess construct validity of the Italian version of the BSMAS. Reliability analyses comprised the average variance extracted, the standard error of measurement, and the factor determinacy coefficient. Results Indices obtained from the CFA showed the Italian version of the BSMAS to have an excellent fit of the model to the data, thus confirming the single-factor structure of the instrument. Measurement invariance was established at configural, metric, and strict invariances across age groups, and at configural and metric levels across gender groups. Internal consistency was supported by several indicators. In addition, the theoretical associations between SNS addiction and attachment styles were generally supported. Conclusion This study provides evidence that the Italian version of the BSMAS is a psychometrically robust tool that can be used in future Italian research into social networking addiction.","[{'authorId': '1894083', 'name': 'L.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of the analysis window duration on speech intelligibility in a systematic way. For this purpose, both subjective and objective experiments are conducted. The subjective experiment is in a form of a consonant recognition task by human listeners, whereas the objective experiment is in a form of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) task. In our experiments various analysis window durations are investigated. For the subjective experiment we construct speech stimuli based purely on the short-time magnitude information. The results of the subjective experiment show that the analysis window duration of 15–35 ms is the optimum choice when speech is reconstructed from the short-time magnitude spectrum. Similar conclusions were made based on the results of the objective (ASR) experiment. The ASR results were found to have statistically significant correlation with the subjective intelligibility results.","[{'authorId': '48099761', 'name': 'K.

No study has yet examined the presence of psychiatric symptoms in the UK population under similar conditions. Aims We investigated the prevalence of COVID-19-related anxiety, generalised anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms in the UK population during an early phase of the pandemic, and estimated associations with variables likely to influence these symptoms. Method Between 23 and 28 March 2020, a quota sample of 2025 UK adults aged 18 years and older, stratified by age, gender and household income, was recruited by online survey company Qualtrics. Participants completed standardised measures of depression, generalised anxiety and trauma symptoms relating to the pandemic. Bivariate and multivariate associations were calculated for demographic and health-related variables. Results Higher levels of anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms were reported compared with previous population studies, but not dramatically so. Anxiety or depression and trauma symptoms were predicted by young age, presence of children in the home, and high estimates of personal risk. Anxiety and depression were also predicted by low income, loss of income and pre-existing health conditions in self and others. Specific anxiety about COVID-19 was greater in older participants. Conclusions This study showed a modest increase in the prevalence of mental health problems in the early stages of the pandemic, and these problems were predicted by several specific COVID-related variables. Further similar surveys, particularly of those with children at home, are required as the pandemic progresses.","[{'authorId': '1921545', 'name': 'M. Shevlin'}, {'authorId': '47303600', 'name': 'O.

Methods: The study included 25 patients with BD (aged 35±14 years) during an acute manic episode, 25 bipolar patients (aged 41±14 years) during a depressive episode, and 25 healthy control subjects (aged 36±11 years). Cognitive and affective empathy were assessed using the Multifaceted Empathy Test. Results: In both manic and depressive patients, a significant deficit in cognitive empathy was demonstrated. However, indices of affective empathy were significantly higher in the manic group than in depressed and control subjects. In the depressed patients, indices did not differ from those of healthy controls. For affective empathy, a significant positive correlation was found with intensity of manic symptoms and a negative correlation was found with intensity of depressive symptoms. No such correlations were observed with cognitive empathy. Conclusion: We found evidence of increased affective empathy (overempathizing) during a manic episode in bipolar patients. This phenomenon may be connected with disturbances in emotion inhibition related to anastrophic thinking and associated with increased activity of mirror neurons, all of which occur during a manic episode.","[{'authorId': '33505875', 'name': 'A.

This study aims at assessing the prevalence of burnout and psychopathological conditions in health professionals working in a health institution in the Northern Italy, and to identify socio-demographic, work-related and psychological predictors of burnout. Methods: Health professionals working in the hospitals of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano were asked to participate to an online anonymous survey investigating socio-demographic data, COVID-19 emergency-related work and psychological factors, state anxiety, psychological distress, post-traumatic symptoms and burnout. Predictors of the three components of burnout were assessed using elastic net regression models. Results: Three hundred and thirty health professionals participated to the online survey. Two hundred and thirty-five health professionals (71.2%) had scores of state anxiety above the clinical cutoff, 88 (26.8%) had clinical levels of depression, 103 (31.3%) of anxiety, 113 (34.3%) of stress, 121 (36.7%) of post-traumatic stress. Regarding burnout, 107 (35.7%) had moderate and 105 (31.9%) severe levels of emotional exhaustion; 46 (14.0%) had moderate and 40 (12.1%) severe levels of depersonalization; 132 (40.1%) had moderate and 113 (34.3%) severe levels of reduced personal accomplishment. Predictors of all the three components of burnout were work hours, psychological comorbidities, fear of infection and perceived support by friends. Predictors of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were female gender, being a nurse, working in the hospital, being in contact with COVID-19 patients. Reduced personal accomplishment was also predicted by age. Conclusions: Health professionals had high levels of burnout and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 emergency. Monitoring and timely treatment of these conditions is needed.","[{'authorId': '4518999', 'name': 'E. Giusti'}, {'authorId': '3346433', 'name': 'E. Pedroli'}, {'authorId': '1401057622', 'name': 'G.

f2a6f2f5bc0b5c3f38ad95bb555ec63587a1fe11,"Vygotsky, when introducing the concept of the zone of proximal development, declared that “more competent peers,” as well as adults, can aid children's development (1978, p. 86). Although there has been a recent upsurge of interest in Vygotsky's theory, fueled by several influential books (e.g., Wertsch, 1985a) and research based on Vygotskian theory (Rogoff & Wertsch, 1984; Valsiner, 1987; Wertsch, 1985a), most of this interest has centered on the role adults play in fostering children's development. The same focus is apparent in this book; not unnaturally, in a volume devoted to education, the role of adults is given a good deal of emphasis. I have chosen, instead, to examine the effects of collaboration between peers. After all, in many classrooms children work in groups, either under the guidance of a teacher or aide or as members of a team, working together to solve a problem with little or no adult guidance. In some classes, children also act as tutors, helping less competent peers learn some relatively straightforward skill. Even where peer collaboration is not encouraged, the potential role of such collaboration should not be casually dismissed. There is a theoretical, as well as a practical, motivation for examining peer collaboration. Because the research set within a Vygotskian framework has almost exclusively focused upon adult–child interaction and has supported the view that providing information within a child's zone of proximal development can be highly beneficial, the impression left is that development proceeds in the direction of current adult models of culturally appropriate practice.","[{'authorId': '49766519', 'name': 'J.

Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by deep learning a neural embedding across more than 1.8 billion words of modern fiction. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered filter.

As expected, age predicted executive functioning components and social–emotional readiness. Moreover, working memory and inhibitory control directly predicted academic readiness, whereas delay of gratification predicted social–emotional readiness. Working memory and inhibitory control predicted delay of gratification, consistent with the notion that simpler executive functions may set the stage for more complex executive functions.

f567579216e6a62af2a3bb57ab143bd3e8bf9f46,"Background Diagnosis of ‘specific’ language impairment traditionally required nonverbal IQ to be within normal limits, often resulting in restricted access to clinical services for children with lower NVIQ. Changes to DSM‐5 criteria for language disorder removed this NVIQ requirement. This study sought to delineate the impact of varying NVIQ criteria on prevalence, clinical presentation and functional impact of language disorder in the first UK population study of language impairment at school entry. Methods A population‐based survey design with sample weighting procedures was used to estimate population prevalence. We surveyed state‐maintained reception classrooms (n = 161 or 61% of eligible schools) in Surrey, England. From a total population of 12,398 children (ages 4–5 years), 7,267 (59%) were screened. A stratified subsample (n = 529) received comprehensive assessment of language, NVIQ, social, emotional and behavioural problems, and academic attainment. Results The total population prevalence estimate of language disorder was 9.92% (95% CI 7.38, 13.20). The prevalence of language disorder of unknown origin was estimated to be 7.58% (95% CI 5.33, 10.66), while the prevalence of language impairment associated with intellectual disability and/or existing medical diagnosis was 2.34% (95% CI 1.40, 3.91). Children with language disorder displayed elevated symptoms of social, emotional and behavioural problems relative to peers, F(1, 466) = 7.88, p = .05, and 88% did not make expected academic progress. There were no differences between those with average and low‐average NVIQ scores in severity of language deficit, social, emotional and behavioural problems, or educational attainment. In contrast, children with language impairments associated with known medical diagnosis and/or intellectual disability displayed more severe deficits on multiple measures. Conclusions At school entry, approximately two children in every class of 30 pupils will experience language disorder severe enough to hinder academic progress. Access to specialist clinical services should not depend on NVIQ.","[{'authorId': '6233915', 'name': 'C.

The most common practice is to represent EF ability as a reflective latent variable, with child performance on individual EF tasks as observed indicators.

We review the literature suggesting that reflective latent variable models may not be the most appropriate representation of the construct of EF. Using preschool (Mage = 48.3 months) and first grade (Mage = 83.5 months) data from the Family Life Project (N = 920), we also investigate the implications of measurement model specification for the interpretation of study findings. Children in this sample varied in terms of sex (49% male), race (43% black) and socioeconomic status (76% low-income).

f5aec988a7c02a3bc0441b0d881c231ccd51f28c,"Motivation and pleasure deficits are common in schizophrenia, strongly linked with poorer functioning, and may reflect underlying alterations in brain functions governing reward processing and goal pursuit. While there is extensive research examining cognitive and reward mechanisms related to these deficits in schizophrenia, less attention has been paid to psychological characteristics that contribute to resilience against, or risk for, motivation and pleasure impairment. For example, psychological tendencies involving positive future expectancies (e.g., optimism) and effective affect management (e.g., reappraisal, mindfulness) are associated with aspects of reward anticipation and evaluation that optimally guide goal-directed behavior. Conversely, maladaptive thinking patterns (e.g., defeatist performance beliefs, asocial beliefs) and tendencies that amplify negative cognitions (e.g., rumination), may divert cognitive resources away from goal pursuit or reduce willingness to exert effort. Additionally, aspects of sociality, including the propensity to experience social connection as positive reinforcement may be particularly relevant for pursuing social goals. In the current review, we discuss the roles of several psychological characteristics with respect to motivation and pleasure in schizophrenia. We argue that individual variation in these psychological dimensions is relevant to the study of motivation and reward processing in schizophrenia, including interactions between these psychological dimensions and more well-characterized cognitive and reward processing contributors to motivation. We close by emphasizing the value of considering a broad set of modulating factors when studying motivation and pleasure functions in schizophrenia.","[{'authorId': '5200074', 'name': 'Samantha V Abram'}, {'authorId': '4565958', 'name': 'Lauren P.

Purpose
The technological revolution in the service sector is radically changing the ways in which and with whom consumers co-create value. This conceptual paper considers social robots in elderly care services and outlines ways in which their human-like affect and cognition influence users’ social perceptions and anticipations of robots’ value co-creation or co-destruction potential. A future research agenda offers relevant, conceptually robust directions for stimulating the advancement of knowledge and understanding in this nascent field.


Design/methodology/approach
Drawing from service, robotics and social cognition research, this paper develops a conceptual understanding of the value co-creation/destruction potential of social robots in services.


Findings
Three theoretical propositions construct an iterative framework of users’ evaluations of social robots in services. First, social robots offer users value propositions leveraging affective and cognitive resources. Second, users’ personal values become salient through interactions with social robots’ affective and cognitive resources. Third, users evaluate social robots’ value co-creation/destruction potential according to social cognition dimensions.


Originality/value
Social robots in services are an emerging topic in service research and hold promising implications for organizations and users. This relevant, conceptually robust framework advances scholarly understanding of their opportunities and pitfalls for realizing value. This study also identifies guidelines for service managers for designing and introducing social robots into complex service environments.

In this study we assessed the incidence rates of psychiatric diagnoses and drugs in Israeli adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of health records data of over 200,000 12-17 years old adolescents identified a significant increase in all mental health diagnoses and most psychiatric drugs dispensation during the COVID-19 period compared to a corresponding pre-COVID period. A gender sub-analysis revealed that most of this increase was associated with adolescent girls. Girls exhibited increases of 68% in depression, 67% in eating disorders, 42% in anxiety and 29% in stress-related diagnoses during the COVID-19 period, which are significantly higher rates than those seen in boys and in the pre-COVID period. Sector sub-analysis showed that the increase was mainly in the general Jewish sector with almost no significant increases in the Arab and ultra-orthodox sectors.

f5eecfecc74d197760c28b10c0709dd89f06298c,"The potential that robots offer to support humans in multiple aspects of our daily lives is increasingly acknowledged. Despite the clear progress in social robotics and human-robot interaction, the actual realization of this potential still faces numerous scientific and technical challenges, many of them linked to difficulties in dealing with the complexity of the real world. Achieving real-world human-robot interaction requires, on the one hand, taking into account and addressing real-world (e.g., stakeholder’s) needs and application areas and, on the other hand, making our robots operational in the real world. In this talk, I will address some of the contributions that Embodied Artificial Intelligence can make towards this goal, illustrating my arguments with examples of my and my group’s research on HRI using embodied autonomous affective robots in areas such as developmental robotics, healthcare, and computational psychiatry. So far little explored in HRI, Embodied AI, which started as an alternative to “symbolic AI” (a “paradigm change”) in the way to conceive and model the notion of “intelligence” and the interactions of embodied agents with the real world, is highly relevant towards achieving “real-world HRI”, with its emphasis on notions such as autonomy, adaptation, interaction with dynamic environments, sensorimotor loops and coordination, learning from interactions, and more generally, as Rodney Brooks put it, using and exploiting the real world as “its own best model”.","[{'authorId': '1713009', 'name': 'L.

f5fd33af7c5be2af49ca4b8172e25cde136069fc,"The authors present the design and implementation of an exploratory virtual learning environment that assists children with autism (ASD) in learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills along with improving social-emotional and communication skills. The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students’ varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash™, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent’s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent’s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state. The paper provides exploratory findings of the first 2 years of this 5-year scaling-up research study. The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability. Therefore, findings are reported as changes within subjects instead of across subjects. While these exploratory observations serve as a basis for longer term research on a larger population, this paper focuses less on student learning and more on evolving technology in AIC and supporting students with ASD in STEM environments.","[{'authorId': '2056019735', 'name': 'Charles E.

f61b5b5b66670b1ae468743ec56b7f9e7b165320,"Background Mental health problems are common among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and difficulties with emotion regulation processes may underlie these issues. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10‐session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods Sixty‐eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent‐, child‐, and clinician‐reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10‐week follow‐up. Results Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow‐up. Conclusions This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD. Additional investigations are needed to further establish its relative efficacy compared to more traditional models of CBT for children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.","[{'authorId': '2150018495', 'name': 'J.

Moreover, we expected trust to mediate procedural fairness effects on followers' attitudes (authorities' legitimacy and charisma attributed to authorities) and organizational citizenship behavior. Procedural fairness effects on these variables, as mediated by trust, should therefore also be stronger when authority power is high. The results of a single- and multisource field study and a laboratory experiment supported these predictions. These studies support the role of authority power as a theoretically and practically relevant moderator of procedural fairness effects and show that its effectiveness is explained through trust in authorities.","[{'authorId': '115522522', 'name': 'Marius van Dijke'}, {'authorId': '118042674', 'name': 'D.

f6948a8e1db11bf1f94b4386ef43110b5b708d4a,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects a variety of social skills in children. One of the most important social skills that are affected by ASD is the ability to pay attention; ASD introduces unnecessary temporal delays in the attentional behavior of children toward external stimuli. This research focuses on identifying the effect of different social stimuli from robotic agents to assess the attentional behavior of children with ASD. Latencies in shifting attention and the number of attentions paid to a stimulus are defined as indexes of attentional behaviors for children with ASD. Nine children with ASD (seven males and two females, mean: 7.57 ± 2.57 years) that had minimal to no symptoms of autism participated in this study. Two robotic agents presented visual, speech, and motion social stimuli to the participants. Regarding social stimuli, a significant effect on the latency in shifting attention (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\chi ^{2}(2)=9.55$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text {p} = 0.008$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and the number of attentions paid (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\chi ^{2}(2)=9.56$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, p = 0.008) was observed in children with ASD. The speech stimulus captured the children’s attention faster than the visual and motion stimuli in terms of latency in shifting attention and the number of attentions paid. Moreover, significant positive correlations were found for some pairs of stimuli among visual, speech, and motion stimuli for latencies in shifting attention, as well as the number of attentions paid using Pearson’s correlation analysis. This study contributes to the literature in terms of the impact of robotic stimuli on the attentional behavior of children with ASD.","[{'authorId': '1443781694', 'name': 'Faisal Mehmood'}, {'authorId': '3401601', 'name': 'Hamed Mahzoon'}, {'authorId': '2836701', 'name': 'Y.

With a human speaker, children rely more strongly on non-verbal cues (pointing) than on verbal cues (labeling) if these cues are in conflict. However, we do not know how children weigh the non-verbal cues of a robot. Here, we assessed whether four- to six-year-old children (i) differed in their weighing of non-verbal cues (pointing, eye gaze) and verbal cues provided by a robot versus a human; (ii) weighed non-verbal cues differently depending on whether these contrasted with a novel or familiar label; and (iii) relied differently on a robot’s non-verbal cues depending on the degree to which they attributed human-like properties to the robot. The results showed that children generally followed pointing over labeling, in line with earlier research. Children did not rely more strongly on the non-verbal cues of a robot versus those of a human. Regarding pointing, children who perceived the robot as more human-like relied on pointing more strongly when it contrasted with a novel label versus a familiar label, but children who perceived the robot as less human-like did not show this difference. Regarding eye gaze, children relied more strongly on the gaze cue when it contrasted with a novel versus a familiar label, and no effect of anthropomorphism was found. Taken together, these results show no difference in the degree to which children rely on non-verbal cues of a robot versus those of a human and provide preliminary evidence that differences in anthropomorphism may interact with children’s reliance on a robot’s non-verbal behaviors.","[{'authorId': '38887731', 'name': 'Josje Verhagen'}, {'authorId': '36973146', 'name': 'R.

We designed verbal and non-verbal behaviors of the social robot that constitute interaction patterns for artificial creativity. 51 participants played the Droodle Creativity Game with the robot to generate creative titles for ambiguous images.

HRV is a potential biomarker of altered autonomic functioning that can predict future physiological and cognitive health. Understanding the HRV profiles that are unique to each condition will assist in generating predictive models of health. In the current study, we directly compared 12 adults with schizophrenia, 25 adults with autism, and 27 neurotypical controls on their HRV profiles. HRV was measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG) channel as part of a larger electroencephalography (EEG) study. All participants also completed the UCLA Loneliness Questionnaire as a measure of social stress. We found that the adults with schizophrenia exhibited reduced variability in R-R peaks and lower low frequency power in the ECG trace compared to controls. The HRV in adults with autism was slightly suppressed compared to controls but not significantly so. Interestingly, the autism group reported feeling lonelier than the schizophrenia group, and HRV did not correlate with feelings of loneliness for any of the three groups. However, suppressed HRV was related to worse performance on neuropsychological tests of cognition in the schizophrenia group. Together, this suggests that autonomic functioning is more abnormal in schizophrenia than in autism and could be reflecting health factors that are unique to schizophrenia.","[{'authorId': '2228071', 'name': 'Sarah M.

f95319db5d2a2354a96457560242dbce4ad5a65a,"Problem/Condition Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Period Covered 2018. Description of System The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network conducts active surveillance of ASD. This report focuses on the prevalence and characteristics of ASD among children aged 8 years in 2018 whose parents or guardians lived in 11 ADDM Network sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin). To ascertain ASD among children aged 8 years, ADDM Network staff review and abstract developmental evaluations and records from community medical and educational service providers. In 2018, children met the case definition if their records documented 1) an ASD diagnostic statement in an evaluation (diagnosis), 2) a special education classification of ASD (eligibility), or 3) an ASD International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code. Results For 2018, across all 11 ADDM sites, ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years ranged from 16.5 in Missouri to 38.9 in California. The overall ASD prevalence was 23.0 per 1,000 (one in 44) children aged 8 years, and ASD was 4.2 times as prevalent among boys as among girls. Overall ASD prevalence was similar across racial and ethnic groups, except American Indian/Alaska Native children had higher ASD prevalence than non-Hispanic White (White) children (29.0 versus 21.2 per 1,000 children aged 8 years). At multiple sites, Hispanic children had lower ASD prevalence than White children (Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, and Utah), and non-Hispanic Black (Black) children (Georgia and Minnesota). The associations between ASD prevalence and neighborhood-level median household income varied by site. Among the 5,058 children who met the ASD case definition, 75.8% had a diagnostic statement of ASD in an evaluation, 18.8% had an ASD special education classification or eligibility and no ASD diagnostic statement, and 5.4% had an ASD ICD code only. ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years that was based exclusively on documented ASD diagnostic statements was 17.4 overall (range: 11.2 in Maryland to 29.9 in California). The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis ranged from 36 months in California to 63 months in Minnesota. Among the 3,007 children with ASD and data on cognitive ability, 35.2% were classified as having an intelligence quotient (IQ) score ≤70. The percentages of children with ASD with IQ scores ≤70 were 49.8%, 33.1%, and 29.7% among Black, Hispanic, and White children, respectively. Overall, children with ASD and IQ scores ≤70 had earlier median ages of ASD diagnosis than children with ASD and IQ scores >70 (44 versus 53 months). Interpretation In 2018, one in 44 children aged 8 years was estimated to have ASD, and prevalence and median age of identification varied widely across sites. Whereas overall ASD prevalence was similar by race and ethnicity, at certain sites Hispanic children were less likely to be identified as having ASD than White or Black children. The higher proportion of Black children compared with White and Hispanic children classified as having intellectual disability was consistent with previous findings. Public Health Action The variability in ASD prevalence and community ASD identification practices among children with different racial, ethnic, and geographical characteristics highlights the importance of research into the causes of that variability and strategies to provide equitable access to developmental evaluations and services. These findings also underscore the need for enhanced infrastructure for diagnostic, treatment, and support services to meet the needs of all children.","[{'authorId': '3511870', 'name': 'M.

It has been argued that there are universal preferences for some colors over others (e.g., Eysenck, 1941), universal sex differences (e.g., Hurlbert & Ling, 2007), and universal mechanisms or dimensions that govern these preferences (e.g., Palmer & Schloss, 2010). However, there have been surprisingly few cross-cultural investigations of color preference and none from nonindustrialized societies that are relatively free from the common influence of global consumer culture. Here, we compare the color preferences of British adults to those of Himba adults who belong to a nonindustrialized culture in rural Namibia. British and Himba color preferences are found to share few characteristics, and Himba color preferences display none of the so-called ""universal"" patterns or sex differences. Several significant predictors of color preference are identified, such as cone-contrast between stimulus and background (Hurlbert & Ling, 2007), the valence of color-associated objects (Palmer & Schloss, 2010), and the colorfulness of the color. However, the relationship of these predictors to color preference was strikingly different for the two cultures. No one model of color preference is able to account for both British and Himba color preferences. We suggest that not only do patterns of color preference vary across individuals and groups but the underlying mechanisms and dimensions of color preference vary as well. The findings have implications for broader debate on the extent to which our perception and experience of color is culturally relative or universally constrained.","[{'authorId': '84669656', 'name': 'Chloë Taylor'}, {'authorId': '3390246', 'name': 'Alexandra Clifford'}, {'authorId': '4817624', 'name': 'A.

In a sample of 116 boys and girls, 4-year-olds recognized and generated strategies for anger more than 3-year-olds but 3- and 4-year-olds recognized and generated strategies similarly for sadness. Age effects for strategy generation were explained by expressive language skill. Maternal support in response to child distress was related to strategy recognition and generation but in different ways. Maternal structuring was related only to strategy generation for anger. Child strategy understanding of anger and sadness predicted different child behaviors when children had to deal with frustration alone. The findings suggest that emotion regulation strategy understanding can be assessed in young children and that such understanding has implications for self-regulatory behavior.","[{'authorId': '34935701', 'name': 'P.

Accumulating research evidence supports the role of emotion dysregulation in the etiology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The present systematic review synthesized the extant literature and aimed to determine the effects of cognitive emotion regulation strategies and global emotion dysregulation on positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders.


METHOD
A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to identify quantitative studies published between 2000 and 2019. A total of 22 studies were included in this review.


RESULTS
Overall, maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies of rumination, worry, and suppression were generally related to more positive symptoms, while global emotion dysregulation was related to more positive and negative symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results provide preliminary and conceptual evidence on the role of emotion dysregulation in understanding schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Psychological treatment should further determine the therapeutic value of addressing emotion dysregulation to improve positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders.","[{'authorId': '48211619', 'name': 'Jianlin Liu'}, {'authorId': '1400458738', 'name': 'Jesselyn Jia-Xin Chua'}, {'authorId': '4075207', 'name': 'S.

In the present study, regulatory focus theory is used to integrate both approaches and examine their distinct response behaviors concurrently. The findings are robust across two studies with different methods and contexts. As suggested in the proposed model, trust and privacy concern are the two central mediating variables with differentiated effects on promotion and prevention-focused behaviors. Specifically, trust mediates fairness perceptions on promotion-focused behaviors (i.e., relational behavior, relationship investment, and repatronage intentions), whereas privacy concern mediates fairness perceptions on prevention-focused behaviors (i.e., defensive, deflective, and disruptive behaviors).

Much attention has been devoted to the idea that these displays are honest signals of need, and that their apparent cost serves to maintain their honesty. Recent analyses, however, have shown that the cost needed to maintain a fully informative, honest signal may often be so great that both offspring (signaler) and parent (receiver) would do better to refrain from communication. This apparently calls into question the relevance of the costly signaling hypothesis. Here, I show that this argument overlooks the impact of sibling competition. When multiple signalers must compete for the attention of a receiver (as is commonly the case in parent-offspring interactions), I show that (all other things being equal) individual equilibrium signal costs will typically be lower. The greater the number of competitors, the smaller the mean cost, though the maximum level of signal intensity employed by very needy signalers may actually increase with the number of competitors. At the same time, costs become increasingly sensitive to relatedness among signalers as opposed to relatedness between signalers and receivers. As a result of these trends, signaling proves profitable for signalers under a much wider range of conditions when there is competition (though it is still likely to be unprofitable for receivers).","[{'authorId': '35702588', 'name': 'R.

The results revealed that women consistently used more strategies than men and were more flexible in the implementation of those strategies.

Children are often subject to psychological trauma, demonstrated by anxiety, aggression, anger, and similar expressions of emotion, because they lack control of their environment. This sense of helplessness, coupled with fear and pain can cause children to feel powerless in healthcare settings. These emotional responses can delay important medical treatment, take more time to complete and can reduce patient satisfaction. Healthcare professionals are uniquely positioned to prevent healthcare-induced trauma and reduce healthcare-induced anxiety. This article introduces a new way to choice, agenda, resilience and emotion (CARE) for pediatric patients in the healthcare setting by implementing the four following treatment principles called the care process: (1) Choices: Offer power in a powerless environment; (2) Agenda: Let patients and families know what to expect and what is expected of them; (3) Resilience: Highlight strengths and reframe negatives; and (4) Emotional support: Recognize and normalize common fears and responses. Engaging the CARE principles helps patients and families feel empowered and mitigates, reduces, and may even ameliorate risk of anxiety and trauma responses.","[{'authorId': '13393122', 'name': 'Julie L Lerwick'}]",106.0,,42.0,Minimizing pediatric healthcare-induced anxiety and trauma.,2016.0

The program, designed for hearing-impaired elders and their significant others (SO), deals with communication strategies and speech reading. Participants were randomly assigned to a training group (hearing aid fitting + home education program) or a control group (hearing aid fitting). The training group included 24 hearing-impaired subjects and 24 SO's. Controls were 24 affected individuals and 22 SO's. Questionnaires addressing emotional response, communication strategies and the IOI-HA, IOI-AI and IOI-SO were used. A repeated measures analysis of variance was applied to test group differences between pre, post, and 6-months follow-up measures. Increased awareness of benefits of speech reading and improved interaction with the SO were observed in the training group only (p < 0.05). No group difference on ‘emotional response’ was found. IOI-AI and IOI-SO demonstrated favorable attitudes towards the program. Follow-up measures showed improved quality of life and satisfaction in the training group, while a decrease was observed among the controls (p < 0.05). Some effects differed between first-time and experienced hearing aid users.

But there is a dark side to the Internet, and one of the negative consequences of the vast potentials of the Internet has been its excessive and uncontrollable use, often referred to as ‘Internet addiction’. Hardly a day passes without this phenomenon of the modern age being mentioned in the media. Over the past decade, Internet addiction and related behaviours have been attracting the attention of mental health researchers and clinicians, although this field is still in its infancy. In some Asian countries, such as South Korea, Internet addiction and similar problems are considered issues of public health significance. However, in such countries, competitive online video gaming is heavily promoted, blurring the boundary between ‘normal excessive’ and pathologically excessive use of the Internet and online video games. The very term ‘Internet addiction’ is controversial and the concept remains elusive.

This Report then reviews a recent and persuasive body of rigorous research, to determine whether children’s emotional adjustment can be significantly affected by interventions implemented in the preschool and early school years. Results of this review suggest that family early educational, and clinical interventions offer policy makers a wide array of choices in ways that they can make sound investments in young children’s emotional development and school readiness. This research suggests that, while young children’s emotional and behavioral problems are costly to their chances of school success, these problems are identifiable early, are amenable to change, and can be reduced over time. What kinds of investments should policy makers be advised to make, at what point in young children’s development, and in what settings? While modest investments in low-cost interventions initially may seem appealing, this report suggests that there are few bargains to be had when investing in young children’s emotional adjustment. With this caveat in mind, the findings of this report suggest that policy makers should broaden early elementary educational mandates for school readiness to include children’s emotional and behavioral adjustments as key programmatic goals. Policy makers should consider targeting young children’s emotional adjustment prior to school entry, in diverse settings such as Head Start, child care settings, as well as in the first few years of school. Finally, young children’s emotional adjustment can serve as an important benchmark of programmatic success in other policy arenas focusing on child welfare, family support, and economic self-sufficiency, as well as in education.","[{'authorId': '5169917', 'name': 'C.

fb54d7646b76c275451cdb74c17fa83643870fea,"Abstract Social robots serve people as tutors, caretakers, receptionists, companions, and other social agents. People know that the robots are mechanical artifacts, yet they interact with them as if they were actual agents. How is this possible? The proposal here is that people construe social robots not as social agents per se, but as depictions of social agents. They interpret them much as they interpret ventriloquist dummies, hand puppets, virtual assistants, and other interactive depictions of people and animals. Depictions as a class consist of three physical scenes with part-by-part mappings between them: (a) a base scene (the raw physical artifact), (b) the depiction proper (the artifact construed as a depiction), and (c) the scene depicted (the scene people are to imagine). With social robots, evidence shows people form the same three scenes plus mappings: They perceive the raw machinery of a robot, construe it as a depiction of a character, and, using the depiction as a guide, engage in the pretense that they are interacting with the character depicted. With social robots, people also recognize three classes of agents – the characters depicted, the intended recipients of the depictions (those who view or interact with the robots), and the authorities responsible for the robots (the designers, makers, and owners). Construing social robots as depictions, we argue, accounts for many phenomena not covered by alternative models.","[{'authorId': '2160535338', 'name': 'Herbert H.

Questionnaire data were obtained from 217 adolescents (68% girls, mean age 16.7 years) in two waves. Adolescents’ positive self-presentation and number of friends were found to be related to a higher frequency of receiving positive feedback, which in turn was negatively associated with self-esteem. However, the number of Facebook friends had a positive impact on self-esteem, and the initiation of online relationships positively influenced the initiation of offline relationships over time, demonstrating that Facebook may be a training ground for increasing adolescents’ social skills.

The design rationale of the robot and its technical features are described in detail. Three research studies will be presented that have been using KASPAR extensively. Firstly, we present its application in robot-assisted play and therapy for children with autism. Secondly, we illustrate its use in human--robot interaction studies investigating the role of interaction kinesics and gestures. Lastly, we describe a study in the field of developmental robotics into computational architectures based on interaction histories for robot ontogeny. The three areas differ in the way as to how the robot is being operated and its role in social interaction scenarios. Each will be introduced briefly and examples of the results will be presented. Reflections on the specific design features of KASPAR that were important in these studies and lessons learnt from these studies concerning the design of humanoid robots for social interaction will also be discussed.

Although how these mechanisms select for cooperation has been explored extensively, their potential to select simultaneously for complex cheating strategies has been largely overlooked. Tactical deception, the misrepresentation of the state of the world to another individual, may allow cheaters to exploit conditional cooperation by tactically misrepresenting their past actions and/or current intentions. Here we first use a simple game-theoretic model to show that the evolution of cooperation can create selection pressures favouring the evolution of tactical deception. This effect is driven by deception weakening cheater detection in conditional cooperators, allowing tactical deceivers to elicit cooperation at lower costs, while simple cheats are recognized and discriminated against. We then provide support for our theoretical predictions using a comparative analysis of deception across primate species. Our results suggest that the evolution of conditional strategies may, in addition to promoting cooperation, select for astute cheating and associated psychological abilities. Ultimately, our ability to convincingly lie to each other may have evolved as a direct result of our cooperative nature.","[{'authorId': '2665733', 'name': 'L.

The current research was performed to present the aggression model in teenagers to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence, emotional regulation, communicative skills, self-efficacy, and parents’ performance with the mediating role of avoidance insecure attachment style.
Methods: The present correlational study was conducted using structural equation modeling. The population of the research consisted of all female high school students of Tehran city, Iran, in the academic year of 2019-20. The samples were selected using a cluster random sampling method (n=384). The instruments used in this research to collect the required data included the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, Bar-on Emotional Quotient Inventory, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Communicative Skills Questionnaire, General Self-Efficacy Scale, Adult Attachment Scale, and Family Assessment Device. The data analysis was carried out in LISREL 8.80 software using Pearson correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling.
Results: The results showed that emotional intelligence (β=-0.42, P<0.001), emotion regulation (β=-0.39, P<0.001), communication skills (β=-0.37, P<0.001), self-efficacy (β= 0.43, P<0.001), and avoidance insecure attachment style (β=-0.45, P<0.001) had a negative and inverse effect on aggression.

The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) is an instrument that assesses nine cognitive strategies to cope with negative situations. The aim of this study was to validate the CERQ for a sample of Spanish adolescents, to analyse reliability and validity, and to examine the factor structure by confirmatory factor analysis.


METHOD
The Spanish version of CERQ (CERQ-S) and other scales (gratitude, emotional intelligence, satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety and stress) were completed by 835 adolescents aged 14-18 (455 girls) from the South of Spain.


RESULTS
The results showed that the CERQ-S in adolescents (CERQ-SA) has appropriate psychometric properties with indexes of reliability a = .89 and w = .96, and the original nine-factor structure was confirmed. There was also significant correlation between the CERQ-SA and the other scales, showing evidence of convergent validity.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that the CERQ-SA could be useful for appraising cognitive coping in adolescents. This will help to expand the study and understanding of these strategies, their influence and their consequences for adolescents' psychological functioning and health.","[{'authorId': '1490428136', 'name': 'M.

With a person‐centred approach, the present study examined 123 kindergarteners (59 girls, 64 boys) regarding their early executive functions and social skills profiles. Children were 6–7 years of age at the first measurement point (M = 6; 6, SD = 4.22, range = 5; 8–7; 8). One year later, at the end of first grade, they were 7–8‐years old (M = 7; 6, SD = 4.11, range = 6; 9–8; 8). Four different profiles were identified. The profiles did not differ on demographic dimensions or socioeconomic status but appeared to be related to academic achievement and school adjustment at the end of the first grade 1 year later. Profiles with high executive functions showed the greatest predictive validity, independent of their social skills. However, greater social skills seemed to serve as a compensator in the profile with lower executive functions. The resulting profiles have theoretical and practical relevance, when discussing the question what a child needs to be “ready” for school.","[{'authorId': '3367765', 'name': 'C.

POS believes there needs to be a focus on the positive in organizational research versus the negative approach that has been the tradition (Baumeister et al., 2001; Sekerka et al., 2014). However, there is reason to believe that even in the face of positive organizational features, if workplace bullying is present, the beneficial outcomes associated with positive features may be lost or at least diminished (Baumeister et al., 2001; Dutton and Glynn, 2008). From this perspective, in order to best understand and enrich human and organizational life, researchers should continue to study problems and their potential solutions, but do so in tandem with others who are studying human thriving in the absence of, or despite, problems. The current study has two central goals. One of the purposes of the study is to explore the effect of positive interpersonal work experiences and perceived organizational virtuousness on three vital individual and organizational outcomes: stress levels related to work, perceptions of mental health quality, and the intent to leave jobs. Importantly for this purpose, however, is going beyond simply looking at positive phenomena but also looking at the moderating effect of workplace bullying on these outcomes. Workplace bullying has significant negative consequences for individuals and organizations (e.g., Malinauskiene and Einarsen, 2014; Finne et al., 2011; Loerbroks et al, 2015) and can often escalate into what is becoming of significant concern in organizations, workplace violence (Mayhew and Chappell, 2007). It will be argued that although positive phenomena are valuable goals for a wide variety of reasons, if workers are also targeted with negative, hostile messages and behaviors, positive dynamics can be negated or at least weakened. LITERATURE REVIEW Positive Organizational Scholarship The organizational literature has traditionally taken a problem-focused approach (Sekerka et al., 2014), in which researchers attempt to address deficits in organizations and to bring organizations to some state of normalcy rather than attempting to cultivate strengths (Cooperrider and Godwin, 2012). Positive organizational scholarship (POS) conceptualizes and studies what is or could be ""good"" in organizations--how organizations and their members might thrive, what leads to thriving, what thriving leads to, and how thriving might be increased. POS ""is concerned with the study of especially positive outcomes, processes, and attributes of organizations and their members.... [, that which is] exceptional, virtuous, life-giving, and flourishing"" (Cameron et al., 2003a: 4, 5). POS and positive organizational behavior are relatively young fields (Cameron et al., 2003b; Luthans, 2002) still calling for empirical work to test its nascent assumptions (Cameron and McNaughtan, 2014). POS focuses on issues including but not limited to perceived organizational virtuousness (Cameron et at., 2004), upward spirals in organizations (Fredrickson, 2003), and narratives of compassion (Frost et al., 2000). Empirical work suggests that these phenomena are associated with positive organizational outcomes and, more importantly, positive human outcomes (Cameron and McNaughton, 2014). Compassion, for example, can provide supportive spaces for persons suffering loss or trauma in their personal lives and also ""may be a factor in both attracting and retaining staff"" (Frost et al., 2000: 38). The effects of such positive organizational processes appear promising for enriching human life, both inside and outside of organizations. The effects of two particular arenas of positive organizational phenomena are explored: positive individual treatment and organizational virtuousness.

Child life specialists offered PLEO as a therapeutic activity to children in a personalised way for a well-being related purpose in three to five play like activity sessions during hospital visits/stay. Robot–child interaction was observed; care professionals, children and parents were interviewed. Applying direct content analysis revealed six categories of interest: interaction with PLEO, role of the adults, preferences for PLEO, PLEO as buddy, attainment of predetermined goal(s) and deployment of PLEO. Four girls and five boys, aged 4–13, had PLEO offered as a relief from stress or boredom or for physical stimulation. All but one started interacting with PLEO and showed behaviours like hugging, caring or technical exploration, promoting relaxation, activation and/or making contact. Interaction with PLEO contributed to achieving the well-being related purpose for six of them. PLEO was perceived as attractive to elicit play.

The findings suggest that the existing definition and characteristics of risky play are appropriate for twoand threeyear-old children, but for one-year-olds, the study found discrepancies indicating deviations from existing definitions, indicating that the concept may not be so useful for this age group. To develop understanding of risky play, this article suggests new categories and an adapted definition.","[{'authorId': '87331962', 'name': 'Rasmus Kleppe'}]",5.0,,334.0,One-to-three-year-olds’ Risky Play in Early Childhood Education and Care,2018.0

This paper presents a preliminary study on whether motivational strategies based on Regulatory Focus Theory and goal attainment affect children’s perception of a virtual social robot when solving a task. The ongoing pandemic (COVID-19) is altering the way we perform research. Hence, we designed a fully autonomous game with a virtual social robot. In an online user study, 25 children (8 to 17 years old) played a regulatory focus goal-oriented game with a virtual child-like version of the Furhat robot. We evaluated children’s perceptions of the robot’s social trust, competency trust, and likability. Also, we assessed the children’s affective state (valence and arousal) before and after playing the game. Our preliminary results show that in the prevention condition, fulfilling the goal elicited less happiness in children. Surprisingly, we observed a trend increase in the social and competency trust elicited by the virtual robot when children were prevented from fulfilling the goal of the task.

Indeed, the single most common request for assistance from teachers is related to behavior and classroom management (Rose & Gallup, 2005). Classrooms with frequent disruptive behaviors have less academic engaged time, and the students in disruptive classrooms tend to have lower grades and do poorer on standardized tests (Shinn, Ramsey, Walker, Stieber, & O‟Neill, 1987). Furthermore, attempts to control disruptive behaviors cost considerable teacher time at the expense of academic instruction.Effective classroom management focuses on preventive rather than reactive procedures and establishes a positive classroom environment in which the teacher focuses on students who behave appropriately (Lewis & Sugai, 1999). Rules and routines are powerful preventative components to classroom organization and management plans because they establish the behavioral context of the classroom by specifying what is expected, what will be reinforced, and what will be retaught if inappropriate behavior occurs (Colvin, Kame‟enui, & Sugai, 1993). This prevents problem behavior by giving students specific, appropriate behaviors to engage in. Monitoring student behavior allows the teacher to acknowledge students who are engaging in appropriate behavior and prevent misbehavior from escalating (Colvin et al., 1993).","[{'authorId': '93050306', 'name': 'Regina M.

The Positive Emotions Program for Schizophrenia (PEPS) is an emotion regulation strategy training that aims to intensify positive emotions and develop positive performance beliefs. A randomized controlled trial showed that PEPS is effective in reducing the composite score of the reduction of experience syndrome (anhedonia and apathy). The present study is designed to evaluate its feasibility in natural conditions to measure external validity of PEPS. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one participants recruited through the French national network of expert centers followed eight sessions of PEPS and were assessed pre- and posttest with the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Personal and Social Performance (PSP). The scales of the SANS were divided into a composite score of the reduction of the ability to experience and a composite score of the reduction of expression. Results: All participants followed the 8 sessions of PEPS, and both composite scores were significantly and clinically improved at posttest. Social functioning assessed with the PSP was also improved. Conclusions: This field test shows that participation in PEPS is accompanied by a reduction of negative symptoms and an improvement of social functioning. Both negative syndromes, reduction of expression and reduction of experience, are improved. Participants are younger than those in previous studies, which may explain this unexpected result. However, this calls for a controlled study with younger participants.","[{'authorId': '6187446', 'name': 'J.

The patterns enable the child to make decisions about the story by talking with the robot, reenact parts of the story together with the robot, and recording self-made sound effects. The design patterns successfully support children’s engagement and agency. A user study $(\mathrm{N}=27$, 8-10 y.o.) showed that children paid more attention to the robot, enjoyed the storytelling experience more, and could recall more about the story, when the design patterns were employed by the robot during storytelling. All three aspects are important features of engagement. Children felt more autonomous during storytelling with the design patterns and highly appreciated that the design patterns allowed them to express themselves more freely. Both aspects are important features of children’s agency. Important lessons we have learned are that reducing points of confusion and giving the children more time to make themselves heard by the robot will improve the patterns efficiency to support engagement and agency. Allowing children to pick and choose from a diverse set of stories and interaction settings would make the storytelling experience more inclusive for a broader range of children.

The abstract qualities Winnicott ascribes to potential space were corroborated by the answers of a group of student readers to a questionnaire on their physical and mental experiences when reading short stories. Potential space thus can illuminate literary space, or the relationship readers form with literary texts. Winnicott's concept is placed in the context of speculations by literary critics on the ways people become absorbed in literature, including theories of Norman Holland, Louise Rosenblatt, and Murray Schwartz. Finally, the concept of potential space gives teachers and students new metaphors to understand responses to literature, and may require us to seriously re-evaluate classroom practices and goals. ""For heaven's sake, go away and stay out of her life, you bastard!"" Who said this? Was it: (1) the angry third party in a triangular love affair admonishing the extra boyfriend to get lost; (2) a protective mother to her daughter's abusive husband; or (3) a moviegoer at a showing of the film ""New York, New York,"" shouting at Robert DeNiro's character, out of concern for Liza Minelli's character? It was number three. When my fellow-watcher irately spoke out, I had to laugh. Her verbal outburst exactly matched my own hostile feelings toward DeNiro's character. Yet my own distinction between the actor's character as a fiction and the on-screen character as a ""real"" person had not blurred to the point where I reacted as though he were physically present. The blurring, however, had almost gone that far, which provoked my amusement. At least since Aristotle developed his theory of catharsis to explain the pity and fear aroused in the viewer of tragedy, people have been bemused by and challenged to explain our emotionally intense reactions to plays, novels, poems, and other art forms. I will briefly summarize a line of commentary by literary critics that runs from Dr. Johnson to Coleridge and to contemporary psychoanalytic and transactive critics. Finally, I discuss the concept of ""potential space"" as some critics use it to describe the state of mind in which a reader blurs the distinction between reality and art.

When the diagnosis or selection of a therapy is no longer made solely by the physician, but to a significant extent by a machine using algorithms, decisions become nontransparent. Skill learning is the most common application of machine learning algorithms in clinical decision making. These are a class of very general algorithms (artificial neural networks, classifiers, etc.), which are tuned based on examples to optimize the classification of new, unseen cases. It is pointless to ask for an explanation for a decision. A detailed understanding of the mathematical details of an AI algorithm may be possible for experts in statistics or computer science. However, when it comes to the fate of human beings, this “developer’s explanation” is not sufficient.

Patients with remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) were previously found to display abnormal functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity (fMRI) between the right superior anterior temporal lobe (RSATL) and the subgenual cingulate cortex and adjacent septal region (SCSR) when experiencing self-blaming emotions relative to emotions related to blaming others (eg, ""indignation or anger toward others""). This finding provided the first neural signature of biases toward overgeneralized self-blaming emotions (eg, ""feeling guilty for everything""), known to have a key role in cognitive vulnerability to MDD. It is unknown whether this neural signature predicts risk of recurrence, a crucial step in establishing its potential as a prognostic biomarker, which is urgently needed for stratification into pathophysiologically more homogeneous subgroups and for novel treatments.


OBJECTIVE
To use fMRI in remitted MDD at baseline to test the hypothesis that RSATL-SCSR connectivity for self-blaming relative to other-blaming emotions predicts subsequent recurrence of depressive episodes.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A prospective cohort study from June 16, 2011, to October 10, 2014, in a clinical research facility completed by 75 psychotropic medication-free patients with remitted MDD and no relevant comorbidity. In total, 31 remained in stable remission, and 25 developed a recurring episode over the 14 months of clinical follow-up and were included in the primary analysis. Thirty-nine control participants with no personal or family history of MDD were recruited for further comparison.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Between-group difference (recurring vs stable MDD) in RSATL connectivity, with an a priori SCSR region of interest for self-blaming vs other-blaming emotions.


RESULTS
We corroborated our hypothesis that during the experience of self-blaming vs other-blaming emotions, RSATL-SCSR connectivity predicted risk of subsequent recurrence. The recurring MDD group showed higher connectivity than the stable MDD group (familywise error-corrected P < .05 over the a priori SCSR region of interest) and the control group. In addition, the recurring MDD group also exhibited RSATL hyperconnectivity with the right ventral putamen and claustrum and the temporoparietal junction. Together, these regions predicted recurrence with 75% accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a robust demonstration of an fMRI signature of recurrence risk in remitted MDD. Additional studies are needed for its further optimization and validation as a prognostic biomarker.","[{'authorId': '6495774', 'name': 'K. Lythe'}, {'authorId': '2529727', 'name': 'J.

To ensure audiological rehabilitation is provided appropriately for older adults with comorbid psychological symptoms, a greater understanding of their preferences and experiences is needed. This study sought to understand experiences of hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation from the perspective of older adults with comorbid psychological symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychosis). Design A qualitative study using in-depth semistructured interviews was conducted with older adults who had attended audiological rehabilitation within the last year and scored above established cutoffs on measures of depression, anxiety, and psychosis. A thematic analysis generated themes that related to participants' experiences of hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation. Results Participants included 14 older adults (eight men and six women) with an average age of 70.5 years (SD = 4.45, range: 64-80) who received hearing aids or a cochlear implant. Three major themes emerged from the analysis of participant interviews. ""The cumulative impact of hearing loss and psychological symptoms"" theme describes the two-way, additive relationship between hearing ability and psychological symptoms. ""The experience of loss throughout hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation"" captures subjective losses, the impact they have, and how participants cope with them. In contrast, ""The experience of gain throughout hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation"" describes the participants' reported gains, their related impacts, and coping strategies. Conclusions The experiences of participants revealed that the presence of comorbid psychological symptoms can influence the experience of hearing loss and audiological rehabilitation. These findings have implications for how audiological rehabilitation is provided to ensure optimal outcomes for adults with hearing loss and comorbid psychological symptoms.

We discuss implications for future social distancing policies that aim to balance physical health with psychological health.","[{'authorId': '1483547161', 'name': 'Karynna Okabe‐Miyamoto'}, {'authorId': '2008789336', 'name': 'D.

Despite the growing interest in recent years in emotional intelligence within the managerial literature, too little has been written about emotional intelligence within the public sector. This is surprising in light of New Public Management voices that stress flexibility, responsiveness, and a focus on the needs and demands of citizens. The functionality of the heart in a mind-oriented bureaucracy is analyzed, and a model is suggested for exploring the relationship between emotional intelligence, organizational politics, and employees' performance in public agencies. This model is empirically tested in two Israeli municipalities. The results support a moderating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between organizational politics and emotional commitment, as well as between organizational politics and employees' absenteeism. Other direct mediating effects of political perceptions and skills are noted. Implications for theory development, future empirical studies, as well as practical recommendations are suggested.","[{'authorId': '1402009022', 'name': 'E.

ffedd368a154f17193e97f52775cc0fdfcec71fb,"This study examines the relationship between top management turnover (i.e. investment directors) and investment performance for actively managed Australian funds. This issue is significant given the importance of executive management in the implementation of the institution's investment strategy, the sizeable assets under their control, as well as the overall success and profitability of the funds management operation. In addition, investors, asset consultants, managed-fund ratings agencies and the financial media devote significant resources to the scrutiny of performance, the organisational activities, leadership and human capital of investment management firms. Accordingly, this study examines the impact of performance and fund-flow activity on top management turnover in both the pre-and-post replacement period. The research documents that turnover of underperforming investment managers results in significantly higher performance in the post-replacement period, while turnover coinciding with outperforming managers delivers investors significantly lower returns. The evidence also identifies significant changes in portfolio risk associated with managerial turnover. Finally, this research documents that underperforming investment managers exhibit significantly lower fund flows prior to replacement.","[{'authorId': '2302650', 'name': 'D.
