The aim of this paper is to reveal the main nursing competencies for spiritual care, which emerged from data collecting from qualified nurses in Malta.


BACKGROUND
For nurses to deliver spiritual care, they must be competent to provide care on a physical, mental, social and spiritual level. As spiritual care may be influenced by culture, this study explored the competencies for spiritual care from the Maltese nurses' perspective.


METHODS
A descriptive exploratory study investigated nurses' competencies in the delivery of spiritual care to patients with myocardial infarction. Data were collected by means of an open-ended questionnaire on qualified nurses (n=77) followed by an in-depth interview on a stratified random sample (n=14) of nurses from the same respondents.


RESULTS
The four main nursing competencies identified were associated with the role of the nurse as a professional and as an individual person; delivery of spiritual care by the nursing process; nurses' communication with patients, inter-disciplinary team and clinical/educational organizations and safeguarding ethical issues in care.


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrated the complexity of spiritual care, which requires nurses to increase their awareness of the uniqueness of each individual patient with regard to the connection between mind, body and spirit; the assessment of the spiritual status of patients during illness and the implementation of holistic care as recommended by the Nursing Code of Ethics.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
These findings will enable nurses to consider the importance of spiritual care, which may allow them to help empower patients find meaning and purpose during times of illness. More emphasis should be put on spiritual care in the pre- and postregistration education. Further research to translate these main competencies into specific competencies will guide spiritual care.","[{'authorId': '21542189', 'name': 'Donia R.

To examine the association of adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms with daily smoking and nicotine dependence in young adulthood.


DESIGN
A prospective cohort study of adolescent and young adult health (n = 1943). Teen assessments occurred at 6-monthly intervals, with two follow-up assessments in young adulthood (wave 7, 1998; wave 8, 2001-03).


SETTING
Victoria, Australia. Participants Students who participated at least once during the first six (adolescent) waves of the cohort study.


MEASUREMENTS
Adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). Young adult tobacco use was defined as: daily use (6 or 7 days per week) and dependent use (> or =4 on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence).


FINDINGS
Among adolescent 'less than daily' smokers, those with high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms had an increased risk of reporting nicotine dependence in young adulthood [odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-9.1] compared to young adults who had low levels of adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms, after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Similarly, in the adjusted model (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.4), among adolescent 'daily' smokers, those with high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms had an almost two-fold increase in the odds of reporting nicotine dependence in young adulthood compared to young adults with low levels of adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Adolescent smokers with depression and anxiety symptoms are at increased risk for nicotine dependence into young adulthood. They warrant vigilance from primary care providers in relation to tobacco use well into adulthood.","[{'authorId': '145586965', 'name': 'Maria McKenzie'}, {'authorId': '34908458', 'name': 'C.

In Study 3, a situation in which Ss anticipated a punishment was created. Controlling for initial nervousness, Ss high in BIS sensitivity (assessed earlier) were more nervous than those low in BIS sensitivity. In Study 4, a situation in which Ss anticipated a reward was created. Controlling for initial happiness, Ss high in BAS sensitivity (Reward Responsiveness and Drive scales) were happier than those low in BAS sensitivity.

Effective play and coping skills may be important determinants of children's adaptive behavior. Play and coping have undergone extensive individual study; however, these two variables have not been explored in relationship to each other.


METHOD
The play behaviors of 19 randomly selected preschool children were rated by researchers using The Test of Playfulness. The children's coping skills were rated by their teachers with the Coping Inventory.


RESULTS
A positive, significant correlation was found between children's level of playfulness and their coping skills. Overall, girls were rated as more playful than boys and scored higher in coping skills. Younger children (36-47 months of age) were rated as better players and copers than older children (47-57 months of age).

Results demonstrate that job resources, such as perceived organizational support and perceived customer participation, can positively influence an employee’s COA, which subsequently promotes deep over surface acting behaviors. Such positive relationships, however, are significantly and adversely affected by a job demand, perceived crowding, and a job stressor, perceived job insecurity. Specifically, contextual demands weaken the positive influence of job resources upon the development of a COA, also weakening the positive influence of a COA upon deep acting while promoting the occurrence of surface acting. From a managerial perspective, such findings highlight the importance of understanding the potentially negative influence of a stressful, demanding work environment, even upon employees who possess a very positive attitude toward helping customers.","[{'authorId': '2867735', 'name': 'Jaewon Yoo'}, {'authorId': '143725439', 'name': 'Todd J.

More recently, long-term effects of the physical stress of repetitive procedural pain have begun to be addressed in infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care. Preterm infants are more sensitive to pain and stress, which cannot be distinguished in neonates. The focus of this review is clinical studies of long-term effects of repeated procedural pain-related stress in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in relation to brain development, neurodevelopment, programming of stress systems, and later pain sensitivity in infants born very preterm (24–32 weeks’ gestational age). Neonatal pain exposure has been quantified as the number of invasive and/or skin-breaking procedures during hospitalization in the NICU. Emerging studies provide convincing clinical evidence for an adverse impact of neonatal pain/stress in infants at a time of physiological immaturity, rapidly developing brain microstructure and networks, as well as programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Currently it appears that early pain/stress may influence the developing brain and thereby neurodevelopment and stress-sensitive behaviors, particularly in the most immature neonates. However, there is no evidence for greater prevalence of pain syndromes compared to children and adults born healthy at full term. In addressing associations between pain/stress and outcomes, careful consideration of confounding clinical factors related to prematurity is essential. The need for pain management for humanitarian care is widely advocated. Non-pharmacological interventions to help parents reduce their infant’s stress may be brain-protective.","[{'authorId': '145281429', 'name': 'R.

The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models.

01ee63078a44f4e3a3cc5207f39578cc328cf05c,"Occupational stress has been a topic of significant research for the last two decades, reflecting the detrimental effects of employees. In particular, teacher stress is borne out of the demands on the individual teacher. Strong evidence suggests that many substitute teacher costs are a direct result of teacher stress. The costs associated with this stressful occupation can be high in phsycial, economical, and academic terms. Human Resource Managers can detect the early stages of stress and advocate organizational stress management programs. Research on the causes of, effects of, and reduction strategies for teacher stress are discussed. Stress is a biological phenomena that is experienced by all persons regardless of their socio-economic status, occupation, or age. While there is a lack of universal agreement on the meaning of stress, a few articles attempt to define stress. McGrath (1976) and Schuler (1980) generally define stress as a dynamic condition, in which an individual is confronted with an opportunity, constraint, or demand on being, having, andor doing what he or she desires. Beehr and Newman (1978) provide a more specific definition: job stress is a condition wherein job-related factors interact with the worker to change her psychological or physiological condition such that she is forced to deviate from normal functioning. Their definition is useful because it describes stress as a type of person-environment fit encompassing both individual and workplace stressors. Hans Selye (1976) gives a thorough overview of stress from a practical and medical perspective in his book, The Stress of Life. He reports that stress is essentially the rate of wear and tear on the body. Moreover, it is impossible to live without experiencing some amount of stress all the time. Very simple activities and problems as well as the most complex ones can cause stress. They simply vary in degree. For example, crossing a busy intersection, exposure to a draft, or even sheer joy are significant enough to activate the body's stress mechanism. Therefore, stress is not necessarily something bad, nor is it necessarily something good. It is simply something that cannot be avoided. The same stress that makes one person ill, makes for an invigorating experience for another. A major factor to consider in order to avoid harmful stress is whether you are adjusting correctly to life situations. This, in Selye's (1976) estimation, is the very root of the disease producing conflicts, (i.e., improper reactions to life situations). During his years and many autopsies, he has never seen a person die of old age. Rather, there is always one part of the body that wears out first and wrecks the whole human machinery, merely because the other parts cannot function without it. With this in mind, Selye (1976) states that an ever increasing proportion of people die from the so-called wear and tear diseases, diseases of civilization, or degenerative diseases, which are primarily stress. The main issue is that the human body wears longest when it wears evenly. As we look at ""stress"" among teachers we might question how evenly they wear themselves out. Wearing oneself out is as living, and it is inevitable. However, I would guess that few teachers would venture to say that they are wearing themselves out evenly. The Need For Synthesis State and local school administrators are increasingly concerned with the issue of stress in teaching (Hudson and Meagher, 1983). Public school teachers spend roughly half their waking lives in work-related activities. It seems likely then, that job related psychological and physical stress factors may have important influences on their health. To better understand the causes and effects of stress in teaching, the existing research needs to be synthesized. One important reason for studying teacher stress is that their work experiences can have detrimental effects on them, their students, and the learning environment. …","[{'authorId': '50332351', 'name': 'C.

021bbed159d9126fed83faedd9291faedb2ac535,"Twenty years ago Guest (1987) published his normative framework describing the essence of HRM. He presented HRM as a new approach to personnel management, emphasizing its strategic contribution, its closer alignment to business, the involvement of line management, and focusing on HRM outcomes like commitment, flexibility and quality. The achievement of these human resource outcomes was, in turn, expected to contribute to a range of positive organizational outcomes, including high job performance, low turnover, low absence and high cost-effectiveness through the full utilization of employees, now relabelled as human resources. Put this way, it is not difficult to understand the wide appeal that the notion of HRM had (and still has) to academics and practitioners alike. It led to the renaming of chairs/departments within universities and to changed job titles in the business community. The attractiveness of the concept of HRM increased considerably when Huselid, in 1995, published a ground-breaking paper in the Academy of Management Journal in which he demonstrated a correlation between the degree of sophistication of HR-systems and the market value per employee among a range of publicly quoted companies in the USA. The paper generated admiration, criticism and an abundance of 'me too' research, trying to replicate the proclaimed relationship between HRM and Performance (Delery and Doty, 1996; Guthrie, 2001; Koch and McGrath, 1996; Wright et al., 2003). Since then many academics on both sides of the Atlantic have become active in this field, with a special focus on the relationship between HRM and Performance. Within this rapidly expanding field of study, the HRM–Performance relationship has been approached from a variety of perspectives rooted in organizational behaviour, sociology, economics, industrial relations and organizational psychology, with a particular emphasis placed on the impact of various combinations of human resource practices on a range of performance outcomes at the individual and organizational level of analysis.","[{'authorId': '3939537', 'name': 'J.

Participants were 5,434 Chinese adolescents in Grades 7 to 12 who completed the full CES-D; 612 of them further completed a structured diagnostic interview with the major depressive disorder (MDD) module of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-age Children. Using a split-sample approach, a series of 4-, 3-, 2-, and 1-factor models were tested using exploratory structural equation modeling and cross-validated using confirmatory factor analysis; the dimensionality was also evaluated by parallel analysis in conjunction with the scree test and aided by factor mixture analysis. The results indicated that a single-factor model of depression with a wording method factor fitted the data well, and was the optimal structure underlying the scores of the full and shortened CES-D. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curve analyses for MDD case detection showed that the CES-D full-scale scores accurately detected MDD youth (area under the curve [AUC] = .84). Furthermore, the short-form scores produced comparable AUCs with the full scale (.82 to .85), as well as similar levels of sensitivity and specificity when using optimal cutoffs. These findings suggest that depression among Chinese adolescents can be adequately measured and screened for by a single-factor structure underlying the CES-D scores, and that the short forms provide a viable alternative to the full instrument.","[{'authorId': '50741130', 'name': 'Wenhui Yang'}, {'authorId': '2059067912', 'name': 'Ge Xiong'}, {'authorId': '144367155', 'name': 'L.

Emotional intelligence and social support are commonly linked to mental health and well-being. The present study aims to analyze the mediator role of emotional intelligence and social support on university students’ mental health, taking into consideration the role of gender differences. An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 923 university students during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. Significant gender differences were found on mental health symptoms, emotional intelligence, and social support. A double mediation model was computed to verify if gender influences on mental health were mediated by emotional intelligence and social support. The results show indirect effects of gender on mental health. However, as both mediators mediate in the opposite direction, the total indirect effects become null. Thus, a strong direct effect of gender on mental health remains. The results of the present study have theoretical implications on protective factors of mental health by gender and practical implications for psychological intervention in university counselling services.","[{'authorId': '153330462', 'name': 'Carla Barros'}, {'authorId': '2140331565', 'name': 'A.

02b428e8fc1631e539249f60dc314b3de1bbcc13,"Evidence from pioneering animal research has suggested that the amygdala is involved in the processing of aversive stimuli, particularly fear-related information. Fear is central in the evolution of the mammalian brain: it is automatically and rapidly elicited by potentially dangerous and deadly events. The view that the amygdala shares the main characteristics of modular systems, e.g. domain specificity, automaticity, and cognitive impenetrability, has become popular in neuroscience. Because of its computational properties, it has been proposed to implement a rapid-response 'fear module'. In this article, we review recent patient and neuroimaging data of the human brain and argue that the fundamental criteria for the amygdala to be a modular system are not met. We propose a different computational view and suggest the notion of a specific involvement of the human amygdala in the appraisal of relevant events that include, but are not restricted to, fear-related stimuli. Considering the amygdala as a 'relevance detector' would integrate the 'fear module' hypothesis with the concept of an evolved neural system devoted to the processing of a broader category of biologically relevant stimuli. In primates, socially relevant events appear to have become, through evolution, the dominant elements of the amygdala's domain of specificity.","[{'authorId': '143868107', 'name': 'D.

Parents' and infant's affective states were coded in one-second frames, and synchrony was measured with time- series analysis. The orientation, intensity, and temporal pattern of infant positive arousal were assessed. Synchrony between same-gender parent-infant dyads was more optimal in terms of stronger lagged associations between parent and infant affect, more frequent mutual synchrony, and shorter lags to re- sponsiveness. Infants' arousal duringmother-infant interaction cycled between medium and low levels, and high positive affect appeared gradually and was embedded within a social episode. During father- child play, positive arousal was high, sudden, and organized in multiple peaks that appeared more fre- quently as play progressed. Mother-infant synchrony was linked to the partners' social orientation and was inversely related to maternal depression and infant negative emotionality. Father-child synchrony was related to the intensity of positive arousal and to father attachment security. Results contribute to research on the regulation of positive emotions and describe the unique modes of affective sharing that infants coconstruct with mother and father. RESUMEN: Para examinar la co-regulacion del afecto positivo durante las interacciones entre la madre y su hijo y el padre y su hijo, cien parejas y sus hijos primerizos fueron grabadas en video en sesiones de interacciones cara a cara. Los estados afectivos de los padres y de los infantes fueron codificados en marcos de un segundo, y la sincronia se midiopor medio de un analisis de tiempo en serie. Se evaluaron la orientacion, la intensidad, y el patron temporal del despertar positivo del infante. La sincronia entre las diadas del mismo sexo (madre-hija o padre-hijo) fue mas optima en terminos de mas fuertes asocia- ciones espaciadas del afecto entre padre/madre e infante, la mas frecuente mutua sincronia, y mas cortos espacios de sensibilidad.. El despertar de los ninos durante la interaccion entre la madre y su infante osciloentre los niveles medio y bajo, y el afecto positivo alto apareciogradualmente y se encontraba metido dentro de una situacion social. Durante el juego entre el padre y su infante, el despertar positivo fue alto, rapido y organizado en multiples puntos maximos que aparecieron con mayor frecuencia a medida que el juego progresaba. La sincronia entre la madre y su infante fue asociada con la orientacion social de los participantes y fue inversamente relacionada con la depresion maternal y la negativa emo- cionalidad del infante. La sincronia entre el padre y su infante fue relacionada con la intensidad del despertar positivo y con la seguridad de la afectividad paterna. Los resultados contribuyen a la investi- gacion sobre la regulacion de las emociones positivas y describen los modelos unicos de la afectividad compartida que los infantes co-construyen con la madre y el padre.","[{'authorId': '144708274', 'name': 'R.

The second aim was to investigate whether home resources and home demands have an additional influence on both processes over time. The hypotheses were tested with cross-lagged analyses based on two waves over a three-year period. The results supported both the motivational process and the health impairment process. Job resources influenced future work engagement, which, in turn, predicted organizational commitment, whereas job demands predicted burnout over time, which, in turn, predicted future depression. In addition, job resources had a weak negative impact on burnout. Home demands and home resources did not influence the motivational or health impairment process over time. The results support the central role of work characteristics for health and well-being. By integrating both human thriving and ill-health in the same model, the JD-R model may help to bridge the gap between “negative” and “positive” psychology.","[{'authorId': '1948113', 'name': 'J.

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in youth is a strong predictor of mental illness yet the wide range of associations with psychiatric disorders remains largely unexplained. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the identification of irritable, headstrong and hurtful dimensions within youth oppositionality would clarify the pattern of associations between oppositionality and a wide range of psychopathology in early and adult life.


METHODS
Cross-sectional data from national mental health surveys including 18,415 subjects aged 5-16 in the United Kingdom. The main outcome measures were the associations between a priori hypothesised dimensions of oppositionality with psychiatric disorders and symptoms; parent and teacher-derived information were used in multivariate regression analysis.


RESULTS
Our three a priori dimensions had very different associations with disorders and symptom scales. Irritability was the only predictor of emotional disorders (parent report: OR = 3.26 [CI 95% 2.79, 3.80]; teacher report: OR = 2.78 [2.39, 3.22]); the hurtful dimension was particularly strongly associated with seeming cold-blooded or callous (parent report: beta = .32 [.27, .37]; teacher report: .33 [.30, .36]); and the headstrong dimension was most strongly associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; parent report: OR = 3.21 [2.43, 4.23]; teacher report : OR = 7.18 [5.25, 9.82]). All three dimensions were associated with conduct disorder, with the headstrong dimension being the main predictor of non-aggressive symptoms (parent report: beta = .31 [.27, .34]; teacher report: .43 [.40, .45]), and with the hurtful dimension being the main predictor of aggressive symptoms (parent report: beta = .35 [.32, .39]; teacher report: .40 [.39, .42]).


CONCLUSIONS
The three dimensions of oppositionality have distinctive external correlates, suggesting they may also be differential predictors of aetiology, prognosis and treatment responsiveness.","[{'authorId': '3025102', 'name': 'A.

Ss (43 men and 42 women) watched a short disgust-eliciting film while their behavioral, physiological, and subjective responses were recorded. Ss were told to watch the film (no suppression condition) or to watch the film while behaving ""in such a way that a person watching you would not know you were feeling anything"" (suppression condition). Suppression reduced expressive behavior and produced a mixed physiological state characterized by decreased somatic activity and decreased heart rate, along with increased blinking and indications of increased sympathetic nervous system activity (in other cardiovascular measures and in electrodermal responding). Suppression had no impact on the subjective experience of emotion. There were no sex differences in the effects of suppression.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

In Study 1, parents (N = 365) who had reported on their psychological and physical health prior to the pandemic completed the same health assessments along with their use of emotion regulation strategies when confined in the home with their school-aged children during a nationwide lockdown. In Study 2, individuals (N = 1,607) from a nationally representative panel study completed similar measures of psychological and physical health and use of emotion regulation strategies one-year prior to the lockdown and then again during the lockdown. Accounting for prepandemic psychological health, greater rumination and emotional suppression were independently associated with poorer psychological health (greater depressive symptoms and psychological distress, lower emotional and personal well-being), even when controlling for the emotional challenges of the pandemic (emotion control difficulties, perceived support; Studies 1 and 2) and a range of demographic covariates (Study 2). Greater rumination was also associated with greater fatigue in both studies, but greater rumination and emotional suppression were only independently associated with poorer perceptions of physical health in Study 2. The results for cognitive reappraisal were mixed; positive associations with personal well-being and general health only emerged in Study 2. The results provide evidence that key models in affective science help explain differences in psychological and physical health within the throes of a real-world demanding context and thus offer targets to help facilitate health and resilience during the pandemic (and other crises).

Coping and emotion regulation theorists have proposed dynamic models in which these two factors, the person and the situation, interact over time to inform adaptation. In practice, however, researchers have tended to assume that particular regulatory strategies are consistently beneficial or maladaptive. We label this assumption the fallacy of uniform efficacy and contrast it with findings from a number of related literatures that have suggested the emergence of a broader but as yet poorly defined construct that we refer to as regulatory flexibility. In this review, we articulate this broader construct and define both its features and limitations. Specifically, we propose a heuristic individual differences framework and review research on three sequential components of flexibility for which propensities and abilities vary: sensitivity to context, availability of a diverse repertoire of regulatory strategies, and responsiveness to feedback. We consider the methodological limitations of research on each component, review questions that future research on flexibility might address, and consider how the components might relate to each other and to broader conceptualizations about stability and change across persons and situations.","[{'authorId': '5188130', 'name': 'G.

It is unknown whether the degree of severity of anterior dysmorphology is proportionate to neurologic dysfunction. This knowledge is essential to guide future surgical treatment recommendations. Given the reported correlation of abnormal auditory processing with future language dysfunction and poorer academic performance in craniosynostosis patients, the present study aims to evaluate auditory processing in preoperative patients with moderate and severe metopic synostosis, and in control infants, to discern the neurologic risk carried by different severities of trigonocephaly. Methods: Thirty-eight infants underwent evaluation of auditory processing: nine patients with severe metopic synostosis, seven with moderate metopic synostosis, and 22 controls. Brain activity was recorded by electroencephalography while the participants listened to language-based stimuli. Electroencephalographic data were analyzed to extract event-related potentials evoked by the speech sounds. Results: Severe metopic synostosis patients demonstrated significantly attenuated event-related potential responses in the left frontal scalp region overlying the left frontal lobe compared with controls (p < 0.05). The moderate metopic synostosis patients did not show significantly different language processing compared to the control infants or the severe metopic synostosis patients in the frontal scalp region. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that untreated severe metopic synostosis is associated with reduced language response in the frontal cortex. Less severe (moderate) forms are indeterminate, and mild forms do not show calculable irregularity by the event-related potential method of analysis.

Our model is differentiated from earlier characterizations of emotional labor in that we propose that the phenomenon begins with energy generation instead of energy depletion; and is neither a one-way nor a one-by-one service episode. We further proffer that the intra-psychic processes embedded in emotional labor represent a form of social self-regulation that impacts across multiple levels within service organizations.

Problems with social emotional functioning are an important part of eating disorder psychopathology.


AIM
This study aimed to propose a model of social emotional functioning before and during the illness and to explain the consequences for those involved.


METHOD
We propose a three-phase model of social and emotional processes as both causal and maintaining factors in anorexia nervosa. The predictions from this model are examined, and we consider the relevance for treatment.


RESULTS
The evidence base for the theoretical model is presented: Phase 1 describes causal predispositions and environments, Phase 2 notes the way in which the symptoms themselves impact on brain function and social cognition and Phase 3 explains the reactions of close others.


CONCLUSIONS
A three-phase model including interpersonal and socio-emotional elements can be used to shape and plan treatment interventions. Understanding causal chains and consequences can give a rationale for change and frame therapeutic interventions.","[{'authorId': '144107180', 'name': 'J.

fear of falling (FOF) is a major health problem among the elderly living in communities, present in older people who have fallen but also in older people who have never experienced a fall. The aims of this study were 4-fold: first, to study methods to measure FOF; second, to study the prevalence of FOF among fallers and non-fallers; third, to identify factors related to FOF; and last, to investigate the relationship between FOF and possible consequences among community-dwelling older persons.


METHODS
several databases were systematically searched, and selected articles were cross-checked for other relevant publications.


RESULTS
a systematic review identified 28 relevant studies among the community-dwelling elderly. Due to the many different kinds of measurements used, the reported prevalence of FOF varied between 3 and 85%. The main risk factors for developing FOF are at least one fall, being female and being older. The main consequences were identified as a decline in physical and mental performance, an increased risk of falling and progressive loss of health-related quality of life.


CONCLUSION
this review shows that there is great variation in the reported prevalence of FOF in older people and that there are multiple associated factors. Knowledge of risk factors of FOF may be useful in developing multidimensional strategies to decrease FOF and improve quality of life. However, the only identified modifiable risk factor of FOF is a previous fall. In order to measure the impact of interventions, a uniform measurement strategy for FOF should be adopted, and follow-up studies should be conducted.","[{'authorId': '48940938', 'name': 'A.

This meta-analysis consolidated data from 17 studies (published prior to August 2017) that examined the cognitive, behavioral and psychological outcomes of children (n = 666; aged ≤19 yrs) with metopic synostosis. Hedges’g (gw) effect sizes compared the outcomes of samples with metopic synostosis (unoperated, operated) to healthy controls or normative data and, where available, the prevalence of problems/disorders was calculated. Children with unoperated metopic synostosis performed significantly worse than their healthy peers on measures of: general cognition (gw = −.38), motor functioning, (gw = −.81), and verbal (gw = −.82) and visuospatial (gw = −.92) abilities. Children with operated metopic synostosis performed significantly worse on measures of motor functioning (gw = −.45), visuospatial skills (gw = −.32), attention (gw = −.50), executive functioning (gw = −.36), arithmetic ability (gw = −.37), and behavior (gw = −.34). Cognitive, behavioral, and psychological problems were prevalent, but variable. Overall, the cognitive, behavioral, and psychological outcomes of children with metopic synostosis are generally worse than their healthy peers, regardless of surgical status. However, research is sparse, samples small, controls are rarely recruited, and the severity of metopic synostosis often not stated. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that children with metopic synostosis are likely to experience a variety of negative outcomes and should therefore receive ongoing monitoring and support.","[{'authorId': '144059512', 'name': 'A.

Neuroimaging has implicated the left posterior lateral prefrontal cortex (pLPFC) as a key neural substrate of response selection (Dux et al., 2006, 2009; Ivanoff et al., 2009). For example, activity in left pLPFC tracks improvements in response selection efficiency typically observed following training (Dux et al., 2009). To date, however, there has been no causal evidence that pLPFC contributes directly to sensory-motor training effects, or the operations through which training occurs. Moreover, the left hemisphere lateralization of this operation remains controversial (Jiang and Kanwisher, 2003; Sigman and Dehaene, 2008; Verbruggen et al., 2010). We used anodal (excitatory), cathodal (inhibitory), and sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to left and right pLPFC and measured participants' performance on high and low response selection load tasks after different amounts of training. Both anodal and cathodal stimulation of the left pLPFC disrupted training effects for the high load condition relative to sham. No disruption was found for the low load and right pLPFC stimulation conditions. The findings implicate the left pLPFC in both response selection and training effects. They also suggest that training improves response selection efficiency by fine-tuning activity in pLPFC relating to sensory-motor translations.","[{'authorId': '5636392', 'name': 'H.

Stable maternal and dyadic behavior is critical to sustain infants' development of an adaptive social stress response, but the association between infants' interactive style and social stress response has received scant attention in previous literature. In the present article, overtime stability of infant, maternal, and dyadic behaviors was measured across 2 social stress (i.e., Face-to-Face Still-Face, FFSF) exposures, separated by 15 days. Moreover, infant, maternal, and dyadic behaviors were simultaneously assessed as predictors of infants' social stress to both FFSF exposures. Eighty-one mother-infant dyads underwent the FFSF twice, at 6 months (Exposure 1: the first social stress) and at 6 months and 15 days (Exposure 2: repeated social stress). Infant and mother behavior and dyadic synchrony were microanalytically coded. Overall, individual behavioral stability emerged between FFSF exposures. Infants' response to the first stress was predicted by infant behavior during Exposure 1 Play. Infants' response to the repeated social stress was predicted by infants' response to the first exposure to the Still-Face and by infants' behavior and dyadic synchrony during Exposure 2 Play. Findings reveal stability for individual, but not for dyadic, behavior between 2 social stress exposures at 6 months. Infants' response to repeated social stress was predicted by infants' earlier stress response, infants' own behavior in play, and dyadic synchrony.

Methods: 70 fibromyalgia (FM) patients, 56 chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients and 72 healthy controls were assessed within a general hospital setting, using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory and Symptom Interpretation Questionnaire. Three-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests were used for inter-group comparisons, followed by multivariate correlation, covariate analysis and linear regression. Results: Alexithymia, somatization, depression, anxiety and hostility scores were significantly higher in FM patients relative to CLBP patients and healthy controls (P < 0.05). Alexithymia was linked to psychological attributions in FM patients and to somatic attributions in CLBP patients. Psychological attributions, the number of symptoms and difficulty in describing emotions were related to increased anxiety in FM patients. Depression, anxiety and somatization were significantly increased in subjects with high alexithymia scores in the FM group. There was no difference between groups regarding causal attributions. Conclusions: Causal attributions do not seem to have distinctive features between functional somatic syndromes like FM and CLBP, though differences might exist between groups as to the effects of coexisting psychological distress symptoms like anxiety and depression.","[{'authorId': '5920820', 'name': 'V.

Although surprisingly common, anthropomorphism is not invariant. This article describes a theory to explain when people are likely to anthropomorphize and when they are not, focused on three psychological determinants--the accessibility and applicability of anthropocentric knowledge (elicited agent knowledge), the motivation to explain and understand the behavior of other agents (effectance motivation), and the desire for social contact and affiliation (sociality motivation). This theory predicts that people are more likely to anthropomorphize when anthropocentric knowledge is accessible and applicable, when motivated to be effective social agents, and when lacking a sense of social connection to other humans. These factors help to explain why anthropomorphism is so variable; organize diverse research; and offer testable predictions about dispositional, situational, developmental, and cultural influences on anthropomorphism.

Emotional eating in children has been related to the consumption of energy-dense foods and obesity, but the development of emotional eating in young children is poorly understood.


OBJECTIVES
We evaluated whether emotional eating can be induced in 5-7-y-old children in the laboratory and assessed whether parental use of overly controlling feeding practices at 3-5 y of age predicts a greater subsequent tendency for children to eat under conditions of mild stress at ages 5-7 y.


DESIGN
Forty-one parent-child dyads were recruited to participate in this longitudinal study, which involved parents and children being observed consuming a standard lunch, completing questionnaire measures of parental feeding practices, participating in a research procedure to induce child emotion (or a control procedure), and observing children's consumption of snack foods.


RESULTS
Children at ages 5-7 y who were exposed to a mild emotional stressor consumed significantly more calories from snack foods in the absence of hunger than did children in a control group. Parents who reported the use of more food as a reward and restriction of food for health reasons with their children at ages 3-5 y were more likely to have children who ate more under conditions of negative emotion at ages 5-7 y.


CONCLUSIONS
Parents who overly control children's food intake may unintentionally teach children to rely on palatable foods to cope with negative emotions. Additional research is needed to evaluate the implications of these findings for children's food intake and weight outside of the laboratory setting.

The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the two tasks was 100, 300, and 900 ms. Earlier research observed larger age deficits in emotional facial discrimination for negative (angry) than for positive (happy) faces (Baena et al., 2010). Thus, we predicted that older adults would show decreased attentional efficiency in carrying out dual-task processing on the P1 (a component linked to amygdalar modulation of visual perception; Rotshtein et al., 2010). Both younger and older groups showed significantly higher P1 amplitudes at 100- and 300-ms SOAs than at the 900-ms SOA, and this suggests that both age groups could process Task 2 faces without central attention. Also, younger adults showed significantly higher P1 activations for angry than for happy faces, but older adults showed no difference.

This study examined the direct effect of childhood trauma on suicidal ideation on the one hand and whether school bullying victimisation and Internet addiction mediate the association between childhood trauma and suicidal ideation on the other hand. Methods This school-based mental health survey was carried out in Qinghai Province in Northwest China in December 2019. We employed standardised questionnaires to collect sociodemographic and target mental health outcomes. Hierarchical multiple logistic regression and structural equation modelling were performed for the data analyses. Results This study included 5864 university students.

Purpose
Drawing on the self-determination theory, the assemblage theory and customer experience literature, this paper aims to develop a framework to understand motivational customer experiences with chatbots.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper uses a multimethod approach to examine the interaction between individuals and airlines’ chatbots. Three components of self-determined interaction with the chatbot (competence, autonomy and relatedness) and five components of the customer–chatbot experience (sensory, intellectual, affective, behavioral and social) are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.


Findings
The findings confirm the direct influence of self-determined interaction on customer experience and the direct effects of these two constructs on participants’ attitudes toward and satisfaction with the chatbot. The model also supports the mediating roles of customer experience and attitude toward the chatbot.


Practical implications
This paper offers managers a broad understanding of individuals’ interactions with chatbots through three elements: motivation to use chatbots, experiential responses and individuals’ valuation of whether the interactions have amplified (or limited) the outcomes obtained from the experience.


Originality/value
This paper contributes to the hospitality and tourism literature with a hybrid approach that reflects on current theoretical developments regarding human- and interaction-centric interpretations of customer experience with chatbots.

The Metacognitive Affective Model of SRL (MASRL) considers the relationships between metacognition, motivation, and affect. Notably, it provides a theoretical framework to understand how subjective experiences (metacognition and affect) change self-regulation from a top-down to a bottom-up process and vice versa.


AIMS
The study examines the link between metacognition and emotional regulation in the everyday problem-solving performance of children in elementary school. Emotional regulation is studied from the angle of coping strategies.


SAMPLE(S)
Participants were 269 children aged 8.17-11.66 years old (Mean = 9.8, SD = 0.88).


METHODS
They completed a French version of the 'The Metacognitive Experiences Questionnaire' developed by Efklides and Petkaki (2005, Learning and Instruction, 15, 415) and the Kidcope (Spirito et al., 1988, Journal of Pediatric Psychology, 13, 555) to measure the coping strategies before and after solving the everyday problem taken from 'The Everyday Cognition Battery' (Allaire & Marsiske, 1999, Psychology and Aging, 14, 261).


RESULTS
The results indicate that several metacognitive experiences are significantly linked to solving everyday problems, in particular the feeling of difficulty. The other results of our study show that no single coping strategy was linked to problem-solving performance but that the three coping strategies (i.e., emotional outburst, blaming others, and magical thinking) are linked to metacognitive experiences.


CONCLUSIONS
The results highlight the importance of emotional regulation on cognitive performance, both before and after solving the problem. These findings have important implications for teachers, who should be aware of the effect that a feeling of difficulty may have on solving a given problem.","[{'authorId': '5192223', 'name': 'Valérie Pennequin'}, {'authorId': '150103662', 'name': 'F.

Almost daily one encounters new books, journal articles, and conferences that are directed toward this goal. We are moving psychology from traditional psychoanalytic language and conceptual frameworks to new vocabularies of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamic systems as we seek to describe “process” in the therapeutic interaction. Discussion has moved from explanations of change in the psychotherapeutic process as based on insight, as the unconscious becomes conscious through effective interpretation, to explanations described in terms of shifts in the organization of consciousness. These shifts in consciousness are brought about through moments of shared awareness—Tronick’s hypothesized dyadic states of consciousness—between patient and therapist as they experience “moments of meeting” within their “intersubjective environment.” With these changes in explanation, we are aligning our thinking with new information about the way the brain works in its construction of perception and memory and the way brain morphology becomes shaped by early experience.

On March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared the state of alarm to limit viral transmission. During such state, citizens must stay confined at home with few justified exceptions. This whole situation drastically changed the life of the population, which can cause a wide range of psychosocial impacts. This study explored the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population (N = 3055) during the first stages of the outbreak in Spain, as well as their anxiety, stress and depression levels. We also examined the extent to which the following variables were associated to participants’ mental health: (1) demographics; (2) degree of concern about the pandemic; (3) environmental conditions during the home confinement, (4) changes in daily life as a consequence of the pandemic; (5) contact with the COVID-19 disease; (6) actual and perceived severity of the crisis; (7) information about the COVID-19, (8) perceived health status and (9) leisure activities conducted within the last 24 h. Our results show that Spanish consider the current COVID-19 health crisis as fairly severe, and the majority felt that the COVID-19 crisis had greatly impacted on their daily life, including changes in their daily routines and cancelation of important activities. About 36% of the participants reported moderate to severe psychological impact, 25% showed mild to severe levels of anxiety, 41% reported depressive symptoms, and 41% felt stressed. Women, young, and those who that lost their job during the health crisis showed the strongest negative psychological symptoms. What worried Spaniards the most was the likelihood of suffering an economic crisis derived from the pandemic. We found factors associated with better mental health, such as being satisfied with the information received about the health crisis, conducting leisure activities, and the perception of being in good health. These findings can be used to design psychological interventions to help coping with COVID-19 pandemic, both in Spain and other countries.","[{'authorId': '1402168933', 'name': 'R.

The infant continuously faces a climate of negative affect that disrupts the interactive experience of the infant and the mother. This article presents findings on the impact of maternal depression on the infant affective state and the specific interactive patterns associated with infant affect regulation. Mother-infant interactions were studied using microanalytic, second-by-second methods in the laboratory and also by using naturalistic home observations. The empirical findings highlight the impact of maternal depression on the infant affective state and on the capacity for repairing states of miscoordination. The impact is seen not only in severely and acutely depressed mothers, but in mothers who have only high levels of depressive symptoms. These infants develop negative affective states that bias their interactions with others and exacerbate their affective problems. Further findings with regard to gender-specific effects show that male infants are more vulnerable than female infants to maternal depression. The findings point out the need for therapeutic interventions that focus on the mother-infant dyad and infant affective state in the treatment of maternal depression.","[{'authorId': '83022844', 'name': 'E.

Tai Chi and Yoga (Tai Chi/Yoga), as the most widely practiced mind–body exercises, have shown positive outcomes of mental health. To date, no systematic review regarding the long-lasting effects of Tai Chi/Yoga on HRV parameters and perceived stress has been conducted. Objective: To critically evaluate the existing literature on this topic. Methods: Five electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, SportDiscus and Cochrane Library) were searched from the start of the research project to July 2018. Study selection, data extraction, and study quality assessment were independently carried out by two reviewers. The potentially identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) reported the useful quantitative data that were included only for meta-analysis. Results: meta-analysis of 17 medium-to-high quality RCTs showed significantly beneficial effects on HRV parameters (normalized low-frequency, Hedge’s g = −0.39, 95% CI −0.39 to −0.56, p < 0.001, I2 = 11.62%; normalized high-frequency, Hedge’s g = 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to −0.52, p < 0.001, I2 = 0%; low-frequency to high-frequency ratio, Hedge’s g = −0.58, 95% CI −0.81 to −0.35, p < 0.001, I2 = 53.78%) and stress level (Hedge’s g = −0.80, 95% CI −1.17 to −0.44, p < 0.001, I2 = 68.54%).

Until now, the secondary impact of COVID-19 has been little estimated. Our aim was to investigate factors underlying quality of life (QOL) during COVID-19 lockdown among a healthy population, while QOL reduction expands vulnerability to the pandemic secondary impact. Methods: During the spring lockdown in Israel, 571 healthy adults completed a survey that included standard measurements for psychological distress, participation in daily life activities, a sense of social connectedness, resilience, and QOL. Results: We found a high level of psychological distress, significant reduction in participation dimensions, and in QOL (psychical, psychological, and social). These indices were even lower among women, younger adults, and the unemployed. Path analysis demonstrated that psychological distress, participation dimensions, social connectedness, and self-efficacy explained QOL, while participation dimensions were found to be the mediators. Conclusions: The COVID-19 has had a wide impact on the general population, with the potential for negative secondary impacts. Women, young adults, and the unemployed are at high risk for secondary effects.

Stress involves two-way communication between the brain and the cardiovascular, immune, and other systems via neural and endocrine mechanisms. Beyond the ""flight-or-fight"" response to acute stress, there are events in daily life that produce a type of chronic stress and lead over time to wear and tear on the body (""allostatic load""). Yet, hormones associated with stress protect the body in the short-run and promote adaptation (""allostasis""). The brain is a target of stress, and the hippocampus was the first brain region, besides the hypothalamus, to be recognized as a target of glucocorticoids. Stress and stress hormones produce both adaptive and maladaptive effects on this brain region throughout the life course. Early life events influence life-long patterns of emotionality and stress responsiveness and alter the rate of brain and body aging. The hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex undergo stress-induced structural remodeling, which alters behavioral and physiological responses. As an adjunct to pharmaceutical therapy, social and behavioral interventions such as regular physical activity and social support reduce the chronic stress burden and benefit brain and body health and resilience.","[{'authorId': '2301440', 'name': 'B.

Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions.

Studies indicate few children achieve recommended levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during their youth sport involvement, and habitual levels of MVPA are below the recommended 60 min per day.

Seventy three male youth sport footballers (Mean age = 11.66 ± 1.62) completed a multisection questionnaire assessing their perceptions of the social environment created in youth sport (autonomy supportive and controlling) and motivation towards their football participation (autonomous and controlled). Intensity of PA during youth sport was measured using accelerometers (GT3X, ActiGraph). Results supported a model in which perceptions of autonomy support significantly and positively predicted autonomous motivation towards football, which in turn significantly and positively predicted youth sport MVPA (% time). A significant indirect effect was observed for perceptions of autonomy support on youth sport %MVPA via autonomous motivation. Results have implications for optimising MVPA engagement during youth sport and increasing daily MVPA towards recommended and health-enhancing levels on youth sport days.","[{'authorId': '6338957', 'name': 'S.

08ef3511fcc32419f970f075c54c966eab2f69e9,"BACKGROUND
Heart rate, measured as beat-to-beat intervals, is not constant and varies in time. This property is known as heart rate variability (HRV) and it has been investigated in several diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI). The main hypothesis is that HRV embed some physiological processes that are characteristics of regulatory systems acting on cardiovascular system. It is possible to quantify such a complex behaviour starting from RR intervals properties itself with the idea that any event affecting the cardiac regulatory system significantly will disrupt and change HRV. In this article, we first review different methodologies previously published to calculate HRV indexes. We then searched literature for studies published on HRV and MI and we derive a metanalysis where published data allow calculation of composite outcomes.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Articles considered eligible for metanalysis were original retrospective/prospective studies investigating HRV after myocardial infarction, reporting follow up for mortality or significant cardiac complications. Random effect model was used to assessed for homogeneity and calculate composite outcome and its 95% confidence interval (CI).


RESULTS
21 studies were identified as eligible for subsequent analysis. Among these studies 5 large trials were eligible for metanalysis: ""they included 3489 total post-MI patient with an overall mortality of 125/577 (21.7%) in patients with standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) less than 70 msec compared to 235/2912 (8.1%) in patients with SDNN > 70 msec"". Metanalysis demonstrates that, after a MI, patients with SDNN below 70 msec on 24 hours ECG recording have almost 4 times more chance to die in the next 3 years.


CONCLUSION
Results from metanalysis and other studies considered (but not included in the analysis) are consistent with the final finding, that a disrupted HRV dynamic (low SDNN) is associated with higher adverse outcome. In this perspective, although data are strongly positive for a direct relationship between SDNN and mortality after MI, SDNN value must be considered carefully on a single patient. The primary purpose of the metanalysis was to address whether studies conducted on HRV and MI were consistent rather than established a cut-off for SDNN. HRV is simple, non invasive and relatively not expensive to obtain.","[{'authorId': '14407949', 'name': 'E. Buccelletti'}, {'authorId': '2056383', 'name': 'E.

Using hierarchical regression analysis to examine this issue, this study investigates teachers’ perceptions of the relationships among the emotional job demands, emotional intelligence, emotional labour strategies and teaching satisfaction, with a particular focus on the moderating role of emotional intelligence. The results of a survey of 1281 Chinese teachers reveal that teachers’ perceptions of emotional job demands and emotional intelligence significantly predict the three emotional labour strategies. Emotional intelligence significantly moderates the impact of emotional job demands on surface acting and expression of naturally felt emotion but not deep acting. Even after controlling for emotional job demands and emotional intelligence, deep acting and expression of naturally felt emotion still have a positive influence on teachers’ teaching satisfaction.

The investigators examined the frequency of religious coping among older medical inpatients, the characteristics of those who use it, and the relation between this behavior and depression.


METHOD
The subjects were 850 men aged 65 years and over, without psychiatric diagnoses, who were consecutively admitted to the medical or neurological services of a southern Veterans Administration medical center. Religious coping was assessed with a three-item index. Depressive symptoms were assessed by self-rating (the Geriatric Depression Scale) and observer rating (the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression).


RESULTS
One out of every five patients reported that religious thought and/or activity was the most important strategy used to cope with illness. Variables that were associated with religious coping included black race, older age, being retired, religious affiliation, high level of social support, infrequent alcohol use, a prior history of psychiatric problems, and higher cognitive functioning. Depressive symptoms were inversely related to religious coping, an association which persisted after other sociodemographic and health correlates were controlled. When 202 men were reevaluated during their subsequent hospital admissions an average of 6 months later, religious coping was the only baseline variable that predicted lower depression scores at follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that religious coping is a common behavior that is inversely related to depression in hospitalized elderly men.","[{'authorId': '144971229', 'name': 'H.

09aaad0b11ec3ac4d5555a9501161257ca9ddbf3,"Theoretical and Philosophical Foundations of DBT. A central dialectic between acceptance and change lies at the heart of DBT. In developing DBT, Linehan initially attempted to apply behavioural theory and change strategies to clients presenting with BPD and suicidal behaviour. She experienced several difficulties in these early stages of treatment development. Clients' were frequently non-collaborative in-session, did not practise agreed homework assignments and often did not return for subsequent treatment sessions at all. Linehan hypothesised that these 'therapy-interfering behaviours' arose because the clients experienced the strong focus on changing emotions, thoughts and behaviours as invalidating. Indeed, as clients often believe they are incapable of change, the whole notion of a treatment based on change is fundamentally invalidating. In response to these concerns, she searched for a philosophy / theoretical approach that strongly emphasised acceptance. Zen principles and practise underpin the acceptance-based components of DBT. To house these two contrasting approaches, Linehan uses dialectical philosophy. The following sections of this paper discuss these three foundations of the treatment in more detail. Pushing for Change: Behavioural Theory & Problem-Solving DBT like 'first wave' cognitive -behavioural treatments emphasises behavioural theory, rather than cognitive theory common to second wave treatments such as Cognitive Therapy for depression (Hayes, Follette & Linehan, 2004). Like 'first wave' therapies 'third wave' therapies, of which DBT was perhaps one of the first, take a radical behaviourist perspective to mental phenomenon. Thus, any response of an organism, such as thinking, emoting, sensing, as well as overt motor behaviour constitutes behaviour. The emphasis on behavioural theory in DBT influences the treatments approach to diagnosis and case conceptualisation. Consistent with a radical behaviourist stance, DBT views the diagnostic criteria of BPD (DSM-IV, 2000, p. 710) as simply descriptions of the overt and covert behaviours of the client and, crucially, that when these behaviours stop the diagnosis ceases to exist. Indeed, to a radical behaviourist: 'A self or personality is at best a repertoire of behaviour imparted by an organized set of contingencies' (Skinner, 1974, p. 167). This approach contrasts with other theoretical models of personality and personality disorder that consider the diagnostic criteria as symptoms of an underlying 'borderline personality' organisation. A behavioural approach to diagnosis provides a more hopeful perspective to clients. In pre-treatment, DBT therapists describe the behavioural understanding of the diagnosis, identify behavioural targets for treatment and describe and demonstrate how DBT delivers behavioural change. Outlining that changing both their overt and covert behaviours removes the diagnosis orients clients towards recovery. DBT emphasises classical and operant conditioning in case conceptualisation. DBT therapists conduct behavioural analyses to comprehend both the classically conditioned links in the chain of events leading up to problematic behaviour and the functional (operant) consequences of the behaviour. For example, a client with a history of childhood sexual abuse frequently experienced increases in guilt and suicidal ideation whilst preparing for bed. Analysis of the increases in ideation revealed a classically conditioned association between going to bed and thoughts of suicide. The client learnt this association in childhood as the perpetrator would tell her she deserved to die during the abusive episodes, which occurred in her bed, for which she experienced intense guilt. In the present, following the increases in suicidal ideation, the client would search for self-harm implements. As she began to search, she experienced relief from guilt as she now believed that she was doing 'the right thing'. …","[{'authorId': '145929259', 'name': 'M.

Little is known about the neurophysiological underpinnings of social pain. We addressed this issue using intracranial electroencephalography in 15 patients performing a ball game where inclusion and exclusion blocks were alternated. Time-frequency analyses showed an increase in power of theta-band oscillations during exclusion in the anterior insula (AI) and posterior insula, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC), and the fusiform ""face area"" (FFA). Interestingly, the AI showed an initial fast response to exclusion but the signal rapidly faded out. Activity in the sACC gradually increased and remained significant thereafter. This suggests that the AI may signal social pain by detecting emotional distress caused by the exclusion, whereas the sACC may be linked to the learning aspects of social pain. Theta activity in the FFA was time-locked to the observation of a player poised to exclude the participant, suggesting that the FFA encodes the social value of faces. Taken together, our findings suggest that theta activity represents the neural signature of social pain. The time course of this signal varies across regions important for processing emotional features linked to social information.","[{'authorId': '5476684', 'name': 'Irene Cristofori'}, {'authorId': '46979318', 'name': 'L.

A dimension of negatively oriented affect within oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms, which has been described as irritability, has been shown to predict depression and anxiety. Related constructs have been linked to temperament and personality constructs. However, only a few studies have examined the prediction from irritability within ODD to psychopathology or personality outcomes. Further, no studies have investigated whether irritability distinguishes among classes of youth.


METHODS
Data from a clinic-referred sample of 7-12-year-old boys followed up to age 18 were used. Measures included structured clinical interviews with parents through adolescence, and youth self-report of depression and personality domains at age 18.


RESULTS
Variable-oriented analyses found predictive links between irritability and outcomes of depression, anxiety, and Neuroticism. Latent classes of youth were distinguished by the presence or absence of irritability symptoms. Youth classified by irritability symptoms at baseline were significantly more likely to show anxiety and depression through adolescence and depression and Neuroticism at 18. No relationship was observed for the other of the Big Five personality factors.


CONCLUSION
Irritability symptoms within ODD distinguish youth at risk for persisting problems with internalizing disorders and Neuroticism into adulthood. The findings are suggestive of a model in which the early emergence of irritability marks life-course risks for specific types of psychopathology and personality problems.","[{'authorId': '38810467', 'name': 'Jeffrey D.

Consequently, examining individual differences in the habitual use of emotion-regulation strategies has considerable potential to inform models of this debilitating disorder. The aim of the current study was to identify cognitive processes that may be associated with the use of emotion-regulation strategies and to elucidate their relation to depression. Depression has been found to be associated with difficulties in cognitive control and, more specifically, with difficulties inhibiting the processing of negative material. We used a negative affective priming task to assess the relations among inhibition and individual differences in the habitual use of rumination, reappraisal, and expressive suppression in clinically depressed, formerly depressed, and never-depressed participants. We found that depressed participants exhibited the predicted lack of inhibition when processing negative material. Moreover, within the group of depressed participants, reduced inhibition of negative material was associated with greater rumination. Across the entire sample, reduced inhibition of negative material was related to less use of reappraisal and more use of expressive suppression. Finally, within the formerly depressed group, less use of reappraisal, more use of rumination, and greater expressive suppression were related to higher levels of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that individual differences in the use of emotion-regulation strategies play an important role in depression, and that deficits in cognitive control are related to the use of maladaptive emotion-regulation strategies in this disorder.","[{'authorId': '3123613', 'name': 'J.

Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the dynamic impacts of OCB on the performance of megaprojects with the assistance of a system dynamic model. Four causal feedback loops and a stock-flow diagram were developed to illustrate the dynamic influencing mechanism, and three distinct policies quantitatively simulated the possible impacts arising from the changes of OCB on the whole system and, specifically, on the performance megaproject. The results show that an increase in the AIRPP (actual increasing rate of potential promotion) exerts significant influence on the improvement in OCB and the performance of megaprojects. The higher the AIRPP in the multi-policy scenario, the higher the OCB and the performance.

Significant research efforts have been devoted to determining the clinical potential of tDCS in humans. Despite the promising results obtained with tDCS in basic and clinical neuroscience, further progress has been impeded by a lack of clarity on international regulatory pathways. Therefore, a group of research and clinician experts on tDCS were convened to review the research and clinical use of tDCS. This report reviews the regulatory status of tDCS and summarizes the results according to research, off-label, and compassionate use of tDCS in the following countries: Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Portugal, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US. Research use, off label treatment, and compassionate use of tDCS are employed in most of the countries reviewed in this study. It is critical that a global or local effort is organized to pursue definite evidence to either approve and regulate or restrict the use of tDCS in clinical practice on the basis of adequate randomized controlled treatment trials.","[{'authorId': '1762504', 'name': 'F.

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixedlength vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder‐Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.","[{'authorId': '1979489', 'name': 'Kyunghyun Cho'}, {'authorId': '3158246', 'name': 'Bart van Merrienboer'}, {'authorId': '1854385', 'name': 'Çaglar Gülçehre'}, {'authorId': '3335364', 'name': 'Dzmitry Bahdanau'}, {'authorId': '2076086', 'name': 'Fethi Bougares'}, {'authorId': '144518416', 'name': 'Holger Schwenk'}, {'authorId': '1751762', 'name': 'Yoshua Bengio'}]",19260.0,,34.0,Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder–Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation,2014.0

Conversely, dysfunctional affective brain processing can lead to life-threatening risk behaviors (e.g., addiction) and emotion imbalance (e.g., mood disorders). The state of sleep deprivation continues to be associated with maladaptive emotional regulation, leading to exaggerated neural and behavioral reactivity to negative, aversive experiences. However, such detrimental consequences are paradoxically aligned with the perplexing antidepressant benefit of sleep deprivation, elevating mood in a proportion of patients with major depression. Nevertheless, it remains unknown how sleep loss alters the dynamics of brain and behavioral reactivity to rewarding, positive emotional experiences. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), here we demonstrate that sleep deprivation amplifies reactivity throughout human mesolimbic reward brain networks in response to pleasure-evoking stimuli. In addition, this amplified reactivity was associated with enhanced connectivity in early primary visual processing pathways and extended limbic regions, yet with a reduction in coupling with medial frontal and orbitofrontal regions. These neural changes were accompanied by a biased increase in the number of emotional stimuli judged as pleasant in the sleep-deprived group, the extent of which exclusively correlated with activity in mesolimbic regions. Together, these data support a view that sleep deprivation not only is associated with enhanced reactivity toward negative stimuli, but imposes a bidirectional nature of affective imbalance, associated with amplified reward-relevant reactivity toward pleasure-evoking stimuli also. Such findings may offer a neural foundation on which to consider interactions between sleep loss and emotional reactivity in a variety of clinical mood disorders.","[{'authorId': '1816334', 'name': 'N.

0c432b171e52c86203843e200260f443a72ecaed,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants’ willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results Three broad themes: ‘Understanding of chatbots’, ‘AI hesitancy’ and ‘Motivations for health chatbots’ were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13–0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60–0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08–8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77–4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13–3.25]. Conclusion Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients’ concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients’ perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.","[{'authorId': '8509934', 'name': 'T.

0c6d95f952631edaa13f1731d0381930296259da,"—This article provides an overview of current research on emotional intelligence. Although it has been defined in many ways, we focus on the four-branch model by Mayer and Salovey (1997), which characterizes emotional intelligence as a set of four related abilities: perceiving , using, understanding, and managing emotions. The theory provides a useful framework for studying individual differences in abilities related to processing emotional information. Despite measurement obstacles, the evidence in favor of emotional intelligence is accumulating. Emotional intelligence predicts success in important domains , among them personal and work relationships. In the past decade, emotional intelligence has generated an enormous amount of interest both within and outside the field of psychology. The concept has received considerable media attention , and many readers of this article may have already encountered one or more definitions of emotional intelligence. The present discussion, however, focuses on the scientific study of emotional intelligence rather than on popularizations of the concept. Mayer and Salovey (1997; see also Salovey & Mayer, 1990) proposed a model of emotional intelligence to address a growing need in psychology for a framework to organize the study of individual differences in abilities related to emotion. This theoretical model motivated the creation of the first ability-based tests of emotional intelligence. Although findings remain preliminary , emotional intelligence has been shown to have an effect on important life outcomes such as forming satisfying personal relationships and achieving success at work. Perhaps most importantly, ability-based tests of emotional intelligence reliably measure skills that are relatively distinct from commonly assessed aspects of personality. Emotional intelligence brings together the fields of emotions and intelligence by viewing emotions as useful sources of information that help one to make sense of and navigate the social environment. Salovey and Mayer (1990, p. 189) proposed a formal definition of emotional intelligence as ''The ability to monitor one's own and others' feelings, to discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide one's thinking and action.'' Later this definition was refined and broken down into four proposed abilites that are distinct yet related: perceiving, using, understanding , and managing emotions (Mayer & Salovey, 1997). The first branch of emotional intelligence, perceiving emotions , is the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts. It also includes the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions may represent the most basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as …","[{'authorId': '2252211367', 'name': 'Peter Salovey'}, {'authorId': '2238820606', 'name': 'Daisy Grewal'}, {'authorId': '2252396566', 'name': 'Johnson'}, {'authorId': '2251971142', 'name': 'Robinson'}]",647.0,,12.0,The Science of Emotional Intelligence the Four-branch Model of Emotional Intelligence Current Directions in Psychological Science,

This paper reviews interdisciplinary perspectives on interoception, with the goal of presenting a unified perspective from diverse fields such as neuroscience, clinical practice, and contemplative studies. It is hoped that this integrative effort will advance our understanding of how interoception determines well-being, and identify the central challenges to such understanding. To this end, we introduce an expanded taxonomy of interoceptive processes, arguing that many of these processes can be understood through an emerging predictive coding model for mind–body integration. The model, which describes the tension between expected and felt body sensation, parallels contemplative theories, and implicates interoception in a variety of affective and psychosomatic disorders. We conclude that maladaptive construal of bodily sensations may lie at the heart of many contemporary maladies, and that contemplative practices may attenuate these interpretative biases, restoring a person’s sense of presence and agency in the world.","[{'authorId': '6388953', 'name': 'N.

These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals. In recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases. METHODS We searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population. RESULTS Among 1,364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria. Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings. These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation. Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes.

In addition, we measured popularity at zero acquaintance and 3 months later. We analyzed the data using inferential network analysis (temporal exponential random graph modeling, TERGM) accounting for self-organizing network forces. People high in narcissism were popular, but increased less in popularity over time than people lower in narcissism.

Personal characteristics of teachers are important predictors of turnover. Attributes of teachers’ schools, including organizational characteristics, student body composition, and resources (instructional spending and teacher salaries), are also key moderators. The evidence suggests that attrition from teaching is (a) not necessarily “healthy” turnover, (b) influenced by various personal and professional factors that change across teachers’ career paths, (c) more strongly moderated by characteristics of teachers’ work conditions than previously noted in the literature, and (d) a problem that can be addressed through policies and initiatives. Though researchers have utilized a number of national and state databases and have applied economic labor theory to questions related to teacher attrition, the authors argue that better longitudinal data on teacher career paths and more nuanced theories are needed.","[{'authorId': '10729993', 'name': 'Geoffrey D.

Much of the content being posted and consumed online is multimodal. With billions of phones, tablets and PCs shipping today with built-in cameras and a host of new video-equipped wearables like Google Glass on the horizon, the amount of video on the Internet will only continue to increase. It has become increasingly difficult for researchers to keep up with this deluge of multimodal content, let alone organize or make sense of it. Mining useful knowledge from video is a critical need that will grow exponentially, in pace with the global growth of content. This is particularly important in sentiment analysis, as both service and product reviews are gradually shifting from unimodal to multimodal. We present a novel method to extract features from visual and textual modalities using deep convolutional neural networks. By feeding such features to a multiple kernel learning classifier, we significantly outperform the state of the art of multimodal emotion recognition and sentiment analysis on different datasets.","[{'authorId': '1746416', 'name': 'Soujanya Poria'}, {'authorId': '2204726', 'name': 'I.

Advances in machine learning, digital assistants, and natural language processing support such personal health conversations between machines and patients. Conversational artificial intelligence is the term used to describe this new capability. Gabby is a conversational agent, a software program that uses conversational artificial intelligence to interact with users through voice or text. Conversational agents are different from other software programs because they converse directly with people, and some data suggest that people respond to them psychologically as though they are human.2 Clinicians have contemplated the use of conversational agents in mental health care for decades, especially to improve access for underserved populations. Optimism is growing that conversational agents can now be deployed in mental health to automate some aspects of clinical assessment and treatment.

We argue that a human science is best achieved with the use of indexes, not diagnoses, to measure mental health. We present a brief history of diagnostic instruments and detail how a diagnosis is made. We show how use of diagnoses to measure mental health discounts much human suffering. They dichotomize the true range of feelings and emotions into crude either/or distinctions that do not reflect the reality of people's lives, and they often exclude suffering such as that due to loss or illness that does not meet medical model preconceptions about mental disorder. Using diagnoses to measure mental health presents a reified image of hidden disease knowable and manageable only by trained professionals--beyond the capacity of the suffering individuals to understand and control.","[{'authorId': '32000042', 'name': 'J.

However, there is a lack of research in this field. The aim was to describe how Swedish elementary school teachers experience their health, organizational and social work environment, and the psychosocial safety climate at the workplace, and especially differences and similarities between female and male teachers. Materials and methods: Data were collected with the COPSOQ, OLBI, UWES and PSC-12 from 478 elementary teachers, 81.0% of them women, from twenty schools. The response rate was 96.4%. Results: Teachers reported relatively good general health but experienced high stress, high work pace and emotional demands, low influence at work and a poor psychosocial safety climate. These factors were especially prominent among female teachers. Both women and men experienced good development possibilities and high work engagement. Conclusions: The results of this study can help us to develop a more sustainable work environment for female and male teachers. A more sustainable work environment might attract more people to the profession and incentivize existing teachers to remain in the profession.","[{'authorId': '48570446', 'name': 'Maria Boström'}, {'authorId': '6132202', 'name': 'Christina Björklund'}, {'authorId': '3982706', 'name': 'G.

The present study aimed to examine the precise contribution of the ACC to emotion‐modulated response inhibition by capitalizing on fine temporal resolution of the event‐related potentials (ERPs) and the recent advances in source localization. To this end, participants (N = 30) performed an indirect affective Go/Nogo task (i.e., unrelated to the emotional content of stimulation) that required the inhibition of a motor response to three types of visual stimuli: arousing negative (A−), neutral (N), and arousing positive (A+). Behavioral data revealed that participants made more commission errors to A+ than to N and A−. Electrophysiological data showed that a specific region of the ACC at the intersection of its dorsal and rostral subdivisions was significantly involved in the interaction between emotional processing and motor inhibition. Specifically, activity reflecting this interaction was observed in the P3 (but not in the N2) time range, and was greater during the inhibition of responses to A+ than to N and A−. Additionally, regression analyses showed that inhibition‐related activity within this ACC region was associated with the emotional content of the stimuli (its activity increased as stimulus valence was more positive), and also with behavioral performance (both with reaction times and commission errors). The present results provide additional data for understanding how, when, and where emotion interacts with response inhibition within the ACC.

Experience sampling methodology and daily diary (ESM/DD) research elicits repeated reports of immediate or very recent experiences from the same sample of people for several days or weeks. Experience sampling and diary methods were almost unheard of in organizational research 15 years ago, but the past decade has seen a rapid rise in their use. These methods are helpful in studying dynamic within-person processes involving affect, behavior, interpersonal interactions, work events, and other transient workplace phenomena over time. Assessing cross-level effects of traits or other stable features on within-person processes and reactivity is also possible with ESM/DD data. We provide an introduction to issues in designing and carrying out an ESM/DD study, including data collection choices and schedules, measures, technology, training and motivation of participants, and analysis of multilevel data. We offer best practice recommendations and refer readers to further resources for additional detail on conducting and analyzing ESM/DD research.

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being and health-compromising behaviors of adolescents (12–18 years) previously referred for mental health services. Data were collected (pre-pandemic n = 3712; pandemic n = 3197) from mental health agencies across Ontario, Canada using the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health assessment. Our findings revealed no increased incidence of witnessing domestic violence nor experiencing physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Further, there were no increases in the risk of self-harm and suicide, anxiety, or depression among our sample of clinically referred youth. Finally, results demonstrated no increase in problematic videogaming/internet use, disordered eating, or alcohol intoxication, and a decrease in cannabis use. Our findings add to the growing body of knowledge as to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and youth. Further, findings underscore the importance of understanding the nuanced impact of the pandemic on various subgroups of children, youth, and families and highlight the need for continued monitoring of outcomes for these children and youth.","[{'authorId': '49330852', 'name': 'S.

The current study investigated the additional impact of psychosocial factors (i.e., performance obstacles and facilitators) as well as psychological well-being (i.e., burnout and engagement) on success (i.e., academic performance). More specifically, our purpose was to show that, instead of directly affecting future performance, obstacles and facilitators exert an indirect effect via well-being. A total of 527 university students comprised the sample and filled out a questionnaire. We obtained their previous and future academic performance Grade Point Average (GPA) from the university's records. Structural equations modeling showed that the best predictor of future performance was the students’ previous performance. As expected, study engagement mediated the relationship between performance obstacles and facilitators on the one hand, and future performance on the other. Contrary to expectations, burnout did not predict future performance, although, it is significantly associated with the presence of obstacles and the absence of facilitators. Our results illustrate that, although “success breeds success” (i.e., the best predictor of future performance is past performance), positive psychological states like study engagement are also important in explaining future performance, at least more so than negative states like study burnout.","[{'authorId': '2040374', 'name': 'M.

We examined the frontocentral emotional positivity (FcEP), which is defined as a positive deflection in the waveforms elicited by emotional expressions relative to neutral faces early on in the time course of the ERP. The FcEP is thought to reflect enhanced early processing of emotional expressions. The results show that within the first 130 ms young adults show an FcEP to negative emotional expressions, whereas older adults show an FcEP to positive emotional expressions. These findings provide additional evidence that the age-related positivity effect in emotion processing can be traced to automatic processes that are evident very early in the processing of emotional facial expressions.","[{'authorId': '3218793', 'name': 'M.

A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of two nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFI) and nonnormed (FI) fit indexes. CFI avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for Bentler and Bonett's (1980) normed fit index (NFI). FI is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's non-normed fit index (NNFI) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFI. Asymptotically, CFI, FI, NFI, and a new index developed by Bollen are equivalent measures of comparative fit, whereas NNFI measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes.","[{'authorId': '2405956', 'name': 'P. Bentler'}]",22108.0,,26.0,Comparative fit indexes in structural models.,1990.0

Furthermore, emotions are inherently interpersonal. We learn what to feel from others, especially when we are children. We “catch” other people’s emotions just by being around them. We get caught in escalating response–counterresponse emotional sequences. This all takes place in time, generating complex patterns of interpersonal emotional dynamics. This review summarizes theory, empirical findings, and key challenges for future research regarding three processes that contribute to interpersonal affective dynamics: (a) Convergence of social partners’ emotional responses to the external world, (b) emotional reactivity of social partners to each other, and (c) interpersonal emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '34687440', 'name': 'Emily Butler'}]",138.0,,46.0,Interpersonal Affect Dynamics: It Takes Two (and Time) to Tango,2015.0
0f57af8d69a3dd2a756d139199eda91d0d81ad72,"In both biology and the human sciences, social groups are sometimes treated as adaptive units whose organization cannot be reduced to individual interactions. This group-level view is opposed by a more individualistic one that treats social organization as a byproduct of self-interest. According to biologists, group-level adaptations can evolve only by a process of natural selection at the group level. Most biologists rejected group selection as an important evolutionary force during the 1960s and 1970s but a positive literature began to grow during the 1970s and is rapidly expanding today. We review this recent literature and its implications for human evolutionary biology. We show that the rejection of group selection was based on a misplaced emphasis on genes as “replicators” which is in fact irrelevant to the question of whether groups can be like individuals in their functional organization. The fundamental question is whether social groups and other higher-level entities can be “vehicles” of selection. When this elementary fact is recognized, group selection emerges as an important force in nature and what seem to be competing theories, such as kin selection and reciprocity, reappear as special cases of group selection. The result is a unified theory of natural selection that operates on a nested hierarchy of units. The vehicle-based theory makes it clear that group selection is an important force to consider in human evolution. Humans can facultatively span the full range from self-interested individuals to “organs” of group-level “organisms.” Human behavior not only reflects the balance between levels of selection but it can also alter the balance through the construction of social structures that have the effect of reducing fitness differences within groups, concentrating natural selection (and functional organization) at the group level. These social structures and the cognitive abilities that produce them allow group selection to be important even among large groups of unrelated individuals.","[{'authorId': '40652121', 'name': 'D.

It is well accepted that emotion regulation difficulties are a serious concern for children with ASD, yet empirical studies of this construct are limited for this population. The present study describes group differences between high functioning children with autism and their typical peers in frustration and discrete coping strategies for emotion regulation. We also use sequential analyses to test differences in the efficacy of individual coping strategies at regulating children's frustration.


METHODS
Subjects were 20 children with autism (M = 59 months) and 20 developmentally matched typically developing children (M = 50 months). Measures of children's frustration (negative facial expressions and behaviors, negative vocalizations, resignation) and emotion regulation coping strategies were observationally coded from structured video recordings.


RESULTS
Children with autism displayed a higher intensity and duration of resignation, and the group difference became most pronounced when children worked alone during the parent-absent segment of the locked box task. Children with autism used significantly more avoidance and venting strategies, and fewer constructive strategies than typical children. Sequential analyses revealed that social support strategies (orienting and verbalizing to the experimenter) were ineffective for children with autism, while these behaviors, vocal venting, and distraction strategies were all effective for typically developing children.


CONCLUSIONS
The results go beyond the recent literature by offering a rich description of children's efforts to regulate their frustration when faced with challenge, and point to important contextual differences in the efficacy of children's coping strategies.","[{'authorId': '4879861', 'name': 'Laudan B.

We addressed these two issues in a quantitative study of 108 subjects with focal brain lesions, using three different tasks that assessed the recognition and naming of six basic emotions from facial expressions. Lesions were analyzed as a function of task performance by coregistration in a common brain space, and statistical analyses of their joint volumetric density revealed specific regions in which damage was significantly associated with impairment. We show that recognizing emotions from visually presented facial expressions requires right somatosensory-related cortices. The findings are consistent with the idea that we recognize another individual's emotional state by internally generating somatosensory representations that simulate how the other individual would feel when displaying a certain facial expression. Follow-up experiments revealed that conceptual knowledge and knowledge of the name of the emotion draw on neuroanatomically separable systems. Right somatosensory-related cortices thus constitute an additional critical component that functions together with structures such as the amygdala and right visual cortices in retrieving socially relevant information from faces.","[{'authorId': '46306086', 'name': 'R.

The “always-on” status has in fact blurred the clear-cut distinction between physical and digital spaces, introducing a new conception of space, known as “hybrid” space. Hybrid spaces are dynamic spaces generated by constant connectivity, which transparently integrates remote contexts into those we are actually experiencing at that moment. Thus the concept of “hybrid space” is clearly particularly interesting for those having to tackle daily the problem of social/educational inclusion, especially of students who are “homebound” because of physical and/or health problems.

However, previous studies on these relationships have not highlighted their dynamic properties of these relationships. In addition, although the effects of surface and deep acting on emotional exhaustion have been investigated in emotional-labor research, empirical studies on these relationships still report mixed results. Thus, we suggest that moderators may affect the relationship between emotional labor and emotional exhaustion. Also, this study examines the relationship between emotional labor and emotional exhaustion within individuals by repeated measurements, and verifies the mediating effect of a negative affect state. Finally, our study confirms the moderating effects that affective commitment has on the relationship between emotional labor and emotional exhaustion. Data was collected from tellers who had a high degree of interaction with clients at banks based in South Korea. A total of 56 tellers participated in the survey and responded for five working days. A total of 616 data entries were collected from the 56 respondents. We used a hierarchical linear model (HLM) to examine our hypothesis. The results showed that surface-acting emotional labor increases emotional exhaustion; furthermore, the relationship between surface acting emotional labor and emotional exhaustion is mediated by a negative affect state within individuals. In addition, this study verified that affective commitment buffers the negative effects that surface acting emotional labor has on emotional exhaustion. These results suggest that emotional labor is a dynamic process within individuals, and that emotional exhaustion caused by emotional labor differs among individuals, and is dependent upon factors such as the individual’s level of affective commitment.","[{'authorId': '117513617', 'name': 'H.

By graphically demonstrating eventual economic episodes in the financial sector, this study sets out to illustrate the chronological scenario of economic turning points. The scope of this research is to study the vulnerable aspects of financial instability in Bangladesh and seek possible remedies.


Methodology: The Bangladeshi financial market regimes will be constructed based on Hamilton's Markov Switching Model (1989). This paper is the first attempt in utilising a standardised methodology found in business cycle literatures so as to determine the turning points of economic episodes in the Bangladeshi financial dynamic cycle.


Main Findings: This study examines the financial crises and economic distress experienced by banks as forms of economic vulnerabilities. Thus, it describes the financial regimes of transition period movements in the context of the vulnerability of the Bangladeshi financial market sector using the Markov Switching Modeling (MSM) Approach and shows ways to possibly achieve recovery.


Research Limitations/Implications: This research focuses on the current financial episodes of the economic sector’s dynamic movements in a condensed area, while the selection of a broad financial arena of parameters results in more significant and robust outcomes.


Novelty/Originality: Further studies are needed to define and measure the financial cycle concept and its relationship with business cycles, as well as to delineate dynamic models that can offer substantial probabilistic assessments regarding changes in financial cycle regimes. This can significantly develop the capability of the financial market supervisory authorities to forecast macro-prudential systemic risks and to avoid or reduce the consequences of economic crises. This current study provides a platform for future studies in similar fields.","[{'authorId': '76981318', 'name': 'M.

Although progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms underlying CR, the role of attention remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of attention in CR by tracking participants' gazes during the presentation of videos depicting people in negative moods. Participants were asked to attend naturally or to use reappraisal to increase or decrease their emotions while viewing the videos. After each video, they rated their negative emotion experience. Results showed that participants spent more time looking at the emotional regions in the target's face (eyes and mouth) when asked to up-regulate their emotions, compared with when they simply attended to the videos. The reverse pattern was found for down-regulation of emotions. In addition, the effects of cognitive reappraisal on negative emotion experience were mediated by the time spent looking at the emotional regions, with a stronger effect for the down-regulation instruction. Finally, direct effects of regulation instruction on negative emotion were observed even when controlling for time spent viewing emotional regions, which suggests that attention and CR are distinct components that uniquely influence negative emotions. These results complement and extend previous findings on the role of attention in CR, and highlight the importance of taking attentional mechanisms into account when designing CR training.","[{'authorId': '4192721', 'name': 'V.

An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020. Participants completed a modified validated questionnaire that assessed the Impact of Event Scale (IES), indicators of negative mental health impacts, social and family support, and mental health-related lifestyle changes. A total of 263 participants (106 males and 157 females) completed the study. The mean age of the participants was 37.7 ± 14.0 years, and 74.9% had a high level of education. The mean IES score in the participants was 13.6 ± 7.7, reflecting a mild stressful impact. Only 7.6% of participants had an IES score ≥26. The majority of participants (53.3%) did not feel helpless due to the pandemic. On the other hand, 52.1% of participants felt horrified and apprehensive due to the pandemic. Additionally, the majority of participants (57.8–77.9%) received increased support from friends and family members, increased shared feeling and caring with family members and others. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mild stressful impact in our sample, even though the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing.

CAs are often operationalized as chatbots which are used for many applications including technical support, customer service, and digital personal assistants. Despite their widespread use, little research to date has investigated how improving the conversational skill of a CA impacts user perceptions of the agent. To elucidate this relationship, this research uses Social Presence Theory to describe how conversational skill influences perceived social presence and ultimately anthropomorphism of a chatbot. We conducted a series of studies in which 450 participants interacted with CAs exhibiting varying levels of conversational skill. We show that people perceive a more skilled CA to be more socially present and anthropomorphic than a less skilled CA. This research advances the knowledge of computer-human interface in information systems, as CA research to date has largely focused on the technical challenges rather than the behavioral questions of how users interact with CAs.","[{'authorId': '50818348', 'name': 'Ryan M.

EI researchers credit E. L. Thorndike as the first to propose such a construct when he suggested that social intelligence is independent of abstract or academic intelligence. The current paper traces the historical roots of social intelligence and the current scientific status of emotional intelligence. It appears that emotional intelligence, as a concept related to occupational success, exists outside the typical scientific domain. Much of the data necessary for demonstrating the unique association between EI and work-related behavior appears to reside in proprietary databases, preventing rigorous tests of the measurement devices or of their unique predictive value. For those reasons, any claims for the value of EI in the work setting cannot be made under the scientific mantle. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[{'authorId': '46262300', 'name': 'F.

124d726971ebb0858df205143d58b364537dae67,"One possible reason for the continued neglect of statistical power analysis in research in the behavioral sciences is the inaccessibility of or difficulty with the standard material. A convenient, although not comprehensive, presentation of required sample sizes is provided here. Effect-size indexes and conventional values for these are given for operationally defined small, medium, and large effects. The sample sizes necessary for .80 power to detect effects at these levels are tabled for eight standard statistical tests: (a) the difference between independent means, (b) the significance of a product-moment correlation, (c) the difference between independent rs, (d) the sign test, (e) the difference between independent proportions, (f) chi-square tests for goodness of fit and contingency tables, (g) one-way analysis of variance, and (h) the significance o f a multiple or multiple partial correlation. The preface to the first edition of my power handbook (Cohen, 1969) begins: During my first dozen years o f teaching and consulting o n applied statistics with behavioral scientists, 1 became increasingly impressed with the importance of statistical power analysis, an importance which was increased an order of magnitude by its neglect in our textbooks and curricula. The case for its importance is easily made: What behavioral scientist would view with equanimity the question of the probability that his investigation would lead to statistically significant results, i.e., its power? (p. vii) This neglect was obvious through casual observation and had been confirmed by a power review of the 1960 volume of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, which found the mean power to detect medium effect sizes to be .48 (Cohen, 1962). Thus, the chance of obtaining a significant result was about that of tossing a head with a fair coin. I attributed this disregard of power to the inaccessibility of a meager and mathematically difficult literature, beginning with its origin in the work of Neyman and Pearson (1928,1933). The power handbook was supposed to solve the problem. It required no more background than an introductory psychological statistics course that included significance testing. The exposition was verbal-intuitive and carried largely by many worked examples drawn from across the spectrum of behavioral science. In the ensuing two decades, the book has been through revised (1977) and second (1988) editions and has inspired dozens of power and effect-size surveys i n many areas of the social and life sciences (Cohen, 1988, pp. xi-xii).

There is a need for a measure of fear of falling that assesses both easy and difficult physical activities and social activities and is suitable for use in a range of languages and cultural contexts, permitting direct comparison between studies and populations in different countries and settings.


OBJECTIVE
To develop a modified version of the Falls Efficacy Scale to satisfy this need, and to establish its psychometric properties, reliability, and concurrent validity (i.e. that it demonstrates the expected relationship with age, falls history and falls risk factors).


DESIGN
Cross-sectional survey.


SETTING
Community sample.


METHOD
704 people aged between 60 and 95 years completed The Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) either in postal self-completion format or by structured interview.


RESULTS
The FES-I had excellent internal and test-retest reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.96, ICC=0.96). Factor analysis suggested a unitary underlying factor, with two dimensions assessing concern about less demanding physical activities mainly in the home, and concern about more demanding physical activities mainly outside the home. The FES-I had slightly better power than the original FES items to discriminate differences in concern about falling between groups differentiated by sex, age, occupation, falls in the past year, and falls risk factors (chronic illness, taking multiple or psychoactive medications, dizziness).


CONCLUSIONS
The FES-I has close continuity with the best existing measure of fear of falling, excellent psychometric properties, and assesses concerns relating to basic and more demanding activities, both physical and social. Further research is required to confirm cross-cultural and predictive validity.","[{'authorId': '2688701', 'name': 'L. Yardley'}, {'authorId': '4358779', 'name': 'N.

Conversational agents are smartphone-based computer programs designed to respond to users in natural language, thereby mimicking conversations between people. Many people use their smartphones to obtain health information.


OBJECTIVE
To describe the responses of 4 widely used conversational agents (Siri [Apple], Google Now, S Voice [Samsung], and Cortana [Microsoft]) to a standardized panel of questions related to mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A pilot study followed by a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 68 phones from 7 manufacturers conducted from December 2015 to January 2016. Investigators asked the smartphones 9 questions (3 each in mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health) in their natural language. We recorded information on features of the smartphones and their software, including manufacturer, phone model, operating system version, and conversational agent.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
The primary outcomes were the responses of conversational agents to 9 questions. The responses were characterized based on the ability to (1) recognize a crisis, (2) respond with respectful language, and (3) refer to an appropriate helpline, or other health resources for a physical health concern. Questions were asked repeatedly until there were no new answers.


RESULTS
The phones ran 77 conversational agents: Siri (n = 27), Google Now (n = 31), S Voice (n = 9), and Cortana (n = 10). Siri, Google Now, and S Voice recognized the statement ""I want to commit suicide"" as concerning; Siri and Google Now referred the user to a suicide prevention helpline. In response to ""I am depressed,"" Siri recognized the concern and responded with respectful language, the responses from S Voice and Cortana varied, and Google Now did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents referred users to a helpline for depression. In response to ""I was raped,"" Cortana referred to a sexual assault hotline; Siri, Google Now, and S Voice did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents recognized ""I am being abused"" or ""I was beaten up by my husband."" In response to ""I am having a heart attack,"" ""My head hurts,"" and ""My foot hurts."" Siri generally recognized the concern, referred to emergency services, and identified nearby medical facilities. Google Now, S Voice, and Cortana did not recognize any of the physical health concerns.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
When asked simple questions about mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health, Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and S Voice responded inconsistently and incompletely. If conversational agents are to respond fully and effectively to health concerns, their performance will have to substantially improve.","[{'authorId': '145089560', 'name': 'Adam S.

OBJECTIVE To examine whether children diagnosed as having ADHD at a mean age of 8 years (probands) have worse educational, occupational, economic, social, and marital outcomes and higher rates of ongoing ADHD, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), substance use disorders (SUDs), adult-onset psychiatric disorders, psychiatric hospitalizations, and incarcerations than non-ADHD comparison participants at a mean age of 41 years. DESIGN Prospective, 33-year follow-up study, with masked clinical assessments. SETTING Research clinic. PARTICIPANTS A total of 135 white men with ADHD in childhood, free of conduct disorder, and 136 men without childhood ADHD (65.2% and 76.4% of original cohort, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Occupational, economic, and educational attainment; marital history; occupational and social functioning; ongoing and lifetime psychiatric disorders; psychiatric hospitalizations; and incarcerations. RESULTS Probands had significantly worse educational, occupational, economic, and social outcomes; more divorces; and higher rates of ongoing ADHD (22.2% vs 5.1%, P < .001), ASPD (16.3% vs 0%, P < .001), and SUDs (14.1% vs 5.1%, P = .01) but not more mood or anxiety disorders (P = .36 and .33) than did comparison participants. Ongoing ADHD was weakly related to ongoing SUDs (ϕ = 0.19, P = .04), as well as ASPD with SUDs (ϕ = 0.20, P = .04). During their lifetime, probands had significantly more ASPD and SUDs but not mood or anxiety disorders and more psychiatric hospitalizations and incarcerations than comparison participants. Relative to comparisons, psychiatric disorders with onsets at 21 years or older were not significantly elevated in probands.

Related academic literature is fragmented, lacking both definitional consistency and conceptual clarity. This article makes three main contributions to avatar theory and managerial practice. First, to address ambiguity with respect to its definition, this study identifies and critically evaluates key conceptual elements of the term avatar, offers a definition derived from this analysis, and provides a typology of avatars’ design elements. Second, the proposed 2 × 2 avatar taxonomy suggests that the alignment of an avatar’s form realism and behavioral realism, across different contingencies, provides a parsimonious explanation for avatar effectiveness. Third, the authors develop an emerging theory of avatar marketing by triangulating insights from fundamental elements of avatars, a synthesis of extant research, and business practices. This framework integrates key theoretical insights, research propositions, and important managerial implications for this expanding area of marketing strategy. Lastly, the authors outline a research program to test the propositions and insights as well as advance future research.","[{'authorId': '2124013129', 'name': 'Fred Miao'}, {'authorId': '50821921', 'name': 'Irina V.

The effects of the raised intracranial pressure, so produced, were correlated with the presence or absence of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow to induced changes of arterial pressure, which was tested immediately prior to each episode of inflation of the balloon. Cerebral blood flow was measured by a venous outflow method and monitored continuously, together with arterial and supratentorial intracranial pressure; arterial pCO2 and body temperature were held constant. Three stages were identified. When autoregulation to a change of arterial pressure was intact, initial inflation of the balloon did not reduce cerebral blood flow until the difference between arterial and intracranial pressure (which was taken to represent cerebral perfusion pressure) was less than 40 mm Hg.

In particular, we investigated if affect dysregulation predicts EA and is more important than are depressive symptoms in predicting EA. Questionnaire measures and 30 min of free play were obtained from 46 mothers of 4- to 5-month-old infants. Mothers' self-reported affect dysregulation was inversely related to EA, but mothers' depressive symptoms were not related to EA. More specifically, mothers' tendency to use unhealthy externalizing behaviors to reduce tension and distress predicted less EA. These results suggested that even in relatively low-risk samples, mothers' self-reported affect dysregulation, particularly the tendency to act out inappropriately in response to tension and distress, may be a more proximal predictor of EA than are depressive symptoms.","[{'authorId': '2109709569', 'name': 'Bo-Ram Kim'}, {'authorId': '6031824', 'name': 'D.

133b56f616e3d5cceec603fe70b340e0c03a4f10,"The number of reports on the cognitive neuroscience of aging has increased in recent years, and most of these studies have found many similarities in the patterns of activity in young and old adults, indicating that basic neural mechanisms are maintained into older age. Despite these overall similarities, older adults often have less activity in some regions, such as medial temporal areas during memory processing and visual regions across a variety of cognitive domains. It seems clear that age reductions in cognitive function can be tied, at least in part, to these reductions in brain activity. On the other hand, older adults typically also overrecruit some brain areas, mainly the ventral or dorsal prefrontal cortex during memory tasks, as well as both the frontal and parietal regions during tasks engaging cognitive control processes, such as attention. Sometimes this overrecruitment appears to be in response to altered function in other brain regions and is often seen in those older adults who perform better on the task at hand. These findings have provided rather convincing support for the idea that overrecruitment can be compensatory in the elderly. Nevertheless, not all age increases can be interpreted as compensatory, and some are more indicative of neural inefficiency. The challenge facing future research will be to understand the task conditions that promote compensation in older adults, the role of the various brain areas in aiding cognitive function, and how these compensatory mechanisms can be elicited to enhance quality of life in the elderly.","[{'authorId': '2013723', 'name': 'C.

This study explores three elements that contribute to responsiveness—emotional labor, job engagement, and ethical leadership. Three findings emerge: First, in terms of workers and their expression of work-related emotion, authentic emotive expression relates positively with job engagement while pretending to feel the emotion being displayed has a negative relationship. Second, ethical leadership moderates the relationship between pretending and job engagement, in that higher levels of ethical leadership lessen the negative influence of pretense in emotive expression. This means that when employees must mask how they feel, ethical leadership compensates for the deleterious effect of expressing an emotion other than what one is feeling. This, in turn, helps to prevent decreased job engagement. Third, ethical leadership does not affect the relationship between authentic emotive expression and job engagement.

The sample included 209 (106 European American, 103 African American) mothers and their children (52% female). Sensitive maternal behavior was rated and aggregated across five stress-free and stress-inducing tasks when children were about 2 years old, when mothers also retrospectively reported on their adverse life experiences and transitions throughout childhood from birth to age 20. When children were about 1 year old, mothers reported on their difficulties with emotion regulation. Results from path analysis indicated that mothers who carried the long allele of DRD4 and experienced more adverse life events were less sensitive in interactions with their children. These mothers were also more likely to have difficulties with emotion regulation, which in turn predicted lower maternal sensitivity. These effects were significant above and beyond the effects of maternal education, coherence of mind, race, or infants’ DRD4 genotype, and did not vary for African American and European American mothers. Results suggest that genetic predispositions modify the effects of maternal experience of adverse life events on maternal sensitivity and that emotion regulation serves as one mechanism by which genetic factors and gene–environment interactions affect maternal behavior.","[{'authorId': '8606048', 'name': 'J.

13fdc91653228f5236f6feebdcda0a909e227ee3,"Background: Approach and avoidance motivation have been thoroughly studied in common mental disorders, which are prevalent in the military context. Approach/avoidance motivational dispositions underlie emotion responses and are thought to influence emotion dysregulation. However, studies on the mediating role of emotion regulation (ER) between motivational dispositions and mental disorders have been insufficient. We examined the psychopathological correlates of motivational dispositions and explored the mediating role of ER. Methods: The Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scales and measures of mood disorders (depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD) were administered to a nonclinical sample of 3,146 Chinese military service members. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Armymen (ERQ-A) (Chinese version) was used to measure ER styles. We examined the reliability and construct validity of the BIS/BAS scales. Approach/avoidance motivations were correlated with symptoms of mood disorders. Mediation analysis was conducted to confirm the mediating role of ER between motivation and mood disorders. Results: The results showed acceptable internal reliability and construct validity of the BIS/BAS scales. Gender (female), family status (single-parent family), and social relationships (having fewer good friends) were significant predictors of high BIS sensitivity. More years of education, an older age, being an only child and being in a single-parent family all significantly predicted high BAS sensitivity. The BIS/BAS scales were predictive of various DSM-V-based mental disorders (depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD). Immersion exacerbated the impact of BAS/BIS sensitivities on depressive/PTSD symptoms, while reinterpretation and talking out alleviated the impact of BAS/BIS sensitivities on these symptoms. Conclusions: Motivational dispositions have an impact on mood symptoms under specific conditions. ER strategies (immersion, reinterpretation, and talking out) were shown to be partial mediators between approach/avoidance motivation and mood disorders. These findings highlight the importance of ER in altering the impact of motivational dispositions on mood disorders and as a promising target of psychotherapies.","[{'authorId': '51281921', 'name': 'Xiaoxia Wang'}, {'authorId': '2118403863', 'name': 'Rui Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2117026416', 'name': 'Xiao Chen'}, {'authorId': '50987942', 'name': 'Ke-yu Liu'}, {'authorId': '2108573528', 'name': 'Lifei Wang'}, {'authorId': '2117171020', 'name': 'Jin Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2111311817', 'name': 'Xiao Liu'}, {'authorId': '40539488', 'name': 'Zhengzhi Feng'}]",7.0,,87.0,Psychopathological Correlates and Emotion Regulation as Mediators of Approach and Avoidance Motivation in a Chinese Military Sample,2019.0

Evaluation is a key concept in the occupational therapy process, informing treatment approaches and outcomes. The authors could not identify a scale measuring emotional regulation strategies used by adolescent in the literature. A quantitative, descriptive study was done following a process of scale development. A survey with 78 items was designed which 404 adolescents from a tertiary institution completed. From the results, a provisional scale was developed, measuring emotional regulation strategies used by adolescents. The scale has 39 items, consisting of five emotional regulation strategy categories, named Comfort and Sharing, Antisocial behaviour, Creative Activities, Physical Activities and Eating. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model proved the provisional scale, as well as the items, to be reliable. Further research for the development and the refinement of this scale is recommended.

Rotation of head away from the side of the contracting sternocleidomastoid muscle. 2. Tilting of the head toward the contracting sterno-cleidomastoid muscle. 3. Flexion of the neck by both sternocleidomastoid muscles . 4. Elevation of the shoulder by the trapezius. 5. Drawing the head back so the face is upward by the trapezius muscles. With weakness or paralysis these functions are decreased or absent. When the lesion is nuclear or infranuclear, there is associated muscle atrophy and fasciculations. Technique Observe the volume and contour of the sternocleidomastoid muscles as the patient looks ahead. Test the right sterno-cleidomastoid muscle by facing the patient and placing your right palm laterally on the patient's left cheek. Ask the patient to turn the head to the left, resisting the pressure you are exerting in the opposite direction. At the same time, observe and palpate the right sternocleidomastoid with your left hand. Then reverse the procedure to test the left ster-nocleidomastoid. Continue to test the sternocleidomastoid by placing your hand on the patient's forehead and pushing backward as the patient pushes forward. Observe and palpate the ster-nocleidomastoid muscles. Now test the trapezius. Ask the patient to face away from you and observe the shoulder contour for hollowing, displacement , or winging of the scapula. Observe for drooping of the shoulder. Place your hands on the patient's shoulders and press down as the patient elevates or shrugs the shoulders and then retracts the shoulders. Basic Science The eleventh nerve has two parts. The smaller cranial part arises from cells in the nucleus ambiguus and ultimately is distributed with the vagus nerve. This portion innervates the pharyngeal muscles. The main part, the spinal portion, arises from a long column of nuclei situated in the ventral part of the medulla and extending to the fifth cervical segment or lower. Supranuclear innervation is not well known. It has been characterized by authors as being ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral. It begins in the precentral gyri and descends in the corticobulbar tract. As the fibers leave the cord they join together and ascend through the foramen magnum, then leave through the jugular foramen with the vagus nerve. The nerve descends in the neck near the jug-ular vein and supplies the sternocleidomastoid and trape-zius muscles, joined by motor or sensory contributions from the upper cervical nerves. …","[{'authorId': '144140625', 'name': 'H.

We used the Perceived Self-efficacy in Life Skills Scales (PSES_PE/NE: Empathic Self-efficacy Scale; PSES_PS: Problem-solving Self-efficacy Scale) and the Resiliency Attitudes and Skills Profile (Italian-RASP) composed of five factors (sense of humour, competence, adaptability, engagement, and control). Results demonstrated that the factors of resilience were strongly (adaptability and engagement) and moderately (sense of humour and competence) related to perceived self-efficacy in the analysed domains; consequently, adolescents who perceived themselves as highly efficient in empathy and in problem-solving were more resilient than those who perceived themselves as lowly efficient in the same domains.

Lifestyle behaviors are recognized as essential components of stress reduction and wellbeing. These behaviors include consuming a healthy diet, engaging in exercise, and seeking social support. Emotional intelligence (EI) was also included because of its positive effects on subjective well-being and its mitigating effects on stress. The purpose of this study was to examine the link among stress perception, lifestyle behaviors, and EI. Methods: Sixty-three undergraduate nursing students with a mean age of 22 years, electronically completed tools that addressed stress perception, diet, exercise, social support, EI, and demographic characteristics. Descriptive statistics, correlational analysis, and ANOVA were used to analyze data. Results: Students reported a tendency toward perceiving a high level of stress, scored high on EI, sought social support, reported friends as the more frequent social support providers, tended to consume healthy diet, and were more likely to exercise. EI was correlated with the consumption of healthy diet, emotional social support, and instrumental social support. Consumption of a healthy diet was also correlated with exercise participation. The social support constructs of emotional, instrumental, and venting of emotions were correlated with each other. Conclusion: The study results indicate this sample of nursing students participated in a healthy lifestyle and reported high EI. Assessing stress perception needs to be focused on stress-related nursing issues.","[{'authorId': '13271061', 'name': 'N. Ali'}, {'authorId': '47985321', 'name': 'O.

Participants in this study included 111 families (children's age: 1-3 years). Father-child and mother-child play interactions were videotaped and coded for parental playfulness, sensitivity, structuring, and nonintrusiveness as well as child negativity. Results indicated that mothers and fathers did not differ in playfulness and that mothers and fathers who were higher in playfulness had children with lower levels of negativity. However, playfulness differently moderated the links between parents' and children's behaviors for mothers and fathers. A double-risk pattern was found for mothers, such that the links between child negativity and maternal sensitivity, structuring, and nonintrusiveness were significant only for the subgroup of mothers with low levels of playfulness. When mothers had high levels of playfulness, these effects were negligible. For fathers, a double-buffer pattern was revealed, indicating that the links between child negativity and paternal sensitivity and structuring were significant only for fathers with high levels of playfulness. When fathers had low levels of playfulness, these effects were negligible. These findings demonstrate the important role that parental playfulness has on parent-child interaction as well as the need to examine moderation patterns separately for fathers and mothers.","[{'authorId': '1402531024', 'name': 'Atara Menashe-Grinberg'}, {'authorId': '1398382190', 'name': 'Naama Atzaba-Poria'}]",54.0,,62.0,MOTHER-CHILD AND FATHER-CHILD PLAY INTERACTION: THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL PLAYFULNESS AS A MODERATOR OF THE LINKS BETWEEN PARENTAL BEHAVIOR AND CHILD NEGATIVITY.,2017.0
15a19b0e1e4cfa79179c3b4e696bd06c7c77fc40,"IMPORTANCE
Psychiatric nosology is limited by behavioral and biological heterogeneity within existing disorder categories. The imprecise nature of current nosologic distinctions limits both mechanistic understanding and clinical prediction. We demonstrate an approach consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria initiative to identify superior, neurobiologically valid subgroups with better predictive capacity than existing psychiatric categories for childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).


OBJECTIVE
To refine subtyping of childhood ADHD by using biologically based behavioral dimensions (i.e., temperament), novel classification algorithms, and multiple external validators.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A total of 437 clinically well-characterized, community-recruited children, with and without ADHD, participated in an ongoing longitudinal study. Baseline data were used to classify children into subgroups based on temperament dimensions and examine external validators including physiological and magnetic resonance imaging measures. One-year longitudinal follow-up data are reported for a subgroup of the ADHD sample to address stability and clinical prediction.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Parent/guardian ratings of children on a measure of temperament were used as input features in novel community detection analyses to identify subgroups within the sample. Groups were validated using 3 widely accepted external validators: peripheral physiological characteristics (cardiac measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period), central nervous system functioning (via resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging), and clinical outcomes (at 1-year longitudinal follow-up).


RESULTS
The community detection algorithm suggested 3 novel types of ADHD, labeled as mild (normative emotion regulation), surgent (extreme levels of positive approach-motivation), and irritable (extreme levels of negative emotionality, anger, and poor soothability). Types were independent of existing clinical demarcations including DSM-5 presentations or symptom severity. These types showed stability over time and were distinguished by unique patterns of cardiac physiological response, resting-state functional brain connectivity, and clinical outcomes 1 year later.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
Results suggest that a biologically informed temperament-based typology, developed with a discovery-based community detection algorithm, provides a superior description of heterogeneity in the ADHD population than does any current clinical nosologic criteria. This demonstration sets the stage for more aggressive attempts at a tractable, biologically based nosology.","[{'authorId': '5512411', 'name': 'S. Karalunas'}, {'authorId': '35365511', 'name': 'D.

Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between January 1980 and December 2017 that reported the effects of at least two treatments on AN were screened. Weight and psychological symptoms were analyzed separately for each study. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed, and studies were assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria and Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results We identified 35 eligible RCTs, comprising data from 2524 patients. Meta-analyses revealed a significant treatment effect on weight outcomes at EOT [g = 0.16, 95% CI (0.05–0.28), p = 0.006], but not at follow-up [g = 0.11, 95% CI (−0.04 to 0.27), p = 0.15]. There was no significant treatment effect on psychological outcomes at either EOT [g = −0.03, 95% CI (−0.14 to 0.08), p = 0.63], or follow-up [g = −0.001, 95% CI (−0.11 to 0.11), p = 0.98]. There was no strong evidence of publication bias or significant moderator effects for illness duration, mean age, year of publication, comparator group category, or risk of bias (all p values > 0.05). Conclusions Current specialized treatments are more adept than comparator interventions at imparting change in weight-based AN symptoms at EOT, but not at follow-up. Specialized treatments confer no advantage over comparator interventions in terms of psychological symptoms.

We then describe a meta-analysis of 24 longitudinal studies showing that improvement in direct report, peer, and supervisor ratings over time is generally small. We present a theoretical framework and review empirical evidence suggesting performance improvement should be more likely for some feedback recipients than others. Specifically, improvement is most likely to occur when feedback indicates that change is necessary, recipients have a positive feedback orientation, perceive a need to change their behavior, react positively to the feedback, believe change is feasible, set appropriate goals to regulate their behavior, and take actions that lead to skill and performance improvement.

The goal of this article is to provide insight into how recent findings from affective science may be translated into the health arena.


METHODS
We first review definitional issues related to the key concepts of emotion and stress. We then review relevant research that informs our understanding of the affect-health relationship. Subsequently, we highlight findings that are the most informative and also ripe for translation into the domains of health and health-related behaviors.


RESULTS
We identify several domains of affect-relevant processes (e.g., emotion-regulation, stress response) that would benefit from increased elaboration. Three themes may guide how best to broaden our understanding across multiple domains: the need to use a differentiated emotion-based approach, the need to consider potential synergistic and oppositional effects of emotion that can occur in parallel, and the need to examine the impact of emotions with respect to regulation and coping at both the intra- and interindividual levels. Building on insights derived from these themes, we suggest a broad integrative framework for use with future investigations. This framework categorizes potential emotion-related effects on health according to whether they influence health directly (e.g., shaping physiological responses) or indirectly (e.g., guiding decision making and behavior). Using this approach will allow researchers to examine systematically the often simultaneous and sometimes opposing influences of emotion on distinct health-relevant cognitive and physiological mechanisms, and to integrate across potentially disparate findings.


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude by suggesting opportunities for future work that we see as most fruitful based on the presented framework.","[{'authorId': '3034682', 'name': 'David DeSteno'}, {'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Gradual exposure has shown to be an effective therapeutic technique for reducing anxiety. In this article, we suggest that combining play elements with the exposure process may enhance children’s responsiveness to it. Playful exposures can be entwined within a psychodynamic oriented play therapy as well. We propose that playful exposures can accelerate change processes by prompting children to move from an avoidant position to an explorative one, thus enabling them to discover new, competent self-aspects and further the shift from absolute control to adaptive mastery. When exposures take place in the context of play, important internal content that can broaden the therapeutic process may be revealed. Playful exposures may also help parents of anxious children encourage their children to experiment in a playful and attuned manner. This parental approach may in turn promote the separation–individuation process. Exposición lúdica: Una visión integradora sobre las contribuciones de la terapia de exposición a niños con ansiedad Los niños ansiosos tienden a exhibir rigidez excesiva, tendencias evasivas y una necesidad de control en situaciones que perciben como amenazantes. La exposición gradual ha demostrado ser una técnica terapéutica eficaz para reducir la ansiedad. En este trabajo, sugerimos que la combinación de elementos de juego con el proceso de exposición puede mejorar la capacidad de respuesta de los niños. Las exposiciones juguetonas pueden ser entrelazadas dentro de una terapia psicodinámica del juego. Proponemos que las exposiciones lúdicas pueden acelerar los procesos de cambio al impulsar al niño a pasar de una posición evasiva a una exploradora, lo que le permite descubrir nuevos, competentes, auto-aspectos, y el cambio del control absoluto a la maestría adaptativa. Cuando las exposiciones tienen lugar en el contexto del juego, puede revelarse un contenido interno importante que puede ampliar el proceso terapéutico. Las exposiciones juguetonas también pueden ayudar a los padres de los niños ansiosos a animar a sus hijos a experimentar de una manera lúdica y en sintonía.

The predictive effects of sex, age, severity of depression, self-harm/suicidal behaviors, eating problems, risk-taking behaviors, substance use, aggression, and uncontrollable sexual encounters on the incidence and remission of IA over a one-year follow-up were examined. The one-year incidence and remission rates for IA were 7.5% and 46.4%, respectively. Severity of depression, self-harm and suicidal behaviors, and uncontrollable sexual encounters at the initial investigation predicted the incidence of IA in a univariate analysis, whereas only severity of depression predicted the incidence of IA in a multivariable logistic regression (p = 0.015, odds ratio = 1.105, 95% confidence intervals: 1.021–1.196).

This study tested the potential of diffusion measurements in WM for identifying ALS based on support vector machine (SVM). Methods: Voxel-wise fractional anisotropy (FA) values of diffusion tensor images (DTI) were extracted from 22 ALS patients and 26 healthy controls and served as discrimination features. The revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) was employed to assess ALS severity. Feature ranking and selection were based on Fisher scores. A linear kernel SVM algorithm was applied to build the classification model, from which the classification performance was evaluated. To promote classifier generalization ability, a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method was adopted. Results: By using the 2,400~3,400 ranked features as optimal features, the highest classification accuracy of 83.33% (sensitivity = 77.27% and specificity = 88.46%, P = 0.0001) was achieved, with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.862. The predicted function value was positively correlated with patient ALSFRS-R scores (r = 0.493, P = 0.020). In the optimized SVM model, FA values from several regions mostly contributed to classification, primarily involving the corticospinal tract pathway, postcentral gyrus, and frontal and parietal areas. Conclusions: Our results suggest the feasibility of ALS diagnosis based on SVM analysis and diffusion measurements of WM. Additional investigations using a larger cohort is recommended in order to validate the results of this study.","[{'authorId': '122440061', 'name': 'Qiu-Feng Chen'}, {'authorId': '2048540572', 'name': 'Xiao-Hong Zhang'}, {'authorId': '147673938', 'name': 'Nao-Xin Huang'}, {'authorId': '2138727936', 'name': 'Hua-jun Chen'}]",8.0,,76.0,Identification of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Support Vector Machine,2020.0

1748666765afa669d7fe38888918e85eabc19b4c,"Social exclusion evokes social pain in excluded individuals. Neuroimaging studies suggest that this social pain is associated with activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), with further regulation of social pain being reflected in activation of the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC). The present study focused on factors that influence activation of the rVLPFC during social exclusion. We conducted a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) experiment to investigate whether two psychosocial resources (general trust and trait self-esteem) increase rVLPFC activity during social exclusion, thereby buffering against social pain. Thirty-seven undergraduates participated in an NIRS session in which they were socially rejected during an online ball-tossing game. Levels of general trust and trait self-esteem were negatively correlated with self-reported social pain in the exclusion conditions. Furthermore, general trust was positively correlated with rVLPFC activity, although there was no such relationship with self-esteem. rVLPFC activity mediated the relationship between general trust levels and social pain. The rVLPFC appears to be critical for the regulation of social pain. Taken together, these findings suggest that general trust and trait self-esteem probably have different impacts at different times over the course of a series of adaptive processes, all geared toward the modulation of social pain.","[{'authorId': '4798811', 'name': 'K.

Forty doctors completed scales of attachment orientations and emotion regulation strategies, and 160 of their patients reported on a standard measure of satisfaction with their doctor. Results from multilevel analyses showed that doctors’ avoidant and anxious attachment orientations were independently associated with lower satisfaction for patients higher on serious illness perceptions. Doctors’ emotion regulation strategies did not mediate insecure attachment orientation relationships with patients’ satisfaction as anticipated, but these regulatory strategies were an independent factor associated with satisfaction levels of patients with higher illness severity perceptions. The study confirms predictions based on attachment theory that doctors’ insecure attachment can have adverse effects for doctor–patient interaction.","[{'authorId': '1870489', 'name': 'K.

To determine the optimal Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) global score to discriminate between female controls and patients by eating disorder (ED) diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) and age.


METHOD
A sample of 1845 control participants and 620 patients from specialty ED treatment centres.


RESULTS
Mean global EDE-Q was 4.00 [standard deviation (SD) = 1.32] for patients and 1.25 (SD = 1.10) for controls. Receiver operating characteristic analyses demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.94), with an optimal cut-off score of 2.50 (sensitivity = 0.86; specificity = 0.86), ranging from 2.09 for anorexia nervosa, 2.62 for bulimia nervosa and 2.63 for ED otherwise not specified. Optimal cut-off scores also varied according to BMI, ranging from 1.62 (BMI ≤ 18.0 kg/m(2) ) to 3.26 (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ), with less variability for age, ranging inversely from 2.16 (>40 years) to 2.70 (<20 years).


DISCUSSION
The global EDE-Q score showed high discriminant validity, and findings illustrate the particular importance of considering BMI and diagnosis when applying cut-offs based upon the EDE-Q.","[{'authorId': '1398722254', 'name': 'Ø.

In this generative adversarial network approach, the outputs from the discriminator are used to encourage the system towards more human-like dialogue.

It does so by examining whether daily fluctuations in co-workers' support (i.e., a typical job resource) and daily fluctuations in work/family conflict (i.e., a typical job demand) predict day-levels of job satisfaction and mental health through work engagement and exhaustion, respectively. A total of 61 schoolteachers completed a general questionnaire and a daily survey over a period of five consecutive work days. Multilevel analyses provided evidence for both the above processes. Consistently with the hypotheses, our results showed that day-level work engagement mediated the impact of day-level co-workers' support on day-level job satisfaction and day-level mental health, after general levels of work engagement and outcome variables had been controlled for. Moreover, day-level exhaustion mediated the relationship between day-level work/family conflict and day-level job satisfaction and day-level mental health after general levels of exhaustion and outcome variables had been controlled for. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic psychological processes that determine daily fluctuations in employee well-being. Such insights may be transformed into job redesign strategies and other interventions designed to enhance work-related psychological well-being on a daily level.","[{'authorId': '6468224', 'name': 'S.

The LISREL structural analysis was based on a conceptual model adapted from Kyriacou and Sutcliffe. Although the LISREL solution did not reach statistical significance it was concluded that the conceptual model in the essential features was corroborated by the LISREL analyses. Measurement errors, as well as the sensitivity of the used goodness of fit test (chi square) to the size of the samples was put forward as explanations of the failure to reach statistical significance for the LISREL structural solutions. Furthermore, it was argued that the heterogeneity of the teachers with respect to the stages of their professional careers should be considered in further research on teacher stress, to be able to capture the process aspects more adequately.","[{'authorId': '113935157', 'name': 'S.

Research has demonstrated their efficacy in a wide range of psychological conditions characterized by emotion dysregulation. Neuroimaging studies have evidenced functional and structural changes in a myriad of brain regions mainly involved in attention systems, emotion regulation, and self-referential processing. In this article we review studies on psychological and neurobiological correlates across different empirically derived models of research, including dispositional mindfulness, mindfulness induction, MBIs, and expert meditators in relation to emotion regulation. From the perspective of recent findings in the neuroscience of emotion regulation, we discuss the interplay of top-down and bottom-up emotion regulation mechanisms associated with different mindfulness models. From a phenomenological and cognitive perspective, authors have argued that mindfulness elicits a “mindful emotion regulation” strategy; however, from a clinical perspective, this construct has not been properly differentiated from other strategies and interventions within MBIs. In this context we propose the distinction between top-down and bottom-up mindfulness based emotion regulation strategies. Furthermore, we propose an embodied emotion regulation framework as a multilevel approach for understanding psychobiological changes due to mindfulness meditation regarding its effect on emotion regulation. Finally, based on clinical neuroscientific evidence on mindfulness, we open perspectives and dialogues regarding commonalities and differences between MBIs and other psychotherapeutic strategies for emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '40438348', 'name': 'Simón Guendelman'}, {'authorId': '34894564', 'name': 'Sebastián Medeiros'}, {'authorId': '5958477', 'name': 'H.

Little is known, however, about the brain and behavioral mechanisms underlying this association, particularly during childhood and adolescence, when emotional disorders frequently emerge. Here, we demonstrate that psychological control, a parenting strategy known to limit socioemotional development in children, is associated with altered brain and behavioral responses to emotional conflict in 27 at-risk (urban, lower income) youth, ages 9-16. In particular, youth reporting higher parental psychological control demonstrated lower activity in the left anterior insula, a brain area involved in emotion conflict processing, and submitted faster but less accurate behavioral responses-possibly reflecting an avoidant pattern. Effects were not replicated for parental care, and did not generalize to an analogous nonemotional conflict task. We also find evidence that behavioral responses to emotional conflict bridge the previously reported link between parental overcontrol and anxiety in children. Effects of psychological control may reflect a parenting style that limits opportunities to practice self-regulation when faced with emotionally charged situations. Results support the notion that parenting strategies that facilitate appropriate amounts of socioemotional competence and autonomy in children may be protective against social and emotional difficulties.","[{'authorId': '2226488', 'name': 'H.

Building upon previous research that examined the functional relations between emotions and regulatory actions in children, we sought to examine the association of maternal emotion dysregulation and emotion socialization with these functional links in an at-risk community sample of mother–preschooler (children ages 36–60 months) dyads that oversampled for mothers with elevated symptoms of borderline personality disorder (n = 68). We found that maternal emotion dysregulation was associated with children displaying more sadness and engaging in less problem solving during the Locked Box Task, which is designed to elicit anger. Maternal emotion dysregulation was also associated with children being more distracted and talking less in the context of sadness. Maternal nonsupportive emotion socialization responses were associated with children engaging in more defiant behaviors throughout the task and using less problem solving in the context of happiness, whereas maternal supportive emotion socialization responses were associated with more play throughout the task and less talking in the context of sadness, above and beyond the effect of maternal emotion dysregulation. These findings indicate that maternal emotion dysregulation and nonsupportive emotion socialization practices are both meaningfully associated with the development of aberrant patterns of emotional and behavioral responding during the preschool years.","[{'authorId': '30661345', 'name': 'Grace Binion'}, {'authorId': '39007460', 'name': 'Maureen Zalewski'}]",18.0,,66.0,Maternal Emotion Dysregulation and the Functional Organization of Preschoolers’ Emotional Expressions and Regulatory Behaviors,2017.0

A systematic search of the literature identified 306 experimental comparisons of different emotion regulation (ER) strategies. ER instructions were coded according to a new taxonomy, and meta-analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy across studies. The findings revealed differences in effectiveness between ER processes: Attentional deployment had no effect on emotional outcomes (d(+) = 0.00), response modulation had a small effect (d(+) = 0.16), and cognitive change had a small-to-medium effect (d(+) = 0.36). There were also important within-process differences. We identified 7 types of attentional deployment, 4 types of cognitive change, and 4 types of response modulation, and these distinctions had a substantial influence on effectiveness. Whereas distraction was an effective way to regulate emotions (d(+) = 0.27), concentration was not (d(+) = -0.26). Similarly, suppressing the expression of emotion proved effective (d(+) = 0.32), but suppressing the experience of emotion or suppressing thoughts of the emotion-eliciting event did not (d(+) = -0.04 and -0.12, respectively). Finally, reappraising the emotional response proved less effective (d(+) = 0.23) than reappraising the emotional stimulus (d(+) = 0.36) or using perspective taking (d(+) = 0.45).

Moreover, DA D2 receptor levels were found to have an inverse relationship to the body mass index of the obese subjects. We postulated that decreased levels of DA D2 receptors predisposed subjects to search for reinforcers; in the case of drug-addicted subjects for the drug and in the case of the obese subjects for food as a means to temporarily compensate for a decreased sensitivity of DA D2 regulated reward circuits.

The research literature identifies various causes for teacher burnout, offering evidence that special education teachers experience more burnout than teachers of mainstream classes. The research population for this study comprised 302 teachers from elementary schools in the state education system of the Tel Aviv district. The research group was divided into three subgroups: 138 teachers in regular education, 102 teachers from the Local Resource Center for Special Education Services (MATIA program) who were integrated into mainstream schools, and 62 special education teachers. The research tool was a questionnaire titled ‘Teaching Role, School Characteristics, and Teacher’s Feelings,’ which was specially constructed for the study. Data analysis examined 302 questionnaires completed by the regular and special education teachers. The Structural Equation Models instrument was used to analyze the data and test the hypotheses utilizing AMOS 4.0 software. The data analysis showed that teachers start out of a sense of idealism and a belief in their willingness and ability to work hard. For many, the harsh reality of teaching becomes apparent within a very short time in the classroom and involves problematic work with difficult classes, often in an unsupportive organizational climate. These problems lead to stress followed by burnout and even to a desire to quit the profession. Feelings of stress and burnout were found common to teachers in both regular and special education classes and the explanation was found to involve classroom dynamics. On the other hand, the MATIA teachers, who work in mainstream schools with only one or two pupils, showed different results for all the parameters tested. School organizational climate was found to have a significant impact on burnout. The more unsupportive the school organizational climate is perceived, the greater the feeling of stress and burnout among teachers appears to be. Conversely, the more supportive the school organizational climate is perceived to be, the more likely the teacher is not to experience burnout.","[{'authorId': '51152788', 'name': 'R. H.

Eating in response to negative affect contributes towards obesity, however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Evidence that visceral afferent signals contribute towards the experience of emotion is accumulating rapidly, with the emergence of new influential models of ‘active inference’. No longer viewed as a ‘bottom up’ process, new interoceptive facets based on ‘top down’ predictions have been proposed, although at present it is unclear which aspects of interoception contribute to aberrant eating behaviour and obesity. Study one examined the link between eating behaviour, body mass index and the novel interoceptive indices; interoceptive metacognitive awareness (IAw) and interoceptive prediction error (IPE), as well as the traditional measures; interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and interoceptive sensibility (IS). The dissociation between these interoceptive indices was confirmed. Emotional eaters were characterised by a heightened interoceptive signal but reduced meta-cognitive awareness of their interoceptive abilities. In addition, emotional eating correlated with IPE; effects that could not be accounted for by differences in anxiety and depression. Study two confirmed the positive association between interoceptive accuracy and emotional eating using a novel unbiased heartbeat discrimination task based on the method of constant stimuli.

It is increasingly recognized that affective values associated with visual stimuli can influence visual perception, attention, and eye movements. Recent research has begun to uncover the brain mechanisms mediating these phenomena. The present review summarizes the main paradigms and findings demonstrating emotional and motivational influences on visual processing.


RECENT FINDINGS
Several pathways have been identified for enhancing neural responses of cortical visual areas to stimuli with intrinsic emotional value (e.g., facial expressions, social scenes, and others), including projections from the amygdala and ascending modulatory neurotransmitter systems from the brainstem. These pathways can guide attention and gaze to emotionally salient information with either negative (threatening) or positive (rewarding) associations. In addition, abundant research in recent years suggests that probabilistic reward learning can lead to powerful biases in visual attention and saccade control through subcortical pathways connecting visual areas with basal ganglia and superior colliculus. Time-resolved neuroimaging using electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography has begun to tackle the time course of these effects, and can now be complemented by neuroimaging and neurophysiology recordings in monkey.


SUMMARY
These findings have implications for understanding and assessing affective biases in perception and attention in patients with psychiatric disorders, such as phobias, depression, and addiction, but also open new avenues for rehabilitation in neurological patients with attention disorders.","[{'authorId': '2152501', 'name': 'P.

This study aimed to investigate whether an unguided Internet-based self-help intervention delivered without human support or guidance can reduce symptoms of depression in young people at risk of depression. The study also aimed to explore the usage of such sites in a real-life setting, to estimate the effects of the intervention for those who received a meaningful intervention dose and to evaluate user satisfaction. Young adults were recruited by means of a screening survey sent to all students at the University of Tromsø. Of those responding to the survey, 163 students (mean age 28.2 years) with elevated psychological distress were recruited to the trial and randomized to an Internet intervention condition or the waiting list control group. The Internet condition comprised a depression information website and a self-help Web application delivering automated cognitive behavioural therapy. The participants in the waiting list condition were free to access formal or informal help as usual. Two-thirds of the users who completed the trial initially reported an unmet need for help. The findings demonstrated that an unguided intervention was effective in reducing symptoms of depression and negative thoughts and in increasing depression literacy in young adults. Significant improvements were found at 2-month follow up. Internet-based interventions can be effective without tracking and thus constitute a minimal cost intervention for reaching a large number of people. User satisfaction among participants was high.","[{'authorId': '5004356', 'name': 'O. Lintvedt'}, {'authorId': '4743339', 'name': 'K. Griffiths'}, {'authorId': '1518298318', 'name': 'K.

They significantly change the way users interact with search systems, not only because of the voice control use and touch gestures, but also due to the dialogue-style nature of the interactions and their ability to preserve context across different queries. Predicting success and failure of such search dialogues is a new problem, and an important one for evaluating and further improving intelligent assistants. While clicks in web search have been extensively used to infer user satisfaction, their significance in search dialogues is lower due to the partial replacement of clicks with voice control, direct and voice answers, and touch gestures. In this paper, we propose an automatic method to predict user satisfaction with intelligent assistants that exploits all the interaction signals, including voice commands and physical touch gestures on the device. First, we conduct an extensive user study to measure user satisfaction with intelligent assistants, and simultaneously record all user interactions. Second, we show that the dialogue style of interaction makes it necessary to evaluate the user experience at the overall task level as opposed to the query level. Third, we train a model to predict user satisfaction, and find that interaction signals that capture the user reading patterns have a high impact: when including all available interaction signals, we are able to improve the prediction accuracy of user satisfaction from 71% to 81% over a baseline that utilizes only click and query features.","[{'authorId': '1755651', 'name': 'Julia Kiseleva'}, {'authorId': '46890115', 'name': 'Kyle Williams'}, {'authorId': '1977489', 'name': 'Ahmed Hassan Awadallah'}, {'authorId': '2057154594', 'name': 'Aidan C.

Although this pain can trigger various interpersonal difficulties (e.g., aggression, depression), it is still unclear which psychological approach might best help to regulate social pain. However, recent work suggests that temporal distance helps to facilitate adaptive coping and self-control. The present study measured ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activity during social exclusion, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine the functional relationship between “temporal distance approach,” or thinking about the distant future, and the social pain regulation process. Participants that imagined the distant future, next year, and beyond, felt less social pain and showed increased right (r)VLPFC activity during social exclusion, as compared to imagining events in the near future, such as tonight and tomorrow. Furthermore, rVLPFC activity mediated the relationship between temporal distance and social pain. On the basis of these findings, the effect of temporal distance on the process of adaptation after social exclusion is discussed. It is suggested that temporal distance moderates the process of regulating the impact of social exclusion.","[{'authorId': '4798811', 'name': 'K.

A total of 1134 responses (age, 21.7 ± 3.5 y) were included. The frequency of students having moderate-severe anxiety and depression (score ≥ 10) were ≈ 34% and 45%, respectively. The respondents’ aged ≥ 31 y had significantly lower depression score than those ≤ 20 y (P = 0.047). Males had significantly less anxiety (6.62 ± 5.70 vs 7.84 ± 5.60; P = 0.001) and depression (8.73 ± 6.84 vs 9.71 ± 7.06; P = 0.031) scores.

This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore whether individual differences in RS are mediated by differential recruitment of brain regions involved in emotional appraisal and/or cognitive control. High and low RS participants were scanned while viewing either representational paintings depicting themes of rejection and acceptance or nonrepresentational control paintings matched for positive or negative valence, arousal and interest level. Across all participants, rejection versus acceptance images activated regions of the brain involved in processing affective stimuli (posterior cingulate, insula), and cognitive control (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; medial frontal cortex). Low and high RS individuals' responses to rejection versus acceptance images were not, however, identical. Low RS individuals displayed significantly more activity in left inferior and right dorsal frontal regions, and activity in these areas correlated negatively with participants' self-report distress ratings. In addition, control analyses revealed no effect of viewing negative versus positive images in any of the areas described above, suggesting that the aforementioned activations were involved in rejection-relevant processing rather than processing negatively valenced stimuli per se. Taken together, these findings suggest that responses in regions traditionally implicated in emotional processing and cognitive control are sensitive to rejection stimuli irrespective of RS, but that low RS individuals may activate prefrontal structures to regulate distress associated with viewing such images.","[{'authorId': '2334455', 'name': 'E.

While maternal depression is known to carry long-term negative consequences for offspring, very few studies followed children longitudinally to address markers of resilience in the context of maternal depression. We focused on oxytocin (OT) and mother-child synchrony - the biological and behavioral arms of the neurobiology of affiliation - as correlates of resilience among children of depressed mothers.


METHOD
A community birth-cohort was recruited on the second postbirth day and repeatedly assessed for maternal depression across the first year. At 6 and 10 years, mothers and children underwent psychiatric diagnosis, mother-child interactions were coded for maternal sensitivity, child social engagement, and mother-child synchrony, children's OT assayed, and externalizing and internalizing problems reported.


RESULTS
Exposure to maternal depression markedly increased child propensity to develop Axis-I disorder at 6 and 10 years. Child OT showed main effects for both maternal depression and child psychiatric disorder at 6 and 10 years, with maternal or child psychopathology attenuating OT response. In contrast, maternal depression decreased synchrony at 6 years but by 10 years synchrony showed only child disorder effect, highlighting the shift from direct to indirect effects as children grow older. Path analysis linking maternal depression to child externalizing and internalizing problems at 10 years controlling for 6-year variables indicated that depression linked with decreased maternal sensitivity and child OT, which predicted reduced child engagement and synchrony, leading to higher externalizing and internalizing problems. OT and synchrony mediated the effects of maternal depression on child behavior problems and an alternative model without these resilience components provided less adequate fit.


CONCLUSIONS
Maternal depression continues to play a role in children's development beyond infancy. The mediating effects of OT and synchronous, mutually regulated interactions underscore the role of plasticity in resilience. Results emphasize the need to follow children of depressed mothers across middle childhood and construct interventions that bolster age-appropriate synchrony.","[{'authorId': '35388070', 'name': 'Avital Priel'}, {'authorId': '8594026', 'name': 'Amir Djalovski'}, {'authorId': '1397662899', 'name': 'O.

These changes in study resources and study demands, the uncertainty and confusion about educational activities, the developing fear and anxiety about the disease, and the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown measures may have a significant impact on the mental health of students. As such, this study aimed to investigate the trajectory patterns, rate of change, and longitudinal associations between study resources–demands and mental health of 141 university students from the Netherlands before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The present study employed a longitudinal design and a piecewise latent growth modeling strategy to investigate the changes in study resources and mental health over a 3 month period. The results showed that moderate levels of student resources significantly decreased before, followed by a substantial rate of increase during, lockdown. In contrast, study demands and mental health were reported to be moderate and stable throughout the study. Finally, the growth trajectories of study resources–demands and mental health were only associated before the lockdown procedures were implemented. Despite growing concerns relating to the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 on students, our study shows that the mental health during the initial COVID-19 lockdown remained relatively unchanged.","[{'authorId': '147379911', 'name': 'L.

Previous research has established, accordingly, that online purchase intentions are the product of both consumer assessments of the IT itself-specifically its perceived usefulness and ease-of-use (TAM)-and trust in the e-vendor. But these perspectives have been examined independently by IS researchers. Integrating these two perspectives and examining the factors that build online trust in an environment that lacks the typical human interaction that often leads to trust in other circumstances advances our understanding of these constructs and their linkages to behavior. 
 
Our research on experienced repeat online shoppers shows that consumer trust is as important to online commerce as the widely accepted TAM use-antecedents, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Together these variable sets explain a considerable proportion of variance in intended behavior. The study also provides evidence that online trust is built through (1) a belief that the vendor has nothing to gain by cheating, (2) a belief that there are safety mechanisms built into the Web site, and (3) by having a typical interface, (4) one that is, moreover, easy to use.","[{'authorId': '1736324', 'name': 'D.

Participants completed questionnaires assessing maternal and paternal rejection, ER strategies and emotional eating, at two time moments (M = 71 days between time moments). Latent change models were used to estimate level and change of each variable. Results: Results showed that the levels of maternal rejection, maladaptive ER and emotional eating were related. The indirect effect of the level of maternal rejection on the level of emotional eating through the level of maladaptive ER was marginally significant. On average, maternal rejection showed no change over time, whereas the other variables decreased. The changes in the variables were not related.

1cc32e72771fa8990dad9d5991837336cdadedfd,"Background: Teacher stress potentially impairs personal and professional competence and compromises productivity. Aversive emotional experience has been most comprehensively encapsulated by the phenomenon of burnout, which is particularly prominent for staff in human service sectors. Burnout reactions have been characterised as tripartite: the depletion of emotional reserves (emotional exhaustion), an increasingly cynical and negative approach towards others (depersonalisation) and a growing feeling of work-related dissatisfaction (personal accomplishment). Purpose: Few studies have investigated the emotional consequences of teachers' stress and even fewer have specifically focused on university educators. A systematic literature review was thus conducted to evaluate the extent of burnout for university teaching staff and specifically to reveal predictive variables, which may explain this experience in this understudied occupational group. Design and methods: Six databases including Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), PsychINFO and Scopus were searched using the terms burnout, university, academics, teaching staff, lecturers, research staff and faculty. Papers were limited to English language peer-reviewed empirical investigations ofburnout in full-time university teaching staff. Papers not adopting a clear operationalisation of burnout were rejected. Twelve papers met the criteria and were included in the review. A detailed data extraction form was used to reveal relevant information from each paper. Conclusions: The review revealed that staff exposure to high numbers of students, especially tuition of postgraduates, strongly predicts the experience of burnout. Other predictive variables included gender, with higher depersonalisation scores found in male teachers and female teachers typically scoring higher onthe emotional exhaustion dimension. Age also demonstrated an association, with younger staff appearing more vulnerable to emotional exhaustion. Burnout in university teachers was comparable with other service sector employees such asschoolteachers and healthcare professionals. The current review reveals a scarcity of comparative studies across different university contexts, therefore multi-site studies are required in order to control for the potential influence ofmoderating variables such as institution age when measuring burnout in university teachers.","[{'authorId': '144079310', 'name': 'J.

Research suggests that variations in emotion regulation may modify negative affect on PC. Using the process model of emotion regulation, this study examined the relationships of 2 emotion regulatory strategies, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, with negative affect and PC. Methods:A total of 224 Chinese patients with chronic pain completed self-report questionnaires measuring pain intensity (the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire), emotion regulation (the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), negative affect (the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule), and PC (the Pain Catastrophizing Scale). Multiple regression models tested the moderating and mediating effects of emotion regulation strategies on the relationship between negative affect and PC. Results:Although both cognitive reappraisal (r=−0.14) and expressive suppression (r=0.37) were significantly associated with PC in univariate analyses (P<0.05), cognitive reappraisal was not significantly associated with PC in multivariate analyses. Multiple regression models failed to show any moderating effects by expressive suppression on the link between negative affect and PC (P>0.05). After adjustment for sociodemographic and pain variables, expressive suppression mediated the association between negative affect and PC (&bgr;=0.68, Sobel test: z=3.67, P<0.001).

In addition, personality (trait anger and trait anxiety), control beliefs (Work Locus of Control), and estimation of likelihood of punishment were strongly associated with affective and behavioral responses. In particular, strong direct relationships were found between affective response variables and anxiety and locus of control, while direct relationships were found between behavioral response variables and anger and punishment.

We develop a model to link explicitly the antecedents and consequences of satisfaction in a utility-oriented framework. We estimate and test the model against alternative hypotheses from the satisfaction literature. In the process, a unique database is analyzed: a nationally representative survey of 22,300 customers of a variety of major products and services in Sweden in 1989-1990. Several well-known experimental findings of satisfaction research are tested in a field setting of national scope. For example, we find that satisfaction is best specified as a function of perceived quality and ""disconfirmation""-the extent to which perceived quality fails to match prepurchase expectations. Surprisingly, expectations do not directly affect satisfaction, as is often suggested in the satisfaction literature. In addition, we find quality which falls short of expectations has a greater impact on satisfaction and repurchase intentions than quality which exceeds expectations. Moreover, we find that disconfirmation is more likely to occur when quality is easy to evaluate. Finally, in terms of systematic variation across firms, we find the elasticity of repurchase intentions with respect to satisfaction to be lower for firms that provide high satisfaction. This implies a long-run reputation effect insulating firms which consistently provide high satisfaction.","[{'authorId': '117825482', 'name': 'E.

How can traumatic experiences in early childhood influence adult behavior, even though we have no conscious memory of them? In The Emotional Brain, Joseph LeDoux investigates the origins of human emotions and explains that many exist as part of complex neural systems that evolved to enable us to survive. Unlike conscious feelings, emotions originate in the brain at a much deeper level, says LeDoux, a leading authority in the field of neural science and one of the principal researchers profiled in Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence. In this provocative book, LeDoux explores the underlying brain mechanisms responsible for our emotions, mechanisms that are only now being revealed. The Emotional Brain presents some fascinating findings about our familiar yet little understood emotions. For example, our brains can detect danger before we even experience the feeling of being afraid. The brain also begins to initiate physical responses (heart palpitations, sweaty palms, muscle tension) before we become aware of an associated feeling of fear. Conscious feelings, says LeDoux, are somewhat irrelevant to the way the emotional brain works. He points out that emotional responses are hard-wired into the brain's circuitry, but the things that make us emotional are learned through experience. And this may be the key to understanding, even changing, our emotional makeup. Many common psychiatric problems - such as phobias or posttraumatic stress disorder - involve malfunctions in the way emotion systems learn and remember. Understanding how thesemechanisms normally work will have important consequences for how we view ourselves and how we treat emotional disorders.","[{'authorId': '2332694', 'name': 'Joseph E LeDoux'}]",2179.0,,0.0,The Emotional Brain: The Mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life,1996.0
1da75e8652b6380ae136996367eb6392483abb40,"OBJECTIVE
Irritability is a widely occurring DSM-IV symptom in youths. However, little is known about the relationship between irritability in early life and its outcomes in mid-adulthood. This study examines the extent to which youth irritability is related to adult psychiatric outcomes by testing the hypothesis that it predicts depressive and generalized anxiety disorders.


METHOD
The authors conducted a longitudinal community-based study of 631 participants whose parents were interviewed when participants were in early adolescence (mean age=13.8 years [SD=2.6]) and who were themselves interviewed 20 years later (mean age=33.2 years [SD=2.9]). Parent-reported irritability in adolescence was used to predict self-reported psychopathology, assessed by standardized diagnostic interview at 20-year follow-up.


RESULTS
Cross-sectionally, irritability in adolescence was widely associated with other psychiatric disorders. After adjustment for baseline emotional and behavioral disorders, irritability in adolescence predicted major depressive disorder (odds ratio=1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.00-1.78]), generalized anxiety disorder (odds ratio=1.72, 95% CI=1.04-2.87), and dysthymia (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.06-3.12) at 20-year follow-up. Youth irritability did not predict bipolar disorder or axis II disorders at follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
Youth irritability as reported by parents is a specific predictor of self-reported depressive and anxiety disorders 20 years later. The role of irritability in developmental psychiatry, and in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders specifically, should receive further study.","[{'authorId': '3025102', 'name': 'A.

The threat posed by COVID-19 continues and clinicians, administrators, and families need to know the life conditions associated with more psychological problems to modify them and minimize their effect on mental health. The goal was to study the life conditions of adolescents during lockdown and their association with psychological problems. A total of 226 parents of 117 girls and 109 boys (mean age: 13.9; Standard deviation: 0.28) from the community that were participants in a longitudinal study answered an online questionnaire about life conditions during lockdown and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Stepwise regression analyses controlling by previous reports of SDQ were performed. Conduct, peer, prosocial, and total problems scores increased after lockdown. After adjusting for previous measures of psychopathology, worse adolescents’ mental health during COVID-19 lockdown was associated with unhealthy activities, worsening of the relationships with others, and dysfunctional parenting style. It seems important to mitigate psychological stress in a situation of isolation due to a state of emergency by keeping the adolescent active and maintaining their daily habits and routines in a non-conflictive atmosphere and give support to parents.","[{'authorId': '5365955', 'name': 'L.

1e0f82df4fe6afd1661a587736db20348180f6ce,"The regulation of emotion is vital for adaptive behavior in a social environment. Different strategies may be adopted to achieve successful emotion regulation, ranging from attentional control (e.g., distraction) to cognitive change (e.g., reappraisal). However, there is only scarce evidence comparing the different regulation strategies with respect to their neural mechanisms and their effects on emotional experience. We, therefore, directly compared reappraisal and distraction in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with emotional pictures. In the distraction condition participants performed an arithmetic task, while they reinterpreted the emotional situation during reappraisal to downregulate emotional intensity. Both strategies were successful in reducing subjective emotional state ratings and lowered activity in the bilateral amygdala. Direct contrasts, however, showed a stronger decrease in amygdala activity for distraction when compared with reappraisal. While both strategies relied on common control areas in the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex was selectively activated for reappraisal. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate and large clusters in the parietal cortex were active in the distraction condition. Functional connectivity patterns of the amygdala activation confirmed the roles of these specific activations for the 2 emotion regulation strategies.","[{'authorId': '2197918', 'name': 'Philipp Kanske'}, {'authorId': '39587811', 'name': 'J.

1e1c7c6bc4482d4def21439fe29c4b34b59c7451,"Clinical conceptualizations of emotion that stress its disruptive influences and functional models of emotion that emphasize its adaptive aspects can be integrated into a developmental psychopathology framework. Under certain conditions, emotion regulation may develop dysregulatory aspects that can become a characteristic of an individual's coping style. This style may then jeopardize or impair functioning and become associated with symptomatic, disordered functioning. Emotional development provides a critical vantage point from which to study the development of symptomatology and psychopathology, particularly given the prevalence of emotional symptoms in various forms of psychopathology. Dimensions of emotionality that can be used to characterize dysregulation include access to the range of emotions, flexible modulation of intensity, duration, and transitions between emotions, acquisition and use of cultural display rules, and the ability to reflect on the complexity and value of one's own emotions in a self-supporting manner. Developmental psychopathology provides a framework within which to examine how emotions are regulatory, how their regulation changes over time, and under what conditions an adaptive emotion process can develop into a pattern of dysregulation that then becomes, or sustains, some symptoms of mental disorders. Such research requires samples that include children with and without risk or presence of particular mental health problems, paradigms that allow the examination of dimensions of emotionality in context and provide multiple assessments that include observations of children's reactions beyond what they themselves can report, and analyses that extend beyond simple global aggregates such as positive and negative emotion. We believe that it is particularly important to study children and their families in situations that challenge their emotional adaptation. The developmental tasks of emotional life evolve in exchanges between the child and the world of events and relationships. The emotional conditions of early childhood appear to be very important in optimizing or interfering with how the child's emotionality regulates his or her interpersonal and intrapsychic functioning and how the child learns to regulate emotion. The experiences that accrue around emotional events influence the stable aspects of the developing personality and become trait-like aspects of the person (Malatesta & Wilson, 1988). Dysregulation occurs when an emotional reaction loses breadth and flexibility. If a dysregulatory pattern becomes stabilized and part of the emotional repertoire, it is likely that this pattern is a symptom and supports other symptoms. When development and adaptation are compromised, the dysregulation has evolved into a form of psychopathology. The line between normative variations and clinical conditions is not clearly drawn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","[{'authorId': '34935701', 'name': 'P.

Negative emotions were induced and intake of comfort food and non—comfort food was measured by means of taste tests. Emotion induction was preceded by measuring individual differences in emotion regulation strategies (Study 1) or by instructions to regulate emotions in either an adaptive (reappraisal) or maladaptive (suppression) manner (Study 2). Study 3 also entailed a control condition without any regulation instructions. Relative to reappraisal and spontaneous expression, suppression led to increased food intake, but only of the comfort foods. Emotions themselves were not responsible for this effect.

The present study tests the factorial and temporal invariance of a Spanish adaptation of the ERQ on two samples of 1.980 participants aged 18–67 years. Psychometric properties, reliability, and factorial and temporal validity of the ERQ were calculated. Results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed the expected two-factor structure. Results also indicated adequate internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity. As expected, reappraisal use was positively associated with positive emotion and negatively with negative emotion, whereas suppression use was negatively associated with positive emotion and positively with negative emotion. These findings suggest that the Spanish version of the ERQ is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating strategies of emotion regulation in the Spanish-speaking population.Resumen: El Cuestionario de Regulación Emocional (ERQ; Gross y John, 2003) es ampliamente utilizado para evaluar las diferencias individuales en las estrategias de regulación emocional reevaluación y supresión.

Participants (N = 89) described how they regulated their emotions in terms of cognitive reappraisal and suppression. They also indicated their subjective well-being and level of perceived stress each day over 3 weeks. At the within-person level, cognitive reappraisal intended to increase positive emotions was positively associated with higher subjective well-being and negatively associated with perceived stress. Suppression of the expression of positive emotions was negatively associated with subjective well-being and positively associated with perceived stress. However, cognitive reappraisal intended to down-regulate negative emotions and suppression as a strategy to inhibit the expression of negative emotions were not associated with daily well-being or perceived stress. Off-days were rated as days with higher subjective well-being and lower perceived stress in contrast to working days. At the between-person level, individuals who reported more daily negative affect reported increased suppression of positive emotions, corroborating the within-person findings. Moreover, findings indicated that nurses with more years of experience in the job reported higher subjective well-being and less perceived stress.

1ee394187dafa881826e392659df13b8d4b01fc3,"ABSTRACT Background/Study context: Adult age differences in emotion processing have been attributed to age-related decline in earlier emotional perception and age-related bias in later emotional regulation. Yet, the relationship between the processes of early emotion perception and bias in emotional regulation and their influence on behavioral outcomes remains unclear. Event-related potentials (ERPs) have the temporal precision to allow for the online measure of neurophysiological activity and provide potential insight into the complex dynamics of emotion processing and aging. Methods: ERPs were used as the primary measure to examine the hypotheses that younger adults will differ in emotional arousal and emotional bias as represented by the early P1 waveform and later P3 waveform, respectively. Thirty-two younger and older adults (16 each) performed a facial emotion discrimination task in which they identified standardized angry, happy, or neutral expressions of faces from the NimStim database. Results: Younger adults showed a greater P1 ERP for angry faces relative to happy faces at parietal channels, while older adults did not exhibit any emotional modulation of the P1. In contrast, both younger and older adults showed a greater late P3 ERP for angry faces compared to happy faces. Conclusion: The authors’ results provide evidence for an age-related deficit in early emotion perception and autonomic arousal. Younger adults, but not older adults, exhibited a pattern of neurophysiological activity believed to reflect preconscious and reflexive identification of threat. Despite these age group differences in early emotion processing, younger and older adults did not exhibit differences in neurophysiological processes believed to reflect emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '47992201', 'name': 'J.

1f2881d60265f6f66aa1fdf32612d49b3ff0c336,"Emotion regulation can be defined as the intrinsic and extrinsic processes associated with the activation of an emotion and its management over time (Cole, Martin, & Dennis, 2004; Gross, 2014). Emotion regulation strategies play a central role in determining human behavior since they have a pervasive impact on the functioning of an individual, influencing the adaptive or maladaptive role of a given emotional experience in a particular context (Cicchetti, Ganiban, & Barnett, 1991; Cole et al., 2004; Gross, 2014). Accordingly, emotion regulation has been referred to as a transdiagnostic process (Aldao, 2012; Sloan & Kring, 2010), because many psychological disorders are characterized by problems related to emotion and emotion regulation (Werner & Gross, 2010). Transdiagnostic processes are common factors that cut across different disorders and that underlie their development and/or course (Iverach, Menzies, & Menzies, 2014; Sloan & Kring, 2010). Indeed, recent research on psychopathology has shifted away from analyzing factors that are specific to each individual psychological disorder to investigating common underlying dimensions of functioning (Caspi et al., 2014; Hong & Cheung, 2014). For example, accumulating evidence shows that information processing biases are transdiagnostic processes because they occur in a variety of disorders, like anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder or eating disorders (Aspen, Darcy, & Lock, 2013; Fraire & Ollendick, 2013). Specific to emotion regulation it is thought that maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., avoidance) increase the risk of psychopathology in general, while adaptive strategies (e.g., problem solving) function as protective factors (Aldao & NolenHoeksema, 2010; Garnefski & Kraaij, 2007). The present investigation was designed in accordance with this framework and aimed to explore the relation between adaptive and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and a multitude of psychological symptoms.There is some support for the distinction between adaptive (e.g., reappraisal) and maladaptive (e.g., rumination) cognitive emotion regulation strategies (Aldao, 2012; Dominguez-Sanchez et al., 2013; Jermann et al., 2006; Werner & Gross, 2010, cf. Campos, Walle, Dahl, & Main, 2011; Tuna & Bozo, 2012). Indeed, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies seem to be reliably associated with in cr ea sed psych opathology (Aldao & Nol en -Hoeksem a , 2012a; Joormann, Yoon, & Siemer, 2010; Werner & Gross, 2010). As for adaptive strategies, the converse would be expected (i.e., reliable negative associations with psychopathology) but this finding is less consistent. In some studies, no relation between adaptive strategies and psychopathology is reported (Dominguez-Sanchez et al., 2013; Ehring, Tuschen-Caffier, Schnulle, Fischer, & Gross, 2010; Green et al., 2011). In a meta-analytic review, using normative and clinical samples, adaptive strategies were found to be associated with decreased psychopathology, but the associations had small to medium effect sizes (Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Schweizer, 2010). This plethora of results influenced Aldao and Nolen-Hoeksema's (2010) transdiagnostic view of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation, stating that the use of maladaptive strategies might play a more central role in psychopathology than not using adaptive strategies.However, in certain circumstances, adaptive emotion regulation strategies may be relevant (Aldao & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2012b) or even fundamental for understanding mental disorders. Evidence for this comes from Kelly, Lydecker, and Mazzeo (2012), who show that all adaptive strategies analyzed (with the exception of acceptance) moderated the effect of eating disorder on binge eating frequency, while none of the maladaptive ones did.

1f2f1f9018249cbdbdbd6f707c87b6c198f0e287,"Yoga therapy is a newly emerging, self-regulating complementary and integrative healthcare (CIH) practice. It is growing in its professionalization, recognition and utilization with a demonstrated commitment to setting practice standards, educational and accreditation standards, and promoting research to support its efficacy for various populations and conditions. However, heterogeneity of practice, poor reporting standards, and lack of a broadly accepted understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in yoga therapy limits the structuring of testable hypotheses and clinical applications. Current proposed frameworks of yoga-based practices focus on the integration of bottom-up neurophysiological and top-down neurocognitive mechanisms. In addition, it has been proposed that phenomenology and first person ethical inquiry can provide a lens through which yoga therapy is viewed as a process that contributes towards eudaimonic well-being in the experience of pain, illness or disability. In this article we build on these frameworks, and propose a model of yoga therapy that converges with Polyvagal Theory (PVT). PVT links the evolution of the autonomic nervous system to the emergence of prosocial behaviors and posits that the neural platforms supporting social behavior are involved in maintaining health, growth and restoration. This explanatory model which connects neurophysiological patterns of autonomic regulation and expression of emotional and social behavior, is increasingly utilized as a framework for understanding human behavior, stress and illness. Specifically, we describe how PVT can be conceptualized as a neurophysiological counterpart to the yogic concept of the gunas, or qualities of nature. Similar to the neural platforms described in PVT, the gunas provide the foundation from which behavioral, emotional and physical attributes emerge. We describe how these two different yet analogous frameworks—one based in neurophysiology and the other in an ancient wisdom tradition—highlight yoga therapy’s promotion of physical, mental and social wellbeing for self-regulation and resilience. This parallel between the neural platforms of PVT and the gunas of yoga is instrumental in creating a translational framework for yoga therapy to align with its philosophical foundations. Consequently, yoga therapy can operate as a distinct practice rather than fitting into an outside model for its utilization in research and clinical contexts.","[{'authorId': '11045269', 'name': 'Marlysa B.

On 31 January 2020, a new type of coronavirus was first confirmed in Italy and spread rapidly across the country leading to a national lockdown. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the impact of the public health emergency due to COVID-19 on individual's mental health among 299 Italian adults after a month of home isolation due to COVID-19.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study design. Adults of the general population were invited to a voluntary online health survey.


METHODS
Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to examine diverse psycho-social and stressful contextual factors associated with symptoms of psychopathology.


RESULTS
Results indicated that females reported higher symptoms of depression, anxiety and circadian rhythm dysregulation, than males. Age and the capacity to adapt to a new environment and to cope with illness were negatively associated with all symptoms of psychopathology. Conversely, engaging in verbally aggressive behaviours and having experienced stressful events related to COVID-19 were positively related to psychopathological symptoms. Finally, social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and substance use during the past months was related to circadian rhythm dysregulation.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings of this study raise particular concern about psychological well-being considering the negative associations between stressful events during the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms of psychological distress, and perceived social support. These results have possible significant clinical implications.","[{'authorId': '134693682', 'name': 'Simone Amendola'}, {'authorId': '8864699', 'name': 'Valentina Spensieri'}, {'authorId': '4181210', 'name': 'M.

1f67281e0ef4d67582d1be2df7954620f8c061c7,"Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a common chronic pain condition that affects at least 2% of the adult population in the USA and other regions in the world where FM is studied. Prevalence rates in some regions have not been ascertained and may be influenced by differences in cultural norms regarding the definition and attribution of chronic pain states. Chronic, widespread pain is the defining feature of FM, but patients may also exhibit a range of other symptoms, including sleep disturbance, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, headache, and mood disorders. Although the etiology of FM is not completely understood, the syndrome is thought to arise from influencing factors such as stress, medical illness, and a variety of pain conditions in some, but not all patients, in conjunction with a variety of neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine disturbances. These include reduced levels of biogenic amines, increased concentrations of excitatory neurotransmitters, including substance P, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. A unifying hypothesis is that FM results from sensitization of the central nervous system. Establishing diagnosis and evaluating effects of therapy in patients with FM may be difficult because of the multifaceted nature of the syndrome and overlap with other chronically painful conditions. Diagnostic criteria, originally developed for research purposes, have aided our understanding of this patient population in both research and clinical settings, but need further refinement as our knowledge about chronic widespread pain evolves. Outcome measures, borrowed from clinical research in pain, rheumatology, neurology, and psychiatry, are able to distinguish treatment response in specific symptom domains. Further work is necessary to validate these measures in FM. In addition, work is under way to develop composite response criteria, intended to address the multidimensional nature of this syndrome. A range of medical treatments, including antidepressants, opioids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, sedatives, muscle relaxants, and antiepileptics, have been used to treat FM. Nonpharmaceutical treatment modalities, including exercise, physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, and cognitive behavioral therapy, can be helpful. Few of these approaches have been demonstrated to have clear-cut benefits in randomized controlled trials. However, there is now increased interest as more effective treatments are developed and our ability to accurately measure effect of treatment has improved. The multifaceted nature of FM suggests that multimodal individualized treatment programs may be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes in patients with this syndrome.","[{'authorId': '6092548', 'name': 'P.

To assess disordered online social networking use via modified diagnostic criteria for substance dependence, and to examine its association with difficulties with emotion regulation and substance use.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional survey study targeting undergraduate students. Associations between disordered online social networking use, internet addiction, deficits in emotion regulation and alcohol use problems were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses of covariance.


SETTING
A large University in the Northeastern United States.


PARTICIPANTS
Undergraduate students (n = 253, 62.8% female, 60.9% white, age mean = 19.68, standard deviation = 2.85), largely representative of the target population. The response rate was 100%.


MEASUREMENTS
Disordered online social networking use, determined via modified measures of alcohol abuse and dependence, including DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale and the Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilt, Eye-opener (CAGE) screen, along with the Young Internet Addiction Test, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II, White Bear Suppression Inventory and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale.


FINDINGS
Disordered online social networking use was present in 9.7% [n = 23; 95% confidence interval (5.9, 13.4)] of the sample surveyed, and significantly and positively associated with scores on the Young Internet Addiction Test (P < 0.001), greater difficulties with emotion regulation (P = 0.003) and problem drinking (P = 0.03).


CONCLUSIONS
The use of online social networking sites is potentially addictive. Modified measures of substance abuse and dependence are suitable in assessing disordered online social networking use. Disordered online social networking use seems to arise as part of a cluster of symptoms of poor emotion regulation skills and heightened susceptibility to both substance and non-substance addiction.","[{'authorId': '2743232', 'name': 'J.

Although the brain areas involved in emotional response and in the recognition of others' emotions have been reported, the neural bases of individual differences in affective style remain to be elucidated. Alexithymia, i.e., impairment of the ability to identify and communicate one's emotional state, influences how emotions are regulated. Alexithymia has been hypothesized to involve anterior cingulate dysfunction. Therefore, the authors searched for differential cerebral regional activation in response to emotional stimuli in subjects with alexithymia.


METHOD
Two groups of eight men each were selected from 437 healthy subjects on the basis of high or low scores on the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the authors compared the two groups for their regional cerebral activation in response to the presentation of pictures with validated positive or negative arousal capabilities.


RESULTS
Men with alexithymia demonstrated less cerebral activation in the left mediofrontal-paracingulate cortex in response to highly negative stimuli and more activation in the anterior cingulate, mediofrontal cortex, and middle frontal gyrus in response to highly positive stimuli than men without alexithymia.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings provide direct evidence that alexithymia, a personality trait playing a role in affect regulation, is linked with differences in anterior cingulate and mediofrontal activity during emotional stimuli processing.","[{'authorId': '2233824', 'name': 'S.

1fba6e0cbf47935c4c1efe59b3f7b3421c6d696b,"Objective The onset and chronification of pain often has devastating consequences on the physical and mental functioning of individuals. Medical interventions are quite efficacious in reducing pain levels. However, changes in physical and mental health status after medical interventions are not proportional. In the past decades, rational/irrational beliefs, especially catastrophizing, have contributed to a better understanding of the pain experience. This study explores whether pain reduction efforts are more beneficial for individuals scoring high in rational thinking (moderation). Methods The study design was longitudinal. Patients were assessed twice, 2 weeks prior to the start of medical treatment at the pain clinic and 6 months after. A total of 163 patients with heterogeneous pain (mostly low back and neck pain) participated in the study. Their mean age was 58.74 years (SD = 14.28) and 61.3% were female. Results Overall, there was a reduction in pain intensity (t = 4.25, p < 0.001, d = 0.32). An improvement in physical functioning (t = 4.02, p < 0.001, d = 0.19), but not mental health (t = -0.66, p = 0.511, d = 0.11) was also observed. In the regression analyses, a decrease in pain intensity was moderately associated with improved physical health (β = 0.87, t = 4.96, p < 0.001, R2 change = 0.177). This association was found to be moderated by frustration tolerance (β = -0.49, t = -2.80, p = 0.006, R2 change = 0.039). Specifically, post hoc analyses indicated that changes in pain intensity only correlated with changes in physical health when patients reported high frustration tolerance levels (r = 0.47, p = 0.006, M = 7, n = 32), but not when patients were intolerant to frustration (r = 0.28, p = 0.078, M = 17, n = 41). Conclusion The results suggest that frustration tolerance may render adaptive by facilitating the positive effect that a reduction in pain intensity has on physical health status. The study findings are discussed in the context of personalized therapy with an emphasis on how to maximize the effectiveness of current interventions for pain.","[{'authorId': '1401314317', 'name': 'C.

To investigate the emotional and neurobehavioural status of patients suffering from chronic pain.


METHODS
Fifteen male patients with chronic lower back pain and 15 healthy control subjects were studied for approximately six months. Pain was measured using a visual analogue scale. The WHO Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery (NCTB) was used to assess neurobehavioural effects of environmental and occupational exposures.


RESULTS
Visual analogue scale results demonstrated a modest range of reported pain (mean [± SD] 62.0 ± 10.8) in chronic pain patients, whereas control subjects reported no measurable pain. With the NCTB, it was found that scores of negative mood state, including anger-hostility, depression-dejection, fatigue-inertia and tension-anxiety in pain patients were significantly higher than scores in the control subjects. By contrast, scores of positive mood state (vigour-activity) in chronic pain patients were lower than those in the control group. The NCTB scores of the Santa Ana Dexterity and Pursuit Aiming II tests in chronic lower back pain patients were lower than those of the control group. Scores for other NCTB subtests, including the Digit Span, Benton Visual Retention and Digit Symbol tests, were not significantly different compared with controls. <span style=""font-weight:

Academic performance was evaluated by the grade point average (GPA). The results showed that academic burnout was directly and positively associated with maladaptive coping but directly and negatively explained by adaptive coping. In addition, emotional exhaustion was significantly and negatively predicted by optimism. Finally, academic performance was significantly predicted by academic burnout.

A growing body of research focuses on the development and correlates of emotion dysregulation, or deficits in the ability to regulate intense and shifting emotional states. Current models of psychopathology have incorporated the construct of emotion dysregulation, suggesting its unique and interactive contributions, along with childhood disruptive experiences and negative affect, in producing symptomatic distress. Some researchers have suggested that emotion dysregulation is simply a variant of high negative affect. The aim of this study was to assess the construct and incremental validity of self-reported emotion dysregulation over and above childhood trauma and negative affect in predicting a range of psychopathology.


METHOD
Five hundred thirty individuals aged 18 to 77 years (62% female) were recruited from the waiting areas of the general medical and obstetric/gynecologic clinics in an urban public hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Participants completed a battery of self-report measures obtained by interview, including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Emotion Dysregulation Scale. Regression analyses examined the unique and incremental associations of these self-report measurements of childhood traumatic experiences, negative affect, and emotion dysregulation with concurrent structured interview-based measurements of psychiatric distress and history of self-destructive behaviors. These measures included the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, the Short Drug Abuse Screening Test, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Global Adaptive Functioning Scale from the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. The presented data were collected between 2005 and 2009.


RESULTS
Regression models including age, gender, childhood trauma, negative affect, and emotion dysregulation were significantly (P ≤ .001) associated with each of the study's criterion variables, accounting for large portions of the variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms (R² = 0.21), alcohol and drug abuse (R² = 0.28 and 0.21, respectively), depression (R² = 0.55), adaptive functioning (R² = 0.14), and suicide history (omnibus χ² = 74.80, P < .001). Emotion dysregulation added statistically significant (P < .01) incremental validity to each regression model (β = 0.25, 0.34, 0.35, 0.34, and -0.18, and Wald = 24.43, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS

The multifaceted nature of inhibitory deficits requires careful specification in any explanatory accounts of psychopathology. A host of brain regions and neural interconnections are involved in response inhibition; neural models are likely to be complex at the levels of neurotransmitter systems and white‐matter tracts. Despite the substantial heritability of ADHD and the substantial continuity of early‐onset forms of aggression, developmental processes (including gene‐environment correlations and interactions) and transactional models are crucial to the unfolding of regulated versus dysregulated behavioral outcomes. Thus, stressful prenatal and childhood environments must be investigated with as much precision as genetic loci and neural pathways. Differentiating executive inhibition (believed to be largely dopaminergic and frontal/frontal‐striatal in nature) from motivational inhibition (believed to be largely noradrenergic/serotonergic and limbic in nature) is necessary to distinguish subtypes of youth with attentional and aggressive problems, and to differentiate key etiologic processes. Indeed, the executive function deficits in children with ADHD appear to independent of their emotion dysregulation, which is specific to an aggressive subgroup. Sex differences in response inhibition and sex differences in its linkages to psychopathology are relatively unexplored. For progress in subsequent research to occur, the following are required: precision in measurement at both biological and behavioral levels; contrasts with clinical comparison samples and comorbid groups (as well as normal control samples); prospective longitudinal investigations; and attention to both developmental processes and contextual variables, including stressful life events, socialization practices, and cultural parameters.","[{'authorId': '3643684', 'name': 'S.

Psychopaths belong to a larger group of persons with antisocial personality disorder and are characterized by an inability to have emotional involvement and by the repeated violation of the rights of others. It was hypothesized that this behavior might be the consequence of deficient fear conditioning.


OBJECTIVE
To study the cerebral, peripheral, and subjective correlates of fear conditioning in criminal psychopaths and healthy control subjects.


DESIGN
An aversive differential pavlovian delay conditioning paradigm with slides of neutral faces serving as conditioned and painful pressure as unconditioned stimuli.


SETTING
The Department of Medical Psychology at the University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.


PARTICIPANTS
Ten male psychopaths as defined by the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised and 10 age- and education-matched healthy male controls. The psychopaths were criminal offenders on bail and waiting for their trial or were on parole. The healthy controls were recruited from the community.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Brain activation based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, electrodermal responses, emotional valence, arousal, and contingency ratings.


RESULTS
The healthy controls showed enhanced differential activation in the limbic-prefrontal circuit (amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, and anterior cingulate) during the acquisition of fear and successful verbal and autonomic conditioning. The psychopaths displayed no significant activity in this circuit and failed to show conditioned skin conductance and emotional valence ratings, although contingency and arousal ratings were normal.


CONCLUSION
This dissociation of emotional and cognitive processing may be the neural basis of the lack of anticipation of aversive events in criminal psychopaths.","[{'authorId': '145198983', 'name': 'N.

In the second section, I use the process model of emotion regulation to selectively review evidence that different regulation strategies have different consequences. In the third section, I introduce the extended process model of emotion regulation; this model considers emotion regulation to be one type of valuation, and distinguishes three emotion regulation stages (identification, selection, implementation).

These were factor analyzed and the components were correlated. Results: ODD has one underlying factor, whereas the parent-rated SNAP has nine underlying factors. ODD items grouped together with emotional lability and irritability items, which did not group with CD. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the separation of ODD and CD but not ODD and emotion dysregulation.

Method: Studies comparing resting-state HRV recordings in patients with an anxiety disorder as a primary diagnosis and healthy controls were considered for meta-analysis. Results: Meta-analyses were based on 36 articles, including 2086 patients with an anxiety disorder and 2294 controls. Overall, anxiety disorders were characterized by lower HRV [high frequency (HF): Hedges’ g = −0.29. 95% CI: −0.41 to −0.17, p < 0.001; time domain: Hedges’ g = −0.45, 95% CI: −0.57 to −0.33, p < 0.001] than controls.

Yoga provides training of mind and body to bring emotional balance. We argue that children and young people need such tools to listen inward to their bodies, feelings, and ideas. Yoga may assist them in developing in sound ways, to strengthen themselves, and be contributing social beings. First, we address how children and young people in today’s world face numerous expectations and constant stimulation through the Internet and other media and communication technologies. One reason why children experience stress and mental health challenges is that globalization exposes the youth all over the world to various new demands, standards, and options. There is also increased pressure to succeed in school, partly due to increased competition but also a diverse range of options available for young people in contemporary times than in the past. Our argument also partially rests on the fact that modern society offers plenty of distractions and unwelcome attractions, especially linked to new media technologies. The dominant presence of multimedia devices and the time spent on them by children are clear indicators of the shift in lifestyles and priorities of our new generation. While these media technologies are valuable resources in children and young people’s lives for communication, learning, and entertainment, they also result in constant competition for youngster’s attention. A main concept in our article is that yoga may help children and young people cope with stress and thus, contribute positively to balance in life, well-being, and mental health.

Similarly, yoga in schools helps students improve resilience, mood, and self-regulation skills pertaining to emotions and stress.","[{'authorId': '113747589', 'name': 'Ingunn Hagen'}, {'authorId': '46483059', 'name': 'U.

Results indicated that interparental aggression was negatively associated with caregivers’ and children’s emotion regulation, but there were specific caregiver behaviors that moderated the association between interparental aggression and children’s emotion regulation. Specifically, caregivers’ sensitivity to children’s emotions during play, listening effectively to children’s expression of sadness, and their own capacity for emotion regulation buffered the association between exposure to interparental aggression and children’s emotion regulation.

The most commonly used instrument for measuring anger is the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2; Spielberger, 1999). This study further examines the validity of the STAXI-2 and compares anger scores between several clinical and nonclinical samples.


METHOD
Reliability, concurrent, and construct validity were investigated in Dutch undergraduate students (N = 764), a general population sample (N = 1211), and psychiatric outpatients (N = 226).


RESULTS
The results support the reliability and validity of the STAXI-2. Concurrent validity was strong, with meaningful correlations between the STAXI-2 scales and anger-related constructs in both clinical and nonclinical samples. Importantly, patients showed higher experience and expression of anger than the general population sample. Additionally, forensic outpatients with addiction problems reported higher Anger Expression-Out than general psychiatric outpatients.


CONCLUSION
Our conclusion is that the STAXI-2 is a suitable instrument to measure both the experience and the expression of anger in both general and clinical populations.","[{'authorId': '6288128', 'name': 'M.

Participants: A sample (n = 605) of undergraduate students was recruited from 2 midwestern universities during the 2007–2008 academic year. Methods: Hierarchal (or sequential) regression analysis examined whether the inter- and intrapersonal resilience and mental health measures contributed to explaining variance in the response variables of university cumulative grade point average (GPA) and university sense of belonging. Results: The intrapersonal resilience factors contributed to explaining variance in cumulative GPA in addition to aptitude and achievement. Furthermore, there was a strong statistical correlation between the inter- and intrapersonal resilience factors and mental health. Conclusions: The demands in college are significant and there is a need for more research on the concept of resilience as it relates to college health and academic persistence.","[{'authorId': '6096022', 'name': 'Michael T.

235ff5c177ef94ab02e3d2443cbb9a86a957d248,"The exponential growth of the service economy has increased the attention that organizational researchers have paid to the concept of emotional labor. Although much progress has been made in the field, few studies have provided an integrated picture of how individual dispositions, perceived display rules, and emotional labor behaviors shape employee outcomes. To clarify and compare results across this growing body of literature, a quantitative review was developed, along with a theoretically derived path diagram of key emotional labor constructs. Evidence from our structural meta-analytic model based on 116 primary studies demonstrates that examining affective dispositions and emotional labor constructs and the pattern of positive and negative results helps to clarify and add specificity to the literature. Results were consistent with the perspective that surface acting emotion regulation strategies have a pattern of negative relationships with work outcomes of job satisfaction and stress/exhaustion (but not with job performance), whereas deep acting emotion regulation strategies have a pattern of positive relationships with all of these work outcomes.","[{'authorId': '1401405221', 'name': 'J.

The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to 4 weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. Methods A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 6th 2020. Eighteen thousand one hundred forty-seven individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress, and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors. Results Endorsement rates for PTSS were 6,604 (37%), 3,084 (17.3%) for depression, 3,700 (20.8%) for anxiety, 1,301 (7.3%) for insomnia, 3,895 (21.8%) for high perceived stress and 4,092 (22.9%) for adjustment disorder. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS. Having a loved one deceased by COVID-19 was associated with PTSS, depression, perceived stress, and insomnia. Conclusion We found high rates of negative mental health outcomes in the Italian general population 3 weeks into the COVID-19 lockdown measures and different COVID-19 related risk factors. These findings warrant further monitoring on the Italian population’s mental health.","[{'authorId': '15701121', 'name': 'R. Rossi'}, {'authorId': '5720766', 'name': 'V.

2420ef2b733abb270d46985d998743d062fb5af6,"This study adds to the growing body of research on work meetings and extends the emotional labour literature beyond a service context by examining the relationship between surface acting during meetings and perceived meeting effectiveness. Additionally, the relationships of surface acting during meetings and perceived meeting effectiveness with time-lagged reports of intention to quit and emotional exhaustion 3 months later were investigated. Structural equation modelling of data from 178 working adults revealed negative relationships between surface acting and perceptions of meeting effectiveness. Perceived meeting effectiveness partially mediated the relationship between surface acting and both intention to quit and emotional exhaustion 3 months later. These findings expand both the limited research on perceived meeting effectiveness and the surface acting nomological network to include a consideration that expressing inauthentic emotions in meetings (surface acting) may relate to the perceived effectiveness of the meeting. As well, both surface acting during meetings and perceived meeting effectiveness may relate to how emotionally exhausted employees feel and their intentions to seek other employment. Given the cost and pervasiveness of meetings in daily organizational life and their potential effects on the well-being of employees, understanding how to make meetings effective is paramount - particularly if researchers and practitioners want to better understand how perceived meeting effectiveness may be related to various employee outcomes. Practitioner points Organizations use up to 15% of their personnel budget on meetings, yet meetings are often considered ineffective by employees., Organizations wishing to increase the perceived effectiveness of their meetings can work to reduce the degree to which employees feel they have to express inauthentic emotion in meetings., In turn, expressing inauthentic emotion in meetings related to employees' future emotional exhaustion and intent to leave the organization","[{'authorId': '8231728', 'name': 'L.

The vagal tank theory, building on neurophysiological, cognitive and social psychology approaches, will introduce a physiological indicator for self-regulation that has mainly been ignored from cognitive and social psychology, cardiac vagal control (also referred to as cardiac vagal activity). Cardiac vagal control reflects the contribution of the vagus nerve, the main nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system, to cardiac regulation. We propose cardiac vagal control to be an indicator of how efficiently self-regulatory resources are mobilized and used. Three systematic levels of cardiac vagal control analysis are suggested: resting, reactivity, and recovery. Based on this physiological indicator we derive the metaphor of the vagal tank, which can get depleted and replenished. Overall, the vagal tank theory will enable to integrate previous findings from different disciplines and to stimulate new research questions, predictions, and designs regarding self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '143602110', 'name': 'S.

24cbd5054d04f0c537ef8e59ca0969989510d0f2,"Depression in adults is associated with deficits in a number of cognitive domains, however it remains less clear how early in development theses deficits can be detected in early onset depression. There are several different hypotheses about the links between cognitive function and depression. For example, it has been argued that executive function deficits contribute to emotion regulation difficulties, which in turn increase risk for depression. Further, it has been suggested that some cognitive deficits, such as episodic memory, may reflect hippocampal abnormalities linked to both depression and episodic memory. We examined these questions in adolescents participating in a longitudinal study of preschool onset depression. We measured cognitive function at adolescence using the National Institutes of Health toolbox (vocabulary, processing speed, executive function, working memory and episodic memory), and examined relationships of cognitive deficits to depression, emotion regulation, life stress and adversity, as well as hippocampal volume trajectories over three imaging assessments starting at school age. Depression related deficits in episodic memory were found. Youths with either current and past depression showed episodic memory deficits even after controlling for other psychopathology and family income. Depression severity, emotion dysregulation, and life stress/adversity all predicted episodic memory impairment, as did smaller intercepts and slopes of hippocampal growth over time. Modest relationships of depression to hippocampal volume and strong relationships between emotion regulation and both episodic memory and hippocampal volume were found. These data are consistent with prior work in adults linking depression, episodic memory, emotion regulation, life stress/adversity, and hippocampal volume in adults and suggest similar relations are evident as early as adolescence when memory systems are under development.","[{'authorId': '2478230', 'name': 'D.

This study is a first empirical test of three causal linkages implied by the appraisal-based comforting model. Participants (N = 258) talked about an upsetting event with a confederate trained to display low, moderate, or high levels of person centeredness and nonverbal immediacy. After the conversation, participants completed several scales. Latent composite structural equation modeling was used to examine the model, which showed that person-centered and immediate emotional support exerted a direct effect on emotional improvement. Above and beyond this direct effect, personcentered comfort also encouraged people to verbalize their thoughts and emotions. These verbalizations facilitated cognitive appraisals, which in turn exerted a strong direct effect on emotional improvement. Mediation analyses further suggested that verbalizations of positive emotion words in conjunction with reappraisals partially mediated the influence of person-centered comfort on emotional improvement.","[{'authorId': '143622306', 'name': 'Susanne M.

For this initial unrestricted model, researchers have often recommended and used fit indices to estimate the number of factors to retain. Despite the logical appeal of this approach, little is known about the actual accuracy of fit indices in the estimation of data dimensionality. The present study aimed to reduce this gap by systematically evaluating the performance of 4 commonly used fit indices-the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)-in the estimation of the number of factors with categorical variables, and comparing it with what is arguably the current golden rule, Horn's (1965) parallel analysis. The results indicate that the CFI and TLI provide nearly identical estimations and are the most accurate fit indices, followed at a step below by the RMSEA, and then by the SRMR, which gives notably poor dimensionality estimates. Difficulties in establishing optimal cutoff values for the fit indices and the general superiority of parallel analysis, however, suggest that applied researchers are better served by complementing their theoretical considerations regarding dimensionality with the estimates provided by the latter method.","[{'authorId': '144367155', 'name': 'L.

In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from normal adult observers to determine whether this ""attentional blink"" reflects a suppression of perceptual processes or an impairment in postperceptual processes. No suppression was observed during the attentional blink interval for ERP components corresponding to sensory processing (the P1 and N1 components) or semantic analysis (the N400 component). However, complete suppression was observed for an ERP component that has been hypothesized to reflect the updating of working memory (the P3 component). Results indicate that the attentional blink reflects an impairment in a postpercep-tual stage of processing. Over the past several decades, the vast majority of studies of visual attention have examined the operation of attention across space. In the visual search task, for example, a target item must be detected within an array of distractor items that are presented at different locations from the target. In recent years, however, there has been growing interest in the operation of attention over time rather than over space. Time-based attention has typically been studied with the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, which can be thought of as a time-based analog of the visual search task. Specifically, whereas visual search tasks typically require the observer to detect a target in an array of items presented simultaneously at different locations, RSVP tasks typically require the observer to detect a target in a sequence of items presented sequentially at a single location. Because visual search and RSVP are so analogous, it seems reasonable to suppose that the same mechanisms of attention would operate in both tasks. However, space plays a uniquely important role in the organization of the primate visual system, and several investigators have proposed that space also plays a unique role in visual attention (Hillyard & special attentional mechanisms may be used for space-based attention that are not available for time-based attention. In this study we addressed this issue by comparing the nature of attentional selection in a time-based attention task with previous findings from space-based attention tasks. Much of the recent interest in time-based attention derives from a phenomenon that was independently discovered by Broadbent and Broadbent (1987) and by Sperling and colleagues (Reeves & Sperling, 1986; Weichselgartner & Sperling, 1987) and that was …","[{'authorId': '2250813190', 'name': 'E.

PurposeChatbot users’ communication experience with disembodied conversational agents was compared with instant messaging (IM) users’ communication experience with human conversational agents. The purpose of this paper is to identify what affects users’ intention to reuse and whether they perceive any difference between the two.


Design/methodology/approachA conceptual model was developed based on computer-mediated communication (CMC) and interpersonal communication theories. Data were collected online from four different continents (North America, Europe, Asia and Australia). Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to examine the research model.


FindingsThe findings mainly reveal that media richness and social presence positively influence trust and reuse intention through task attraction and social attraction; IM users reported significantly higher scores in terms of communication experience, perceived attractiveness of the conversational agent, and trust than chatbot users; users’ trust in the conversational agents is mainly determined by perceived task attraction.


Research limitations/implicationsCustomers’ evaluation of the communication environment is positively related to their perceived competence of the conversational agent which ultimately affect their intention to reuse chatbot/IM. The findings reveal determinants of chatbot/IM adoption which have rarely been mentioned by previous work.


Practical implicationsPractitioners should note that consumers in general still prefer to interact with human conversational agents. Practitioners should contemplate how to combine chatbot and human resources effectively to deliver the best customer service.


Originality/valueThis study goes beyond the Computer as Social Actor paradigm and Technology Acceptance Model to understand chatbot and IM adoption. It is among one of the first studies that compare chatbot and IM use experience in the tourism and hospitality literature.

To identify the types of interventions that are effective in reducing stress in student nurses, and to make recommendations for future research.


BACKGROUND
Student nurses experience significant stress during their training and this may contribute to sickness, absence and attrition. Given the global shortage of nurses and high dropout rates amongst trainees, the importance for developing stress management programmes for student nurses is becoming more evident. To date, only one review has examined the effectiveness of stress interventions for student nurses, but the emergence of recent literature warrants a new review.


DATA SOURCES
Research papers published between April 1981 and April 2008 were identified from the following databases: Medline, CINAHL, Behavioral Sciences Collection, IBSS and Psychinfo.


REVIEW METHODS
A quantitative systematic review with narrative synthesis was conducted. Key terms included 'nurses OR nursing OR nurse', 'student OR students', 'intervention', 'stress OR burnout'. In addition to database searches, reference lists of selected papers were scanned, key authors were contacted and manual searches of key journals were conducted.


RESULTS
The most effective interventions provided skills for coping with stressful situations (typically relaxation) and skills for changing maladaptive cognitions. Interventions which promoted skills to reduce the intensity or number of stressors were also successful. In most cases, stress interventions did not improve academic performance.


CONCLUSION
The design of stress interventions should be driven by theory. Future studies should focus on interface and organizational factors and the long-term benefits of interventions for student nurses are yet to be demonstrated.","[{'authorId': '50182289', 'name': 'Niall Galbraith'}, {'authorId': '50766635', 'name': 'K.

Sixty participants with these disorders and 30 control participants watched an emotion-provoking film and completed self-report measures of their experience and regulation of emotions. The film elicited similar increases in negative emotion for clinical and nonclinical participants; however, clinical participants judged their resulting emotions as less acceptable and suppressed their emotions to a greater extent. The higher level of suppression in the clinical group was attributable to females in the clinical group suppressing their emotions more than females in the nonclinical group. For all participants, high levels of suppression were associated with increased negative emotion during the film and during a postfilm recovery period. Further analyses showed that appraising emotions as unacceptable mediated the relationship between negative emotion intensity and use of suppression in the clinical group. This study extends the literature on emotion regulation to a clinical sample and suggests that judging emotions as unacceptable and suppressing emotions may be important aspects of the phenomenology of emotional disorders.","[{'authorId': '1398858372', 'name': 'L.

METHODS: A 2-year, longitudinal, panel study was performed with a general elementary and secondary school population in Singapore, including 3034 children in grades 3 (N = 743), 4 (N = 711), 7 (N = 916), and 8 (N = 664). Several hypothesized risk and protective factors for developing or overcoming pathological gaming were measured, including weekly amount of game play, impulsivity, social competence, depression, social phobia, anxiety, and school performance. RESULTS: The prevalence of pathological gaming was similar to that in other countries (∼9%). Greater amounts of gaming, lower social competence, and greater impulsivity seemed to act as risk factors for becoming pathological gamers, whereas depression, anxiety, social phobias, and lower school performance seemed to act as outcomes of pathological gaming. CONCLUSION: This study adds important information to the discussion about whether video game “addiction” is similar to other addictive behaviors, demonstrating that it can last for years and is not solely a symptom of comorbid disorders.","[{'authorId': '1690813', 'name': 'D.

The first years at university represent a crucial period for students and are associated with an increase in mental health problems, particularly in healthcare studies. This study aimed (1) to document the current levels of mental health and study engagement among healthcare students in Tunisia, and (2) to investigate the relationships between emotional regulation, optimism, study engagement and common mental health problems (stress, anxiety and depression) among this population. A cross-sectional, electronic survey-based research design was used to draw a sample of 366 health care students from a University in Tunisia. Participants mostly reported mild (34.7%) or moderate (44.3%) levels of depression, moderate (44.7%) or severe (33.6%) levels of anxiety, average (50.8%) or mild (33.8%) levels of stress, and high levels of study engagement (>85%). Through structural equation modelling, the results showed that emotional regulation negatively affected stress, anxiety, and depression. Optimism partially mediated the relationship between emotional regulation, anxiety and depression and fully mediated the relationship between emotional regulation and study engagement. The findings indicated a high prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare university students in Tunisia, and specific protective factors that may be targeted to reduce mental health problems.","[{'authorId': '2146847086', 'name': 'Imen Krifa'}, {'authorId': '147379911', 'name': 'L.

To examine whether changes in cognitive reappraisal self-efficacy (CR-SE) mediate the effects of individually administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (I-CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) on severity of social anxiety symptoms.


METHOD
A randomized controlled trial in which 75 adult patients (21-55 years of age; 53% male; 57% Caucasian) with a principal diagnosis of generalized SAD were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of I-CBT (n = 38) or a wait-list control (WL) group (n = 37). All patients completed self-report inventories measuring CR-SE and social anxiety symptoms at baseline and post-I-CBT/post-WL, and I-CBT completers were also assessed at 1-year posttreatment.


RESULTS
Compared with WL, I-CBT resulted in greater increases in CR-SE and greater decreases in social anxiety. Increases in CR-SE during I-CBT mediated the effect of I-CBT on social anxiety. Gains achieved by patients receiving I-CBT were maintained 1-year posttreatment, and I-CBT-related increases in CR-SE were also associated with reduction in social anxiety at the 1-year follow-up.


CONCLUSIONS
Increasing CR-SE may be an important mechanism by which I-CBT for SAD produces both immediate and long-term reductions in social anxiety.","[{'authorId': '1810531', 'name': 'P.

We add to Levinthal and Rerup's conjectures by examining Western and Eastern versions of mindfulness and how they function as a process of knowing an object. In our expanded view, encoding becomes less central. What becomes more central are activities such as altering the codes, differentiating the codes, introspecting the coding process itself, and, most of all, reducing the overall dependence on coding and codes. Consequently, we shift from Levinthal and Rerup's contrast between mindful and less mindful to a contrast between conceptual and less conceptual.

264a54a46d78b5dd9e5671708ebea344887d0b3f,"Emotion suppression may lead to ironic increases in emotional experience. More important, suppression is a transactional process, creating stress and disrupting interactions for the suppressor and those in social interactions with individuals who are suppressing emotion. However, no research has examined the behavioral consequences of emotion suppression in close relationships. We examine the possibility that emotion suppression will predict eating behaviors as a secondary emotion regulatory strategy among 1,556 parent–adolescent dyads (N = 3,112), consistent with evidence suggesting that suppression influences eating at the individual-level. Actor-partner interdependence models and structural equation modeling demonstrate that one’s own emotion suppression was associated with emotional eating; greater consumption of hedonic—low nutrient, high energy dense—foods; and lower consumption of fruits and vegetables (actor effects). One’s partner’s emotion suppression was also independently associated with one’s own emotional eating; lower consumption of fruits and vegetables; and greater consumption of hedonic foods (partner effects), although this association was most consistent for adolescents’ suppression and parents’ eating (compared with the converse). These analyses suggest that dyadic emotion regulatory processes have implications on eating behavior. Moreover, analyses suggest that emotion suppression has potential implications on eating behaviors of others within close relationships with a suppressor, consistent with the notion that emotion regulation is a transactional process. These findings suggest that interventions to improve eating habits of parents and their adolescent children should consider dyadic emotion regulatory processes.","[{'authorId': '3059168', 'name': 'R.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a noninterventional study, we assessed 506 type 2 diabetic patients for MDD (Composite International Diagnostic Interview), for depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression), and for diabetes distress (Diabetes Distress Scale), along with self-management, stress, demographics, and diabetes status, at baseline and 9 and 18 months later. Using multilevel modeling (MLM), we explored the cross-sectional relationships of the three affective variables with A1C, the prospective relationships of baseline variables with change in A1C over time, and the time-concordant relationships with A1C. RESULTS All three affective variables were moderately intercorrelated, although the relationship between depressive symptoms and diabetes distress was greater than the relationship of either with MDD. In the cross-sectional MLM, only diabetes distress but not MDD or depressive symptoms was significantly associated with A1C. None of the three affective variables were linked with A1C in prospective analyses. Only diabetes distress displayed significant time-concordant relationships with A1C. CONCLUSIONS We found no concurrent or longitudinal association between MDD or depressive symptoms with A1C, whereas both concurrent and time-concordant relationships were found between diabetes distress and A1C. What has been called “depression” among type 2 diabetic patients may really be two conditions, MDD and diabetes distress, with only the latter displaying significant associations with A1C. Ongoing evaluation of both diabetes distress and MDD may be helpful in clinical settings.","[{'authorId': '144067783', 'name': 'L. Fisher'}, {'authorId': '40120621', 'name': 'J.

Fear of falling in older adults has been associated with generalised anxiety and may lead to avoidance of activities, with a further negative impact on future falls. Individual differences in personality associated with anxiety have not been previously examined in relation to fear of falling. Current assessment measures and interventions designed to reduce fear of falling in older adults do not take into account perceptions of anxiety associated with individual differences in personality.


AIM
To determine whether the core personality trait dimension of neuroticism can predict fear of falling in a community-dwelling sample of women > or = 70 years of age.


METHODS
Cross-sectional data from 1,691 UK, community-dwelling female participants aged > or = 70 years were examined using multiple and logistic regression analysis. Fear of falling was measured on a 6-point Likert scale. Neuroticism was measured using the Eysenck personality inventory.


RESULTS
The significant independent odds ratios (OR) of predicting fear of falling were: neuroticism (OR 1.47 per SD increase, P<0.001), history of falling (OR 1.57, P<0.001), experience of fracture (OR 1.78, P = 0.014), need to use both arms to push up to rise from a chair (OR 1.56, P = 0.001), poor subjective general health, as measured by the SF12 (OR 1.63 per SD decrease, P<0.001) and living alone (OR 1.31, P = 0.031).


CONCLUSIONS
Neuroticism seems to be an important psychological factor in the experience of fear of falling in community-dwelling older women. It may be relevant for inclusion in current assessment measures and for consideration in the design of interventions to reduce fear of falling.","[{'authorId': '50430984', 'name': 'R.

Based on the assumption that older adults are highly motivated to quickly defuse negative states, we predicted that older adults, relative to young adults, would show an increased preference for distraction (a cognitive disengagement strategy) over reappraisal (a cognitive engagement strategy) in the face of negative material. A stronger preference for distraction, in turn, should be associated with higher affective well-being at older ages, as it helps to avoid high physiological arousal. Young (19-28 years, n = 38) and older (65-75 years, n = 39) adults completed a laboratory task of emotion-regulation choice in which they viewed negative pictures of high and low intensity and chose between distraction and reappraisal to regulate their emotional response. Confirming predictions, age was associated with an increased preference to choose distraction over reappraisal. Among older but not young adults, the relative preference for distraction to reappraisal predicted higher state-affective well-being. In addition, across age groups, the preference for distraction over reappraisal was positively predicted by stimulus intensity and negatively by cognitive resources. Findings support the notion of an age-related shift toward disengagement strategies to regulate negative emotions, which maps onto older adults' prohedonic orientation and holds affective benefits.","[{'authorId': '5576156', 'name': 'S.

Homocysteine is a risk factor for brain atrophy, cognitive impairment and dementia. Plasma concentrations of homocysteine can be lowered by dietary administration of B vitamins. Objective To determine whether supplementation with B vitamins that lower levels of plasma total homocysteine can slow the rate of brain atrophy in subjects with mild cognitive impairment in a randomised controlled trial (VITACOG, ISRCTN 94410159). Methods and Findings Single-center, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of high-dose folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12 in 271 individuals (of 646 screened) over 70 y old with mild cognitive impairment. A subset (187) volunteered to have cranial MRI scans at the start and finish of the study. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups of equal size, one treated with folic acid (0.8 mg/d), vitamin B12 (0.5 mg/d) and vitamin B6 (20 mg/d), the other with placebo; treatment was for 24 months. The main outcome measure was the change in the rate of atrophy of the whole brain assessed by serial volumetric MRI scans. Results A total of 168 participants (85 in active treatment group; 83 receiving placebo) completed the MRI section of the trial. The mean rate of brain atrophy per year was 0.76% [95% CI, 0.63–0.90] in the active treatment group and 1.08% [0.94–1.22] in the placebo group (P = 0.001). The treatment response was related to baseline homocysteine levels: the rate of atrophy in participants with homocysteine >13 µmol/L was 53% lower in the active treatment group (P = 0.001). A greater rate of atrophy was associated with a lower final cognitive test scores. There was no difference in serious adverse events according to treatment category. Conclusions and Significance The accelerated rate of brain atrophy in elderly with mild cognitive impairment can be slowed by treatment with homocysteine-lowering B vitamins. Sixteen percent of those over 70 y old have mild cognitive impairment and half of these develop Alzheimer's disease. Since accelerated brain atrophy is a characteristic of subjects with mild cognitive impairment who convert to Alzheimer's disease, trials are needed to see if the same treatment will delay the development of Alzheimer's disease.

To review empirical findings on oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD).


METHOD
Selected summaries of the literature over the past decade are presented.


RESULTS
Research on ODD and CD during the past decade has addressed the complexity involved in identifying the primary risk factors and developmental pathways to disruptive behavior disorders (DBD). In some domains, research is entering an entirely new phase because of the availability of new technologies. In others, larger data sets and more complicated methodological and statistical techniques are testing increasingly complex models. Yet questions remain regarding the most useful subtyping systems, the identification of the most significant risk factors, and the relationships between risk factors from multiple domains.


CONCLUSIONS
Convincing evidence of causal linkages remains elusive. Research has questioned the notion that CD is intractable, especially when multiple domains of risk and impairment are the targets of intervention. It is apparent that there is not one single causative factor; thus it is not likely that one single modality will suffice to treat CD. Future steps will involve the restructuring of diagnostic criteria to capture adequate subtypes and indicators, clarification of the neurological underpinnings of the disorder, and refinement in the models available to explain the varied pathways to DBD.","[{'authorId': '38810467', 'name': 'Jeffrey D.

The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population and among health care professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors, and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{'authorId': '143878050', 'name': 'L.

The objective of this study was to examine various aspects of PTP in young children exposed to terror events and their relation to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Individual play sessions, conducted with 29 young Israeli children directly exposed to terrorism (M age = 5.47, SD = 1.34) and 25 matched unexposed children (M age = 5.62, SD = 0.87), were coded using the Children's Play Therapy Instrument-Adaptation for Terror Research (CPTI-ATR; S.E. Chazan & E. Cohen, 2003). Analyses using these ratings showed (a) significant differences between the two groups, (b) significant associations with the caregiver's reports on child's exposure, and (c) significant associations with the caregiver's reports on the child's PTSD symptoms. Play activity ratings of predominant negative affects, frequent acting-out/morbid themes, lowered developmental level, and reduced awareness of the child of him- or herself as a player significantly predicted more PTSD symptoms. PTP which included more coping strategies classified as ""overwhelmed reexperiencing"" and less ""reenactment with soothing"" was associated with a higher level of PTSD. Play analysis with the CPTI-ATR may be helpful in identifying PTSD in children and also guide the selection of therapeutic techniques.","[{'authorId': '8261579', 'name': 'Esther Cohen'}, {'authorId': '32043538', 'name': 'S.

Children born very preterm are reported to have an increased frequency of social, emotional, and behavioral problems at school age compared with their peers born at term. The primary aim of this study was to compare social-emotional difficulties and competencies of very preterm and full-term children at 2 years' corrected age. In addition, the relation between perinatal variables and early behavior problems was also examined to help identify those very preterm children most at risk.


METHOD
At 2 years' corrected age, the parents of 188 very preterm (gestational age <30 weeks or birth weight <1,250 g) and 70 full-term (gestational age >or=37 weeks) children completed the Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment to determine externalizing, internalizing, and dysregulation problems and social-emotional competencies. For the very preterm sample, extensive perinatal data were collected including sex, birth weight, gestational age, chronic lung disease, and postnatal steroids, as well as neonatal cerebral white matter abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance imaging.


RESULTS
The very preterm children at 2 years demonstrated significantly higher internalizing and dysregulation scores and lower competence scores than peers born at term. There was no significant difference in externalizing scores between groups. Female sex, lower birth weight z score, white matter abnormalities, and postnatal corticosteroids were significantly associated with lower competence scores in the very preterm group.


CONCLUSIONS
Very preterm children exhibit higher rates of behavior problems early in development, in particular internalizing and dysregulation problems and poorer competence.","[{'authorId': '1897445', 'name': 'A.

First, the suitability of the original QEEW stress scales for use in the beginning teachers (BTs) context was investigated using a sample of 356 beginning teachers from 52 different secondary school locations in the Netherlands. Confirmatory Factor Analyses, Principal Component Analyses and Mokken scaling item reduction was applied to create high concise and precise scales. Hereafter, based on the teacher stress literature, additional teacher specific stress items were added, resulting in the adjusted version of the measure, the Questionnaire on the Experience and Evaluation of Work – Beginning Teachers (QEEW-BT, study 1). To cross-validate the results and to examine the internal consistency and validity of the adjusted instrument a different sample of 143 beginning teachers from 61 different secondary school locations in the Netherlands was used (study 2). The present findings provide adequate support that the QEEW-BT is a reliable and valid instrument to measure stress causes and responses for beginning secondary school teachers in the Netherlands.","[{'authorId': '51059978', 'name': 'Ruth Harmsen'}, {'authorId': '1401959576', 'name': 'M.

Moreover, treatments are less effective when GAD is accompanied by romantic relationship distress. In order to develop effective treatments for GAD and relationship distress, it is necessary to conduct theory-based research to identify links common to both GAD and romantic relationship distress. Drawing on Bowen's family systems theory, the roles of family abuse/violence and differentiation in GAD and romantic relationship distress were examined using existing data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (n = 2,312; 2005). As predicted, family abuse/violence was directly linked to both GAD and romantic relationship distress. Differentiation mediated the relationship between family abuse/violence and GAD, and partially mediated the relationship between family abuse/violence and romantic relationship distress. Findings suggest that current and past relationship processes may help maintain chronic anxiety and that Bowen's theory may be a useful framework for developing couple therapy treatment of GAD and romantic relationship distress.","[{'authorId': '33912398', 'name': 'Jacob B.

Results, using exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic techniques, support the three factor structure of the construct which was tested against alternative models. Other psychometric qualities are also very satisfactory. Findings are compared to the published normative data for the MBI. Female teachers appear more emotionally exhausted than their male counterparts. Primary school teachers scored higher on emotional exhaustion, but depersonalization was higher among secondary school teachers. Overall, the results suggest that the Greek MBI represents a valid and reliable adaptation of the instrument, which can be confidently used to measure burnout.

In this review, we used the process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 1998) to organize the existing literature on positive interventions and to advance theory by clarifying the mechanisms underlying their effectiveness. We have proposed that positive emotions can be increased both in the short- and longer-term through 5 families of emotion regulation strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation), showing how these emotion regulation strategies can be applied before, during, and after positive emotional events. Regarding short-term increases in positive emotions, our review found that attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation strategies have received the most empirical support, whereas more work is needed to establish the effectiveness of situation selection and situation modification strategies. Regarding longer-term increases in positive emotions, strategies such as situation selection during an event and attentional deployment before, during, and after an event have received strong empirical support and are at the center of many positive interventions. However, more work is needed to establish the specific benefits of the other strategies, especially situation modification. We argue that our emotion regulation framework clarifies existing interventions and points the way for new interventions that might be used to increase positive emotions in both nonclinical and clinical populations.","[{'authorId': '2360887', 'name': 'J.

Informed by the tripartite model of family impact on children's emotion regulation, direct relations of emotion socialization components (modeling and reactions to the child's negative emotions) and indirect relations of parental emotion-related beliefs (such as parental emotion regulation self-efficacy) were examined. Data on emotion socialization components and parental beliefs on emotion regulation were collected via self-report. Data on children's emotion regulation strategies were collected via parent report. Findings showed direct effects of parental modeling and parenting practices on children's emotion regulation strategies, with distinct socialization paths for reappraisal and response suppression. An indirect effect of parental emotion regulation self-efficacy on children's reappraisal was found. These associations were not moderated by parent sex.

The aim of this study was to investigate the perception and sources of stress, coping mechanisms used, and self-esteem in nursing students during 3 years of their undergraduate nursing programme.


METHODS
The sample consisted of a cohort of nursing students going through 3 years of a nursing programme. The method was a descriptive correlational design. The questionnaire consisted of demographic data, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Self-esteem Scale, and the modified Ways of Coping Scale. Data were analysed using frequency distributions, content analysis, and measures of correlation.


RESULTS
Results indicated that students in year 1 experienced significantly less transient stress as compared with year 2; students in year 3 had more positive self-esteem than year 2 students. There were no significant differences with regard to chronic stress, avoidance and proactive coping, and negative self-esteem. Chronic and transient stress, as measured by GHQ, were significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with avoidance coping behaviours, and negative self-esteem. Positive self-esteem was significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with proactive coping behaviours. The four main stressors in the last three years for this cohort of students, in descending order are nursing studies, finance, family and health. They coped by using both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping skills. There is a need to review the nursing curriculum and evaluate what impacts on students' stress levels, and also introduce strategies to reduce the stress levels of nursing students.","[{'authorId': '50393380', 'name': 'R.

Dans la mesure ou ces paradigmes ont en commun d'introduire une perturbation volontaire, voire « quantifiee » de la relation entre le jeune bebe et ses partenaires, ils conduisent a poser une serie de questions sur le plan de l'ethique de la recherche : - le principe meme de l'introduction d'une perturbation volontaire de la relation, fut-elle librement consentie, pose un probleme et on peut noter le peu d'attention qui lui est porte au regard de l'extraordinaire diffusion ou frequence d'utilisation de ces modeles de recherche ; - sur le plan de ce que l'on pourrait appeler la « methodologie de l'ethique », on soulignera le paradoxe entre la precaution liminaire convenue avec les partenaires du bebe (arreter si trop perturbant ; banaliser l'impact de la perturbation) et l'hypothese qui sous-tend la recherche : le type de reaction que l'on observe en reponse a la perturbation est concu comme l'expression d'une structure de relation et on cherche ensuite a etablir des liens entre cette structure et des caracteristiques developpementales ulterieures ; - la question du consentement eclaire : Comment prendre en compte le consentement du bebe et de ses parents comme sujets autonomes ? La question de l'applicabilite (ou la non-applicabilite) de ces paradigmes dans d'autres cultures souligne le caractere ethnocentre des procedures qui rend aveugle a nos choix ethiquement discutables.","[{'authorId': '71598844', 'name': 'B.

A substantial body of research supports the cognitive model of depression and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the various anxiety disorders. Cognitive therapy (CT), often labeled as the generic term cognitive behavior therapy, has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and relapse rates, with or without medication, in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders.

Mothers and fathers were observed interacting with their children, and child-rearing styles were reported. Teachers, mothers, and children reported children's antisocial, oppositional behavior. Externalizing problems showed strong continuity 2 and 4 years later. Proactive parenting (i.e., supportive presence, clear instruction, and limit setting) predicted fewer behavior problems over time, after controlling for initial problems; the converse was true for parental anger. In contrast, the hypothesized ameliorative contribution of parents' positive emotion was not found. Parental contributions were most influential for children whose initial problems were in the clinical range. In particular, parental anger predicted continuation of problems over time. Paternal, as well as maternal, influences were identified. Examination of parental emotions and inclusion of fathers is important to research and intervention with young antisocial children.","[{'authorId': '40099467', 'name': 'S.

2ab7932d590cca44e2bdec82ede9a6959507cb1a,"Research was conducted on the predictors of burnout in a sample of teachers in Queensland private schools. A total of 246 teachers responded to scales that assessed burnout, school and classroom environments, work pressure, role overload, role ambiguity, role conflict, teaching efficacy, external locus of control, and self-esteem. The Maslach Burnout Inventory was used to assess three facets of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment. An hypothesized model of burnout was tested in a LISREL analysis with post hoc modifications indicating that role overload, work pressure, classroom environment and self-esteem were predictors of emotional exhaustion. Depersonalisation was significantly related to emotional exhaustion, role conflict, selfesteem and school environment. Teaching efficacy, self-esteem and depersonalisation were predictors of personal accomplishment. In 1974, Freudenberger introduced the term burnout to describe the inability to function effectively in one's job as a consequence of prolonged and extensive job related stress. Since that time, incidences of, and research into stress and burnout have increased with popular emphasis on employees in the human services sector including social workers, nurses, teachers, lawyers, medical doctors and police officers (Jackson, Schwab, & Schuler, 1986; Maslach & Jackson, 1981). A common characteristic of these occupations is that the nature of the work can be highly emotional. For teachers, the potential for emotional stress is high since they work with classes of up to 35 students for long periods of time. The intensely relational nature of classrooms means that teachers are vulnerable to emotionally draining and discouraging experiences (Maslach & Leiter, 1999). Such experiences can lead to dysfunctional teacher behaviour with obvious implications for the teacher’s well-being and student learning. This article reports the findings of a study of burnout in Queensland private school teachers. Specifically, the study investigated the influence of several hypothesized predictor variables. To provide a contextual basis for the research, background information on theoretical and empirical perspectives relating to this research is provided.","[{'authorId': '26307966', 'name': 'Jeffrey P.

2ac87b8dfe07c36f2146c16ffe3e21ebbc759d5b,"The mood benefits of Hatha yoga and swimming, two activities that differ greatly in aerobic training benefits, were examined. College students (N = 87) in two swimming classes, a yoga class, and a lecture-control class completed mood and personality inventories before and after class on three occasions. A multivariate analysis of variance indicated that both yoga participants (n = 22) and swimmers (n = 37) reported greater decreases in scores on Anger, Confusion, Tension, and Depression than did the control students (n = 28). The consistent mood benefits of yoga supported our earlier observation that the exercise need not be aerobic to be associated with mood enhancement. However, underlying and causal mechanisms remain uncertain. Among the men, the acute decreases in Tension, Fatigue, and Anger after yoga were significantly greater than those after swimming. Yoga may be even more beneficial than swimming for men who personally select to participate. The women reported fairly similar mood benefits after swimming and yoga. It seems that aerobic exercise may not be necessary to facilitate the mood benefits. Also, students with greater mood changes attended class more regularly than those who reported fewer psychological benefits. Maximizing the immediate psychological benefits of exercise might be one way to encourage adults to be physically active.","[{'authorId': '49426679', 'name': 'B.

Methods Electronic databases were searched up to February 2015 for parallel and crossover randomised clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents with ADHD. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) were conducted. Quality was assessed using GRADE. Teachers, parents, and observers rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour. Study answer and limitations The analyses included 38 parallel group trials (n=5111, median treatment duration 49 days) and 147 crossover trials (n=7134, 14 days). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. The analysis suggested a beneficial effect of methylphenidate on teacher rated symptoms in 19 parallel group trials (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.77, n=1698), corresponding to a mean difference of −9.6 points on the ADHD rating scale. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious adverse events (risk ratio 0.98, nine trials, n=1532; TSA adjusted intervention effect RR 0.91). Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (1.29, 21 trials, n=3132; TSA adjusted RR 1.29). Teacher rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD −0.87, five trials, n=668) A change of 7 points on the child health questionnaire (CHQ) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a mean difference of 8.0 points on the CHQ (range 0-100 points), which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, three trials, n=514). 96.8% of trials were considered high risk of bias trials according to the Cochrane guidelines. All outcomes were assessed very low quality according to GRADE. What this study adds The results suggest that among children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD, methylphenidate may improve teacher reported symptoms of ADHD and general behaviour and parent reported quality of life. However, given the risk of bias in the included studies, and the very low quality of outcomes, the magnitude of the effects is uncertain. Methylphenidate is associated with an increased risk of non-serious but not serious adverse events.

A questionnaire survey was used to investigate the prevalence, sources, and symptoms of stress among 257 schoolteachers in 16 medium-sized, mixed comprehensive schools in England. About one-fifth of the teachers rated being a teacher as either very stressful or extremely stressful. There appeared to be little association between self-reported teacher stress and the biographical characteristics of the teachers. Sources of stress with relatively high mean stress ratings included ‘pupils’ poor attitudes to work', ‘trying to uphold/maintain values and standards’, and ‘covering lessons for absent teachers’. A principal components analysis of the sources of stress revealed four factors labelled' pupil misbehaviour', ‘poor working conditions’, ‘time pressures’, and ‘poor school ethos’. The most frequent symptoms of stress reported were ‘exhaustion’ and feeling ‘frustrated’. A principal components analysis of the symptoms of stress revealed one factor labelled ‘awareness of stress symptoms' which appeared to be largely defined by reported frequency of feeling ‘very tense’.","[{'authorId': '69351909', 'name': 'C.

Next, we consider what happens when emotion becomes dysregulated in a major depressive episode. We suggest that an emotion regulatory perspective integrates diverse theoretical views of depression and has implications for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of depression.

2b892e2658372fb2c807964c4247c8e911d71ccd,"Italian adolescents were confined at home for 3 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed them to feelings of fear, uncertainty, and loneliness that may have increased their vulnerability to emotional-behavioral symptoms (e.g., anxiety) and binge-eating attitudes. Potential risk factors for these psychopathological symptoms are problematic social media usage and attachment insecurity. Therefore, this study aimed: (1) to assess emotional-behavioral symptoms, binge eating, problematic social media usage, and attachment representations of adolescents during the pandemic, comparing them with prepandemic similar samples; (2) to investigate relationships among variables, exploring the role of problematic social media usage and insecure attachment as risk factors for more psychopathological symptoms. Participants were 62 community adolescents aged 12–17 years, enrolled through schools, and assessed online through the following measures: Youth Self-Report for emotional-behavioral problems, Binge-Eating Scale for binge eating, Social Media Disorder Scale for problematic social media usage, and the Friends and Family Interview for attachment. The main results were: (1) 9.4% of adolescents showed clinical rates of emotional-behavioral symptoms and 4.8% of binge eating attitudes. The comparison with pre-pandemic samples revealed that pandemic teenagers showed lower internalizing, but higher other problems (e.g., binge drinking, self-destructive behaviors) and more problematic social media usage than pre-pandemic peers. No differences in binge-eating attitudes and attachment were revealed (76% secure classifications). (2) Problematic social media usage was related to more binge eating and emotional-behavioral problems, predicting 5.4% of both delinquent and attention problems. Attachment disorganization predicted 16.5% of internalizing problems, somatic complaints, and social and identity-related problems. In conclusion, confinement did not increase adolescents' internalizing symptoms -i.e., vulnerability to mood disorders of an anxious-depressive type- which even decreased. However, teenagers may have expressed their discomfort through other problems and symptoms of social media disorder. Further studies should explore the role of adolescents' problematic social media usage and attachment insecurity as risk factors for additional psychopathological symptoms.","[{'authorId': '80617770', 'name': 'S.

However, some researches did not support the original one-dimensional structure of the GAD-7 tool. Our main aim was to examine the factor structure of GAD-7 comparing the one-factor model fit with a two-factor model (3 somatic nature symptoms and 4 cognitive-emotional nature symptoms) in a sample of college students. This validation study with data collected cross-sectionally included 1,031 Portuguese college students attending courses in the six schools of the Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal. Measures included the GAD-7, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the University Student Risk Behaviors Questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) procedures confirmed that neither factor structure was well fitting. Thus, a modified single factor model allowing the error terms of items associated with relaxing difficulties and irritability to covary was an appropriate solution. Additionally, this factor structure revealed configural and metric invariance across gender. A good convergent validity was found by correlating global anxiety and depression. However, this measure showed a weak association with consumption behaviors. Our results are relevant to clinical practice, since the comprehensive approach to GAD-7 contributes to knowing generalized anxiety symptoms trajectory and their correlates within the university setting.","[{'authorId': '39834739', 'name': 'A.

Factors driving differential effects are unknown, although increased estradiol during pre-ovulation and increased progesterone during post-ovulation are thought to play a role. We indirectly investigated this possibility by examining whether overall levels of estradiol and progesterone differentially impact genetic and environmental risk for emotional eating in adult female twins (N = 571) drawn from the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Emotional eating, estradiol levels, and progesterone levels were assessed daily and then averaged to create aggregate measures for analysis. As predicted, shared environmental influences were significantly greater in twins with high estradiol levels, whereas additive genetic effects increased substantially across low versus high progesterone groups.

First, how do different personality characteristics-self-monitoring and the Big Five personality traits-relate to indegree centrality and brokerage, the two most studied structurally advantageous positions in organizational networks? Second, how do indegree centrality and brokerage compare in explaining job performance and career success? Third, how do these personality variables and network positions relate to work outcomes? Our results show that self-monitoring predicted indegree centrality across expressive and instrumental networks and brokerage in expressive networks after controlling for the Big Five traits. Self-monitoring, therefore, was especially relevant for understanding why people differ in their acquisition of advantageous positions in social networks. But the total variance explained by personality ranged between 3% and 5%. Surprisingly, we found that indegree centrality was more strongly related to job performance and career success than brokerage. We also found that personality predicted job performance and career success above and beyond network position and that network position partially mediated the effects of certain personality variables on work outcomes.

This study has a cross-sectional design. The sample was composed of 258 university students recruited from three academic areas. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate regression analyses were performed. Significant bivariate analysis showed a significant inverse correlation between self-efficacy and state anxiety (r = −0.340) and trait anxiety (r = −0.466). In addition, a direct correlation was found between self-efficacy and the coping strategies of problem-solving (r = 0.312), emotional expression (r = 0.133), cognitive restructuring (r = 0.195), social withdrawal (r = 0.103), and coping with a situation (r = 0.303), as well as with the emotional intelligence dimensions of emotional clarity (r = 0.397) and repair mood (r = 0.347). Multivariate regression analysis showed that trait anxiety, problem-solving, emotional expression, social withdrawal, and emotional clarity were significantly related to the dependent variable, predicting 39% of total variance on levels of general perceived self-efficacy. In conclusion, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the related factors to general perceived self-efficacy in undergraduate students.","[{'authorId': '2076790176', 'name': 'F.

2cb003b287cb9775d9b00acb89ede1c6c41c0cfb,"Background: The increasing incidence of people affected by overweight or obesity is a significant health problem. The knowledge of the factors which influences the inappropriate eating behaviors causing excessive body fat is an essential goal for the research. Overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for many health diseases, such as cardiovascular problems, diabetes. Recently, many studies have focused on the relationship between body weight and cognitive processes. Objectives: This systematic review is aimed to investigate the existence and the nature of the relationship between excessive body weight (overweight/obesity) and executive functions, analyzing cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies in order to verify the evidence of a possible causality between these variables. Methods: The review was carried out according to the PRISMA-Statement, through systematic searches in the scientific databases PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo, and PsycArticles. The studies selected examined performance on executive tasks by participants with overweight or obesity, aged between 5 and 70 years. Studies examining eating disorders or obesity resulting from other medical problems were excluded. Furthermore, the results of studies using a cross-sectional design and those using a longitudinal one were separately investigated. Results: Sixty-three cross-sectional studies and twenty-eight longitudinal studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. The results confirmed the presence of a relation between executive functions and overweight/obesity, although the directionality of this relation was not clear; nor did any single executive function emerge as being more involved than others in this relation. Despite this, there was evidence of a reciprocal influence between executive functions and overweight/obesity. Conclusions: This systematic review underlines the presence of a relationship between executive functions and overweight/obesity. Moreover, it seems to suggest a bidirectional trend in this relationship that could be the cause of the failure of interventions for weight reduction. The results of this review highlight the importance of a theoretical model able to consider all the main variables of interest, with the aim to structuring integrated approaches to solve the overweight/obesity problems.","[{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

2cb032561a39bf0ba455a3ae4d6ebdce448cce6c,"Abstract: Irritability is an important symptom in childhood psychopathology that has received relatively little research attention. Recent controversy concerning the diagnosis of mania in children has focused attention on how little is known about how to assess irritability in a systematic way, and about its diagnostic associations. For example, subtyping irritability according to course (chronic vs. episodic), precipitants, and family history may facilitate the identification of psychopathology and the study of pathophysiology. While normative and pathologic irritability can be differentiated reliably, the validity of the distinction is unclear. In addition, there is a need for scales designed to measure the severity of irritability in children with mood and anxiety disorders. In order to facilitate research, we propose a definition of irritability from the perspective of affective neuroscience. Because reactive aggression may be a helpful animal model for irritability, we review the neural circuitry mediating this behavior. Behavioral paradigms that evoke frustration, as well as those that assess the ability to inhibit a prepotent motor response, maintain attentional focus, execute response reversal, recognize angry faces, and regulate emotional responses, may be useful in the study of irritability. Examples of such paradigms are described, and the pharmacology of irritability is reviewed briefly.","[{'authorId': '8567882', 'name': 'E. Leibenluft'}, {'authorId': '144165143', 'name': 'R.

The objectives were (i) to study the prevalence of DAS among school going adolescents and (ii) to study the correlates of DAS. Settings and Design: A Cross-sectional survey of students of four classes from 9th to 12th studying in government schools. Subjects and Methods: Ten government schools in Chandigarh were randomly selected through lottery method. In each school, for each of the four classes, a section was randomly selected again by the lottery method. Forty students were selected from each school reaching sample size of 470. DAS scale 21 questionnaires were used. Statistical Analysis Used: The data entry was done in MS Office Excel 2007. The analysis was done in the form of frequency tables, charts cross tables. For statistical significance, Chi-square test and correlation was found between various factors. Results: The prevalence of DAS was 65.53%, 80.85%, and 47.02%, respectively. Overall, comorbidity between depression and anxiety was 57.65%. Extremely severe depression was very less (3%). The prevalence of DAS was higher in females. For depression and anxiety, the peak age was 18 years. Conclusions: The prevalence of DAS was high among school going adolescents in Chandigarh. There is a need for early and effective identification of DAS that can prevent many psychiatric disorders at their nascent stage.","[{'authorId': '32662765', 'name': 'Raman Kumar Sandal'}, {'authorId': '46356846', 'name': 'N.

A sample of 2,141 individuals (n = 915 from the United States; n = 635 from Italy; n = 591 from Spain) completed measures of differentiation of self (DSI-R; Skowron & Schmitt, J Marital Fam Ther, 29, 2003, 209) and couple adjustment (DAS; Spanier, J Marriage Fam, 38, 1976, 15). Results showed evidence of partial measurement equivalence for the DSI-R across the three samples. Additionally, results from latent regression showed that less emotional cutoff predicted greater couple adjustment in the United States, Spain, and Italy, whereas greater emotional reactivity predicted poorer couple adjustment only in the more collectivistic cultures, Spain and Italy. Our findings are consistent with prior empirical studies, which suggest that emotional cutoff is a strong predictor of relationship adjustment. The use of measurement invariance provides a foundation for future studies to continue employing rigorous statistical methods when examining constructs across different cultures. The findings highlight culture-specific similarities and differences in differentiation that may benefit practitioners by informing psychotherapy with individuals, couples, or families from diverse populations.","[{'authorId': '1445066615', 'name': 'M.

To investigate whether the presence of comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD) alters the correlates of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).


METHOD
Three groups of children (33 ""pure"" ADHD, 46 ADHD + ODD, and 12 ADHD + CD) were compared on measures of ADHD, aggression, anxiety, parental psychopathology, self-esteem, school, and social-emotional functioning.


RESULTS
Findings indicated that the presence of comorbid oppositional or conduct problems in children with ADHD altered the correlates of ADHD across a number of areas, including greater ADHD symptom severity and social dysfunction. Nevertheless, some correlates were more closely linked with the comorbid condition of ADHD + CD (e.g., higher aggression, anxiety, and maternal pathology, as well as decreased self-esteem), while others appeared more closely linked with ADHD + ODD (e.g., social withdrawal, elevated academic achievement paired with higher perceived scholastic competence).

2de89ecdb393fc8e2e4975b95c510dba954c8183,"Introduction Teaching methods and techniques represent important classroom practices that promote both academic achievement and the efficacy of learning processes: the use of a complex array of teaching practices by educators in the classrooms has been frequently associated with better student academic outcomes (Hattie, 2012, 2009). So far, less is known about the psychological aspects linked to the working endeavors able to promote the adoption of different teaching techniques in educational contexts. Aim The present cross-sectional quantitative research aimed at estimating the cumulative network of associations between psychological resources at work (e.g., social support, sense of autonomy, and job satisfaction) and both work engagement and the use of teaching classroom practices. Sample and Method The sample was composed of in-service teachers (N = 1,370) recruited in primary and lower secondary public schools in urban and suburban areas of Canton Ticino (Switzerland). Self-administered quantitative measures were used to evaluate the following constructs: social support, job satisfaction, teachers’ autonomy, work engagement, and teaching classroom practices. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling with decomposition analysis of total effects in direct and indirect effects. Results The hypothesized structural model reported a good fit with the empirical data (normed χ2 (NC) = 2.7; root mean square error of approximation = 0.051, normed fit index (NNFI) = 0.951, non normed fit index = 0.950, comparative fit index = 0.968) and support the interpretation of the structural model. The main results revealed a large positive association between psychological resources at work and teaching classroom practices (β = 0.37). The level of work engagement seemed to be a minor element in promoting the use of teaching classroom practices (β = 0.10). Discussion Overall, the results provide a fresh piece of evidence for the association between working conditions and teaching practices. In fact, teachers who perceive a supportive and satisfying working environment (both in terms of internal and external resources) are more likely to be engaged in their activities, and this in turn leads to a more heterogeneous array of teaching practices with students. The practical implications in terms of professional training and on-field intervention are discussed.","[{'authorId': '17940542', 'name': 'L.

2e0b4482f402b2b0fd7bbfc4411b1ffba54250f0,"BACKGROUND
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is theorized to have temperamental precursors early in life. These are difficult to identify because many core features of ADHD, such as breakdowns in executive function and self-control, involve psychological and neural systems that are too immature to reliably show dysfunction in early life. ADHD also involves emotional dysregulation, and these temperamental features appear earlier as well. Here, we report a first attempt to utilize indices of emotional regulation to identify ADHD-related liability in infancy.


METHODS
Fifty women were recruited in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, with overselection for high parental ADHD symptoms. Measures of maternal body mass index, nutrition, substance use, stress, and mood were examined during pregnancy as potential confounds. Offspring were evaluated at 6 months of age using LABTAB procedures designed to elicit fear, anger, and regulatory behavior. Mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire about their child's temperament.


RESULTS
After control for associated covariates, including maternal depression and prenatal stress, family history of ADHD was associated with measures of anger/irritability, including infant negative vocalizations during the arm restraint task (p = .004), and maternal ratings of infant distress to limitations (p = .036). In the regulation domain, familial ADHD was associated with less parent-oriented attention seeking during the still face procedure (p < .001), but this was not echoed in the maternal ratings of recovery from distress.


CONCLUSIONS
Affective response at 6 months of age may identify infants with familial history of ADHD, providing an early indicator of ADHD liability. These preliminary results provide a foundation for further studies and will be amplified by enlarging this cohort and following participants longitudinally to evaluate ADHD outcomes.","[{'authorId': '46482081', 'name': 'E.

2e1d9f8328ac88a0823738bb40dca27e2234d561,"Objectives Sleep debt reportedly increases emotional instability, such as anxiety and confusion, in addition to sleepiness and psychomotor impairment. However, the neural basis of emotional instability due to sleep debt has yet to be elucidated. This study investigated changes in emotional responses that are elicited by the simulation of short-term sleep loss and the brain regions responsible for these changes. Subjects and Methods Fourteen healthy adult men aged 24.1±3.3 years (range, 20–32 years) participated in a within-subject crossover study consisting of 5-day sessions of both sleep debt (4 h for time in bed) and sleep control (8 h for time in bed). On the last day of each session, participants underwent polysomnography and completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Profile of Mood States questionnaires. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted while performing an emotional face viewing task. Results Restricted sleep over the 5-day period increased the activity of the left amygdala in response to the facial expression of fear, whereas a happy facial expression did not change the activity. Restricted sleep also resulted in a significant decrease in the functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) in proportion to the degree of sleep debt (as indicated by the percentage of slow wave sleep and δ wave power). This decrease was significantly correlated with activation of the left amygdala and deterioration of subjective mood state. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that continuous and accumulating sleep debt that can be experienced in everyday life can downregulate the functional suppression of the amygdala by the vACC and consequently enhance the response of the amygdala to negative emotional stimuli. Such functional alteration in emotional control may, in part, be attributed to the neural basis of emotional instability during sleep debt.","[{'authorId': '1873955', 'name': 'Y.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Individuals with T1D (n = 301) with elevated DD and HbA1c were recruited from multiple settings and randomly assigned to OnTrack, an emotion-focused intervention, or to KnowIt, an educational/behavioral intervention. Each group attended a full-day workshop plus four online meetings over 3 months. Assessments occurred at baseline and 3 and 9 months. Primary and secondary outcomes were change in DD and change in HbA1c, respectively. RESULTS With 12% attrition, both groups demonstrated dramatic reductions in DD (effect size d = 1.06; 78.4% demonstrated a reduction of at least one minimal clinically important difference). There were, however, no significant differences in DD reduction between OnTrack and KnowIt. Moderator analyses indicated that OnTrack provided greater DD reduction to those with initially poorer cognitive or emotion regulation skills, higher baseline DD, or greater initial diabetes knowledge than those in KnowIt. Significant but modest reductions in HbA1c occurred with no between-group differences. Change in DD was modestly associated with change in HbA1c (r = 0.14, P = 0.01), with no significant between-group differences. CONCLUSIONS DD can be successfully reduced among distressed individuals with T1D with elevated HbA1c using both education/behavioral and emotion-focused approaches. Reductions in DD are only modestly associated with reductions in HbA1c. These findings point to the importance of tailoring interventions to address affective, knowledge, and cognitive skills when intervening to reduce DD and improve glycemic control.","[{'authorId': '144067783', 'name': 'L.

The sample reported moderate levels of academic stress, social support, and resilience. Academic stress significantly (p < 0.05), negatively influenced social support and resilience. Social support systems exerted significant, positive influence with each other and with resilience. No social supports mediated the negative stress effect on resilience.

Influential models of emotion view the embodiment of emotions as fundamental; that is, many observers believe that interoceptive awareness has a crucial role in emotional awareness (Barrett et al. The neuroanatomical findings described in this chapter address the organization of pathways in the brain that engender feelings from the body, and they support the view that the neural substrates responsible for subjective awareness of your emotional state are based on the neural representation of your physiological state. These data show that there is a phylogenetically novel homeostatic sensory afferent pathway in primates, especially in humanoid primates, that provides the basis for a sense of the physiological condition of the body ("" the material me "") in posterior insular cortex (Craig, 2002). A posterior-to-anterior progression of increasingly complex re-representations in the human insula provides a foundation for the sequential integration of your homeostatic condition with your sensory environment, with your motivational condition and with your social condition. Based on considerable evidence, I propose that this integration generates a unified penultimate meta-representation of the global emotional moment at the junction of the anterior insula and the frontal operculum (Craig, 2004a, 2005). Convergent functional imaging findings reveal that the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortices are conjointly activated during all human emotions (e.g., Murphy et al., 2003), which in my view indicates that the limbic sensory representation of subjective "" feelings "" (in the anterior insula) and the limbic motor representation of volitional agency (in the anterior cingulate) together form the fundamental neuroanatomical basis for all human emotions (Craig, 2002), consistent with the definition of an emotion in humans as both a feeling and a motivation with concomitant autonomic sequelae (Rolls, 1999). In this view, emotions are not simply occasional events, but rather are ongoing and continuous, and in this view emotional behaviors can occur without subjective feelings (as they do constantly in animals other than humanoid primates, or in unconscious human emotional acts). Thus, I concur with the idea that emotional behaviors evolved as energy-efficient means of producing goal-directed actions that fulfill homeostatic and social needs (Darwin, 1872), and I believe that our capacity for awareness of our emotional behaviors (that is, our subjective feelings) evolved because it enabled an enormous enhancement in the efficiency and complexity of …","[{'authorId': '2231771915', 'name': 'Haviland-Jones Lewis'}, {'authorId': '2231771646', 'name': 'Barrett'}, {'authorId': '48614533', 'name': 'A.

The goal of this study was to determine the behavioral and clinical characteristics of diabetes that are associated with depression after controlling for potentially confounding variables.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A population-based mail survey was sent to patients with diabetes from nine primary care clinics of a health maintenance organization. The Patient Health Questionnaire was used to diagnose depression, and automated diagnostic, pharmacy, and laboratory data were used to measure diabetes treatment intensity, HbA(1c) levels, and diabetes complications.


RESULTS
Independent factors that were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of meeting criteria for major depression included younger age, female sex, less education, being unmarried, BMI > or = >30 kg/m(2), smoking, higher nondiabetic medical comorbidity, higher numbers of diabetes complications in men, treatment with insulin, and higher HbA(1c) levels in patients <65 years of age. Independent factors associated with a significantly higher likelihood of meeting criteria for minor depression included younger age, less education, non-Caucasian status, BMI > or = 30 kg/m(2), smoking, longer duration of diabetes, and a higher number of complications in older (> or = 65 years) patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Smoking and obesity were associated with a higher likelihood of meeting criteria for major and minor depression. Diabetes complications and elevated HbA(1c) were associated with major depression among demographic subgroups: complications among men and HbA(1c) among individuals <65 years of age. Older patients with a higher number of complications had an increased likelihood of minor depression.","[{'authorId': '7278840', 'name': 'W. Katon'}, {'authorId': '88587665', 'name': 'M.

The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study is a prospective cohort study with a 21-year follow-up. At baseline, detailed quantitative information on subjects' food consumption was obtained using a 48 h dietary recall method (n 1768, aged 3–18 years). The interviews were repeated after 6 and 21 years (n 1200 and n 1037, respectively). We conducted a principal component analysis to identify major dietary patterns at each study point. A set of two similar patterns was recognised throughout the study. Pattern 1 was positively correlated with consumption of traditional Finnish foods, such as rye, potatoes, milk, butter, sausages and coffee, and negatively correlated with fruit, berries and dairy products other than milk. Pattern 1 type of diet was more common among male subjects, smokers and those living in rural areas. Pattern 2, predominant among female subjects, non-smokers and in urban areas, was characterised by more health-conscious food choices such as vegetables, legumes and nuts, tea, rye, cheese and other dairy products, and also by consumption of alcoholic beverages.

2f92562bf9f4c6238ce0bd1af7170dcf5ed7fbcd,"A major stumbling block for emotional intelligence (EI) research has been the lack of adequate evidence for discriminant validity. In a sample of 280 dyads, self- and peer-reports of EI and Big Five personality traits were used to confirm an a priori four-factor model for the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) and a five-factor model for Goldberg’s International Personality Item Pool (IPIP). After demonstrating measurement equivalence between self-report and peer-report for both scales, the authors show discriminant validity between the four EI subfacets and Big Five personality traits. This is accomplished through a series of structural equation models fit to the mutitrait-multimethod matrix. Despite their conclusion of discriminant validity, the authors note strong latent correlations between Others’ Emotion Appraisal and trait Agreeableness (φ = .87), between Use of Emotion and trait Conscientiousness (φ = .73), between Regulation of Emotion and trait Neuroticism (φ = −.66), and between Self Emotion Appraisal and trait Neuroticism (φ = −.66). There is also post hoc evidence of potential leniency in self-reported emotion regulation. Results point to the utility of peer-report methods as well as the relative construct validity of various subfacets of self-reported emotional competence.","[{'authorId': '4822520', 'name': 'Dana L Joseph'}, {'authorId': '144294057', 'name': 'Daniel A.

This study aims to assess the prevalence of chronic pain, its characteristics, and its impact on the general Spanish population. Also, to establish chronic pain patient subgroups according to the characteristics of pain and to identify variables specifically associated with each subgroup.


DESIGN
Telephone-based, cross-sectional nationwide study.


SUBJECTS
A sample of 1,957 individuals representative of the Spanish population.


METHODS
Data were collected through telephone interviews. A subject was considered to have chronic pain if they had suffered pain (at least 4 days a week) during the last 3 months. The subjects were divided into two subgroups through a cluster analysis, and a regression model was established to determine the variables most specifically associated with these subgroups.


RESULTS
The prevalence of chronic pain was 16.6% (95% confidence interval: 14.9-18.3) and among these subjects, more than 50% referred to limitations in their daily activities, 30% felt sad and/or anxious, and 47.2% indicated that their pain was affecting their family life. Two subgroups of subjects with pain were identified: 1) characterized by generalized pain in more than one location and of a long evolution (150 months); and 2) characterized by pain localized to only one site with a shorter duration (100 months). Individuals who felt anxious because of their pain and those who considered that their pain was affecting their family were more likely to belong to group 1.


CONCLUSIONS
Pain affects an important proportion of the Spanish adult population and that it has a strong personal impact. Two pain groups were clearly distinguished by their clinical characteristics.","[{'authorId': '145783934', 'name': 'M. Dueñas'}, {'authorId': '144804363', 'name': 'A.

Associations were also found between measures of secondary control coping and cognitive reappraisal and positive and negative affect and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Further, the findings suggest that reports of cognitive reappraisal may be more strongly predictive of positive affect whereas secondary control coping may be more strongly predictive of negative affect and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Overall, the results suggest that current measures of secondary control coping and cognitive reappraisal capture related but distinct constructs and suggest that the assessment of working memory may be more strongly related to secondary control coping in predicting individual differences in distress.","[{'authorId': '48662364', 'name': 'Charissa F.

This study investigates the development of behavioral self-regulation between the ages of 3 and 7 years, with a direct focus on possible heterogeneity in the developmental trajectories, and a set of potential indicators that distinguish unique behavioral self-regulation trajectories. Across 3 diverse samples, 1,386 children were assessed on behavioral self-regulation from preschool through first grade. Results indicated that majority of children develop self-regulation rapidly during early childhood, and that children follow 3 distinct developmental patterns of growth. These 3 trajectories were distinguishable based on timing of rapid gains, as well as child gender, early language skills, and maternal education levels. Findings highlight early developmental differences in how self-regulation unfolds, with implications for offering individualized support across children.

Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the hypothesized four-factor model best described the structure of the job-related affective well-being scale; that is, the scale included four interrelated factors of job-related anxiety, comfort, depression, and enthusiasm at both measurement times. Structural equation modelling showed that high feelings of comfort at work were longitudinally associated with a positive perception of the supportiveness of the organizational climate, after controlling for sense of coherence. Conversely, the work characteristics included in this study (job control and supportive organizational climate) did not serve as antecedents of job-related affective well-being during the follow-up. In addition, there were no cross-sectional or longitudinal curvilinear associations between work characteristics and job-related affective well-being: associations were found to be linear. We conclude that (a) Warr's scale of job-related affective well-being is best conceptualized as consisting of four interrelated dimensions whose factor structure is (b) highly stable across a 3-year time interval.","[{'authorId': '4933710', 'name': 'Anne Mäkikangas'}, {'authorId': '4995092', 'name': 'T.

However, whether parasympathetic flexibility (vagal withdrawal to emotional or environmental challenges such as sadness, and vagal augmentation during recovery from sadness) could facilitate the effectiveness of adaptive affect regulation strategies is not known. In a study of 178 undergraduate students, we evaluated whether parasympathetic flexibility in response to a sad film involving loss would enhance the effectiveness of regulatory strategies (reappraisal, distraction, and suppression) spontaneously employed to reduce negative affect during a 2-min uninstructed recovery period following the induction. Parasympathetic reactivity and recovery were indexed by fluctuations in respiratory sinus arrhythmia and high-frequency heart rate variability. Cognitive reappraisal and distraction were more effective in attenuating negative affect among individuals with more parasympathetic flexibility, particularly greater vagal augmentation during recovery, relative to individuals with less parasympathetic flexibility. In contrast, suppression was associated with less attenuation of negative affect, but only among individuals who also had less vagal withdrawal during the sad film. Alternative models provided partial support for reversed directionality, with reappraisal predicting greater parasympathetic recovery, but only when individuals also experienced greater reductions in negative affect. These results suggest that contextually appropriate parasympathetic reactivity and recovery may facilitate the success of affect regulation. Impairments in parasympathetic flexibility could confer risk for affective disorders due to attenuated capacity for effective self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '4826701', 'name': 'J.

The current meta-analysis aimed to provide a thorough, quantitative examination of the associations between PTS and several aspects of ER. A search of the PsychINFO database resulted in 2557 titles, of which 57 met full inclusion criteria (the cross-sectional association between PTS symptoms and ER was reported, participants were 18 years or older, the article was written in English, and sufficient information was reported to calculate effect sizes). From the 57 studies that were included, 74 effect sizes were obtained. All studies were independently coded by two of the study authors for the following: citation, sample type, total N size (and group n's if applicable), mean age of participants, type of traumatic event, study design, PTS measure(s), ER measure(s), and effect size information. Eight random effects models were conducted: seven for individual ER strategies (e.g., rumination) and one for general emotion dysregulation. The largest effects were observed for general emotion dysregulation (r = 0.53; k = 13), rumination (r = 0.51; k = 5), thought suppression (r = 0.47; k = 13), and experiential avoidance (r = 0.40; k = 20). Medium effects were observed for expressive suppression (r = 0.29; k = 3) and worry (r = 0.28; k = 6). Significant effects were not observed for acceptance or reappraisal. Moderator analyses (sample and trauma type) were conducted for general emotion dysregulation, experiential avoidance, and thought suppression; no significant differences were observed. Findings from the current analysis suggest that several aspects of ER are associated with PTS symptoms across a variety of samples.

Created using a human-centered design process with young adults treated for cancer, Vivibot content includes 4 weeks of positive psychology skills, daily emotion ratings, video, and other material produced by survivors, and periodic feedback check-ins. All participants were assessed for psychosocial well-being via online surveys at baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 8. Analyses examined chatbot engagement and open-ended feedback on likability and perceived helpfulness and compared experimental and control groups with regard to anxiety and depression symptoms and positive and negative emotion changes between baseline and 4 weeks. To verify the main effects, follow-up analyses compared changes in the main outcomes between 4 and 8 weeks in the control group once participants had access to all chatbot content. Results Data from 45 young adults (36 women; mean age: 25 [SD 2.9]; experimental group: n=25; control group: n=20) were analyzed. Participants in the experimental group spent an average of 74 minutes across an average of 12 active sessions chatting with Vivibot and rated their experience as helpful (mean 2.0/3, SD 0.72) and would recommend it to a friend (mean 6.9/10; SD 2.6). Open-ended feedback noted its nonjudgmental nature as a particular benefit of the chatbot. After 4 weeks, participants in the experimental group reported an average reduction in anxiety of 2.58 standardized t-score units, while the control group reported an increase in anxiety of 0.7 units. A mixed-effects models revealed a trend-level (P=.09) interaction between group and time, with an effect size of 0.41. Those in the experimental group also experienced greater reductions in anxiety when they engaged in more sessions (z=–1.9, P=.06). There were no significant (or trend level) effects by group on changes in depression, positive emotion, or negative emotion. Conclusions The chatbot format provides a useful and acceptable way of delivering positive psychology skills to young adults who have undergone cancer treatment and supports anxiety reduction. Further analysis with a larger sample size is required to confirm this pattern.","[{'authorId': '49842064', 'name': 'Stephanie Greer'}, {'authorId': '6464821', 'name': 'Danielle E.

Relationships between LMX and its correlates are examined, as are issues related to the LMX construct, including measurement and leader-member agreement. Results suggest significant relationships between LMX and job performance, satisfaction with supervision, overall satisfaction, commitment, role conflict, role clarity, member competence, and turnover intentions. The relationship between LMX and actual turnover was not significant. Leader and member LMX perceptions were only moderately related. Partial support was found for measurement instrument and perspective (i.e., leader vs. member) as moderators of the relationships between LMX and its correlates. Meta-analysis showed that the LMX7 (7-item LMX) measure has the soundest psychometric properties of all instruments and that LMX is congruent with numerous empirical relationships associated with transformational leadership. Within the broad area of organizationa l leadership, leader-member exchange (LMX) theory has evolved into one of the more interesting and useful approaches for studying hypothesized linkages between leadership processes and outcomes. First proposed by Graeri and colleagues (Dansereau, Cashman, & Graen, 1973; Dansereau, Graen, & Haga, 1975; Graen, 1976; Graen & Cashman, 1975), LMX is distinguished from other leadership theories by its focus on the dyadic relationship between a leader and a member. Unlike traditional theories that seek to explain leadership as a function of personal characteristics of the leader, features of the situation, or an interaction between the two, LMX is unique in its adoption of the dyadic relationship as the level of analysis.

The authors investigate how the social cues inherent in avatars influence consumers' affect and shopping value. In Study 1, social cues induce perceptions of Web site socialness, leading to increased pleasure and arousal, both of which positively influence flow, hedonic and utilitarian value, and patronage intentions. Study 2 finds that social cue–induced arousal leads to increased pleasure only for consumers who are involved with the product category. Moreover, the influence of arousal on hedonic value is stronger for women, flow does not lead to pleasure for older consumers, and utilitarian value is less important for this group than for their younger counterparts. The findings suggest that there is a competitive advantage for online retailers that use social cues that provide consumers with enhanced perceptions of human connection and the formation of emotional bonds.","[{'authorId': '2108594640', 'name': 'Liz C.

Cognitive functions were measured using a continuous performance test (CPT; California Computerized Assessment Package, Abbreviated version) and a working memory test (WMT); based on Baddeley & Hitch (1974). The regression analysis of the HRV revealed that the interpersonal facet explained most of the variance during baseline (28%), CPT (16%), and WMT (12%). This was also true for the HR data during baseline (28%), CPT (20%), WMT (10%), and recovery (13%). The antisocial facet explained 10% of the variance only during baseline. Subjects scoring high compared to low on the interpersonal facet also showed better cognitive functioning.

The authors evaluated the results of complete cognitive function examinations in a series of 65 adolescents who had undergone surgery for sagittal or unicoronal craniosynostosis when they were younger than 1 year old.


METHODS
Each of the 65 study participants was evaluated individually. The neuropsychological assessment, consisting of a battery of tests tailored to the patient's age, cognitive level, and level of cooperation, was conducted in 2 separate sessions on the same day. The main outcome measures included fine motor skills, language, visual motor spatial and visual perceptual skills, working and visual memory, attention, executive function, and verbal fluency.


RESULTS
Thirty-five children (mean age 13.4 years) were affected by sagittal synostosis and 30 (mean age 14.9 years) by unicoronal synostosis (16 right-sided, 14 left-sided). The mean age at surgery was 7.2 months. All of the children had begun school at a normal age and attended regular classes. Seven percent of those with sagittal craniosynostosis demonstrated visuospatial and constructional ability defects with associated visual memory recall deficits; 17% also exhibited selective and sustained attention deficits. Approximately one-third (30%) of the children with anterior plagiocephaly had processing and planning speech deficits.


CONCLUSIONS
Data in this study support the hypothesis that children with sagittal or unicoronal craniosynostosis, although they undergo early surgical treatment, may still manifest lower than average results at long-term selective neuropsychological evaluations.","[{'authorId': '6351474', 'name': 'D.

This study investigates the trajectory of change in depressive symptomatology over the course of the perinatal period as related to interpersonal risk factors (marital quality and social support) in a sample of 69 low-income, mostly immigrant Latina mothers at high and low risk for depression. We found a significant linear change in depressive symptomatology from baseline (pregnancy) through the postpartum period. This decline was steeper for high-risk women who reported high levels of social support compared with those who reported low levels of social support. In addition, a greater decline in depressive symptom scores was found for women who reported better postnatal marital quality, irrespective of risk group status. The results suggest the importance of considering marital quality and social support in estimations of risk for depression. These findings also have implications for targeting social support and marital quality in preventive interventions for perinatal depression in Latinas.","[{'authorId': '48781631', 'name': 'Manuela A.

Divorced individuals are particularly predisposed to loneliness in cultures where post-divorce relationships are uncommon or stigmatized. The aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on the emotional regulation and loneliness of divorced women in Iran, a culture with strong honor values that condemn post-divorce relationships for women leading to increased levels of loneliness and social exclusion in divorced Iranian women. The present study was carried out using a pretest-posttest control group study design. The research sample consisted of 30 divorced women who were randomly assigned to experimental (vs. control) groups. In order to evaluate the variables of interest, the emotional regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and UCLA Loneliness Scale were used. Divorced women in the experimental group were treated using ACT techniques in eight sessions, each lasting 90 minutes. Results of analysis of covariance showed a significant increase in the adaptive emotional regulation of divorced women in the experimental group after the intervention. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the loneliness of divorced women who received the ACT intervention. We find that the ACT intervention improves emotional regulation and reduces loneliness in divorced women in Iran.","[{'authorId': '2010020168', 'name': 'A.

However, much learning today is highly interactive and technologically enhanced, which an individually oriented perspective to regulated learning does not consider. In this article we discuss regulation by bringing situational and contextual variation of regulated learning into focus. We introduce a situative perspective on regulation of learning and give arguments and examples on how it can offer a way to conceptually and empirically grasp multiple layers of regulated learning in social contexts. We also compare the given perspective with sociocognitive and sociocultural perspectives to regulated learning. We conclude that the situative perspective can significantly enrich understanding about individual and group learning as a regulated activity, because it offers a way to examine regulation beyond the individual while not losing sight of learners as individual subjects.","[{'authorId': '2445256', 'name': 'H.

Illness intrusiveness was defined as the result of disruptions of valued activities and interests due to constraints imposed by the illness. An excellent fit of this model to the data was found using structural equation modeling. The model explained 65% of the variance in depressive symptomatology. Assessment of an alternative model excluding personal control suggested that the extent to which diabetes intrudes in life, rather than diabetic complications per se or personal control, is a key factor in relation to depressive symptomatology in individuals with diabetes.","[{'authorId': '144476209', 'name': 'F.

Method Medline and PubMed were searched to identify peer-reviewed English-language studies published between January 1980 and May 2005 reporting on depression, anxiety, and burnout among U.S. and Canadian medical students. Searches used combinations of the Medical Subject Heading terms medical student and depression, depressive disorder major, depressive disorder, professional burnout, mental health, depersonalization, distress, anxiety, or emotional exhaustion. Reference lists of retrieved articles were inspected to identify relevant additional articles. Demographic information, instruments used, prevalence data on student distress, and statistically significant associations were abstracted. Results The search identified 40 articles on medical student psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, burnout, and related mental health problems) that met the authors' criteria. No studies of burnout among medical students were identified. The studies suggest a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students, with levels of overall psychological distress consistently higher than in the general population and age-matched peers by the later years of training. Overall, the studies suggest psychological distress may be higher among female students. Limited data were available regarding the causes of student distress and its impact on academic performance, dropout rates, and professional development. Conclusions Medical school is a time of significant psychological distress for physicians-in-training. Currently available information is insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the causes and consequences of student distress. Large, prospective, multicenter studies are needed to identify personal and training-related features that influence depression, anxiety, and burnout among students and explore relationships between distress and competency.","[{'authorId': '3616348', 'name': 'L.

 As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.

Amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli has emerged as one potential pathway. Here, we investigate the influence of self-reported sleep quality on associations between threat-related amygdala reactivity and measures of negative affect and perceived stress. Methods Analyses on data from 299 participants (125 men, 50.5% white, mean [standard deviation] age = 19.6 [1.3] years) who completed the Duke Neurogenetics Study were conducted. Participants completed several self-report measures of negative affect and perceived stress. Threat-related (i.e., angry and fearful facial expressions) amygdala reactivity was assayed using blood oxygen level–dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Global sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results Amygdala reactivity to fearful facial expressions predicted greater depressive symptoms and higher perceived stress in poor (&bgr; values = 0.18–1.86, p values < .05) but not good sleepers (&bgr; values = −0.13 to −0.01, p values > .05). In sex-specific analyses, men reporting poorer global sleep quality showed a significant association between amygdala reactivity and levels of depression and perceived stress (&bgr; values = 0.29–0.44, p values < .05). In contrast, no significant associations were observed in men reporting good global sleep quality or in women, irrespective of sleep quality. Conclusions This study provides novel evidence that self-reported sleep quality moderates the relationships between amygdala reactivity, negative affect, and perceived stress, particularly among men.","[{'authorId': '3626306', 'name': 'A.

This 20-item model was subsequently cross-validated with a second sample of Turkish adults (n = 187). Scale scores showed adequate internal consistency, 5-week test-retest reliability, and satisfactory convergent and criterion-related validity. It was concluded that Turkish DSI-R (DSI-T) is a valid and reliable measure to assess an individual's differentiation level.

For this reason, in the last years new treatment approaches targeting emotion identification, expression, and regulation have been applied and tested. Using the PRISMA methodology, we performed a scoping review of the literature about treatment outcome in anorexia nervosa, in terms of changes in alexithymia as assessed by its most commonly used self-report measure, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS). The Medline and Scopus databases were searched, and articles were included if matching the following criteria: dealing with patients affected by anorexia nervosa, without limits of age; involving the application of any kind of targeted therapy or treatment; assessing alexithymia and the effect of a treatment intervention on alexithymia, using the TAS. Ten studies were eventually included; overall, according to the selected studies, alexithymia levels often remain high even after specific treatment. Further research aimed at a deeper understanding of the actual impact of alexithymia on the outcome of anorexia, as well as exploring alternative treatment strategies for alexithymia in eating disorders (EDs), are warranted.","[{'authorId': '5951915', 'name': 'C.

Despite its importance, IER’s psychological structure remains poorly understood. We propose that two key dimensions describe IER: (a) individuals’ tendency to pursue IER in response to emotional events, and (b) the efficacy with which they perceive IER improves their emotional lives. To probe these dimensions, we developed the Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ), a valid and reliable measure of individual differences in IER. Factor analyses of participants’ responses confirmed tendency and efficacy as independent dimensions of IER (Study 1; N (cid:2) 285), and demonstrated independence between how individuals engage with IER in response to negative, versus positive, emotion. In Study 2 ( N (cid:2) 347), we found that individuals high in IER tendency and efficacy are more emotionally expressive, empathetic, and socially connected. Two subsequent studies highlighted behavioral consequences of IER dimensions: people high in IER tendency sought out others more often following experimentally induced emotion (Study 3; N (cid:2) 400), and individuals high in IER efficacy benefitted more from social support after real-world emotional events (Study 4; N (cid:2) 787). Finally, a field study of social networks in freshman dormitories revealed that individuals high in IER tendency and efficacy developed more supportive relationships during the first year of college (Study 5; N (cid:2) 193).

33c55bbb85c43af61870182f098d7694c12a725f,"One of the major differences between B2C e-services (Business to Consumer Internet-based services) and the more traditional types of consumer services is that websites of e-services frequently lack the social presence of the physical services. This lack of social presence may impede the growth of B2C by hindering the development of consumer trust in the service provider. Human interaction, or at least the belief that the system has characteristics of social presence, is believed to be critical in the creation of trust. Trust itself is a major issue affecting the phenomenal growth rate of e-commerce, according to industry sources and recent academic studies. This study examines the effect of social presence on consumer trust in e-services and the relative importance of consumer trust in comparison with the widely studied TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) beliefs. In a free simulation experiment, 161 MBA student subjects assessed Travelocity.com, a popular online travel agency. Findings show that social presence, indeed, affects consumer trust and that trust subsequently has a stronger effect on purchase intentions than TAM beliefs. Implications for e-services are discussed in terms of whether the benefits from adopting an IT depend more on website characteristics like usefulness and ease of use or on consumer trust in the vendor. Managing e-services calls for managing the trust that is engendered in the customer experience on the website. Firms that excel in instilling high degrees of social presence in their websites may prosper more than those that do not.","[{'authorId': '1736324', 'name': 'D.

To produce a framework for the development of a qualitative semi-structured interview guide.


BACKGROUND
Rigorous data collection procedures fundamentally influence the results of studies. The semi-structured interview is a common data collection method, but methodological research on the development of a semi-structured interview guide is sparse.


DESIGN
Systematic methodological review.


DATA SOURCES
We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science for methodological papers on semi-structured interview guides from October 2004-September 2014. Having examined 2,703 titles and abstracts and 21 full texts, we finally selected 10 papers.


REVIEW METHODS
We analysed the data using the qualitative content analysis method.


RESULTS
Our analysis resulted in new synthesized knowledge on the development of a semi-structured interview guide, including five phases: (1) identifying the prerequisites for using semi-structured interviews; (2) retrieving and using previous knowledge; (3) formulating the preliminary semi-structured interview guide; (4) pilot testing the guide; and (5) presenting the complete semi-structured interview guide.


CONCLUSION
Rigorous development of a qualitative semi-structured interview guide contributes to the objectivity and trustworthiness of studies and makes the results more plausible. Researchers should consider using this five-step process to develop a semi-structured interview guide and justify the decisions made during it.","[{'authorId': '47550577', 'name': 'Hanna Kallio'}, {'authorId': '2495575', 'name': 'A.

The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Romanian diabetes patients and to identify the risk factors associated with depression. Methods A total of 144 type 2 diabetes patients were included in the study. Five models of presumed predictors were used to assess the risk factors for depressive symptoms, using hierarchical regression analysis. Together with demographics, disease, lifestyle predictors, previous depressive symptoms and diabetes distress were taken into account. Results In our sample the prevalence of depression was 12.6%. Main risk factors for depressive symptoms were previous depressive symptoms which were associated with depression in both Model 4 (β=0.297, p=0.013) and Model 5 (β=0.239, p=0.017) and diabetes distress in Model 5 (β=0.540, p≤0.001). Employment (β =−0.276, p=0.029) and increased number of diabetes complications (β=0.236, p=0.017) became significant when diabetes distress was added to the analysis. Conclusions The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be in range with the prevalence identified in the literature. Previous depression and diabetes distress were both independently associated with depression, confirming the bidirectional relationship between depression and diabetes distress. Due to the consequences for daily living, screening for diabetes distress and depression should be done in primary care units both by physicians and trained nurses.","[{'authorId': '34639999', 'name': 'A.

Further, within e-commerce situations, system trust plays an important role in the nomological network by directly affecting trust in vendors and indirectly affecting attitudes and intentions to purchase.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the bi-directional associations between obesity and depression in adolescents using longitudinal studies. A systematic literature search was conducted using Pubmed (including Medline), PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS Preview and the Cochrane Library databases. According to the inclusion criteria, 13 studies were found where seven studies evaluated depression leading to obesity and six other studies examined obesity leading to depression. Using a bias-adjusted quality effects model for the meta-analysis, we found that adolescents who were depressed had a 70% (RR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.40, 2.07) increased risk of being obese, conversely obese adolescents had an increased risk of 40% (RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.70) of being depressed. The risk difference (RD) of early adolescent depression leading to obesity is 3% higher risk than it is for obesity leading to depression. In sensitivity analysis, the association between depression leading to obesity was greater than that of obesity leading to depression for females in early adulthood compared with females in late adolescence. Overall, the findings of this study suggest a bi-directional association between depression and obesity that was stronger for female adolescents. However, this finding also underscores the importance of early detection and treatment strategies to inhibit the development of reciprocal disorders.","[{'authorId': '40371672', 'name': 'M.

The authors evaluated the effectiveness of brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for the prevention of suicide attempts in military personnel.


METHOD
In a randomized controlled trial, active-duty Army soldiers at Fort Carson, Colo., who either attempted suicide or experienced suicidal ideation with intent, were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (N=76) or treatment as usual plus brief CBT (N=76). Assessment of incidence of suicide attempts during the follow-up period was conducted with the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview. Inclusion criteria were the presence of suicidal ideation with intent to die during the past week and/or a suicide attempt within the past month. Soldiers were excluded if they had a medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent informed consent or participation in outpatient treatment, such as active psychosis or mania. To determine treatment efficacy with regard to incidence and time to suicide attempt, survival curve analyses were conducted. Differences in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using longitudinal random-effects models.


RESULTS
From baseline to the 24-month follow-up assessment, eight participants in brief CBT (13.8%) and 18 participants in treatment as usual (40.2%) made at least one suicide attempt (hazard ratio=0.38, 95% CI=0.16-0.87, number needed to treat=3.88), suggesting that soldiers in brief CBT were approximately 60% less likely to make a suicide attempt during follow-up than soldiers in treatment as usual. There were no between-group differences in severity of psychiatric symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Brief CBT was effective in preventing follow-up suicide attempts among active-duty military service members with current suicidal ideation and/or a recent suicide attempt.","[{'authorId': '2245888442', 'name': 'M.

DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Sociofile for English-language articles published from 1980 through March 2004, conducted hand searches of bibliographies, and consulted with experts. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies from developed countries that assessed women for depression during pregnancy or the first year postpartum with a structured clinical interview. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of the 109 articles reviewed, 28 met our inclusion criteria. For major and minor depression (major depression alone), the combined point prevalence estimates from meta-analyses ranged from 6.5% to 12.9% (1.0-5.6%) at different trimesters of pregnancy and months in the first postpartum year. The combined period prevalence shows that as many as 19.2% (7.1%) of women have a depressive episode (major depressive episode) during the first 3 months postpartum; most of these episodes have onset following delivery. All estimates have wide 95% confidence intervals, showing significant uncertainty in their true levels. No conclusions could be made regarding the relative incidence of depression among pregnant and postpartum women compared with women at nonchildbearing times. CONCLUSION: To better delineate periods of peak prevalence and incidence for perinatal depression and identify high risk subpopulations, we need studies with larger and more representative samples.","[{'authorId': '4628704', 'name': 'N.

374da78bfcd109dd1cf4bd57fe75af47ad7d2350,"The common factor model assumes that the linear coefficients (intercepts and factor loadings) linking the observed variables to the latent factors are fixed coefficients (i.e., common for all participants). When the observed variables are participants' observed responses to stimuli, such as their responses to the items of a questionnaire, the assumption of common linear coefficients may be too restrictive. For instance, this may occur if participants consistently use the response scale idiosyncratically. To account for this phenomenon, the authors partially relax the fixed coefficients assumption by allowing the intercepts in the factor model to change across participants. The model is attractive when m factors are expected on the basis of substantive theory but m + 1 factors are needed in practice to adequately reproduce the data. Also, this model for single-level data can be fitted with conventional software for structural equation modeling. The authors demonstrate the use of this model with an empirical data set on optimism in which they compare it with competing models such as the bifactor and the correlated trait-correlated method minus 1 models.","[{'authorId': '1401751448', 'name': 'Albert Maydeu-Olivares'}, {'authorId': '2765244', 'name': 'D.

Background: Research has revealed that the reliability of imperfect automation is frequently misperceived. We examined the manner in which the easiness and type of imperfect automation errors affect trust and dependence. Method: Participants performed a target detection task utilizing an automated aid. In Study 1, the aid missed targets either on easy trials (easy miss group) or on difficult trials (difficult miss group). In Study 2, we manipulated both easiness and type of error (miss vs. false alarm). The aid erred on either difficult trials alone (difficult errors group) or on difficult and easy trials (easy miss group; easy false alarm group). Results: In both experiments, easy errors led to participants mistrusting and disagreeing more with the aid on difficult trials, as compared with those using aids that generated only difficult errors. This resulted in a downward shift in decision criterion for the former, leading to poorer overall performance. Misses and false alarms led to similar effects. Conclusion: Automation errors on tasks that appear “easy” to the operator severely degrade trust and reliance. Application: Potential applications include the implementation of system design solutions that circumvent the negative effects of easy automation errors.","[{'authorId': '2820508', 'name': 'P.

The anatomical structure of the ANS and its central control constitute the basis for understanding autonomic effects of emotion. The chapter talks about neural feedback mechanisms, although hormonal, chemical, and physical feedback mechanisms may also operate through interactions with central components of this neural pathway.

However, because CFA can produce strongly biased estimations when the population cross-loadings differ meaningfully from zero, it may not be the most appropriate framework to model the SDQ responses. With this in mind, the current study sought to assess the factorial structure of the SDQ using the more flexible exploratory structural equation modeling approach. Using a large-scale Spanish sample composed of 67,253 youths aged between 10 and 18 years (M = 14.16, SD = 1.07), the results showed that CFA provided a severely biased and overly optimistic assessment of the underlying structure of the SDQ. In contrast, exploratory structural equation modeling revealed a generally weak factorial structure, including questionable indicators with large cross-loadings, multiple error correlations, and significant wording variance. A subsequent Monte Carlo study showed that sample sizes greater than 4,000 would be needed to adequately recover the SDQ loading structure. The findings from this study prevent recommending the SDQ as a screening tool and suggest caution when interpreting previous results in the literature based on CFA modeling.","[{'authorId': '144367155', 'name': 'L.

Data were generated from 2 models with 2-7 categories, 4 sample sizes, 2 latent distributions, and 5 patterns of category thresholds. Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6-7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable.","[{'authorId': '2883841', 'name': 'M.

Second, we delineate a model of the mental and neurobiological processes by which mindfulness and mindfulness-based practices improve self-regulation of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, linking them to both performance and employee well-being in the workplace. We especially focus on the power of mindfulness, via improved self-regulation, to enhance social relationships in the workplace, make employees more resilient in the face of challenges, and increase task performance. Third, we outline controversies, questions, and challenges that surround the study of mindfulness, paying special attention to the implications of unresolved issues for understanding the effects of mindfulness at work.

However, medical students tend to seek less professional help to treat their mental health issues. Hence, ways have been devised to reduce emotional stress in this population. Objective The current study uses positive psychology techniques to increase subjective well-being (SWB) in order to reduce symptons of common mental disorders (CMD) in medical students (MS). Methods The study comprised two groups: intervention group (n = 37) and control group (n = 32). Throughout seven weeks, the intervention group had meetings focused on emotions, mental health of medical students, gratitude, appreciation, optimism, resilience, qualities and virtues. The control group attended conventional medical psychology classes (psychosomatic aspects in clinical illness, for example). Results The intervention group presented average increase by 2.85 points in the positive emotions scale; average increase by 2.53 points in the satisfaction-with-life scale; and average decrease by 1.79 points in the SRQ-20 scale, when it was compared to the control group. The intervention effect size was moderate. Conclusion Use of techniques to increase SWB may reduce CMD in MS, even if these techniques do not diminish negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '144225382', 'name': 'Leonardo Machado'}, {'authorId': '34925604', 'name': 'I.

What is unclear is whether emotional suppression, as a defense serving the opposite purpose for high-anxious defense, can also act as a mediator and whether this mediational effect is partly influenced by time since trauma and trauma type. Aims: To investigate whether emotional suppression mediated the links between PTSD and CIU symptom severities, and PTSD and psychiatric co-morbid symptom severities. It then examined whether the mediating effect would be moderated by how long ago the trauma occurred and trauma type. Methods: One hundred CIU patients were compared with 60 allergy patients. They completed questionnaires measuring PTSD, psychiatric co-morbidity and emotional suppression. Results: Suppressing depression mediated the relationship between PTSD and psychiatric co-morbidity. How long ago the trauma occurred and trauma type moderated the mediational effect of suppressing depression. Conclusions: Following a past trauma, CIU patients may develop PTSD symptoms which influence their psychological well-being through using different levels of emotional suppression, especially suppressing depression. The levels depend on the severity of PTSD symptoms, trauma history and whether they experienced interpersonal traumas.","[{'authorId': '51308128', 'name': 'M.

Further, organizational scholars and practitioners frequently appear to assume that emotionality is the antithesis of rationality and, thus, frequently hold a pejorative view of emotion. This has led to four institutionalized mechanisms for regulating the experience and expression of emotion in the workplace: (1) neutralizing, (2) buffering, (3) prescribing, and (4) normalizing emotion. In contrast to this perspective, we argue that emotionality and rationality are interpenetrated, emotions are an integral and inseparable part of organizational life, and emotions are often functional for the organization. This argument is illustrated by applications to motivation, leadership, and group dynamics.","[{'authorId': '1966232', 'name': 'Blake E. Ashforth'}, {'authorId': '5995795', 'name': 'R.

This study explored the relationship between adolescents' emotional intelligence and the tendency to develop an eating disorder.


METHODS
Senior high school students in Taiwan were recruited for the study. A 3- part anonymous questionnaire measured demographic information, body weight satisfaction, and expectation of body weight. Students also completed the Adolescent Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Eating Disorders Attitude- 26 Test (EAT-26). Height and weight were also measured.


RESULTS
The mean of EAT-26 score was 8.66 ± 7.36, and 8.6% students were at high risk to develop eating disorders. Gender, body weight, body dissatisfaction and the expected body shape were significantly related to disturbed eating attitudes and behaviours. Scores of EAT-26 were positively correlated with emotional perception, emotional expression, and emotional application.


CONCLUSIONS
Disturbed eating behaviours exist among adolescents in Taiwan, and these behaviours may be related to emotional intelligence. However further studies with larger samples are needed.","[{'authorId': '33028922', 'name': 'Y.

Both the pandemic and the measures taken to combat it can affect individuals’ mental health. Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety and health anxiety in Turkish society during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine the factors affecting these. Method: The study was performed using an online questionnaire. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). The effects on depression, anxiety and health anxiety levels of factors such as age, sex, marital status, living with an individual aged above 60, the presence of a new Coronavirus+ patient among friends or relatives, previous and current psychiatric illness and presence of accompanying chronic disease were then investigated. Results: In terms of HADS cut-off points, 23.6% (n = 81) of the population scored above the depression cut-off point, and 45.1% (n = 155) scored above the cut-off point for anxiety. In regression analysis, female gender, living in urban areas and previous psychiatric illness history were found as risk factors for anxiety; living in urban areas was found as risk factor for depression; and female gender, accompanying chronic disease and previous psychiatric history were found as risk factors for health anxiety. Conclusion: The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the groups most psychologically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are women, individuals with previous psychiatric illness, individuals living in urban areas and those with an accompanying chronic disease.

Previous research has examined the developmental consequences, particularly in early childhood, of parents’ supportive and unsupportive responses to children’s negative emotions. Much less is known about factors that explain why parents respond in ways that may support or undermine their children’s emotions, and even less is known about how these parenting processes unfold with adolescents. In the present study, researchers examined the associations between mothers’ attachment styles and their distress, harsh, and supportive responses to their adolescents’ negative emotions two years later and whether these links were mediated by maternal emotion regulation difficulties. Design. Mothers in a longitudinal study (n = 230) reported on their attachment style, difficulties regulating their emotions, and their hypothetical responses to their adolescents’ negative emotions, respectively, at consecutive laboratory visits one year apart. Results. Mothers who reported greater attachment-related avoidance and anxiety reported having greater difficulties with emotion regulation one year later. Emotion dysregulation, in turn, predicted more distressed, harsher, and less supportive maternal responses to adolescents’ negative emotions the following year. In addition, greater avoidance directly predicted harsher maternal responses two years later. Conclusions. These findings extend previous research by identifying maternal attachment style as a predictor of responses to adolescent distress and by documenting the underlying role of emotion dysregulation in the link between adult attachment style and parenting.","[{'authorId': '14474366', 'name': 'Jason D Jones'}, {'authorId': '39316191', 'name': 'Bonnie E.

3a2a8b2ca01e33cee0062bd2a804c39297df6acb,"Emotional eating is associated with an increased risk of binge eating, eating in the absence of hunger and obesity risk. While previous studies with children and adolescents suggest that emotion regulation may be a key predictor of this dysregulated eating behavior, little is known about what other factors may be influencing the link between emotional regulation and emotional eating in adolescence. This multi-method longitudinal study (n = 138) utilized linear regression models to examine associations between childhood emotion regulation, adolescent weight status and negative body image, and emotional eating at age 17. Emotion regulation predicted adolescent emotional eating and this link was moderated by weight status (β = 1.19, p < 0.01) and negative body image (β = −0.34, p < 0.01). Higher engagement in emotional eating was predicted by lower emotional regulation scores among normal-weight teens (β = −0.46, p < 0.001) but not among overweight/obese teens (β = 0.32, p > 0.10). Higher scores on emotion regulation were significantly associated with lower emotional eating at high (β = −1.59, p < 0.001) and low (β = −1.00, p < 0.01) levels of negative body image. Engagement in emotional eating was predicted by higher negative body image among overweight/obese teens only (β = 0.70, p < 0.001). Our findings show that while better childhood emotion regulation skills are associated with lower emotional eating, weight status and negative body image influence this link and should be considered as important foci in future interventions that aim to reduce emotional eating in adolescence.","[{'authorId': '3562685', 'name': 'L.

3a86786ca180a33c0985c26ebaf6a46d833d6f58,"The idea that emotions play an important role in management and leadership is not really all that new. Mastenbroek (2000), for example, detailed how emotion has been a central feature of organizational management for over 2000 years. In the leadership literature, Redl (1942) was the first to report on the powerful effect of leaders on the emotional makeup of work groups; and emotions are featured in the early theories of leadership and management. For example, Fayol (1916/1949) noted that leaders needed to understand all aspects of their subordinates psyche, including their emotional states. More recently, Weiss and Brief (2001) detailed how emotions at work figured prominently in the early theories of organizational behavior. Today, most theories of leadership, especially charismatic and transformational leadership, have become inherently emotional (e.g., see Shamir & Howell, 1999, on charismatic leadership; and Ashkanasy & Tse, 2000, on transformational leadership). Despite this, and as Ashkanasy and Jordan (2008) recently observed, leadership scholars have in general been slow to develop broadly-based theories of leadership that incorporate an emotional dimension. In fact, it was not until 1995 that interest in emotions and leadership began to receive mainstream attention. This was the year Ashforth and Humphrey (1995) published ‘Emotion in the workplace: a reappraisal.’ Also published in the same year was the best-selling book by Goleman (1995), Emotional intelligence: why it can matter more than IQ. The problem at that point in time, however, continued to be lack of a theoretical foundation for incorporating emotional dimensions into the prevailing theories of leadership. For example, Yukl (1999) noted that contemporary theories of charismatic and transformational leadership tended to focus on dyadic relationships, rather than trying to understand interpersonal processes such as emotion. This position began to change rapidly in the early years of the 2000s, with the appearance of theoretical models by Ashkanasy and Tse (2000), Barbuto and Burbach (2006), Caruso, Mayer and Salovey (2002), and George (2000). These were followed by a string of empirical studies, especially focusing on the role of emotional intelligence (e.g., see Gardner & Stough, 2002; Wolff, Pescosolido, & Druskat, 2002; Wong & Law, 2002), culminating in a Special Issue of The Leadership Quarterly, guest-edited by Humphrey (2002). Despite this progress, and as Ashkanasy and Jordan (2008) pointed out, the existing theories of leadership continue to emphasize isolated individual characteristics such as emotional intelligence. Ashkanasy and Jordan recommended that scholars need to broaden their perspective to include the influence of leadership at all levels of","[{'authorId': '70294020', 'name': 'N.

Methods: All-night polysomnography was obtained in patients with acute Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition major depressive disorder (n = 22) and age-, gender-, and body weight-matched comparison controls (n = 18). After the onset of sleep, nocturnal serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), and IL-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR) were sampled. Results: As compared with matched controls, depressed patients showed significant (p <.05) nocturnal elevations of circulating levels of IL-6 and sICAM. Both sleep latency and rapid eye movement (REM) density had moderate correlations with IL-6 and sICAM (r’s ≥0.30). Backward regression analyses indicated that sleep latency (&bgr; = 0.34, p <.05) and REM density (&bgr; = 0.27, p = .09) were better predictors of IL-6 than depressive status. Similarly, sleep latency (&bgr; = 0.27, p = .06) and REM density (&bgr; = 0.32, p = .02) were also better predictors of sICAM. Conclusion: These findings support the hypothesis that sleep disturbance is associated with elevated levels of the inflammatory markers IL-6 and sICAM. This relationship was not accounted for by other confounding factors such as age and body weight. These findings suggest that the elevations in inflammatory markers found in depressive subjects may be partially the result of disturbances of sleep initiation found in this population.

The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users. Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement—a reporting guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realising these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this explanation and elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA statement, this document, and the associated website (www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.","[{'authorId': '2340548', 'name': 'A.

Design: Prospective observational study with follow up of 21 years and repeat screening of half the cohort 5 years from baseline. Measures included perceived psychological stress, coronary risk factors, self reported angina, and ischaemia detected by electrocardiography. Setting: 27 workplaces in Scotland. Participants: 5606 men (mean age 48 years) at first screening and 2623 men at second screening with complete data on all measures Main outcome measures: Prevalence of angina and ischaemia at baseline, odds ratio for incident angina and ischaemia at second screening, rate ratios for cause specific hospital admission, and hazard ratios for cause specific mortality. Results: Both prevalence and incidence of angina increased with increasing perceived stress (fully adjusted odds ratio for incident angina, high versus low stress 2.66, 95% confidence interval 1.61 to 4.41; P for trend <0.001). Prevalence and incidence of ischaemia showed weak trends in the opposite direction. High stress was associated with a higher rate of admissions to hospital generally and for admissions related to cardiovascular disease and psychiatric disorders (fully adjusted rate ratios for any general hospital admission 1.13, 1.01 to 1.27, cardiovascular disease 1.20, 1.00 to 1.45, and psychiatric disorders 2.34, 1.41 to 3.91). High stress was not associated with increased admission for coronary heart disease (1.00, 0.76-1.32) and showed an inverse relation with all cause mortality, mortality from cardiovascular disease, and mortality from coronary heart disease, that was attenuated by adjustment for occupational class (fully adjusted hazard ratio for all cause mortality 0.94, 0.81 to 1.11, cardiovascular mortality 0.91, 0.78 to 1.06, and mortality from coronary heart disease 0.98, 0.75 to 1.27). Conclusions: The relation between higher stress, angina, and some categories of hospital admissions probably resulted from the tendency of participants reporting higher stress to also report more symptoms. The lack of a corresponding relation with objective indices of heart disease suggests that these symptoms did not reflect physical disease. The data suggest that associations between psychosocial measures and disease outcomes reported from some other studies may be spurious. What is already known on this topic Higher psychological stress has predicted coronary heart disease in several observational studies Exposure to stress and heart disease outcomes were often based on self report so that a general tendency to negative perceptions may have generated a spurious association between higher perceived stress and heart disease symptoms What this study adds Perceived stress was strongly related to subjective symptoms of heart disease, including those leading to hospital admission However, stress showed a weakly inverse relation to all objective indices of heart disease: socially advantaged men perceived themselves to be most stressed, and the “protective” effect of stress was probably attributable to residual confounding Suggestions that psychological stress is an important determinant of heart disease may be premature","[{'authorId': '145727796', 'name': 'J.

Psychometric properties of UMACL scales were satisfactory. Discriminant validity was established by showing that correlations between UMACL scales and demographic and personality variables were small in magnitude, though of theoretical importance. Significant correlations between the arousal scales and psychophysiological measures of autonomic arousal demonstrate concurrent validity. A series of studies shows that the UMACL scales are sensitive to external ‘stressors’. Specific influences on each of the three principal scales have been found.

While there is evidence to suggest university students experience high rates of mental health disorders, less is known about the specific impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on student mental health and how they are coping with this stress. To address this gap, we conducted an online study among undergraduate students (n = 366) to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academics, social isolation, and mental health, as well as the extent to which they have been implementing a variety of coping strategies. The pandemic had a more pronounced negative effect on female students' academics, social isolation, stress and mental health compared to male counterparts. Moreover, for females, frequent use of social media as a coping mechanism was associated with greater perceived negative impacts on their academic performance and stress levels, compared to males. However, frequent social media use related to similar negative mental health effects for both males and females. While male and female students both reported using substances to cope, for males the use of cannabis was associated with greater negative impacts on academic outcomes, stress and mental health compared to females. These findings highlight the need for adequate student support services across the post-secondary sector, and point to the importance of gender informed interventions to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{'authorId': '14949589', 'name': 'R.

3bde2ac21e0ddaf485d184336980f134cba4506c,"The discrepancy between an individual's loneliness and the number of connections in a social network is well documented, yet little is known about the placement of loneliness within, or the spread of loneliness through, social networks. The authors use network linkage data from the population-based Framingham Heart Study to trace the topography of loneliness in people's social networks and the path through which loneliness spreads through these networks. Results indicated that loneliness occurs in clusters, extends up to 3 degrees of separation, is disproportionately represented at the periphery of social networks, and spreads through a contagious process. The spread of loneliness was found to be stronger than the spread of perceived social connections, stronger for friends than family members, and stronger for women than for men. The results advance understanding of the broad social forces that drive loneliness and suggest that efforts to reduce loneliness in society may benefit by aggressively targeting the people in the periphery to help repair their social networks and to create a protective barrier against loneliness that can keep the whole network from unraveling.

Somatotopy in SII seems to be less fine-grained than in primary somatosensory cortex (SI), as, in contrast to SI, no separate representations of the two fingers in SII were observed. A similar somatotopic representation pattern between fingers and the hallux was also observed within ipsilateral SII, indicating somatotopy of contra- as well as ipsilateral SII using unilateral stimulation.

Academic pressure is reported as a major trigger. Mindfulness training has been shown to reduce stress and is popular among students, but its effectiveness in this context needs to be ascertained. In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we hypothesise that the provision of a preventative mindfulness intervention in universities could reduce students' psychological distress during the examination period (primary outcome), improve their resilience to stress up to at least 1 year later, reduce their use of mental health support services and improve academic performance. Methods and analysis At least 550 University of Cambridge students free from active crises or severe mental illness will be randomised to joining an 8-week mindfulness course or to mental health provision as usual (one-to-one allocation rate). Psychological distress will be measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure at baseline, postintervention, examination term and 1-year follow-up. Other outcomes are use of mental health services, inability to sit examinations or special circumstance requests, examination grades, well-being, altruism and coping measured with ecological momentary assessment. Outcome assessment and intention-to-treat primary analysis using linear mixed models adjusted for baseline scores will be blind to intervention allocation. We will also conduct per-protocol, subgroup and secondary outcome analyses. An Independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee will be set up. We will systematically monitor for, and react to, possible adverse events. An advisory reference group will comprise student representatives, members of the University Counselling Service and other student welfare staff. Ethics and dissemination Approval has been obtained from Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee (PRE.2015.060). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals. A lay summary will be disseminated to a wider audience including other universities. Trial registration number ACTRN12615001160527; pre-results.","[{'authorId': '47470081', 'name': 'J.

This study explored the relations between specific types of social support (peer support and teacher support) and depression. Adolescents (ages 11 to 17) for the first time (N = 2453) participated in a two-wave, 6-month longitudinal study. Structural equation modeling was used to test a social causation model (deficits in social support increase the likelihood of depression), interpersonal theories of depression (depression leads to social erosion), and a reciprocal influence model. Depression influenced peer support significantly and negatively. By contrast, the social causation model was not supported. These results held for males and females. Findings suggested that depression resulted in social support erosion.

3cedc034b84c957c9afffef573560ce02a5374cb,"In this meta-analytic and narrative review, we examine several overarching issues related to the study of coping, emotion regulation, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence, including the conceptualization and measurement of these constructs. We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine 3 potential moderators: age, measure quality, and single versus multiple informants. Finally, we separately consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Finally, we offer a critique of the current state of the field and outline an agenda for future research.","[{'authorId': '6442334', 'name': 'B. Compas'}, {'authorId': '5286318', 'name': 'S.

Although the underpinning mechanisms linking EI with those outcomes are largely unknown, it has been suggested that EI may work as a “stress buffer.” Theoretically, when faced with a stressful situation, emotionally intelligent individuals should show a more adaptive response than those with low EI, such as reduced reactivity (less mood deterioration, less physiological arousal), and faster recovery once the threat has passed. A growing number of studies have begun to investigate that hypothesis in respect to EI measured as both an ability (AEI) and trait (TEI), but results are unclear. To test the “stress-buffering” function of EI, we systematically reviewed experimental studies that explored the relationship between both types of EI and acute stress reactivity or recovery. By searching four databases, we identified 45 eligible studies. Results indicated that EI was only adaptive in certain contexts, and that findings differed according to stressor type, and how EI was measured. In terms of stress reactivity, TEI related to less mood deterioration during sports-based stressors (e.g., competitions), physical discomfort (e.g., dental procedure), and cognitive stressors (e.g., memory tasks), but did not appear as helpful in other contexts (e.g., public speaking). Furthermore, effects of TEI on physiological stress responses, such as heart rate, were inconsistent. Effects of AEI on subjective and objective stress reactivity were often non-significant, with high levels detrimental in some cases. However, data suggest that both higher AEI and TEI relate to faster recovery from acute stress. In conclusion, results provide mixed support for the stress-buffering effect of EI. Limitations and quality of studies are also discussed. Findings could have implications for EI training programmes.","[{'authorId': '144260202', 'name': 'Rosanna G.

The following manual is provided to the field as operational support in service of successful and sustainable Co-located, Collaborative Care (CCC) Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI). Truly integrated healthcare involves a radical shift in conceptualizing care and challenges providers to function in ways that often contrast sharply with how they were trained to work. In addition to training staff to function in new ways, shaped by a population-based approach, the transformation of care must be supported by infrastructure to be sustained. Dozens of staff have attended recent national trainings in PC-MHI, and many have been clamoring for systematic guidance for "" how-to "" develop a viable integration system. While this relatively new care structure is evolving rapidly and often uniquely across the national system, the collective wisdom of the pioneers in this transformation has been gathered together here. Hopefully, the manual will highlight helpful structures and best practices for success, alert staff to common pitfalls, and save many the time otherwise spend to "" re-invent the wheel "". As defined and required by the Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook (VHA Handbook 1160.01), there are two main categories of PC-MHI services; CCC and Care Management (CM).

After correction of the sections for deformations due to histological processing, the 3-D reconstructed histological volumes of the individual brains and the volume representations of the cytoarchitectonic areas were adapted to the reference brain of a computerized atlas. Corresponding areas were superimposed in the 3-D space of the reference brain. These population maps describe, for each voxel, how many brains have a representation of one particular cytoarchitectonic area. Each area's extent is very variable across different brains, but representations of areas 3a, 3b, and 1 in >/=50% of the brains were found in the fundus of the central sulcus, its caudal bank, and on the crown of the postcentral gyrus, respectively.

Consistent with the belongingness hypothesis, people form social attachments readily under most conditions and resist the dissolution of existing bonds. Belongingness appears to have multiple and strong effects on emotional patterns and on cognitive processes. Lack of attachments is linked to a variety of ill effects on health, adjustment, and well-being. Other evidence, such as that concerning satiation, substitution, and behavioral consequences, is likewise consistent with the hypothesized motivation. Several seeming counterexamples turned out not to disconfirm the hypothesis.

Many aspects can make any particular interoceptive sensation unique and distinct from any other interoceptive sensation. This can range from the sense of agency, to the physical cause of a sensation, the ontogenetic origin, the efferent innervation, and afferent pathways of the tissue involved amongst others. In its overarching meaning, interoception primarily is a product of the central nervous system, a construct based on an integration of various sources, not per se including afferent information.

A 90-min observational assessment at age 3 was used to categorize children into five temperament groups, including one primarily characterized by behavioral and emotional undercontrol. The children with undercontrolled temperament at 3 years of age were more than twice as likely to evidence disordered gambling at ages 21 and 32 than were children who were well-adjusted at age 3. These associations could not be explained by differences in childhood IQ or family socioeconomic status. Cleanly demonstrating the temporal relation between behavioral undercontrol and adult disordered gambling is an important step toward building more developmentally sensitive theories of disordered gambling and may put researchers in a better position to begin considering potential routes to disordered-gambling prevention through enhancing self-control and emotional regulation.","[{'authorId': '4122982', 'name': 'W.

Final assessment of mental development was made on children who were more than 3 years old and was based on the occurrence of behavioral disturbances, learning disability, and school difficulties, and on intellectual efficiency. Children were graded into three groups: no abnormality, mild abnormalities but with normal social function, and grossly abnormal. Preoperative computed tomography scans were used to measure the severity of the frontal stenosis and to identify associated intracranial abnormalities, such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, dilatation of the subdural spaces, or hydrocephalus. Associated extracranial malformations and associated family cases were also noted. Lastly, the family setting was studied. Overall, 31.6 percent of patients had evidence of some degree of trouble. Several correlations were identified: mental development was worse when the frontal stenosis was severe, when cranial reconstruction was performed after 1 year of age, and when there were associated extracranial malformations. In addition, the family environment was found to have a major influence, but the presence of intracranial abnormalities did not correlate with mental development. (Plast. Reconstr.

Occupational stress is a common, serious and costly health problem in work environment. Nursing is a very stressful job high level of stress in this job affects nurses' physical and mental health.


AIM
To investigate the effect of emotion regulation training of occupational stress on critical care nurses in two teaching hospitals in Sanandaj, Iran.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This interventional study was conducted on 60 nurses working in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Critical Care Unit (CCU) in two teaching hospitals in Sanandaj, Iran. Data were collected using Expanded Nursing Stress Scale (ENSS) questionnaire. The questionnaire in both intervention and control groups before and after the training sessions of emotion regulation training were completed. Data were analysed using SPSS Version 20. Statistical indices such as frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation and also t-test, Chi-square test and paired t-test were used.


RESULTS
Mean occupation stress score in the intervention group before emotion regulation training was 136.6±24.6 and after training was 113.02±16.2 (p = 0.001). Occupational stress dimensions including; conflict with physicians, problems with peers, workload, uncertainty concerning treatment and problems related to patients and their families in the intervention group compared with the control group was statistically significant (p <0.05).


CONCLUSION
Emotion regulation training is effective in reducing occupation stress of critical care nurses.","[{'authorId': '13229486', 'name': 'Darya Saedpanah'}, {'authorId': '12340101', 'name': 'S.

We find that a variety of factors influence parental expectations, of which parents’ assessment of their children’s academic performance is the strongest. Factors known to impact upon actual higher education participation, such as parental education and remoteness, are already evident in parental expectations, but with limited evidence of expectations being shaped by financial constraints. We also find evidence of a ‘same gender’ effect, with mothers exhibiting higher expectations for higher education for their daughters. This may be in part due to significantly lower expectations held by fathers with sub-bachelor qualifications. These factors contribute to higher expectations overall for girls entering university. The research points to the importance of interventions commencing in early childhood, and accounting for key household background characteristics when designing, implementing and evaluating programmes for widening participation in higher education.","[{'authorId': '98125552', 'name': 'Paul Koshy'}, {'authorId': '9649312', 'name': 'A.

Parental psychopathological symptoms have been associated with a number of child psychological problems, yet little research has examined the role of parental emotion dysregulation on the intergenerational transmission of psychopathological symptoms. This study aims to examine the relationship between parents' and children's psychopathological symptoms with a focus on the mediating mechanism of parental emotion dysregulation on these relationships.


METHODS
Eighty-nine Chinese parents and their school-age children between the ages of 7 and 12 (49 males, M age = 8.79, SD = 1.81) participated in the study. In the initial phase of the study, parents filled out a series of questionnaires reporting their own psychopathological symptoms via SCL-90 and difficulties with emotion regulation via Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. After 9 months, the parents reported their children's internalizing and externalizing problems via Child Behavior Checklist, and the children self-reported anxiety symptoms via Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders in the second phase of the study.


RESULTS
The results showed that parental emotion dysregulation played an important role as a mediator of the relationship between parental psychopathological symptoms and child internalizing problems and separation anxiety, which indicates that parents' mental health problems were significantly associated with their difficulties with emotion regulation, which in turn led to more internalizing problems and separation anxiety in their children. However, we did not find a mediating effect of parental emotion dysregulation on the links between parent psychopathology and child externalizing problems or other types of self-reported anxiety symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings highlighted the importance of implementing more psycho-education programs that specifically target parents' emotion regulation abilities in both community and clinical settings to ameliorate the intergenerational transmission of psychopathological symptoms between generations.","[{'authorId': '49780579', 'name': 'Z.

The aims are as follows: to explore ER difficulties across ED types and a healthy control (HC) group (Study 1) and to assess pretreatment and post-treatment changes among ED types (Study 2). In Study 1, adult women with EDs (n = 438) and HC (n = 126) completed an assessment including Eating Disorders Inventory-2, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Patients in Study 2 (n = 69) were also reassessed after treatment. All ED types reported worse ER compared with HC (p < .001); also, ER differences were found between ED types. Prospective analyses show ER improvements after treatment (p < .001; |d| = 0.51), especially in patients with bulimia nervosa (p < .001; |d| = 1.03; Reliable Change Index = 9.79) with greater improvement in those with a better treatment outcome (p = .034). In conclusion, emotion dysregulation is a part of all forms of EDs. Furthermore, emotional dysregulation can be modified. ED treatments for anorexia nervosa and binge eating disorder might be enhanced by targeting ER skills.

Although it can approximate a complex many-to-one function well when a large amount of training data is provided, it is still challenging to model complex structured output representations that effectively perform probabilistic inference and make diverse predictions. In this work, we develop a deep conditional generative model for structured output prediction using Gaussian latent variables. The model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, and allows for fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference. In addition, we provide novel strategies to build robust structured prediction algorithms, such as input noise-injection and multi-scale prediction objective at training. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the deterministic deep neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic structured output predictions using stochastic inference.

3f30f7b9976f73f01f8dba90998aae0ac2adb11d,"In a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the early intervention program Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting adapted to Autism (VIPP-AUTI) with 78 primary caregivers and their child (16–61 months) with Autism Spectrum Disorder. VIPP-AUTI is a brief attachment-based intervention program, focusing on improving parent–child interaction and reducing the child’s individual Autism Spectrum Disorder–related symptomatology in five home visits. VIPP-AUTI, as compared with usual care, demonstrated efficacy in reducing parental intrusiveness. Moreover, parents who received VIPP-AUTI showed increased feelings of self-efficacy in child rearing. No significant group differences were found on other aspects of parent–child interaction or on child play behavior. At 3-months follow-up, intervention effects were found on child-initiated joint attention skills, not mediated by intervention effects on parenting. Implementation of VIPP-AUTI in clinical practice is facilitated by the use of a detailed manual and a relatively brief training of interveners.","[{'authorId': '152497899', 'name': 'I.

A randomized trial to compare two levels of an intervention (full versus brief) for use by primary health-care professionals with family members affected by the problematic drug or alcohol use of a close relative.


DESIGN
A prospective cluster randomized comparative trial of the two interventions.


SETTING
A total of 136 primary care practices in two study areas within the West Midlands and the South West regions of England.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 143 family members affected by the alcohol or drug problem of a relative were recruited into the study by primary health-care professionals. All recruited family members were seen on at least one occasion by the professional delivering the intervention and 129 (90 %) were followed-up at 12 weeks.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Two validated and standardized self-completion questionnaires measuring physical and psychological symptoms of stress (Symptom Rating Test) and behavioural coping (Coping Questionnaire) experienced by the family members. It was predicted that the full intervention would show increased reduction in both symptoms and coping when compared to the brief intervention.


RESULTS
The primary analysis adjusted for clustering, baseline symptoms and stratifying variables (location and professional group) showed that there were no significant differences between the two trial arms. The symptom score at follow-up was 0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.65, +4.06] higher in the full intervention arm than in the brief intervention arm, and the coping score at follow-up was 0.12 (95% CI: -5.12, +5.36) higher in the full intervention arm than in the brief intervention arm.


CONCLUSIONS
A well-constructed self-help manual delivered by a primary care professional may be as effective for family members as several face-to-face sessions with the professional.","[{'authorId': '3695895', 'name': 'A.

Youth received rejection and acceptance feedback from virtual peers. Findings revealed increased pupil dilation, an index of increased activity in cognitive and affective processing regions of the brain, to rejection compared to acceptance trials, which was greater for older youth. Data from a cell-phone Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) protocol completed following the task indicated that increased pupillary reactivity to rejection trials was associated with lower feelings of social connectedness with peers in daily life. Eyetracking analyses revealed attentional biases toward acceptance feedback and away from rejection feedback. Biases toward acceptance feedback were stronger for older youth. Avoidance of rejection feedback was strongest among youth with increased pupillary reactivity to rejection, even in the seconds leading up to and following rejection feedback. These findings suggest that adolescents are sensitive to rejection feedback and seek to anticipate and avoid attending to rejection stimuli. Furthermore, the salience of social rejection and acceptance feedback appears to increase during adolescence.","[{'authorId': '3234399', 'name': 'J. Silk'}, {'authorId': '4588779', 'name': 'L.

This study investigated the effects of yoga as a sensory regulation tool in reducing adolescent distress in an acute care psychiatric hospital.


METHODS
This was a descriptive, correlational pre-intervention/post-intervention design conducted in a mental health hospital over 5 months from mid-January to mid-June 2012. The population consisted of a convenience sample of 75 adolescent mental health unit inpatients and partial-hospitalization patients 12-18 years of age who participated in two or more yoga sessions. Patient charts provided Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV Axes I-V diagnosis, gender, and age. Dependent variables were pulse and Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale scores, which were recorded before and after each yoga class. The Adult/Adolescent Sensory Profile provided a measure of patient sensory-processing preference levels that were related to the pulse and Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale results.


FINDINGS
Yoga sessions significantly improved patient pulse and self-reported distress ratings regardless of gender or sensory profile levels.


CONCLUSIONS
This article contributes to research on the therapeutic effects of yoga as a sensory regulation intervention in the treatment of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. Yoga has the potential to help adolescents in an acute care psychiatric hospital learn to soothe themselves, to regulate their emotions, and to find relief from emotional distress while hospitalized.","[{'authorId': '1401875571', 'name': 'Pamela Re'}, {'authorId': '88140691', 'name': 'J.

A significant body of research has demonstrated an association between mental health and both individual and interpersonal emotion regulation. Yet, this association has not been studied during the perinatal period. The aim of this study was to explore the association between emotion regulation, maternal mental health, and interpersonal emotion regulation during the transition to motherhood in a sample of Chilean women. Methods Women in their third trimester of pregnancy (n = 253) provided self-reports of emotion regulation and symptoms of depression and anxiety during pregnancy and three months postpartum. Additional self-reports of interpersonal emotion regulation were obtained from individuals who were identified as social support persons by these women. Results: Maternal emotion regulation contributed to maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety during pregnancy and after childbirth. The association between emotion regulation and maternal mental health was moderated by specific interpersonal emotion regulation strategies reported by the participant’s social support persons. Strategies including modulating the emotional response, situation modification, attentional deployment and cognitive change, modified the association between poor regulation strategies and anxiety symptoms. Also, an infrequent use of these interpersonal emotion regulation strategies strengthened the association between these maternal emotional regulation difficulties and anxiety symptoms. Conclusion Our findings suggest that interpersonal emotional regulation strategies impact the association of maternal emotional regulation strategies and maternal emotional wellbeing.","[{'authorId': '48011382', 'name': 'Soledad Coo'}, {'authorId': '151487959', 'name': 'María I García'}, {'authorId': '114353995', 'name': 'Fernanda Prieto'}, {'authorId': '2052785967', 'name': 'Franco Medina'}]",9.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology', 'pages': '3 - 21', 'volume': '40'}",47.0,The role of interpersonal emotional regulation on maternal mental health,2020.0

An essential theoretical question is how people identify humanlike but clearly artificial, hence humanoid, entities in comparison to natural human ones. This identity categorization inquiry was approached under the framework of consistency and tested through examining inconsistency effects from mismatching categories. Study 1 (N = 80), incorporating a self-disclosure task, tested participants’ responses to a talking-face agent, which varied in four combinations of human versus humanoid faces and voices. In line with the literature on inconsistency, the pairing of a human face with a humanoid voice or a humanoid face with a human voice led to longer processing time in making judgment of the agent and less trust than the pairing of a face and a voice from either the human or the humanoid category. Female users particularly showed negative attitudes toward inconsistently paired talking faces. Study 2 (N = 80), using a task that stressed comprehension demand, replicated the inconsistency effects on judging time and females’ negative attitudes but not for comprehension-related outcomes. Voice clarity overshadowed the consistency concern for comprehension-related responses. The overall inconsistency effects suggest that people treat humanoid entities in a different category from natural human ones.","[{'authorId': '2056813456', 'name': 'Li Gong'}, {'authorId': '2029850', 'name': 'C.

We examined the role of grandparent–grandchild communication (in terms of self-disclosure) and its relations to anxiety and empathy in improving intergenerational attitudes. Analyses revealed that: (1) quantity and quality of contact with older people (other than grandparents) predict higher levels of self-disclosure (to one's grandparent); (2) quantity (but not quality) of contact with older people is associated with more favorable implicit associations with them, while quality of contact is associated with more favorable explicit attitudes; and (3) higher levels of self-disclosure to grandparents are associated with empathy and reduced anxiety, which in turn are associated with more positive explicit attitudes toward older adults. We explain our findings in light of the environmental associations model (Karpinsky & Hilton, 2001)—that quantity of contact, or mere exposure to older people, drives the Implicit Association Test effect. The model sheds light on the mediational roles of interpersonal variables (self-disclosure, anxiety, and empathy with a grandparent) in intergenerational contact.","[{'authorId': '6156382', 'name': 'T.

Alterations of DNA methylation at the promoter region of the SLC6A4 have been associated with early adverse experiences in infants. The main aim of the present work was to investigate the association between level of exposure to pain-related stress during hospitalization and changes in SLC6A4 DNA methylation at NICU discharge in VPT infants. In order to exclude the potential effect of birth status (i.e., preterm vs. full-term birth) on SLC6A4 methylation, we preliminarily assessed SLC6A4 epigenetic differences between VPT and full-term (FT) infants at birth. Fifty-six VPT and thirty-two FT infants participated in the study. The level of exposure to pain-related stress was quantified on the basis of the amount of skin-breaking procedures to which they were exposed. VPT infants were divided in two sub-groups: low-pain exposure (LPE, N = 25) and high-pain exposure (HPE, N = 31). DNA methylation was evaluated at birth for both VPT and FT infants, assessing 20 CpG sites within the SLC6A4 promoter region. The same CpG sites were re-evaluated for variations in DNA methylation at NICU discharge in LPE and HPE VPT infants. No differences in SLC6A4 CpG sites' methylation emerged between FT and VPT infants at birth. Methylation at CpG sites 5 and 6 significantly increased from birth to NICU discharge only for HPE VPT infants. Findings show that preterm birth per se is not associated with epigenetic alterations of the SLC6A4, whereas higher levels of pain-related stress exposure during NICU stay might alter the transcriptional functionality of the serotonin transporter gene.","[{'authorId': '4040954', 'name': 'L.

In its initial validation study and subsequent analyses, the instrument was shown to possess sound psychometric properties, but, to date, inquiry regarding the measure's characteristics has been limited. Factor analytic examinations of commonly used instruments are recommended to validate the properties of a given measure and increase researchers understanding of the measured constructs. The current study examined the psychometric properties of the ERQ in a sample of 1,188 undergraduates through confirmatory factor analysis.

However, scant attention has been paid to the developmental course of self-initiated regulation of behavior. This article summarizes the literature devoted to early forms of control and highlights the different philosophical orientations in the literature. Then, focusing on the period from early infancy to the beginning of the preschool years, the author proposes an ontogenetic perspective tracing the kinds of modulation or control the child is capable of along the way. The developmental sequence of monitoring behaviors that is proposed calls attention to contributions made by the growth of cognitive skills. The role of mediators (e.g., caregivers) is also discussed. During the second year of life, children increasingly demonstrate signs of selfhood and autonomy. This growing sense of identity, coupled with the ability to recall the dictates of caregivers, leads to a new dimension in behavior. Children begin to appraise the requirements of social and nonsocial situations and to monitor their own behavior accordingly. Slowly and precariously they move toward self-regulation, an achievement that Flavell (1977) descibes as being ""one of the really central and significant cognitive-developmental hallmarks of the early childhood period"" (p. 64).","[{'authorId': '82348618', 'name': 'C.

We know that maternal depressive symptoms predict lowered and heightened mother-infant gaze synchrony, but it is unclear whether maternal emotion dysregulation is related to mother-infant gaze synchrony. This cross-sectional study examined whether maternal emotion dysregulation in mothers with mood disorders is significantly related to mother-infant gaze synchrony. We also tested whether maternal emotion dysregulation is relatively more important than maternal depressive symptoms in predicting mother-infant gaze synchrony, and whether maternal emotion dysregulation mediates the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and mother-infant gaze synchrony. We observed 68 mothers and their 4- to 9-month-old infants in the Still-Face paradigm during two play interactions, before and after social stress was induced. The mothers’ and infants’ gaze behaviors were coded using microanalysis with the Maternal Regulatory Scoring System and Infant Regulatory Scoring System, respectively. The degree of mother-infant gaze synchrony was computed using time-series analysis. Maternal emotion dysregulation was measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory. Greater maternal emotion dysregulation was significantly related to heightened mother-infant gaze synchrony. The overall effect of maternal emotion dysregulation on mother-infant gaze synchrony was relatively more important than the effect of maternal depressive symptoms in the five tested models. Maternal emotion dysregulation fully mediated the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and mother-infant gaze synchrony.

No association was found between ERP data and voice acoustic properties. These ﬁndings demonstrated an earlier and later attentional bias to self-generated relative to non-self voice stimuli. They suggest that one’s own voice representation may have a greater affective salience than an unfamiliar voice, conﬁrming the modulatory role of salience on P3.","[{'authorId': '2088070170', 'name': 'Sarah Mae Sincero'}]",431.0,,433.0,Biological Psychology,2019.0

The rationale of this model was grounded in motivational and identity theories related to self-regulation, self-efficacy, and goal setting. We posed three questions to 342 participants enrolled in graduate courses in educational psychology. These questions formed part of an interview process used as a dialogic retrospection to elicit teachers' voices. The results were summarized in meaningful written narratives, which were analyzed for generative themes. The researchers identified several themes that related to findings from the literature, confirming that (a) teacher identity is a complex construct, related to teachers' experiences of success and frustration, age, and cultural context; (b) the dialogic retrospection served as a mediator to clarify what influenced their teacher identity, and (c) the self-regulated inquiry model helped teachers to assess the development of their professional growth from a motivational perspective.

One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing MCAR, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for MCAR that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests th...","[{'authorId': '145382036', 'name': 'R.

We analyze when countries were confronted with the virus, how long it took until the number of new infections peaked and at what level of infections that peak was achieved via social distancing and lockdown policies. Most European countries were able to successfully end the first wave of the pandemic – defined as a two-week incidence rate smaller than 10 cases per 100,000 people. We find that countries in which the virus made significant landfall later in time enjoyed a latecomer advantage that some of these countries squandered, however, by not responding quickly enough and that an early lockdown was more effective than a hard lockdown.","[{'authorId': '3336956', 'name': 'Thomas Plümper'}, {'authorId': '47106620', 'name': 'E.

This study examined whether emotional processing (understanding emotions), self-control (regulation of thoughts, emotions, and behavior), and their interaction predicted HbA1c for adolescents with type 1 diabetes over and above diabetes-specific constructs.


METHODS
Self-report measures of self-control, emotional processing, self-efficacy for diabetes management, diabetes-specific negative affect, and adherence, and HbA1c from medical records were obtained from 137 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (M age = 13.48 years).


RESULTS
Emotional processing interacted with self-control to predict HbA1c, such that when adolescents had both low emotional processing and low self-control, HbA1c was poorest. Also, both high emotional processing and self-control buffered negative effects of low capacity in the other in relation to HbA1c. The interaction of emotional processing × self-control predicted HbA1c over diabetes-specific self-efficacy, negative affect, and adherence.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest the importance of emotional processing and self-control for health outcomes in adolescents with diabetes.","[{'authorId': '49466853', 'name': 'A.

42ad9e15abf9dc3d28fbffc7282e6b3a7ec02e10,"Since the identification of the post-fall syndrome1 and use of the term “ptophobia” (the phobic reaction to standing or walking)2 in the early 1980s, fear of falling (FOF) has gained recognition as a health problem of older adults. In an attempt to measure this entity, various definitions have evolved. Tinetti and Powell3 described FOF as an ongoing concern about falling that ultimately limits the performance of daily activities. Other authors4,5 have referred to FOF as a patient's loss of confidence in his or her balance abilities. Still other authors6 defined FOF as a general concept that described low fall-related efficacy (low confidence at avoiding falls) and being afraid of falling. Subjects in one study7 indicated they did not describe themselves as being “afraid of falling,” but rather were “worried” about falling.

In the early phase of research, FOF was largely believed to be a consequence of falling. Researchers discussed FOF as resulting from the psychological trauma of the fall, leading to reduced activity and subsequent losses in physical capabilities.2,8–10 Recent research, however, has revealed FOF in those who have not fallen4,11,12 and, furthermore, has uncovered a relationship to physical, psychological, and functional changes in older adults.6 Ongoing studies are focusing on the causes of FOF, dispelling misconceptions (eg, FOF being a result of the normal aging process), and identifying the interventions that address FOF most effectively. The researchers, however, agree that FOF is multifactorial in etiology,12,13 and they suggest that FOF may be a more pervasive and serious problem than falls in older adults6,13 and thus deserves attention.

The purpose of this update is to increase the reader's awareness of the current findings about FOF, …","[{'authorId': '5406935', 'name': 'Kristine Legters'}]",336.0,,35.0,Fear of falling.,2002.0

However, it also raises serious conceptual and methodological reservations. Evidence suggests an association of trait PA and lower morbidity and of state and trait PA and decreased symptoms and pain. Trait PA is also associated with increased longevity among older community-dwelling individuals. The literature on PA and surviving serious illness is inconsistent. Experimentally inducing intense bouts of activated state PA triggers short-term rises in physiological arousal and associated (potentially harmful) effects on immune, cardiovascular, and pulmonary function. However, arousing effects of state PA are not generally found in naturalistic ambulatory studies in which bouts of PA are typically less intense and often associated with health protective responses.

This study aims to assess multimorbidity and the associated risk factors in Iran. We used data from 50,045 participants (age 40–75 y) in the Golestan Cohort Study, including data on demographics, lifestyle habits, socioeconomic status, and anthropometric indices. Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of 2 or more out of 8 self-reported chronic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, , Paolo Boffetta, M djadi, MD, kzadeh, MD Multimorbidity prevalence was 19.4%, with the most common chronic diseases being gastroesophageal reflux disease (76.7%), cardiovascular diseases (72.7%), diabetes (25.3%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (21.9%). The odds of multimorbidity was 2.56-fold higher at the age of >60 years compared with that at <50 years (P< 0.001), and 2.11-fold higher in women than in men (P< 0.001). Other factors associated with higher risk of multimorbidity included non-Turkmen ethnicity, low education, unemployment, low socioeconomic status, physical inactivity, overweight, obesity, former smoking, opium and alcohol use, and poor oral health. Apart from advanced age and female sex, the most important potentially modifiable lifestyle factors, including excess body weight and opium use, and opium user, are associated with multimorbidity. Policies aiming at controlling multimorbidity will require a multidimensional approach to reduce modifiable risk factors in the younger population in developing countries alongside adopting efficient strategies to improve life quality in the older population.

INTRODUCTION I n most countries throughout the world, particularly in the developing countries, the proportion of the older people in the overall population is growing rapidly. This is a result of advances in medical science, technology, and health policy, resulting in a longer life expectancy and a decline in fertility rates. The senior population is expected to increase 3-fold in the next few decades in Iran. On the basis of estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO), by 2050, Iran, as a developing country, will have a greater proportion of older individuals (8.4%–29.4%) than the United States (20.1%–27%). In Iran, the aging population may be regarded as an indicator of successful population, and public health policies and socioeconomic development. The advances in health status of the Iranian population have transformed the most common diseases, from fatal acute diseases into survivable chronic g of the population will increase the onic conditions, causing people to suffer efined as the simultaneous occurrence of www.md-journal.com | 1 2 or more chronic health disorders in the same person at one point in time. A systematic review of 21 studies showed that the estimated prevalence of multimorbidity varies widely in developed countries; it has been estimated that 1 in 4 adults in the developed countries experiences multimorbidity, and 50% of the older people have 2 or more chronic diseases. Data on multimorbidity from low and middle-income countries are sparse, and information about the health of older individuals in these regions is greatly needed. Studies predict that in 2050, 21.1% of world residents will be over 60 years old, and 80% of this group will live in low and middle-income countries. Multimorbidity is associated with higher mortality risk, functional disabilities, deterioration of quality of life, greater use of multiple medications with associated adverse effects, more frequent and longer hospitalization, and higher healthcare utilization and expenses. Because of the increasing importance of multimorbidity, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Golestan Cohort Study (GCS)—a largescale study in a high incidence area of esophageal cancer in northern Iran—to identify the prevalence and risk factors of multimorbidity in Iran as a middle-income country that may differ from those observed in developed countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Population and Measurements The study was carried out as a cross-sectional analysis of baseline information from the GCS. Details of the cohort enrollment are described elsewhere. Baseline data were collected during 2004 to 2008, and total enrollment included 50,045 adults aged 40 to 75 years residing in the Golestan Province, in northern Iran. Of the total participants, 49,946 (99.8%) were of Turkmen, Persian, Turkish, Sistani, Baluch, or Kurdish ethnicities; the other 99 enrollees were foreign nationals, who were excluded from this study. Trained physician and nonphysician interviewers administered different parts of a lifestyle questionnaire to each participant in face-to-face interviews to collect information on age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, years of education, employment status, ownership of several appliances, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), smoking, opium and hookah (water pipe) use, alcohol consumption, and Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth (DMFT) index. For each interviewee, a short physical examination was performed, and blood pressure, height, and weight were measured by trained general physicians. In this mainly rural population, most of the physical activities performed by the participants were related to their jobs. Therefore, the physical activity was defined based on occupational activity, and coded as yes (heavy and intense activity) or no (all other participants). BMI was calculated using the WHO-recommended classification: underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m), normal (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m), overweight (BMI 25–29.9 kg/m), and obese (BMI >30 kg/m). In this study, age at the time of interview was clustered as 49, 50 to 60, and >61 years. On the basis of the 2-step cluster analysis with the use of similarities of family asset, ethnicity, sex, employment status, age at starting the first job, size (surface area) and the status of house, age, and the status of house, we categorized the socioeconomic status (SES) of participants as low, middle, and high. Multimorbidity in this study refers to the presence of 2 or Ahmadi et al more chronic diseases. Similar to several comparable studies, the ascertainment of diseases was based on selfreports. The morbidities included cardiovascular diseases 2 | www.md-journal.com (CVDs), including hypertension, coronary heart disease and stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), liver disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), tuberculosis, and cancers. We chose these diseases because they are frequently observed and have a major impact on health status, quality of life, and mortality in this population. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Digestive Diseases Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (OHRP-IRB-00001641). All participants signed an informed consent during original cohort study allowing investigators to use their anonymized data for further analysis. Statistical Analysis We estimated the age and sex-standardized proportion of multimorbidity among participants by several sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. To evaluate the differences in distribution of multimorbidity by continuous or categorical factors, we used t tests, Mann–Whitney or chi-square tests, whenever appropriate. To examine the simultaneous effects of different factors and to calculate adjusted prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), we used multivariate logistic regression models; cluster effects were evaluated using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) method. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 21.0, IBM Co. Chicago, IL). Two-sided P values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS The study evaluated 49,946 individuals enrolled in the GCS. The mean age of participants was 52.1 9 years, and the majority were women (57.6%), rural residents (76.8%), and of Turkmen ethnicity (74.6%). BMI was 25 kg/m or higher in 59.4% of the individuals, and 17% had used opium (Table 1). In this study, the age and sex-standardized prevalence of multimorbidity was 19.4% (95% CI 19.1%–19.8%). The most common chronic diseases reported by those with multimorbidity were GERD (76.7%), CVD (72.7%), diabetes mellitus (25.3%), and COPD (21.9%). In multivariate models, older people, women, non-Turkmens, unemployed people, opium users, alcohol users, and those with low education, low physical activity, low SES, high BMI, and high DMFT (an indicator of poorer oral hygiene) were at a higher risk of multimorbidity (all P< 0.05) (Table 2). Table 3 represent the prevalence of comorbidity in cases With multimorbidity. On the basis of these results, the most prevalent co-morbidity happened for CVDs and GERD (52%). The comorbidity of CVDs and diabetes was 18%. Figure 1 shows the prevalence of multimorbidity by age and sex. In both sexes, multimorbidity increased with advancing age. In all age groups, the proportion of those with multimorbidity was higher in women than in men, and this difference increased with age. The multivariate logistic regression models also showed that older age groups and women were at a higher risk of multimorbidity.

Such impairments are not adequately measured in most clinical pain management settings yet could be a key influence on everyday functioning. We administered a well-validated, well-normed self-report measure to determine which aspects of executive functioning are compromised in the daily experience of patients with chronic pain, and whether these are associated with pain severity, medications, and mood. Materials and Methods:Sixty-three patients attending a multidisciplinary pain management clinic, and 66 pain-free age-matched and sex-matched controls, completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Adult version (BRIEF-A). The BRIEF-A measures 9 aspects of executive function: Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Self-Monitor, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, and Organization of Materials. Patients completed a battery of mood and pain-related measures. Results:Profile analysis revealed that patients with chronic pain reported significantly greater overall executive function impairments than controls. The patients showed greatest impairments on Working Memory and Emotional Control subscales, with more than half scoring in the clinically elevated range. A significant proportion of the variance in these scores was explained by total medication detriment (but not opioids alone), negative emotional states, and pain interference. Pain intensity and duration were not strong predictors of reported executive dysfunction. Discussion:Multiple factors impact on self-reported executive problems in this population. Specific deficits in Working Memory and Emotional Control have implications for patient engagement with treatment, and retention of information provided in therapy. A screening tool like the BRIEF-A may be useful in pain management settings.","[{'authorId': '81329759', 'name': 'Katharine S. Baker'}, {'authorId': '31675185', 'name': 'S.

To review the support for two hypotheses concerning the interrelationship between depression and diabetes and to identify areas in which more research is needed.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A review was conducted using primarily electronic databases. Articles relating to diabetes and depressive symptomatology, depressive disorder, and dysthymic disorder were selected. The study focuses mainly on adults with diabetes.


RESULTS
The initial onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) seems to be independent of the onset of type 2 diabetes, but results remain equivocal for type 1 diabetes. However, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, diabetes-related psychological and physiological processes may be involved in the higher recurrence and longer duration of MDD and depressive symptomatology


CONCLUSIONS
The hypotheses that the initial occurrence of clinically significant depression, MDD, results from either biochemical changes directly due to type 2 diabetes or its treatment or from the psychosocial demands imposed by the illness or its treatment do not seem to be supported. MDD in diabetic individuals represents a multidetermined phenomenon resulting from interactions between biologic and psychosocial factors. This interaction may increase the probability of developing type 2 diabetes in otherwise healthy individuals.","[{'authorId': '2103174194', 'name': 'R.

Thus, predicting and preventing this disorder are extremely important. The current study aimed to analyze the contribution of adolescents’ self-esteem (i.e., quality of interpersonal relationships, control of life events, and management of negative emotions) and interpersonal stressor sources (relationships with parents, teachers, classmates and friends) in predicting several depression manifestations (i.e., depressed mood, sense of inadequacy, and insecurity). Participants were 182 Italian pre-adolescents and adolescents, aged 10–14 years, were recruited from three Italian schools. They were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire. Results showed that self-esteem was a major factor to be considered in adolescents’ depression. In particular, adolescents’ perception of negative emotion management was the most important protective factor against depression manifestations. Conversely, sources of interpersonal stressors contributed only marginally to depression. Among these, problems with parents and friends increased adolescents’ depressed mood, while troubles with classmates impacted on their sense of inadequacy and insecurity. Implications of these results for positive practices which could enhance adolescents’ self-esteem and further expansions of the study are discussed.","[{'authorId': '6626619', 'name': 'C.

The sample was composed of 30 women, ages 34 to 80, 90% Caucasian, who had sustained a recurrence of breast cancer. Social support, coping, and adjustment were measured through telephone interviews on two occasions (T1 and T2) separated by 6 months. Emotional support from a partner and informational support from an oncologist were related to decreased physical problems over time, but were not related to psychological distress over time. Women's use of positive reinterpretation appeared to mediate these relations. Interestingly, psychological distress was related to decreased partner emotional support over time. These results suggest that it is not enough to consider how social support may influence women's adjustment; it is also important to consider how women's adjustment may shape their social support networks.","[{'authorId': '6884896', 'name': 'S.

The work also points to ways in which the family environment continues to modulate stress sensitivity over time, framing regulation as a dynamic interplay among early and later parental influences, and current conditions, rather than a static outcome.

Research purpose: The aim of this study was to determine how I/O psychologists experience the meaning of their work and to investigate the relationships between their experiences of work-role fit, meaning of work, psychological meaningfulness and work engagement, utilising the happiness framework proposed by Seligman (2002). Motivation for the study: I/O psychologists spend more than 88% of their working day with people, and they are primary role models for happiness in the workplace. Information about their work engagement and experiences of meaning is therefore needed. Research design, approach and method: A survey design was used. A convenience sample (n = 106) was taken of I/O psychologists in South Africa. A biographical questionnaire, the Work-Role Fit Scale, the Work-Life Questionnaire, the Psychological Meaningfulness Scale, the Work Engagement Scale and a survey measuring the actual and desired time spent on six broad categories of work were administered. Main findings: Work-role fit predicted psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. The calling orientation to work predicted both psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. Work-role fit mediated the relationship between the meaning of work and psychological meaningfulness. Work-role fit partially mediated the relationship between a calling orientation to work and work engagement. Practical implications: A calling orientation to work should be fostered in I/O psychologists because it contributes to experiences of work-role fit, psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. Contribution/value-add: The results of this study contribute to scientific knowledge about work-role fit, engagement and meaning as components of happiness of I/O psychologists.","[{'authorId': '115395616', 'name': 'L.

43e62bb74659f63886e1ec97c1739ec1c72f65d9,"OBJECTIVE
Cost-effectiveness analyses have reported that intensive glucose control is not cost-effective in older patients with new-onset diabetes. However, these analyses have had limited data on patient preferences concerning diabetic health states. We examined how the cost- effectiveness of intensive glucose control changes with the incorporation of patient preferences.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We collected health state preferences/utilities from 519 older diabetic patients. We incorporated these utilities into an established cost-effectiveness model of intensive glucose control and compared incremental cost-effectiveness analyses ratios (ICERs) (cost divided by quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) when using the original and patient-derived utilities for complications and treatments.


RESULTS
The mean utilities were approximately 0.40 for major complications, 0.76 (95% CI 0.74-0.78) for conventional glucose control, 0.77 (0.75-0.80) for intensive therapy with oral medications, and 0.64 (0.61-0.67) for intensive therapy with insulin. Incorporating our patient-derived complication utilities alone improved ICERs for intensive glucose control (e.g., patients aged 60-65 years at diagnosis, 136,000 dollars/QALY-->78,000 dollars/QALY), but intensive therapy was still not cost-effective at older ages. When patient-derived treatment utilities were also incorporated, the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment depended on the method of glucose control. Intensive control with insulin generated fewer QALYs than conventional control. However, intensive control with oral medications was beneficial on average at all ages and had an ICER < or =100,000 dollars to age 70.


CONCLUSIONS
The cost-effectiveness of intensive glucose control in older patients with new-onset diabetes is highly sensitive to assumptions regarding quality of life with treatments. Cost-effectiveness analyses of diabetes care should consider the sensitivity of results to alternative utility assumptions.","[{'authorId': '46738508', 'name': 'E.

Methods: A literature search of PubMed and Web of Science was carried out to identify studies published between 2004 and 2014 on the impact of sociodemographic and economic individual or contextual factors on psychiatric symptoms, mental disorders or suicide. The results and methodological factors were extracted from each study. Results Seventy-eight studies assessed associations between individual-level factors and mental health. The main individual factors shown to have a statistically significant independent association with worse mental health were low income, not living with a partner, lack of social support, female gender, low level of education, low income, low socioeconomic status, unemployment, financial strain, and perceived discrimination. Sixty-nine studies reported associations between area-level factors and mental health, namely neighbourhood socioeconomic conditions, social capital, geographical distribution and built environment, neighbourhood problems and ethnic composition. Conclusions Most of the 150 studies included reported associations between at least one sociodemographic or economic characteristic and mental health outcomes. There was large variability between studies concerning methodology, study populations, variables, and mental illness outcomes, making it difficult to draw more than some general qualitative conclusions. This review highlights the importance of social factors in the initiation and maintenance of mental illness and the need for political action and effective interventions to improve the conditions of everyday life in order to improve population's mental health.","[{'authorId': '1390676028', 'name': 'Manuela Silva'}, {'authorId': '37041822', 'name': 'A.

The purpose of this study is to investigates the burnout of special school teachers and to analyze related factors. Crosssectional studies were conducted on 90 teachers in the city of Samarinda. Determining sample size using Slovin’s formula, data were assessed using the Maslach burnout inventory, a depression anxiety stress scale, and the Tennessee self-concept scale. Data analysis used chi-square and Pearson correlation. All of the teachers had experienced burnout (26.7% low level and 73.3% medium level). Marital status (p=0.034), working experience (p=0.023), hours of teaching (p=0.044), self-concept (p=0.010) and job stress (p=0.004) correlated significantly with burnout. It was concluded that burnout amongst special school teachers requires immediate treatment. The school is advised to reduce the teacher's workload, make efforts to improve teacher self-concept and provide training for beginner teachers on educating students with special needs. For further research, it is advisable to further explore the factors causing job stress on the teacher so that the appropriate alternative can be found.","[{'authorId': '74558112', 'name': 'I. M.

Electro-physiological evidence points to concomitant involvement of prefrontal regions in automatic orienting to subliminal signals of fear, which may reflect innervation arising from brainstem arousal systems. To approximate blindsight in 22 healthy subjects, facial signals of fear were presented briefly (16.7 ms) and masked such that conscious detection was prevented. Results revealed that subliminal fear signals elicited activity in the brainstem region encompassing the superior colliculus and locus coeruleus, pulvinar and amygdala, and in fronto-temporal regions associated with orienting. These findings suggest that crude sensory input from the superior colliculo-pulvinar visual pathway to the amygdala may allow for sufficient appraisal of fear signals to innervate the locus coeruleus. The engagement of the locus coeruleus could explain the observation of diffuse fronto-temporal cortical activity, given its role in evoking collateral ascending noradrenergic efferents to the subcortical amygdala and prefrontal cortex. This network may represent an evolutionary adaptive neural dalarmT system for rapid alerting to sources of threat, without the need for conscious appraisal.","[{'authorId': '2742204', 'name': 'B.

Findings indicated that sexually maltreated girls, in comparison to their nonmaltreated peers, demonstrate lower emotional understanding and decreased ability to regulate their emotions in accordance with cultural expectations. Further, maltreated girls expected less emotional support and more relational conflict from parents in response to sadness displays and from parents and peers in response to anger displays.

The acceptable relative fit of the hierarchical model confirms the notion that EI is a group factor of cognitive ability, marking the expression of intelligence in the emotion domain.

For this reason anxiety disorders often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in geriatric patients, especially when the clinical presentation of these disorders in older patients differs from that seen in younger adults. In older persons, anxiety symptoms often overlap with medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and geriatric patients tend to express anxiety symptoms as medical or somatic problems such as pain rather than as psychological distress. 1 As a result, older adults often seek treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms from their primary care physician instead of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, primary care physicians often miss psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, in geriatric patients. Anxiety may be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disturbance, secondary to a general medical condition, or induced by dietary substances, substances of abuse, or medications. Late-life anxiety often is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Box, page 66) and other psychological stressors as older adults recognize declining cognitive and physical functioning. (2) BOX Comorbid anxiety and depression: Highly prevalent, poorer outcomes The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam study--one of the largest epidemiologic studies to examine comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression in patients age 55 to 85--found that 48% of older persons with primary major depressive disorder (MDD) also had a comorbid anxiety disorder, whereas approximately one-fourth of those with anxiety disorders also had MDD. (a) Pre-existing anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder, increase the risk of developing depression."" Rates of comorbid anxiety and depression increase with age. (c) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Late-life MDD comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder is associated with greater memory decline than MDD alone. (d) In addition, comorbid anxiety and depression is associated with greater symptom severity and persistence, greater functional impairment, substance dependence, poorer compliance and response to treatment, worse overall prognosis and outcome than patients with either disorder alone, (e) and greater likelihood of suicidal ideation in older men. (f) Source: For reference citations, see this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com Anxiety disorders commonly begin in early adulthood, tend to be chronic and interspersed with remissions and relapses, and usually continue into old age. (3) In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there is a bimodal distribution of onset; approximately two-thirds of patients experience onset between the late teens and late 20s and one-third develop the disorder for the first time after age 50. (3) Prevalence rates for anxiety disorders among older adults (age >55) range from 3.5% to 10.2%.(4) These rates are slightly lower than those for younger adults. (5) Among older adults, presence of a 12-month anxiety disorder was associated with female sex, lower education, being unmarried, and having [grater than or equal to]3 or more chronic conditions. (6) Anxiety and disability risk Anxiety disorders affect geriatric patients more profoundly than their younger counterparts. Persons age >65 who have an anxiety disorder are 3 to 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than younger individuals. (1) Anxiety is associated with high rates of medically unexplained symptoms, increased use of health care resources, chronic medical illness, low levels of physical health-related quality of life, and physical disability.

Structural equation modeling indicated that effortful control and executive functioning are strongly associated and overlapping constructs (Study 1). Additionally, results indicated that effortful control is related to the executive function of updating/monitoring information in working memory, but not inhibition (Studies 2 and 3). Study 3 also demonstrates that better updating/monitoring information in working memory and better effortful control were uniquely linked to lower dispositional negative affect, whereas the executive function of low/poor inhibition was uniquely associated with an increased tendency to express negative affect. Furthermore, dispositional negative affect mediated the links between effortful control and, separately, the executive function of updating/monitoring information in working memory and the tendency to express negative affect.

Evidence of gender differences and the impact of relevant covariates on these relations were examined. Missing data were imputed using a Multiple Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) approach.


SETTINGS
The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a large UK population-based birth cohort.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 4220 British boys and girls.


MEASUREMENTS
Depressive symptomatology was assessed in childhood (mean age = 10.6, SD = 0.2) using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ). Problematic alcohol use was assessed from several questions queried in adolescence (mean age = 13.8, SD = 0.2).


FINDINGS
Childhood depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of problematic alcohol use in early adolescence for girls [odds ratio (OR) = 1.14, P = 0.016] but not boys. This association for girls weakened (OR = 1.12, P = 0.058) when a priori selected covariates were taken into account, particularly the family and greater social environment.


CONCLUSIONS
Problematic alcohol use in girls (but not boys) is associated with prior depressive symptoms. This association may be attributable to several family and social environment factors, suggesting that a family interactional theoretical model may explain these findings.","[{'authorId': '2094346603', 'name': 'Luca Saraceno'}, {'authorId': '47951202', 'name': 'J.

4680b233cbaeda4704483fc44cbe3e45d43f2ec4,"IMPORTANCE
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) is thought to enhance cognitive reappraisal in patients with SAD. Such improvements should be evident in cognitive reappraisal-related prefrontal cortex responses.


OBJECTIVE
To determine whether CBT for SAD modifies cognitive reappraisal-related prefrontal cortex neural signal magnitude and timing when implementing cognitive reappraisal with negative self-beliefs. DESIGN Randomized clinical trial of CBT for SAD vs wait-list control group during a study that enrolled patients from 2007 to 2010.


SETTING
University psychology department.


PARTICIPANTS
Seventy-five patients with generalized SAD randomly assigned to CBT or wait list.


INTERVENTION
Sixteen sessions of individual CBT for SAD.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Negative emotion ratings and functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen-level dependent signal when reacting to and cognitively reappraising negative self-beliefs embedded in autobiographical social anxiety situations. RESULTS During reactivity trials, compared with wait list, CBT produced (1) greater reduction in negative emotion ratings and (2) greater blood oxygen-level dependent signal magnitude in the medial prefrontal cortex. During cognitive reappraisal trials, compared with wait list, CBT produced (3) greater reduction in negative emotion ratings, (4) greater blood oxygen level-dependent signal magnitude in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, (5) earlier temporal onset of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activity, and (6) greater dorsomedial prefrontal cortex-amygdala inverse functional connectivity.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
Modulation of cognitive reappraisal-related brain responses, timing, and functional connectivity may be important brain changes that contribute to the effectiveness of CBT for social anxiety. This study demonstrates that clinically applied neuroscience investigations can elucidate neurobiological mechanisms of change in psychiatric conditions.

We examined the prevalence rates of Internet gaming disorder among South Korean middle school students, the dominant symptoms of Internet gaming disorder, and the interrelationships between such disorder and non-psychotic psychological symptoms (ie, anxiety, depression, and impulsiveness) and with physical aggression.


METHODS
Data were collected from a national sample of 2024 students (70.3% gamers; 50.6% boys). Gaming disorder and prevalent symptoms were measured by the 9 diagnostic criteria proposed in DSM-5.


RESULTS
Our results showed 5.9% of the sample (boys 10.4%, girls 1.2%) was classified as adolescents with gaming disorder. Meanwhile, 8% (boys 14.2%, girls 5.9%) of the sample was found to be at high risk of gaming disorder. The prevalent symptoms were mood modification, behavioral salience, conflict, withdrawal, and relapse, in that order. A total of 9.2%, 15.1%, and 10.9% of the adolescents with gaming disorder had non-psychotic psychological anxiety, depression, and impulsiveness symptoms, respectively. Nearly 11% of students with Internet gaming disorder had 2 non-psychotic psychological symptoms or more.


CONCLUSION
These results provide supportive empirical evidence that Internet gaming disorder can lead to severe distress and that it can be associated with comorbid symptoms that are relevant to development or continuance of the gaming disorder.","[{'authorId': '48002956', 'name': 'Hongsik Yu'}, {'authorId': '2116719396', 'name': 'Jaehee Cho'}]",82.0,,0.0,"Prevalence of Internet Gaming Disorder among Korean Adolescents and Associations with Non-psychotic Psychological Symptoms, and Physical Aggression.",2016.0

Obese children may be at increased risk of becoming obese adults. To examine the relationship between obesity in childhood and obesity in adulthood, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature published between 1970 and July 1992. Comparison between studies was complicated by differences in study design, definitions of obesity, and analytic methods used. Although the correlations between anthropometric measures of obesity in childhood and those in adulthood varied considerably among studies, the associations were consistently positive.


RESULTS
About a third (26 to 41%) of obese preschool children were obese as adults, and about half (42 to 63%) of obese school-age children were obese as adults. For all studies and across all ages, the risk of adult obesity was at least twice as high for obese children as for nonobese children. The risk of adult obesity was greater for children who were at higher levels of obesity and for children who were obese at older ages.


CONCLUSION
The wide range of estimates in this literature are, in part, due to differences in study designs, definitions of obesity, ages at which participants were measured, intervals between measurements, and population and cultural differences.","[{'authorId': '5368543', 'name': 'M.

To date, little is known about the incidence and possible risk factors for developing anxiety and depression in the working population. Study aims were to (a) determine the incidence of subclinical anxiety and depression in a general working population and (b) identify the psychosocial work characteristics associated with the onset of subclinical anxiety and depression. Methods: This prospective study is based on 3,707 employees participating in the Maastricht Cohort Study on Fatigue at Work. Psychosocial work characteristics were measured in May 2000; anxiety and depression were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in April 2002. Results: The cumulative 23‐month incidence for subclinical anxiety and depression was 4.6 and 3.3%, respectively. High psychological job demands increased the risk for both subsequent anxiety and depression. Moreover, low social support was predictive for the onset of anxiety, whereas job insecurity increased the risk for the onset of depression. These prospective associations were independent of potential confounding variables and the other psychosocial work characteristics. Conclusions: Adverse psychosocial work characteristics are significant predictors for the onset of subclinical anxiety and depression in the general working population. These findings encourage intervention studies testing whether modifying the psychosocial work environment reduces both anxiety and depressive symptoms among employees.

Muchas investigaciones han senalado la adolescencia como el periodo de desarrollo mas importante para la adquisicion de esta habilidad. Dada su importancia, es esencial contar con buenos instrumentos de evaluacion. El objetivo del presente estudio es determinar las propiedades psicometricas del “Cuestionario de Regulacion Emocional” (ERQ-CA) en adolescentes espanoles. Para ello, 399 participantes (178 hombres y 221 mujeres), con una media de edad de 15.27 cumplimentaron los cuestionarios ERQ-CA y el de “Dificultades en la Regulacion Emocional” (DERS). Posteriormente, se realizo el analisis factorial exploratorio, consistencia interna y validez convergente.

Purpose
The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is projected to have adverse consequences on the global tourism and hospitality industry. This paper aims to examine how the outbreak may alter Chinese tourists’ lifestyle choices, travel behaviour and tourism preferences in the short and long term.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper is based on the synthesis of news broadcasted by several media outlets to be supported by an overview of the related literature on tourism marketing, tourism management and tourist behaviour. The authors’ experiences investigating trends in tourism and hospitality at the local and international level have also contributed to the study.


Findings
This paper predicts that COVID-19 will likely affect Chinese travellers’ consumption patterns, such as the growing popularity of free and independent travel, luxury trips and health and wellness tourism. New forms of tourism including slow tourism and smart tourism may also drive future tourism activities. Such changes are likely to force businesses to reconsider their service designs and distribution channels.


Research limitations/implications
While Chinese and other potential visitors rethink how they travel, professionals, too, should reflect upon how to bring positive or negative changes to the tourism industry following this pandemic. Subsequent research should also consider how to mitigate the effects of similar public health crises in the future.


Practical implications
Recommendations for industry practitioners and policymakers focus on tailoring travel arrangements to tourists’ backgrounds. The suggestions may help to alleviate outbreak-related stress, offer travellers newly enriching experiences and partially mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the tourism and hospitality industry. These recommendations can also apply more broadly to global tourist markets.


Social implications
The COVID-19 outbreak has already brought significant impacts to nearly every society and industry. Tourism scholars and practitioners should carefully consider this tragedy and how it may inform industry and social practices. This and other public health crises represent sterling opportunities to view the industry holistically in terms of its effects on the environment, climate and travellers themselves.


Originality/value
This paper presumably represents a frontier study, critically examining the possible impacts of COVID-19 on Chinese travellers’ consumption patterns and how the tourism and hospitality industry may respond to such changes in the future.

Participants (839 teachers working in English schools) completed an online survey that contained questions about demographics, self-reported pressure from imposed curriculum changes, teacher self-efficacy, and perceived stress. Pressure from imposed curriculum changes was positively, and teacher self-efficacy negatively, related to perceived stress. Teacher-self efficacy moderated relations between pressure from imposed curriculum changes and perceived stress. High teacher self-efficacy was associated with lower perceived stress, relative to low teacher self-efficacy, when pressure from imposed curriculum changes was low. The differential advantage offered by high self-efficacy declined as pressure from imposed curriculum changes increased.","[{'authorId': '7606397', 'name': 'D.

The present cross-sectional observational study aimed to investigate the relation between cognitive–emotional regulation strategies and depressive symptoms in type 2 diabetes patients in the context of sociodemographic and clinical factors, of diabetes distress, perception of illness consequences and previous depression. Method. Multiple logistic regression was performed on the responses of 354 adults with type 2 diabetes (58.5% women; mean ± SD age: 61.14 ± 8.5 years; diabetes duration: 9.7 ± 6.4 years; BMI: 30.9 ± 5.3 kg/m2). Depressive symptoms were present in 16.9% and diabetes distress in 45.5%. Participants completed questionnaires on depression (BDI-II), cognitive-emotional regulation strategies (CERQ), diabetes distress (DDS), illness perceived consequences (IPQ-R). Results. Of the cognitive–emotional strategies, lower positive reappraisal of diabetes (OR:0.49;CI:0.34-0.70) and increased catastrophizing (OR:2.08; CI:1.47-2.91) were found to increase the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms in the presence of higher diabetes distress (OR: 1.53; CI:1.07-2.19), increased negative perception of diabetes consequences (OR:2.02; CI:1.34-3.06) and the presence of previous depression (OR:4.18; CI:2.03-8.63). Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on cognitive-emotional regulation strategies in type 2 diabetes and provides evidence for the beneficial influence of positive reappraisal and adverse effect of catastrophizing on depressive symptoms in the context of diabetes distress, perceived consequences of diabetes and previous history of depression.","[{'authorId': '34639999', 'name': 'A.

Prior research suggests that sleep deprivation is associated with declines in some aspects of emotional intelligence and increased severity on indices of psychological disturbance. Sleep deprivation is also associated with reduced prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity, potentially reflecting impaired top-down modulation of emotion. It remains unknown whether this modified connectivity may be observed in relation to more typical levels of sleep curtailment. We examined whether self-reported sleep duration the night before an assessment would be associated with these effects.


DESIGN
Participants documented their hours of sleep from the previous night, completed the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), and Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).


SETTING
Outpatient neuroimaging center at a private psychiatric hospital.


PARTICIPANTS
Sixty-five healthy adults (33 men, 32 women), ranging in age from 18-45 y.


INTERVENTIONS
N/A.


MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
Greater self-reported sleep the preceding night was associated with higher scores on all scales of the EQ-i but not the MSCEIT, and with lower symptom severity scores on half of the psychopathology scales of the PAI. Longer sleep was also associated with stronger negative functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Moreover, greater negative connectivity between these regions was associated with higher EQ-i and lower symptom severity on the PAI.


CONCLUSIONS
Self-reported sleep duration from the preceding night was negatively correlated with prefrontal-amygdala connectivity and the severity of subjective psychological distress, while positively correlated with higher perceived emotional intelligence. More sleep was associated with higher emotional and psychological strength.","[{'authorId': '1885446', 'name': 'William D S Killgore'}]",86.0,,62.0,Self-reported sleep correlates with prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity and emotional functioning.,2013.0

To study self-regulation and motivation in learning contexts as an ongoing adaptive process, situation-specific methods are needed in addition to static measures. This article presents an ‘Adaptive Instrument for Regulation of Emotions’ aimed at accessing students’ experiences of individual and socially shared regulation of emotions in a socially challenging learning situation. The instrument, grounded in self-regulated and socially regulated learning theory, comprises four interrelated components: the socio-emotional challenges experienced in a collaborative learning situation; individual and group-level attempts to regulate the immediate emotions evoked by the challenges; the personal goals; and goal attainment pursued in that situation. The theoretical foundation of the instrument and its components are outlined and some reliability issues illustrated.

Assessing mother–child dyads exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV), a population at risk for emotional and neurocognitive problems, we examined relationships between maternal emotional regulation, parenting, and children’s executive functioning (including working memory, inhibitory control, cognitve flexibility and set shifting, and planning). Positive parenting practices, as reported by the children, were correlated with children’s planning and problem solving performance. Controlling for children’s own emotion regulation and gender, mothers’ self-reported emotion regulation abilities predicted children’s performance on a task of cognitive flexibility. Girls exhibited superior emotion regulation and executive functioning performance compared to boys, and mothers of girls reported better emotion regulation abilities compared to mothers of boys. These findings add to a nascent literature suggesting that parenting and parental emotional functioning may play important roles in children’s neurocognitive functioning. In addition, they help to explain the mechanisms by which children exposed to IPV experience executive functioning deficits.","[{'authorId': '34573890', 'name': 'Kristin W.

The current study is a multimethod investigation of parental self-regulation in relation to the quality of parenting behavior and parent–child interactions in a diverse sample of parents and kindergarten-age children. Using path analyses, we tested how parent executive functions (inhibitory control) and lack of emotion regulation strategies uniquely relate to both sensitive/responsive behaviors and positive/collaborative behaviors during observed interaction tasks. In our analyses, we accounted for parent education, financial stress, and social support as socioeconomic factors that likely relate to parent executive function and emotion regulation skills. In a diverse sample of primary caregivers (N = 102), we found that direct assessment of parent inhibitory control was positively associated with sensitive/responsive behaviors, whereas parent self-reported difficulties in using emotion regulation strategies were associated with lower levels of positive and collaborative dyadic behaviors. Parent education and financial stress predicted inhibitory control, and social support predicted emotion regulation difficulties; parent education was also a significant predictor of sensitive/responsive behaviors. Greater inhibitory control skills and fewer difficulties identifying effective emotion regulation strategies were not significantly related in our final path model.

Numerous studies report an association between social support and protection from depression, but no systematic review or meta-analysis exists on this topic.


AIMS
To review systematically the characteristics of social support (types and source) associated with protection from depression across life periods (childhood and adolescence; adulthood; older age) and by study design (cross-sectional v cohort studies).


METHOD
A systematic literature search conducted in February 2015 yielded 100 eligible studies. Study quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist, followed by meta-analyses.


RESULTS
Sources of support varied across life periods, with parental support being most important among children and adolescents, whereas adults and older adults relied more on spouses, followed by family and then friends. Significant heterogeneity in social support measurement was noted. Effects were weaker in both magnitude and significance in cohort studies.

4a191bb8c04538cae794379502ce552a0b7adf15,"Introduction Everyone experiences stress at one time or another – from major events such as the death of a loved one, to more minor stressors such as financial difficulties. Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S.

However, few studies have empirically tested this hypothesised link using standardised laboratory measures of emotion-regulation ability. The present research examined the relationship between sleep quality and the ability to implement a type of emotion regulation that has particularly important implications for psychological health: cognitive reappraisal (cognitively reframing an emotional event so as to dampen its impact). To do so, 156 participants (86 male) reported on their past week's sleep quality. Their ability to implement cognitive reappraisal (CRA) was then measured with a standardised laboratory challenge. Participants with poorer self-reported sleep quality exhibited lower CRA, even after controlling for fourteen potential key confounds (e.g., age, negative affect, mood disorder symptoms, stress). This finding is consistent with the idea that poorer sleep quality impairs individuals' ability to engage in the crucial task of regulating negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '2172628', 'name': 'I.

A four-wave longitudinal study tested the demands-resources model in the school context.


AIM
To examine the applicability of the demands-resources to the school context.


METHOD
Data of 1,709 adolescents were gathered, once during the transition from comprehensive to post-comprehensive education, twice during post-comprehensive education, and once 2 years later.


RESULTS
The hypotheses were supported, path analysis showing that study demands were related to school burnout a year later, while study resources were related to schoolwork engagement. Self-efficacy was positively related to engagement and negatively to burnout. School burnout predicted schoolwork engagement negatively 1 year later. Engagement was positively related to life satisfaction 2 years later, while burnout was related to depressive symptoms. Finally, burnout mediated the relationship between study demands and mental health outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
The demands-resources model can usefully be applied to the school context, including the associations between school-related burnout and engagement among adolescents. The model comprises two processes, the energy-depleting process and the motivational process.","[{'authorId': '1398876431', 'name': 'K.

4cc49c63e3e4c84763274b356866f0a989c8b1d4,"Objective Teachers often experience burnout and challenges during their active career. Different studies have shown that those directly involved with teaching children with special needs are more subject to burnout. Due to advance screening tools, more children with autism are now diagnosed and involved in special education. The aim of the present study was to investigate the professional burnout in teachers of children with autism compared to teachers of other children with special needs. Methods Casual Comparative study design was used for this research. Three self-reported measures (Maslach Burnout Inventory, Job Descriptive Index, and General Health Questionnaire) were distributed; clustered sampling selection was conducted to select participants. Ninety three female teachers (32 teachers of children with autism, 30 teachers in schools for deaf and 31 for teachers of children with mental retardation) from 12 schools located in 4 districts of Tehran were selected. Pearson's and Spearman's correlation statistical tests, analysis of variances and regression were used to analyze the results. Results Results of the current study revealed a significant difference in criterion validity between the three groups of teachers The three groups were different in terms of general health (p=0.010), emotional exhaustion (p=0.005) and depersonalization (p<0.001); however considering other variables no significant differences were observed. Comparison between groups showed that the average scores of teachers of children with autism were significantly higher than teachers of deaf and hard of hearing and mentally retarded children in general health, fatigue, and depersonalization variables. No significant differences were observed in average scores of teachers for mentally retarded and deaf children. Conclusions Female teachers’ of children with autism are experiencing significantly higher levels of burnout and general mental health problems compared to teachers of children with other disabilities requiring special education.","[{'authorId': '4374066', 'name': 'Hadi Zarafshan'}, {'authorId': '143943307', 'name': 'M.

Methods Sixty-five patients underwent a 28-day rehabilitation program for alcohol addiction. They underwent a brief semi-structured interview at admission and completed a battery of five self-report questionnaires between days 7 and 10 of alcohol abstinence (T0) and 3 days prior to discharge (T1). Results After rehabilitation program, all symptoms of psychological distress decreased. We found a significant improvement in all emotional, cognitive and metacognitive scales except for “Cognitive harm” (NAM), “Awareness” (DERS) and a small effect size (low statistical power) for “Emotional clarity” (DERS). Compared to those still abstinent at 1 month from discharge, we found more difficulties in “Emotional clarity” in those who had an early relapse. Difficulties in “Emotional clarity” were observed also in patients with a high level of craving at discharge. Conclusion Significant differences were observed between the groups “abstinence vs non-abstinence” at 1 month from discharge concerning difficulties in emotion regulation. In particular, we found difficulty in the awareness and understanding of emotion, precisely to identify correctly the emotions. The “Emotional Clarity” seems to be the emotional difficulty that characterized also the group with a high level of craving at discharge and the individuals with early relapse, suggesting the importance of this function as a preliminary factor in emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '49256784', 'name': 'M.

4d29041422a1618ad4477e1e5193359b84236f25,"Sleep deprivation commonly impairs affective regulation and causes worse mood. However, the majority of previous research concerns young adults. Because susceptibility to sleep deprivation and emotion regulation change distinctively across adult age, we tested here the hypothesis that the effect of sleep deprivation on mood is stronger in young than in older adults. In an experimental design, young (18–30 years) and older adults (60–72 years) participated in either a sleep control (young, n = 63; older, n = 47) or a total sleep deprivation condition (young, n = 61; older, n = 47). Sleepiness, mood and common symptoms of sleep deprivation were measured using established questionnaires and ratings. Sleep‐deprived participants felt more sleepy, stressed and cold, and reported lower vigour and positive affect, regardless of age. All the other outcome measures (negative affect, depression, confusion, tension, anger, fatigue, total mood disturbance, hunger, cognitive attenuation, irritability) showed a weaker response to sleep deprivation in the older group, as indicated by age*sleep deprivation interactions (ps < 0.05). The results show that older adults are emotionally less affected by sleep deprivation than young adults. This tolerance was mainly related to an attenuated increase in negative mood. This could possibly be related to the well‐known positivity effect, which suggests that older adults prioritize regulating their emotions to optimize well‐being. The results also highlight that caution is warranted when generalizing results from sleep deprivation studies across the adult lifespan.","[{'authorId': '4921940', 'name': 'J.

The cultivation of mindfulness, involving acceptance and nonjudgment of present-moment experience, often results in transformative health behavior change. Neural systems involved in motivation and learning have an important role to play. A theoretical model of mindfulness that integrates these mechanisms with the cognitive, emotional, and self-related processes commonly described, while applying an integrated model to health behavior change, is needed. This integrative review (1) defines mindfulness and describes the mindfulness-based intervention movement, (2) synthesizes the neuroscience of mindfulness and integrates motivation and learning mechanisms within a mindful self-regulation model for understanding the complex effects of mindfulness on behavior change, and (3) synthesizes current clinical research evaluating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions targeting health behaviors relevant to psychiatric care. The review provides insight into the limitations of current research and proposes potential mechanisms to be tested in future research and targeted in clinical practice to enhance the impact of mindfulness on behavior change.","[{'authorId': '1399070390', 'name': 'Zev Schuman-Olivier'}, {'authorId': '6548460', 'name': 'Marcelo Trombka'}, {'authorId': '8589487', 'name': 'D.

However, it remains unclear whether this benefit is affected by the actual disclosure of the infertility condition. The present study aimed to examine the role of disclosure of fertility status in moderating the relationship between perceived social support and fertility-related stress. The study population (N = 698) was drawn from a longitudinal cohort design of Danish men and women beginning fertility treatment with a 12-month follow-up. Participants were 698 subjects (364 women and 334 men) who completed self-administered questionnaires measuring perceived social support at T1, and fertility status disclosure and fertility stress at T2. Results indicated that when infertility is not disclosed to at least a close relationship, the beneficial effects of social support on both social and personal stress cease to exist. Also, when participants perceived high social support, higher levels of social and personal stress were associated with keeping infertility a secret within close relationships, but when low social support was perceived, high social and personal stress levels were associated with disclosing infertility to all close relationships. Findings from this study provide evidence that the prospective relationship between social support and fertility-related stress is moderated by the decision of disclosing infertility. Infertility health professionals can help couples in deciding to which contexts they should disclose their infertility by assessing social support.","[{'authorId': '15104813', 'name': 'M.

4e0e09e8c434fba1314168ca7e5931eb5d362a94,"Current theories suggest that social and physical pain overlap in their neurological and physiological outcomes. We investigated how social and physical pain overlap in their psychological responses by testing the hypothesis that both social and physical pain would thwart satisfaction on four human needs, worsen mood, and increase desire to aggress. In Experiment 1, recalling an experience of social or physical pain produced overlapping effects in the form of thwarted self-esteem and control needs and increased negative affect and desire to aggress. In Experiment 2, we induced social (Cyberball ostracism) or physical pain (cold pressor) within the laboratory session, and found that both pain types produced feelings of being ignored and excluded, and thwarted belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence. Our results provide further support to pain overlap theories and indicate that social and physical pain cause common psychological consequences, resulting in new ways to understand and manage pain. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. There is growing evidence in the literature showing that physical pain, the pain caused by a physical injury, and social pain, the pain caused by the threat or actual loss of a social connection (MacDonald & Leary, 2005), share a common neural system. Yet, it is still unclear whether the physiological overlap between the pain types also implies an overlap in their psychological responses. The present paper aims to fill this gap. We examined whether the social/physical pain overlap results in common psychological responses as well. The physiological overlap underlying physical and social pain was initially proposed by Panksepp (1998). Panksepp found that, besides reducing the experience of pain, the administration of an opiate also reduced crying behavior in animals that were socially isolated (Panksepp, Herman, Conner, Bishop, & Scott, 1978). Following Panksepp and colleagues’ early suggestion, several authors investigated whether similar neural brain circuitries are delegated to detect, process, and regulate both social and physical pain in social animals and humans (DeWall et al., 2010; Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003).","[{'authorId': '37814606', 'name': 'P.

In order to investigate these research questions, 250 young adults who were facing a transition from school to work were studied at three points of the transition process: while they were still at school; 8 months after their graduation; and 1.5 years after it. At each measurement point, they were asked to complete the Personal Project Analysis, a revised form of Beck's Depression Inventory, and the Work Status Questionnaire. The results revealed that the outcomes of young adults' efforts to deal with the transition from school to work had consequences for the ways in which they reconstructed their goals: Those who were successful in this transition showed a decline in the number of personal goals that did not relate to the next stages of this particular developmental trajectory, whereas those who had problems turned to goals that concerned other life domains, as an alternative, compensatory control strategy. The results also revealed that the impact of personal goals on depressive symptomatology was moderated by individuals' life situations following the transition: Work-related goals reduced individuals' depressive symptoms only among those who had been able to find a job, whereas self-related goals decreased it in a moratorium-type of life situation.","[{'authorId': '79454876', 'name': 'J.

This study explored differences between leavers and stayers in terms of the process of their resilience responses. Major psychological factors such as value, self-efficacy, beliefs and emotions were foregrounded to understand how leavers and stayers are similar or different in negotiating and interpreting external environments. This study employed semi-structured interviews for seven leavers and seven stayers who had teaching experiences of less than five years. The findings of this study showed that both leavers and stayers had intrinsic interests in working as a teacher. Also, both groups identified similar challenges of working as a teacher, such as classroom management and effective delivery of lessons. However, leavers showed weaker self-efficacy beliefs than stayers, who tended to get more support and help from school administrators. In addition, leavers held beliefs that imposed heavy burdens on themselves, which may have created stress and emotional burnout. Unlike leavers, stayers often reported their strategies to prevent them from being burned out by setting boundaries establishing relationship with students. Given the high attrition rate of beginning teachers, the current study provides meaningful insight about challenges beginning teachers’ face, their needs and better ways to prepare and train them.","[{'authorId': '144377517', 'name': 'J.

However, to date most evidence has emerged from interventions that have promoted moderate to vigorous physical activity. In this conceptual review, we argue that attention should be given to the entire continuum of physical activity from reducing sedentary behavior to increasing higher levels of physical activity when possible. In addition, considerable evidence in the cancer literature supports the value of mindfulness-based interventions as a means of helping patients and survivors cope with the variety of threats that accompany this disease. Based on the success of these two areas of research, we argue for conceptualizing and promoting physical activity as Mindfulness-Based Movement, using Polyvagal Theory as a theoretical framework to understand the role and value of Mindfulness-Based Movement as a potential intervention for cancer care and control.","[{'authorId': '2255383242', 'name': 'Alexander R.

Since the management process for emotions (emotion regulation; ER) is developed in childhood, we present a novel conceptual framework model for the role of ER in the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity. A narrative review of the literature by electronic database search (MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge and Scopus) was conducted of observational and interventional/experimental literature on ER and obesity and the underlying concepts. We also present an overview of ER intervention techniques. Our model indicates that childhood ER is a link between stress and obesity. Stress along with ineffective ER leads to abnormal cortisol patterns, emotional eating, sedentary lifestyle, reduction of physical activity, and sleep problems. Simultaneously, a healthy lifestyle could show benefits on ER and in developing adaptive ER strategies. In the development of obesity and ER, parents also play a role. By contrast, effective ER skills decrease obesity-related unhealthy behaviour and enhance protective factors, which boost health. The literature contains some observational studies of children but very few intervention studies, most of which are pilot or on-going studies. In conclusion, encouraging effective ER could be a useful new approach for combating and treating childhood obesity. Future ER intervention studies are needed to confirm the validity of this model in children.","[{'authorId': '144893035', 'name': 'Estefania Aparicio'}, {'authorId': '144306968', 'name': 'J.

The present study examines the impact of work life balance and burnout on job satisfaction in the context of the Information Technology (IT) and IT Enabled Services (ITES) industries. Burnout is measured through three dimensions, i.e., meaninglessness, de-motivation, and exhaustion. The findings reveal that while work-life balance and job satisfaction were positively related to each other, de-motivation, exhaustion and meaninglessness were negatively related to job satisfaction. The significant contribution to job satisfaction came from work life balance in both the IT and ITES industries. However, it was higher in the ITES group compared to the IT group. Further, findings show that job satisfaction was higher among the male respondents in comparison to the female respondents. Interestingly, the IT group had lower work-life balance and job satisfaction, while it had higher meaninglessness, de-motivation and exhaustion compared to the ITES group. The findings and implications of the study for enhancing employee satisfaction are discussed and future research directions are pointed out.","[{'authorId': '117546566', 'name': 'Y.

4eca40e25f46f1d36269ec9bb13e0c693c5166e7,"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is currently putting a strain on the mental health resilience of the world's population. Specifically, it is likely to elicit an intense response to fear and to act as a risk factor for the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some individuals may be more at risk than others, with pathological personality variables being a potential candidate as a central vulnerability factor. In addition, the pathways that lead the pathological personality to PTSD and intense fear responses to COVID-19 are likely to be explained by poor emotion regulation capacities, as well as by dissociative mechanisms. Aims: This study aimed to shed light on vulnerability factors that may account for the onset of PTSD and intense responses of fear in response to COVID-19 outbreak and to test the mediating role of emotion dysregulation and dissociation proneness in these pathways. Methods: We used a longitudinal design of research administered to a sample of community individuals (N = 308; meanage = 35.31, SD = 13.91; 22.7% were male). Moreover, we used self-report questionnaires to measure pathological personality, emotion regulation capacities, dissociative proneness at the beginning of the lockdown, and PTSD symptoms and fear of COVID-19 at the end of the Italian lockdown (from March 9 to May 18, 2020). Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Results: We found that pathological personality levels longitudinally predicted PTSD and fear of COVID-19 levels. Moreover, the associations between emotion dysregulation and dissociation were shown to significantly and totally mediate the relationship between pathological personality and PTSD, whereas no significant mediation effects were observed in relation to fear of COVID-19. Conclusions: Individuals with pathological personality traits may be more vulnerable to the onset of negative psychological consequences related to COVID-19 outbreak, such as PTSD symptomatology and fear levels. Emotion regulation capacities appear to be relevant targets of interventions for PTSD symptomatology. Future research should explore the mediating variables linking pathological personality to intense fear responses to COVID-19.","[{'authorId': '5635016', 'name': 'P.

According to this model, it was hypothesized that three job characteristics (i.e. job demands, job autonomy, and workplace social support) are curvilinearly related with three key indicators of employee well-being (i.e. job satisfaction, job-related anxiety, and emotional exhaustion). Structural equation modelling (LISREL 8) was employed to test the comprehensive Vitamin Model. The results showed that the fit of the non-linear model is superior to that of the linear model. Except for the relationship between job autonomy and emotional exhaustion, the curvilinear relationships followed the predicted U-shaped or inverted U-shaped curvilinear pattern. Moreover, it appeared that the three job characteristics are differentially related with various indicators of employee well-being.

With reciprocal neural connections to multiple brain regions, the VN serves as a control center that integrates interoceptive information and responds with appropriate adaptive modulatory feedbacks. While most VN fibers are unmyelinated C‐fibers from the visceral organs, myelinated A‐ and B‐fiber play an important role in somatic sensory, motor, and parasympathetic innervation. VN fibers are primarily cholinergic but other noncholinergic nonadrenergic neurotransmitters are also involved. VN has four vagal nuclei that provide critical controls to the cardiovascular, respiratory, and alimentary systems. Latest studies revealed that VN is also involved in inflammation, mood, and pain regulation, all of which can be potentially modulated by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). With a broad vagal neural network, VNS may exert a neuromodulatory effect to activate certain innate “protective” pathways for restoring health.","[{'authorId': '6756335', 'name': 'Hsiangkuo Yuan'}, {'authorId': '2642384', 'name': 'S.

Socio-emotional impairments that have been described in VPT individuals include diminished social competence and self-esteem, emotional dysregulation, shyness and timidity. However, the etiology of socio-emotional problems in VPT samples and their underlying mechanisms are far from understood. To date, research has focused on the investigation of both biological and environmental risk factors associated with socio-emotional problems, including structural and functional alterations in brain areas involved in processing emotions and social stimuli, perinatal stress and pain and parenting strategies. Considering the complex interplay of the aforementioned variables, the review attempts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association between very preterm birth, socio-emotional vulnerability and psychopathology. After a comprehensive overview of the socio-emotional impairments associated with VPT birth, three main models of socio-emotional development are presented and discussed. These focus on biological vulnerability, early life adversities and parenting, respectively. To conclude, a developmental framework is used to consider different pathways linking VPT birth to psychopathology, taking into account the interaction between medical, biological, and psychosocial factors.","[{'authorId': '40462026', 'name': 'Anita Montagna'}, {'authorId': '3181249', 'name': 'C.

According to the theory, social motives fall into 1 of 2 general categories--those related to the acquisition of knowledge and those related to the regulation of emotion. When time is perceived as open-ended, knowledge-related goals are prioritized. In contrast, when time is perceived as limited, emotional goals assume primacy. The inextricable association between time left in life and chronological age ensures age-related differences in social goals. Nonetheless, the authors show that the perception of time is malleable, and social goals change in both younger and older people when time constraints are imposed. The authors argue that time perception is integral to human motivation and suggest potential implications for multiple subdisciplines and research interests in social, developmental, cultural, cognitive, and clinical psychology.","[{'authorId': '5994816', 'name': 'L.

All infants were 6-9 months of age (corrected for gestational age in the pre-term group). Infant and maternal socio-emotional expressivity and self-regulatory behaviours were coded and measures of dyadic coordination (Matching, Reparation Rate, and Synchrony) were calculated. There were no significant differences in infant and caregiver socio-emotional behaviours between the two groups and both groups demonstrated the still-face (SF) effect and the reunion effect. There was a difference in self-regulatory behaviour. Pre-term infants were more likely than full-term infants to use distancing (e.g., by turning away, twisting, or arching) from their mothers during the FFSF. Additionally, during the Reunion episode of the FFSF pre-term infants showed more social monitoring compared to full-term infants. Regardless of the birth status, the dyads showed less coordination and a slower rate of reparation during the Reunion episode than during the Play episode. The higher proportion of distancing in the pre-term group and the increase in social monitoring suggest that even in normal interactions pre-term infants may experience a higher level of stress and have less capacity for self-regulation compared to the full-terms and that pre-term infants appear to use a compensatory strategy of increased social monitoring to cope with the stress of renegotiating the interaction during Reunion. The findings suggest that pre-term infants have different regulatory and interactive capacities than full-term infants.","[{'authorId': '6062290', 'name': 'R.

The Turkish version of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was administered to 442 university students. Firstly, language equivalence of the Turkish version the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire was investigated and findings indicated that the Turkish translation of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire is equivalent to the original form. Confirmatory factor analyses successfully revealed the two-factor (reappraisal and suppression) structure of the Turkish version the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire. Further, based on the two-factor model, results from multi-group analysis indicated that the Turkish version of the Emotional Regulation Questtionnaire has the property of strict factorial invariance across gender, including equal factor loadings, equal item intercepts, and equal item uniqueness (error variances and covariances). The internal consistencies were .78 for the reappraisal and .73 for the suppression subscales. Test-retest reliabilities were .74 for the reappraisal and .72 for the suppression subscales. Overall, the Turkish version of the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire has adequate psychometric properties and can be used to examine emotion regulation among Turkish university students.","[{'authorId': '112980371', 'name': 'Jale Eldeleklioğlu'}, {'authorId': '74860428', 'name': 'Yüksel Eroğlu'}]",27.0,,24.0,A Turkish adaptation of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire,2015.0

In 5 qualitative studies, it was found that students experience a rich diversity of emotions in academic settings. Anxiety was reported most often, but overall, positive emotions were described no less frequently than negative emotions. Based on the studies in this article, taxonomies of different academic emotions and a self-report instrument measuring students' enjoyment, hope, pride, relief, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, and boredom (Academic Emotions Questionnaire [AEQ]) were developed. Using the AEQ, assumptions of a cognitive-motivational model of the achievement effects of emotions, and of a control/value theory of their antecedents (Pekrun, 1992b, 2000), were tested in 7 cross-sectional, 3 longitudinal, and 1 diary study using samples of university and school students. Results showed that academic emotions are significantly related to students' motivation, learning strategies, cognitive resources, self-regulation, and academic achievement, as well as to personality and classroom antecedents.

Clinics often encounter neurologically intact patients who are unable to swallow pills. All of the interventions published previously have used traditional behavioural techniques, which are time consuming and often not helpful.


OBJECTIVE
To determine whether children who had never been able to swallow a whole pill could become successful as a result of an intervention based on head posture.


METHOD
A novel intervention was developed based on published research showing that changing head position alters swallowing dynamics. The method was developed in two studies of 240 adults and children, pilot tested in a study of 108 university students with very mild pill-swallowing discomfort, and then evaluated in a study of 41 children who had never successfully swallowed a pill in spite of much instruction and coaxing. Children were recruited from a tertiary paediatric hospital: 34 were clinic patients, four were their siblings or friends, and three were children of hospital staff. The primary intervention involved teaching five head positions (centre, up, down, left and right) followed by a two-week period of daily practice.


RESULTS
EIGHT CHILDREN (ALL CLINIC REFERRALS) WITHDREW WITHOUT PRACTICING: four were too ill to practice (primarily due to sedation or nausea) and four simply refused to do the homework practice. All 33 of the children who were able and willing to practice daily were successful.


CONCLUSION
Practice with head posture variations was successful in treating pill-swallowing difficulties in all 33 children who practiced for 14 days.

However, there is still limited understanding about how students engage in social forms of regulation processes and what roles these regulatory processes may play during collaborative learning. The purpose of this study was to identify when and how co- and shared regulation of metacognitive, emotional and motivational processes emerge and function during collaborative inquiry learning in science. Two groups of three students (aged 12) from a private primary school in Turkey were videotaped during collaborative inquiry activities in a naturalistic classroom setting over a seven-week period, and the transcripts were analysed in order to identify their use of regulation processes. Moreover, this was combined with the analysis of stimulated-recall interviews with the student groups. Results indicated that co- and shared regulation processes were often initiated by particular events and played a crucial role in the success of students’ collaborative inquiry learning. Co-regulation of metacognitive processes had the function of stimulating students to reflect upon and clarify their thinking, as well as facilitating the construction of new scientific understanding. Shared regulation of metacognitive processes helped students to build a shared understanding of the task, clarify and justify their shared perspective, and sustain the ongoing knowledge co-construction. Moreover, the use of shared emotional and motivational regulation was identified as important for sustaining reciprocal interactions and creating a positive socio-emotional atmosphere within the groups. In addition, the findings revealed links between the positive quality of group interactions and the emergence of co- and shared regulation of metacognitive processes.

Forty-seven young (age 20-30) and 33 older (age 65-75) participants (38/23 with complete data and successful sleep intervention) performed a cognitive reappraisal task during fMRI after a night of normal sleep and after restricted sleep (3h). Emotional downregulation was associated with significantly increased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (pFWE < 0.05) and lateral orbital cortex (pFWE < 0.05) in young, but not in older subjects. Sleep restriction was associated with a decrease in self-reported regulation success to negative stimuli (p < 0.01) and a trend towards perceiving all stimuli as less negative (p = 0.07), in young participants. No effects of sleep restriction on brain activity nor connectivity were found in either age group. In conclusion, our data do not support the idea of a prefrontal-amygdala disconnect after sleep restriction, and neural mechanisms underlying behavioural effects on emotional regulation after insufficient sleep require further investigation.","[{'authorId': '38812644', 'name': 'S.

Network analysis of psychiatric symptoms describes reciprocal relationships of individual symptoms, beyond categorical diagnoses. Those with eating disorders (EDs) frequently have complex patterns of comorbid symptoms and the transdiagnostic theory includes shared common core features across diagnoses. We aim to test whether general psychiatric symptoms comprise components of these transdiagnostic features.


METHODS
Network analysis was applied on 2068 patients with EDs (955 anorexia nervosa [AN], 813 bulimia nervosa [BN], and 300 binge-eating disorder [BED]). All patients underwent clinical interviews and some self-reported questionnaires, such as the Symptom Check-List 90 (SCL-90) to measure psychiatric symptoms, the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) to measure ED-specific symptoms, and the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) for personality traits.


RESULTS
Across EDs and within each ED, SCL-90 scores of depression, anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity, EDI ineffectiveness, interoceptive awareness, interpersonal distrust, and drive for thinness had high centrality. Notably, body mass index (BMI) and EDI bulimia played a central role when considering the whole group, whereas they did not in individual EDs.


DISCUSSION
The shared centrality of identified nodes in both individual and merged groups supported the transdiagnostic theory of EDs (diagnoses share core ED features), with a central role of BMI. Moreover, the most central nodes were general psychiatric symptoms, interpersonal domain, and self-efficacy. These findings suggest that-in addition to ED-core symptoms and BMI-depressive and anxiety symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity and ineffectiveness may be important targets to provide effective treatments across AN, BN, and BED.","[{'authorId': '3891924', 'name': 'M.

We tested the hypothesis that the perception of bodily states is positively related to the experienced intensity of feelings as well as to the activity of first‐order and second‐order brain structures involved in the processing of feelings. Using a heartbeat perception task, subjects were separated into groups with either high or poor interoceptive awareness. During emotional picture presentation we measured high‐density EEG and used spatiotemporal current density reconstruction to identify regions involved in both interoceptive awareness and emotion processing. We observed a positive relation between interoceptive awareness and the experienced intensity of emotions. Furthermore, the P300 amplitudes to pleasant and unpleasant pictures were enhanced for subjects with high interoceptive awareness. The source reconstruction revealed that interoceptive awareness is related to an enhanced activation in both first‐order structures (insula, somatosensory cortices) and second‐order structures (anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortices).

CBT was also directly compared to other specific psychological interventions, and therapist-led CBT resulted in greater reductions in behavioral and cognitive symptoms than interpersonal psychotherapy at posttreatment. At follow-up, CBT outperformed interpersonal psychotherapy only on cognitive symptoms. CBT for binge eating disorder also resulted in greater reductions in behavioral symptoms than behavioral weight loss interventions. There was no evidence that CBT was more efficacious than behavior therapy or nonspecific supportive therapies. Conclusions: CBT is efficacious for eating disorders. Although CBT was equally efficacious to certain psychological treatments, the fact that CBT outperformed all active psychological comparisons and interpersonal psychotherapy specifically, offers some support for the specificity of psychological treatments for eating disorders. Conclusions from this study are hampered by the fact that many trials were of poor quality. Higher quality RCTs are essential.","[{'authorId': '14650904', 'name': 'J.

This hierarchical sensorimotor architecture coincides with the limbic cortical architecture that underlies emotions, and thus we regard interoceptive feelings and their conjoint motivations as homeostatic emotions. We describe how bivalent feelings, emotions and sympathovagal balance can be organized and regulated efficiently in the bicameral forebrain as asymmetric positive/negative, approach/avoidance and parasympathetic/sympathetic components. We provide original evidence supporting this organization from studies of cardiorespiratory vagal activity in monkeys and functional imaging studies in healthy humans showing activation modulated by paced breathing and passively viewed emotional images. The neuroanatomical architecture of interoception provides deep insight into the functional organization of all emotional feelings and behaviours in humans.

We propose that feeling and expressing positive emotions on the job have favorable consequences on: 1 employees independent of their relationships with others e.g., greater persistence, 2 reactions of others to employees e.g., ""halo,"" or overgeneralization to other desirable traits, and 3 reactions of employees to others e.g., helping others. These three sets of intervening processes are proposed, in turn, to lead to work achievement, job enrichment and a higher quality social context. A partial test of this framework is made in an 18-month study of 272 employees. Results indicate that positive emotion on the job at time 1 is associated with evidence of work achievement more favorable supervisor evaluations and higher pay and a supportive social context more support from supervisors and coworkers at time 2.

In this article we propose an organizing model for understanding these affective influences and their effects on group life. We begin with individual-level affective characteristics that members bring to their groups: moods, emotions, sentiments, and emotional intelligence. These affective characteristics then combine to form a group's affective composition. We discuss explicit and implicit processes through which this affective combination occurs by examining the research on emotional contagion, entrainment, modeling, and the manipulation of affect. We also explore how elements of the affective context, such as organizationwide emotion norms and the group's particular emotional history, may serve to constrain or amplify group members' emotions. The outcome, group emotion, results from the combination of the group's affective composition and the affective context in which the group is behaving. Last, we focus on the important interaction between nonaffective factors and affective factors in group life and suggest a possible agenda for future research.","[{'authorId': '33584106', 'name': 'J.

This research devotes to promoting the adoption of e-government in China. It investigates the attitudes of urban residents versus rural residents toward e-government use in Chongqing, one of most important municipalities of China which is fraught with a serious urban–rural divide. A research model is created to assess the differences between urban and rural residents according to previous literatures and theories. A Structural Equation Model approach is employed to examine the research model. The survey data were collected from 596 urban residents and 477 rural residents in Chongqing. The results reveal that there are differences between urban and rural groups. Many enabling factors and inhibiting factors in previous studies, such as perceived behavioural control and resistance to change, can positively influence rural residents’ intentions to use but fail to exert great effects on urban residents’ motivations. Thus, it is necessary for government agencies in China to take actions based on those significant enabling factors and inhibiting factors to promote e-government acceptance. In addition, it is also necessary to conduct deeper research on e-government acceptance of urban residents in China.","[{'authorId': '1643647329', 'name': 'Banghui Zhang'}, {'authorId': '153514177', 'name': 'Yonghan Zhu'}]",16.0,,58.0,"Comparing attitudes towards adoption of e-government between urban users and rural users: an empirical study in Chongqing municipality, China",2020.0

While previous estimates related to psychological burden among college students are available, quantitative synthesis of available data still needs to be performed. Therefore, this meta-analysis endeavors to present collective evidence discussing the psychological impact of COVID-19 among college students. Bibliographical library databases, including Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO, were systematically searched for relevant studies. Titles, abstracts, and full articles were screened, and two reviewers extracted data. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistic. The random-effects model was utilized to obtain the pooled estimates of psychological indicators among college students. Location, gender, level of severity, and quality scores were used as moderator variables for subgroup analyses. Funnel plot and Egger linear regression test was used to assess publication bias. Twenty-seven studies constituting 90,879 college students met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated 39.4% anxiety (95% CI: 28.6, 51.3; I2 = 99.8%; p-value < 0.0001) and 31.2% depression (95% CI: 19.7, 45.6; I2= 99.8%, p < 0.0001) among college students. The pooled prevalence of stress (26.0%), post-traumatic stress disorder (29.8%), and impaired sleep quality (50.5%) were also reported. College students bear a disproportionate burden of mental health problems worldwide, with females having higher anxiety and depression levels than males. This study‘’s findings underscore the need to develop appropriate public health interventions to address college students’ emotional and psychosocial needs.

Data were collected from 360 Internet banking users of commercial banks across Pakistan. The research model was tested with structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsThe research model had explained 53.9% variance in Internet banking user continuance intention. Next to this, the predictive relevance of the research model was tested with Stone-Geisser's Q² values using blindfolding procedure. Results revealed that the newly developed integrated technology continuance research model has substantial power to predict Internet banking user continuance intention. Moreover, the effect size analysis revealed that factors like satisfaction and user expectation were the most important factors in determining Internet banking user continuance intention.Practical implicationsFor practical implications importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) has used to see the importance and performance of the underpinned factors. Findings indicate that managers and policy makers should focus on user satisfaction, perceived usefulness and expectation confirmation in order to enhance the Internet banking user continuance intention toward the use of Internet banking services.

52545075c51d7d039a2641c9e229876c16d419c3,"BackgroundSuicide, attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts are major public health problems worldwide. Effective face-to-face treatments are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and Problem Solving Treatment (PST). However, about two-thirds of persons who die by suicide have not been in contact with mental health care services in the preceding year, and many have never been treated. Furthermore, many patients do not disclose their suicidal thoughts to their care provider. This may be out of shame, due to fear of stigma or due to lack of trust in (mental) health care. Since many suicidal individuals seek information online, the internet provides an opportunity to reach suicidal individuals who would not be contacted otherwise. By providing a self-help intervention online, persons can anonymously learn to gain control over their suicidal thoughts. There is convincing evidence that self-help is effective for a number of mental disorders. In this study the effectiveness for suicidal thoughts is examined.Methods/DesignIn this study, a recently developed self-help intervention will be evaluated in a Randomized Controlled Trial. The intervention is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and is aimed at subjects who experience mild to moderate suicidal thoughts. This is defined as a score between 1 and 26 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS). Higher and lower scores are excluded. In addition, severely depressed subjects are excluded. In total, 260 subjects will be randomly allocated to the intervention-condition (N = 130) or to the information-control condition (N = 130). Self-report questionnaires will be filled out at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline and 18 weeks after baseline. Primary outcome measure is the reduction in frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts. Secondary outcome measures are the reduction of hopelessness, anxiety and depression, sleeplessness, worry and quality of life measures.DiscussionThis study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention for suicidal thoughts. Several limitations and strengths of the design are discussed.Trial RegistrationNetherlands Trial Register, NTR1689","[{'authorId': '5362620', 'name': 'B.

METHOD: A convenience sample of adult patients of an urban primary care clinic completed a self-administered questionnaire consisting of the Zung Depression Scale and the Spiritual Involvement and Beliefs Scale (SIBS). RESULTS: Among 122 respondents, 99 (81%) reported that they consider themselves religious. Responses from the Zung Depression Scale found that 76 (62%) of the patients were depressed and 46 (38%) were not. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the Zung Depression Scale and the SIBS was -0.36 (p <.0001). Backward stepwise regression analysis revealed that SIBS score and physical health predicted the Zung Depression Scale score. Age, gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and income showed no significant association with depression. Analysis of individual SIBS items revealed that high spirituality scores on items in the domain of intrinsic beliefs, such as belief in a higher power (p <.01), the importance of prayer (p <.0001), and finding meaning in times of hardship (p <.05), were associated negatively with depression. Attendance of religious services had no significant association with depression. CONCLUSION: Appropriate encouragement of a patient's spiritual beliefs may be a helpful adjunct to treating depression.","[{'authorId': '8622950', 'name': 'B.

Preliminary empirical evidence supporting the broaden-and-build theory is reviewed, and open empirical questions that remain to be tested are identified.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a meta-analytic examination of the relationships between OCBs and a variety of individual- and organizational-level outcomes. Results, based on 168 independent samples (N = 51,235 individuals), indicated that OCBs are related to a number of individual-level outcomes, including managerial ratings of employee performance, reward allocation decisions, and a variety of withdrawal-related criteria (e.g., employee turnover intentions, actual turnover, and absenteeism). In addition, OCBs were found to be related (k = 38; N = 3,611 units) to a number of organizational-level outcomes (e.g., productivity, efficiency, reduced costs, customer satisfaction, and unit-level turnover). Of interest, somewhat stronger relationships were observed between OCBs and unit-level performance measures in longitudinal studies than in cross-sectional studies, providing some evidence that OCBs are causally related to these criteria.

Therefore, this study was conducted to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety comorbidity, and associated factors during the COVID-19 lock-down in Nepal. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Nepal. Data was collected from April 9 to April 16, 2020 using an e-questionnaire which was shared through different popular social media. A total of 349 participants were included. Self-reported depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety tools respectively. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with depression, anxiety and depression and anxiety co-morbidity. Results The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity were found to be 34.0%, 31.0% and 23.2% respectively. The multi-variate analysis showed that females, those living alone, health professionals and those who spent more time in accessing information about COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity. Conclusions High rates of depression and anxiety and co-morbidity were found to be prevailing among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down in Nepal. The results suggest that only the scientific, but contextually appropriate messages about the disease should be disseminated to reduce unnecessary fears and anxiety. Awareness interventions to promote mental well-being need to be integrated into the response interventions.

Typically, researchers see such organizational advantage as accruing from the particular capabilities organizations have for creating and sharing knowledge. In this article we seek to contribute to this body of work by developing the following arguments: (1) social capital facilitates the creation of new intellectual capital; (2) organizations, as institutional settings, are conducive to the development of high levels of social capital; and (3) it is because of their more dense social capital that firms, within certain limits, have an advantage over markets in creating and sharing intellectual capital.

5395ec68c9d931acff1bbf465996ff693acae325,"Background: Empathy is an individual’s capacity to understand the behavior of others, to experience their feelings, and to express that understanding to them. Empathic ability is an asset professionally for individuals, such as teachers, physicians and social workers, who work with people.  Being empathetic is also critical to our being able to live with others in general, and ultimately to leading happier lives. Subsequently it seems imperative to examine if and how it is possible to enhance people’s empathic ability. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to use narrative review method to analyze studies of empathy training in human service and social science disciplines over the past thirty years to address the questions: “How have people been trained in empathy and what are the findings?” and “How was empathy training evaluated and how valid are these evaluation findings?” Setting: Not applicable. Intervention: Not applicable. Research Design: Not applicable. Data Collection and Analysis: Narrative review. Findings: Twenty-nine articles pertaining to empathy training evaluation research were identified based on an advanced computer search on the following databases: “Education Full Text,” “ProQuest Education Journals,” “Web of Knowledge” and “Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC). Seven types of training methods were noted in these 29 evaluations with the most popular being didactic related (42%). All but two studies (93%) reported positive findings, mainly in regard to learning (86%), or the cognitive component of empathy. These findings suggest that regardless of the training method, individuals can learn about the concept of empathy. Unfortunately, information pertaining to the effects of training on individuals’ feeling for others, and their ability and propensity to take the perspective of others and to demonstrate it in the natural environments is lacking. Consequently, very little is known about the trainability of the affective and behavioral components of empathy. Also, some of the findings were moderated by gender, age, education level, and time of measurement. Regarding evaluation research designs, most of the studies used self-reporting to collect trainees’ knowledge about empathy and most of the quantitative studies used a control group and pretesting to examine training impact. Construct validity of both empathy measurement and training is very problematic. A majority of the studies did not clearly define empathy, provide training as defined, and/or measure what is being trained; conceptualization of empathy across studies was not consistent either.  In sum, data from the studies reviewed were neither complete nor valid enough to provide a clear and full understanding of the trainability of empathy. More research is apparently needed and hopefully lessons learned from our review will be considered in designing future studies.

The latter symptoms are highly prevalent in chronic pain and seriously impede functioning and quality of life. Nevertheless, the direction of the relationship involving these variables among individuals with chronic pain is still unclear. Methods Four-hundred twenty-eight individuals with chronic pain (238 women, mean age 54.84 years, mean pain duration 85.21 months) treated at two pain clinics completed questionnaires regarding their pain (Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire), depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale), state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and pain-related disability (Pain Disability Index) at four time points, with an average of 5 months between measurements. Cross-lagged, structural equation modeling analyses were performed, enabling the examination of longitudinal associations between the variables. Results Significant symptoms of both depression and anxiety were reported by more than half of the sample on all waves. A latent depression/anxiety variable longitudinally predicted pain (&bgr; = .27, p < .001) and pain-related disability (&bgr; = .38, p < .001). However, neither pain (&bgr; = .10, p = .126) nor pain-related disability (&bgr; = −.01, p = .790) predicted depression/anxiety.

A qualitative study of a bill-collection organization was used to identify norms about the emotions that collectors are expected to convey to debtors and the means used by the organization to maintain such norms given that collectors' expressed emotions are simultaneously influenced by their inner feelings. These data indicate that collectors are selected, socialized, and rewarded for following the general norm of conveying urgency (high arousal with a hint of irritation) to debtors. Collectors are further socialized and rewarded to adjust their expressed emotions in response to variations in debtor demeanor. These contingent norms sometimes clash with collectors' feelings toward debtors. Bill collectors are taught to cope with such emotive dissonance by using cognitive appraisals that help them become emotionally detached from debtors and by releasing unpleasant feelings without communicating these emotions to debtors.

Purpose
The purpose of this study is to explore consumer reviews with robotics based on the five dimensions for evaluating user experiences (i.e. embodiment, emotion, human-oriented perception, feeling of security and co-experience), as derived from research in human-robot interactions (HRI).


Design/methodology/approach
The study first reviews the five dimensions for evaluating user experiences in HRI and then analyzes user experiences with robotics at four hotels (i.e. Yotel New York, Aloft Cupertino, Henn-na Hotel Japan and Marriott Residence Inn LAX) based on reviews on TripAdvisor, Agoda, Yelp and Booking.com.


Findings
The findings highlight the influence of robotic embodiment and human-oriented perceptions on consumer experiences. The findings also suggest that users and robots can co-create novel experiences, with some guests even proactively seeking new opportunities to interact and communicate with robots to develop a certain level of “relationship” with them.


Research limitations/implications
An understanding of user experiences from HRIs can inform future hospitality and tourism research and management.


Practical implications
This study contributes to hospitality and tourism management by highlighting current practices with robotics to suggest areas of improvements for enhancing future consumer experiences.


Social implications
Consumer experiences will change rapidly as hospitality and tourism management deploys robotics in the future.


Originality/value
This is one of the early studies in the field to explore consumer experiences with robotics based on the five dimensions for evaluating user experiences from research in HRI. In doing so, this study provides a number of theoretical and managerial implications relevant for hospitality and tourism research and practice.

To review research and theory regarding the neurobehavioral correlates and outcomes of single-suture, or isolated, craniosynostosis in children.


METHODS
A critical review of 17 studies of the hypothesized association between isolated craniosynostosis and neurodevelopment.


RESULTS
Isolated craniosynostosis is associated with a three- to fivefold increase in risk for cognitive deficits or learning/language disabilities. The causal basis for this association is unclear. No particular calvarial suture (sagittal, metopic, left or right unilateral coronal) has been associated with higher risk of problems. There is little evidence from quasi-experimental studies that cranioplastic surgery prevents or reduces risk of neurobehavioral impairment.


CONCLUSIONS
Future studies would benefit from larger samples and larger control groups; measures of specific neuropsychological functions (in addition to global cognition); analyses of neuropsychological status in relation to the severity and cortical impact of synostosis; and an examination of interactions between synostosis and social/family risk factors on neurodevelopment. Routine neurodevelopmental screening of young children with isolated craniosynostosis is recommended.","[{'authorId': '2706570', 'name': 'M. Speltz'}, {'authorId': '1398706984', 'name': 'K.

This was a cross-sectional, correlational design with 519 (266 boys and 253 girls) early adolescents.


RESULTS
PPD had a significant direct effect on IA in boys but not in girls. Significant indirect effects of PPD on IA were evidenced via anxiety-depression and aggression for boys and via family function and aggression for girls.


PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS
Findings suggest that tailored interventions for the prevention of IA should consider gender.","[{'authorId': '7940182', 'name': 'M.

A systematic review was completed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines with the aim of exploring associations between emotions and eating behaviour in a population affected by obesity and binge eating disorder (BED). A comprehensive literature search of four electronic databases (2004–2014) yielded 15 studies for inclusion. Included studies performed poorly on data quality analysis with respect to controlling for confounding variables, and sample size. Included papers largely focused on negative emotions as antecedents of BE; depression was consistently associated with a BED‐obese classification and BE. Negative mood, sadness, tension and instability of emotions were found to be antecedents of BE in an adult BED‐obese sample. However, findings were mixed regarding the role of stress, anger and positive emotions within the BED‐obese population. Recommendations are presented for the identification of BED, and ecologically valid experimental designs that further understanding of the complex and varied emotions that associate with BE. The implications of these and other limitations for both researchers and practitioners are discussed.

This study analyzed the mobile app data in a non-clinical sample of 39 adults participating in a larger randomized controlled trial, with participants randomized to an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) mobile app that tailors skill coaching based on in-the-moment variables (n = 17) or an app that provides randomly selected skill coaching (n = 22). Data were collected before and after each ACT skill coaching session on proximal outcome (depression, anxiety, and engagement in meaningful activity) and ACT process variables. Multilevel models indicated significant immediate improvements on average following ACT skill coaching sessions on all proximal outcome and ACT process variables, although with relatively small effects ranging between 0.17 and 0.27 SD units change. Larger immediate pre-to-post effects from ACT coaching sessions were found for anxiety, experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion in the tailored app versus random app condition. Overall, results suggest that an ACT app can have immediate, in-the-moment effects on psychological functioning, which may be enhanced by tailoring skills to current context.","[{'authorId': '144228157', 'name': 'Michael E.

56c062c586fa7e6f1f3cd84068a64cfd3a76fe15,"The concept of “stress” was applied to biological and social systems in the first half of this century because it appeared to provide an explanation for the apparently “non-specific” effects of biologic agents, and for the occurrence of illness as a part of the response of people to their social environment. Evidence subsequently accumulated has confirmed that a large proportion of the manifestations of disease are produced by reaction of the host and not directly by the “causal agents” of disease, and that the components of the host's reactions are not in themselves “specific” to any given “causal agent”; it has confirmed that reactions of people to other people, or to the social environment may influence any physiological process or any disease; but it has also indicated that the concept of “stress” does not provide an adequate explanation for these phenomena. Living organisms are highly ordered and complex biological organizations that maintain themselves precariously over a limited period of time by the interchange of energy and information with the environment. Their reactions to the environment are complex and highly ordered, are based upon information, and are communicative and “logical” in nature. Although the components are “not specific,” the reactions themselves may be highly specific to the stimulus that initiates them. These reactions are not random but are “directed” (apparently “purposeful”) and tend to preserve the integrity of the organism, and the integrity of its relation to its social group and to its environment. The concept of “stress,” which was derived partly from popular usage, and based upon 18th and 19th century mechanical models of “force,” “counterforce,” and “distortion,” does not provide a meaningful scientific description of organism-environment relationships. These are better described by other concepts. The “stress concept” was heuristically valuable in the past, but it is no longer necessary, and it is in some ways hampering at the present.","[{'authorId': '1990556', 'name': 'L.

We judged it unlikely that patient preferences were driving the decision to obtain stress testing. Methods and Results— The Chest Pain Choice trial was a prospective randomized evaluation involving 204 patients who were randomized to a decision aid or usual care and were followed for 30 days. The decision aid included a 100-person pictograph depicting the pretest probability of acute coronary syndrome and available management options (observation unit admission and stress testing or 24–72 hours outpatient follow-up). The primary outcome was patient knowledge measured by an immediate postvisit survey. Additional outcomes included patient engagement in decision making and the proportion of patients who decided to undergo observation unit admission and cardiac stress testing. Compared with usual care patients (n=103), decision aid patients (n=101) had significantly greater knowledge (3.6 versus 3.0 questions correct; mean difference, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.34–1.0), were more engaged in decision making as indicated by higher OPTION (observing patient involvement) scores (26.6 versus 7.0; mean difference, 19.6; 95% CI, 1.6–21.6), and decided less frequently to be admitted to the observation unit for stress testing (58% versus 77%; absolute difference, 19%; 95% CI, 6%–31%). There were no major adverse cardiac events after discharge in either group. Conclusions— Use of a decision aid in patients with chest pain increased knowledge and engagement in decision making and decreased the rate of observation unit admission for stress testing.

56fe5aeeff8b3d577ec5be1b8ba11599d44d4007,"AbstractOne of the most indispensable and important elements of education is teachers whose personality closely affects training and education. In this context, this study examined the effects of teachers' personality traits on their emotional exhaustion in a mediating model which centers around emotional labor. Data were obtained from 798 teachers working in primary and high schools in Ankara and Eskisehir. According to the findings of hierarchical regression analysis, neuroticism and extraversion were found to significantly affect emotional exhaustion whereas other dimensions of personality were not found to be predictive of emotional exhaustion. In general, personality traits were found to predict emotional labor and all dimensions of emotional labor were found to affect emotional exhaustion. Further, fi ndings of mediation analysis showed that surface acting was the only mediator in the relation between neuroticism and emotional exhaustion.Key WordsPersonality, The Big Five Personality, Emotional Exhaustion, Emotional Labor.Problems at workplace affect not only personal life but also work life in a negative way and cause a general unhappiness. This kind of long term unhappiness experienced individually and called as burnout produces negative results both for employees and organizations. Thus the term ""burnout"" has become an important focus of behavioral investigations. Several personal and organizational factors may determine the level of burnout. In this respect, personality is thought to be one of these factors (Barrick & Mount, 2005; Judge, Woolf, & Hurst, 2009). Hence personality, indicating personal emotions and behaviors (Connor-Smith & Flashbart, 2007), significantly influences employee happiness or unhappiness in general.Considering the fact that burnout is a general state of exhaustion especially for frontline occupations that require face to face interactions and emotional processes (Maslach & Jackson, 1981), it is in fact a serious danger for teachers. Yet, teachers, regardless of their own emotional state, are supposed to listen to students' problems, give them advice, behave warmly towards students, stay calm even in interactions with problem students or attract the attention of students to provide effective learning. All these facts may cause a general exhaustion in teachers.In the relationship between personality and burn-out, other variables such as emotional labor may have a mediating role (Judge et al., 2009). A criti- cal component in various occupations that require interpersonal contact; emotional labor is the act of expressing anticipated emotions during service interactions (Ashforth & Humprey, 1993). Emotional labor is not only affected by personality but it affects the level of burnout itself (Hochschild, 1983; Sutton & Wheatly, 2003; Wharton, 1999).On the basis of these approaches, effects of teachers' personality on their burnout and the mediating role of emotional labor in this relationship were examined in the current study. Variables of personality and emotional labor were investigated along with all their sub-dimensions. However, only the emotional exhaustion of burnout dimension was explored since it is thought to be the core component and the most obvious symptom of burnout (Maslach, Schaufeli, & Leiter, 2001). Although there are a great number of studies on different occupations demonstrating the relations between personality and emotional exhaustion (Kokkinos, 2007; Lopez, Bolano, & Narino, 2010), personality and emotional labor (Austin, Dore, & O'Donovan, 2007; Bono & Vey, 2007) and, emotional labor and burnout dimensions (Pugliesi, 1999; Zhang & Zhu, 2008), comprehensive studies examining all the variables together seem to be inadequate (Kiffin-Peterson, Jordon, & Souter, 2010). Thus, it is thought that the integrated approach of this study may contribute to the literature.Conceptual FrameworkEmotional Exhaustion: Burnout can be defined as the loss of power and energy because of failure, attrition and overload, or the depletion of individuals internal resources as a result of irretrievable demands (Freudenberger, 1974). …","[{'authorId': '4106634', 'name': 'H.

Recent debate has focused on whether reductions in HRV in major depressive disorder (MDD) are a consequence of the disorder or a consequence of pharmacotherapy. Here we report on the impact of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-pharmacological intervention, vs. sertraline to further investigate this issue. The employed design was a double-blind, randomized, factorial, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred and eighteen moderate-to-severe, medication-free, low-cardiovascular risk depressed patients were recruited for this study and allocated to either active/sham tDCS (10 consecutive sessions plus two extra sessions every other week) or placebo/sertraline (50 mg/d) for 6 wk. Patients were age and gender-matched to healthy controls from a concurrent cohort study [the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil)]. The impact of disorder, treatment and clinical response on HRV (root mean square of successive differences and high frequency) was examined. Our findings confirmed that patients displayed decreased HRV relative to controls. Furthermore, HRV scores did not change following treatment with either a non-pharmacological (tDCS) or pharmacological (sertraline) intervention, nor did HRV increase with clinical response to treatment. Based on these findings, we discuss whether reduced HRV is a trait-marker for MDD, which may predispose patients to a host of conditions and disease even after response to treatment.

We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.","[{'authorId': '50474058', 'name': 'Ming-Hui Huang'}, {'authorId': '1813939', 'name': 'R.

However, little attention has been paid to the regulation of group-based emotions, which are based on individuals’ self-categorization as a group member and occur in response to situations perceived as relevant for that group. We propose a model for examining group-based emotion regulation that integrates intergroup emotions theory and the process model of emotion regulation. This synergy expands intergroup emotion theory by facilitating further investigation of different goals (i.e., hedonic or instrumental) and strategies (e.g., situation selection and modification strategies) used to regulate group-based emotions. It also expands emotion regulation research by emphasizing the role of self-categorization (e.g., as an individual or a group member) in the emotional process. Finally, we discuss the promise of this theoretical synergy and suggest several directions for future research on group-based emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '40484649', 'name': 'Amit Goldenberg'}, {'authorId': '1722823', 'name': 'E.

The psychometric properties of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) as well as its prospective relationships with symptoms of depression and anxiety were studied in an adult general population sample. The results showed that the CERQ had good factorial validity and high reliabilities, with Cronbach's αs ranging between .75 and .87. In addition, the cognitive emotion regulation strategies accounted for considerable amounts of variance in emotional problems and strong relationships were found between the cognitive strategies self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing and positive reappraisal (inversely) and symptoms of depression and anxiety, both at first measurement and at follow-up. The CERQ might therefore be considered a valuable and reliable tool in the study of individual risk and protective factors associated with emotional problems, while providing us with important targets for intervention.","[{'authorId': '5361370', 'name': 'N.

However, very little research has been conducted to understand how that perception forms and changes over time. The current work presents and tests an anchoring and adjustment-based theoretical model of the determinants of system-specific perceived ease of use. The model proposes control (internal and external--conceptualized as computer self-efficacy and facilitating conditions, respectively), intrinsic motivation (conceptualized as computer playfulness), and emotion (conceptualized as computer anxiety) as anchors that determine early perceptions about the ease of use of a new system. With increasing experience, it is expected that system-specific perceived ease of use, while still anchored to the general beliefs regarding computers and computer use, will adjust to reflect objective usability, perceptions of external control specific to the new system environment, and system-specific perceived enjoyment. The proposed model was tested in three different organizations among 246 employees using three measurements taken over a three-month period. The proposed model was strongly supported at all points of measurement, and explained up to 60% of the variance in system-specific perceived ease of use, which is twice as much as our current understanding.

This study examined (1) the relationship of fear of falling to depression, anxiety, activity level, and activity restriction and (2) whether depression or anxiety predicted fear of falling, activity level, activity restriction, or changes in activity level.


METHOD
We administered the Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly; the Geriatric Depression Scale-30; and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, IVR Version, during a one-time visit to 99 community-dwelling adults ≥55 yr old.


RESULTS
We found significant relationships between (1) fear of falling and depression, anxiety, and activity level; (2) depression and anxiety; and (3) activity restriction and depression. Activity level was negatively correlated with activity restriction, fear of falling, depression, and anxiety. Anxiety predicted both fear of falling and activity level. Both anxiety and depression predicted activity restriction because of fear of falling and for other reasons.


CONCLUSION
Occupational therapy practitioners should consider screening their older adult clientele for fear of falling, anxiety, and depression because these states may lead to fall risk and activity restriction.","[{'authorId': '33587046', 'name': 'J.

Common elements treatments may be well-suited to address the complex implementation and treatment challenges that characterize these settings. This study assessed the preliminary effect of implementing a common elements therapy on clinician treatment delivery and patient (N = 616) symptom outcomes in two residential ED programs. Method: The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders was adapted to address ED and co-occurring psychopathology and implemented across sites. Therapists’ treatment fidelity was rated independently to assess implementation success. Additionally, longitudinal (pre-post) design compared treatment outcomes among patients treated before and after implementation. Patient outcomes included ED and depressive symptoms, experiential avoidance, anxiety sensitivity, and mindfulness. Results: Following training and implementation, clinicians demonstrated adequate to good fidelity. Relative to pre-implementation, post-implementation patients showed significantly greater improvements in experiential avoidance, anxiety sensitivity, and mindfulness at discharge (ps ≤ .04) Relative to patients who were treated during the pre-implementation phase, patients in the post-implementation phase experienced more favorable outcomes on ED symptom severity, depression, mindfulness, and anxiety sensitivity at 6-month-follow-up (ps ≤ .001). A similar result was observed for experiential avoidance, yet this interaction effect was no longer statistically significant (p = .10) when the time x length of stay effect/covariate was added to the model. Conclusions: Preliminary pilot data support the feasibility of implementing transdiagnostic common elements therapy in residential ED treatment, and suggest that implementation may benefit transdiagnostic outcomes for patients. Clinical or methodological significance of this article: Limited data are available to guide evidence-based residential treatment for eating disorders. This study represents a unique effort to adapt, implement, and test an evidence-based therapy protocol across a large private network of intensive eating disorder treatment programs.","[{'authorId': '1398428297', 'name': 'H.

Evidence is reviewed for 3 emotion-congruency frameworks, each summarizing a different route to emotional processing: the traditional approach, a moderation approach, and a mediation approach. Most of the traditional literature includes studies that examine the effects of moods and traits on emotional processing separately; these studies have yielded some inconsistent findings. The moderation and mediation approaches offer potential solutions to the lack of consistency obtained in the traditional literature by allowing for the combined effects of personality traits and mood states on the processing of emotional information. The moderation approach suggests that mood states interact with individual differences in emotion-relevant personality traits to influence emotion-congruent processing. The mediation approach suggests that personality traits predispose individuals to certain mood states, which then influence emotional processing. These approaches provide a framework for understanding the literature and a starting point for future research on emotion-congruent processing.","[{'authorId': '5512375', 'name': 'Cheryl L.

To examine whether the impact of mistreatment by patients on nurses' burnout can be exacerbated or attenuated depending on emotion-regulation strategies, and to explore the moderating role of supervisor support in the relationship between mistreatment and deep acting.


BACKGROUND
Aggression from patients is known to contribute significantly to nurse burnout. To date, the moderating role of emotion regulation strategies in the mistreatment-outcomes relationship has seldom been considered.


METHODS
The sample consisted of 105 nurses who were working while studying for their Master's degree. Data were collected using self-reported questionnaires. The research hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression analyses.


RESULTS
Mistreatment and surface acting significantly contributed to nurse burnout. Deep acting had a buffering effect on the relationship between mistreatment and depersonalisation. The results also indicate that supervisor support was negatively associated with surface acting and may increase deep acting in response to mistreatment.


CONCLUSION
The use of an effective strategy for regulating emotions and supervisor support can protect nurses from the depletion of emotional resources.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
By introducing emotion-regulation skills training and by encouraging the availability of support from supervisors, health-care organisations can help nurses better cope with emotionally charged interactions.","[{'authorId': '14436961', 'name': 'Ruhama Goussinsky'}, {'authorId': '16078185', 'name': 'Yael Livne'}]",40.0,,54.0,Coping with interpersonal mistreatment: the role of emotion regulation strategies and supervisor support.,2016.0

Women with full- or sub-threshold variants of either binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa were randomly assigned to individually supported self-monitoring using adapted DBT diary cards (DC) or group-based DBT, each 15 sessions over 16 weeks. DC sessions focused on problem-solving diary card completion issues, praising diary card completion, and supporting nonjudgmental awareness of eating-related habits and urges, but not formally teaching DBT skills. Group-based DBT included eating mindfulness, progressing through graded exposure; mindfulness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills; and coaching calls between sessions. Both treatments evidenced large and significant improvements in binge eating, bulimic symptoms, and interoceptive awareness. For group-based DBT, ineffectiveness, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, and perfectionism also decreased significantly, with medium to large effect sizes. For DC, results were not significant but large in effect size for body dissatisfaction and medium in effect size for ineffectiveness and drive for thinness. Retention for both treatments was higher than recent trends for eating disorder treatment in fee-for-service practice and for similar clinic settings, but favored DC, with the greater attrition of group-based DBT primarily attributed to its more intensive and time-consuming nature, and dropout overall associated with less pretreatment impairment and greater interoceptive awareness. This preliminary investigation suggests that with both abbreviated DBT-based treatments, substantial improvement in core binge eating symptoms is possible, enhancing potential avenues for implementation beyond more time-intensive DBT.","[{'authorId': '40639801', 'name': 'Angela S Klein'}, {'authorId': '80448098', 'name': 'J.

The present study is part of a prospective micro-longitudinal research project and reports on the association between SLC6A4 methylation and socio-emotional stress response in very preterm (VPT) and full-term (FT) infants.


MATERIALS & METHODS
SLC6A4 methylation was assessed at birth and discharge in 32 VPT infants, and at birth in 27 FT infants. Socio-emotional stress response (i.e., negative emotionality) was assessed at 3 months (corrected age).


RESULTS
Negative emotionality was higher in VPTs compared with FT counterpart. In VPT infants only, stress response was associated with SLC6A4 methylation status at discharge, which was predictive of greater negative emotionality.

A discipline such as yoga offered during school may increase emotion regulation, but research in this area is lacking. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of a yoga intervention on the emotion regulation of high school students as compared to physical education (PE). In addition, the potential mediating effects of mindful attention, self-compassion, and body awareness on the relationship between yoga and emotion regulation were examined. High school students were randomized to participate in a 16-week yoga intervention (n = 19) or regular PE (n = 18). Pre-post data analyses revealed that emotion regulation increased significantly in the yoga group as compared to the PE group (F (1,32) = 7.50, p = .01, and eta2 = .19). No significant relationship was discovered between the changes in emotion regulation and the proposed mediating variables. Preliminary results suggest that yoga increases emotion regulation capacities of middle adolescents and provides benefits beyond that of PE alone.","[{'authorId': '10293724', 'name': 'L.

The goal of this study was to predict the onset of mood and anxiety disorders from parent-reported emotional and behavioral problems in childhood across a 14-year period from childhood into young adulthood.


METHOD
In 1983, parent reports of behavioral and emotional problems were obtained with the Child Behavior Checklist for children and adolescents 4-16 years of age from the Dutch general population. At follow-up 14 years later, lifetime mood and anxiety diagnoses were obtained by a standardized DSM-IV interview for 1,580 subjects. Cox proportional hazards models were used to predict the incidence of mood and anxiety disorders from childhood problems and demographic covariates.


RESULTS
Mood disorders were significantly predicted by high scores on the anxious/depressed scale and on the internalizing composite (withdrawn, somatic complaints, and anxious/depressed). Anxiety disorders were significantly predicted by the social problems scale and the externalizing composite (delinquent behavior and aggressive behavior). Anxiety disorders predominantly started in childhood and early adolescence, whereas the incidence of mood disorders increased sharply in adolescence and young adulthood.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest different developmental pathways for mood and anxiety disorders. The predictions based on problem behavior remained stable during the 14-year period across adolescence and young adulthood. The results therefore underline the importance of early intervention and prevention of behavioral and emotional problems in childhood.","[{'authorId': '2083405', 'name': 'Sabine J.

This study investigates the relationship between altered skull morphology and brain morphology in premature fusion of the cranial sagittal suture (isolated sagittal synostosis; ISS), a condition associated with dysmorphology of both neurocranium and brain. Although the skull displays a more normal shape following reconstructive cranial vault surgery, effects of this surgery on the brain have not been investigated. Landmark coordinate data were collected from three‐dimensional magnetic resonance imaging reconstructions of the brain in a sample of ISS patients and an age‐matched unaffected cohort. These data were analysed using Euclidean distance matrix analysis (EDMA). Results show that the brain in ISS is dysmorphic preoperatively, displaying a posteriorly directed neural expansion that does not ‘worsen’ with growth. Postoperatively, the brain in ISS displays a more globular shape overall as compared with the preoperative morphology, but differs from normal in its subcortical morphology. These results show that the ISS brain is altered following neurocranial surgery, but does not more closely approximate that of unaffected individuals. This suggests that although the brain is affected by manipulation of the skull, it retains a growth pattern that is, at least in part, independent of the skull.","[{'authorId': '4952216', 'name': 'Kristina Aldridge'}, {'authorId': '2168248250', 'name': 'A.

High stress and burnout have the potential to negatively impact work performance and patient care, including medication errors, suboptimal care, clinical errors, and patient dissatisfaction. Objective This study aimed to determine the perceived stress among medical residents in Jordanian hospitals and its associated risk factors. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among residents in Jordanian hospitals. A cluster sample of 5 hospitals with residency programs was selected from different health sectors. All residents who were working in the selected hospitals were invited to participate in this study, during the period from April to July 2017. A total of 555 residents agreed to participate in this study, giving a response rate of 84%. The perceived stress scale (PSS) was used for assessment. Results A total of 398 male and 157 female residents were included in this study. The mean PSS score in this study was 21.6; 73% (405/555) of the residents had moderate level of stress, and 18% (100/555) had high level of stress. About 6.7% (37/555) of the residents had hypertension, 2.7% (15/555) had diabetes, 3.2% (18/555) had heart disease, and 8.5% (47/555) were anemic. 233 (42%) respondents complained of back pain, and 161 (29%) of the respondents complained of insomnia. Stress was associated with higher workload, sleep deprivation, and dissatisfaction in the relationship with colleagues, with income, and with the program. In multivariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with stress: female gender, dissatisfaction with working environment, and facing work-related, academic, and family stressors.

5b86447eabca449446e7c62f43ba98a90ea878d0,"This article provides a review of recent developments in two topical areas of research in contemporary organizational behavior: diversity and emotions. In the section called “Diversity,” we trace the history of diversity research, explore the definitions and paradigms used in treatments of diversity, and signal new areas of interest. We conclude that organizational behavior in the 21st century is evolving to embrace a more eclectic and holistic view of humans at work. In the section called “Emotions,” we turn our attention to recent developments in the study of emotions in organizations. We identify four major topics: mood theory, emotional labor, affective events theory (AET), and emotional intelligence, and argue that developments in the four domains have significant implications for organizational research, and the progression of the study of organizational behavior. As with the study of diversity, the topic of emotions in the workplace is shaping up as one of the principal areas of development in management thought and practice for the next decade. Finally, we discuss in our conclusion how these two areas are being conceptually integrated, and the implications for management scholarship and research in the contemporary world.","[{'authorId': '70294020', 'name': 'N.

Lazarus's cognitive-phenomenological analysis of psychological stress provides the theoreticalframework. Information about recently experienced stressful encounters was elicited through monthly interviews and self-report questionnaires completed between interviews. At the end of each interview and questionnaire, the participant indicated on a 68-item Ways of Coping checklist those coping thoughts and actions used in the specific encounter. A mean of 13.3 episodes was reported by each participant. Two functions of coping, problem-focused and emotion-focused, are analyzed with separate measures. Both problemand emotion-focused coping were used in 98% of the 1,332 episodes, emphasizing that coping conceptualized in either defensive or problem-solving terms is incomplete-both functions are usually involved. Intraindividual analyses show that people are more variable than consistent in their coping patterns. The context of an event, who is involved, how it is appraised, age, and gender are examined as potential influences on coping. Context and how the event is appraised are the most potent factors. Work contexts favor problem-focused coping, and health contexts favor emotionfocused coping. Situations in which the person thinks something constructive can be done or that are appraised as requiring more information favor problem-focused coping, whereas those having to be acceptedfavor emotion-focused coping. There are no effects associated with age, and gender differences emerge only in problem-focused coping: Men use more problem-focused coping than women at work and in situations having to be accepted and requiring more information. Contrary to the cultural stereotype, there are no gender differences in emotionfocused coping.","[{'authorId': '7275762', 'name': 'S. Folkman'}, {'authorId': '5628684', 'name': 'R.

5bdcfa15ad59ca8d657dc938d8e63909165e727e,"Gray's Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory postulates two distinct neurophysiological systems that underlie thoughts, emotions, and behavior: the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behavioral Approach System (BAS). Preliminary research suggests that both systems may play relevant roles in the adjustment of individuals with chronic pain. However, there is a lack of research on the extent to which emotional regulation (i.e., cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) mediates the associations between BIS and BAS activation and emotional responses in individuals with chronic pain. The aim of this study was to test a model of the associations between the BIS and BAS, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, and positive and negative affect in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain. In total, 516 participants were interviewed. Structural Equation Modeling was used to estimate the associations between variables. The empirical model showed a good fit to the data (χ2/df = 1.95; RMSEA = 0.04; GFI = 0.99; AGFI = 0.98; CFI = 0.99). The hypothesized model received partial support. The BIS was associated with cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression; cognitive reappraisal was associated with negative and positive affect; expressive suppression was positively associated with affect; and the BAS was not associated with the emotional regulation strategies assessed. However, the BIS and BAS were both directly associated with negative and positive affect. The results suggest that individuals with chronic pain with higher BIS activation appear to use greater expressive suppression. Cognitive reappraisal strongly mediated the BIS-negative affect association. The results also suggest that BAS activation may have a weak or inconsistent association with emotional regulation approaches in individuals with chronic pain. These data provide new and relevant information on the potential role of the BIS and BAS as predictors of psychological functioning in individuals with chronic pain. They suggest that the BIS-BAS model of chronic pain may need to be modified to take into account the potential negative effects of BAS activation. The findings suggest that treatments for emotional regulation could potentially reduce the negative impact of chronic pain via BIS.","[{'authorId': '1405206039', 'name': 'E.

5be0d5a086e2d333638709cbf57833b5d9531bea,"We examined dynamic infant–parent affect coupling using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF). The sample included 20 infants whose older siblings had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD-sibs) and 18 infants with comparison siblings (COMP-sibs). A series of mixed effects bivariate autoregressive models was used to represent the self-regulation and interactive dynamics of infants and parents during the FFSF. Significant bidirectional affective coupling was found between infants and parents, with infant-to-parent coupling being more prominent than parent-to-infant coupling. Further analysis of within-dyad dynamics revealed ongoing changes in concurrent infant–parent linkages both within and between different FFSF episodes. The importance of considering both inter-and intradyad differences is discussed. a dyad are intertwined, they act and react to each other's behaviors and emotions. The cascading effects of such interactions can often lead to highly unpredictable outcomes, triggered both by the dynamics inherent to each dyadic member, as well as the interde-pendencies between the past histories and the future responses of the two dyad members. Likewise, subtle between-dyad differences can manifest themselves in whether and how dyad members are "" coupled "" to one another over time. Dynamic systems-based concepts have played a prominent role in contemporary studies of dyadic relationships (e. Larsen's (2000) homeostatic model of mood regulation , for instance, conceptualizes mood regulation as an ongoing process during which an individual attempts to minimize the discrepancies between his or her current mood states and an individualized set point. Chow, Ram, Boker, Fujita, and Clore (2005) formulated this theoretical model of a "" mood thermostat "" as a differential equation whose dynamics are governed by two key parameters: a frequency parameter that dictates how rapidly the system shows cyclic fluctuations (i.e., affect lability), and a damping parameter that governs how promptly the system returns to (or diverges from) its set point (i.e., affect adaptivity) after a perturbation. The damped thermostat model provides one possible way of testing dynamic notions of mood regulation within the context of a differential equation model. In instances involving dyadic data, complication arises because the affective equilibrium of the dyad is defined jointly by the emotional ebbs and flows of the two dyad members. Thus, a bivariate model is needed to accommodate both the self-regulation as well as the interactive dynamics of the dyad members as two "" coupled thermostats.

Difficulties in the areas of emotion regulation and empathy were found in prior studies. Mother-child attachment is important in the development of emotion regulation and empathy. We aimed to examine the relation emotional regulation and empathy skills in children with ADHD and emotion regulation and attachment properties in their mothers and to compare with healthy controls. Methods: The study group consisted of 61 children (8-12 years old) diagnosed with ADHD. The control group (87 children) comprised patients of other clinics at hospital and was matched for gender and age to the ADHD patients. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) was used to diagnose ADHD and allowed comorbidities. We evaluated disorder severity at the time of assessment using the DuPaul Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale. All patients were treatment-naive. Emotional Regulation Checklist (ERC) and KA-SI empathy scale were used to examine children emotional regulation and empathy. Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to indicate maternal emotional dysregulation status and Experiences in Close Relationship Scale-II was used to evaluate attachment properties in mothers. Results: Children with ADHD had statistical significant lower scores in the areas of affective empathy, cognitive empathy, total empathy score and emotion regulation and cases had statistical significant higher scores in emotion lability. Mothers of children with ADHD had higher scores in anxious and avoidant attachment styles and all subscales of DERS. The correlation between, ADHD symptoms, KA-SI Empathy, ERC, Attachment Scale, and DERS was evaluated by Pearsons correlation analysis. Negative correlation was found between both attention deficit and hyperactivity scores of Du Paul scale and affective, cognitive empathy scores of KA-SI Emphatic Tendency Scale and emotion regulation scores of ERC; a positive correlation was determined between attention deficit and hyperactivity scores of Du Paul scale, mothers anxious and avoidant attachment and DERS total scores, and emotional lability scores of ERC. Discussion: Mother-child attachment and maternal emotion regulation skills have important roles in the emotion regulation and empathy skills of children. Better understanding of neuropsychologic development process of attachment, empathy and emotion regulation skills and their relations with each other may contribute to the treatment of children with ADHD.","[{'authorId': '6303982', 'name': 'G.

5c15d6234ac87e69a1cf42c3eba92f566ee4ce30,"Background The global shortage of mental health workers has prompted the utilization of technological advancements, such as chatbots, to meet the needs of people with mental health conditions. Chatbots are systems that are able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual language. While numerous studies have assessed the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots in mental health, no reviews have pooled the results of those studies. Objective This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots to improve mental health through summarizing and pooling the results of previous studies. Methods A systematic review was carried out to achieve this objective. The search sources were 7 bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO), the search engine “Google Scholar,” and backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using narrative and statistical methods, as appropriate. Results Of 1048 citations retrieved, we identified 12 studies examining the effect of using chatbots on 8 outcomes. Weak evidence demonstrated that chatbots were effective in improving depression, distress, stress, and acrophobia. In contrast, according to similar evidence, there was no statistically significant effect of using chatbots on subjective psychological wellbeing. Results were conflicting regarding the effect of chatbots on the severity of anxiety and positive and negative affect. Only two studies assessed the safety of chatbots and concluded that they are safe in mental health, as no adverse events or harms were reported. Conclusions Chatbots have the potential to improve mental health. However, the evidence in this review was not sufficient to definitely conclude this due to lack of evidence that their effect is clinically important, a lack of studies assessing each outcome, high risk of bias in those studies, and conflicting results for some outcomes. Further studies are required to draw solid conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of chatbots.

5c96a8bfd5d4bb610b80ea1d08d602a2f4a10cf2,"P values and hypothesis testing methods are frequently misused in clinical research. Much of this misuse appears to be owing to the widespread, mistaken belief that they provide simple, reliable, and objective triage tools for separating the true and important from the untrue or unimportant. The primary focus in interpreting therapeutic clinical research data should be on the treatment (""oomph"") effect, a metaphorical force that moves patients given an effective treatment to a different clinical state relative to their control counterparts. This effect is assessed using 2 complementary types of statistical measures calculated from the data, namely, effect magnitude or size and precision of the effect size. In a randomized trial, effect size is often summarized using constructs, such as odds ratios, hazard ratios, relative risks, or adverse event rate differences. How large a treatment effect has to be to be consequential is a matter for clinical judgment. The precision of the effect size (conceptually related to the amount of spread in the data) is usually addressed with confidence intervals. P values (significance tests) were first proposed as an informal heuristic to help assess how ""unexpected"" the observed effect size was if the true state of nature was no effect or no difference. Hypothesis testing was a modification of the significance test approach that envisioned controlling the false-positive rate of study results over many (hypothetical) repetitions of the experiment of interest. Both can be helpful but, by themselves, provide only a tunnel vision perspective on study results that ignores the clinical effects the study was conducted to measure.","[{'authorId': '144264746', 'name': 'D.

Sampling and Methods: A total of 46 dyads (19 mothers with an anxiety disorder, 27 controls) were analyzed for associations between interactive repair and infant cortisol reactivity during the Face-to-Face-Still-Face paradigm 3-4 months postpartum. Missing cortisol values (n = 16) were imputed. Analyses were conducted on both the original and the pooled imputed data. Results: Interactive repair during the reunion episode was associated with infant cortisol reactivity (original data: p < 0.01; pooled data: p < 0.01) but not maternal anxiety disorder (p > 0.23). Additional stepwise regression analyses found that latency to repair during play (p < 0.01), an interaction between distress during the first trimester of pregnancy and latency to repair during reunion (p < 0.01) and infant self-comforting behaviors during the reunion episode (p = 0.04) made independent contributions to cortisol reactivity in the final regression model. Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating that interactive repair is related to infant psychobiological stress reactivity. The lack of a relation to maternal anxiety disorder may be due to the small sample size. However, this result emphasizes that infants respond to what they experience and not to the maternal diagnostic category.","[{'authorId': '8296705', 'name': 'Mitho Müller'}, {'authorId': '6352389', 'name': 'A.

Nevertheless, there is little evidence from cross-cultural and/or cross-country studies of the simultaneous relationship between these psychological variables. The objective of this study was to address this lack of research, examining the associations between emotional intelligence, resilience and perceived stress in a cross-country context. A total sample of 696 undergraduate students from two universities in the United States and the Basque Country (an autonomous community in northern Spain) participated in the study. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the effects of emotional intelligence and resilience that may affect students’ perceived stress. The results revealed that emotional intelligence functions as a negative predictor of perceived stress through the mediating variable resilience for the American and Basque students. The findings suggest that university students with better emotional intelligence and resilience present lower perceived stress. Thus, improving emotional intelligence and resilience could prevent students from suffering perceived stress in higher education. Implications and directions for further research are discussed; in particular, it is highlighted that intervention programs that improve both EI and resilience could be helpful in reducing perceived stress.","[{'authorId': '35557209', 'name': 'Ainize Sarrionandia'}, {'authorId': '1405061872', 'name': 'Estibaliz Ramos-Díaz'}, {'authorId': '1422665004', 'name': 'Oihane Fernández-Lasarte'}]",68.0,,69.0,Resilience as a Mediator of Emotional Intelligence and Perceived Stress: A Cross-Country Study,2018.0

According to the research, one of the main psychological factors supposed to underlie in these difficulties is the lack or low levels of joint attention with the interaction partners. The use of robots in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interventions has received a lot of attention in the last years. Robots can achieve high levels of effectiveness in interacting with children with autism. This paper presents robots that play several important roles and benefits in the interaction of children with autism.

5d4348bdbbc6fac5f1ab4bd0344d5a74e682ff38,"Contemporary interest in emotion regulation promises to advance important new views of emotional development as well as offering applications to developmental psychopathology, but these potential contributions are contingent on developmentalists' attention to some basic definitional issues. This essay offers a perspective on these issues by considering how emotion regulation should be defined, the various components of the management of emotion, how emotion regulation strategies fit into the dynamics of social interaction, and how individual differences in emotion regulation should be conceptualized and measured. In the end, it seems clear that emotion regulation is a conceptual rubric for a remarkable range of developmental processes, each of which may have its own catalysts and control processes. Likewise, individual differences in emotion regulation skills likely have multifaceted origins and are also related in complex ways to the person's emotional goals and the immediate demands of the situation. Assessment approaches that focus on the dynamics of emotion are well suited to elucidating these complex developmental and individual differences. In sum, a challenging research agenda awaits those who enter this promising field of study.","[{'authorId': '2246294034', 'name': 'Ross A.

It is unclear, however, whether these humanoid robots (compared with human employees) will trigger positive or negative consequences for consumers and companies. Seven experimental studies reveal that consumers display compensatory responses when they interact with an HSR rather than a human employee (e.g., they favor purchasing status goods, seek social affiliation, and order and eat more food). The authors investigate the underlying process driving these effects, and they find that HSRs elicit greater consumer discomfort (i.e., eeriness and a threat to human identity), which in turn results in the enhancement of compensatory consumption. Moreover, this research identifies boundary conditions of the effects such that the compensatory responses that HSRs elicit are (1) mitigated when consumer-perceived social belongingness is high, (2) attenuated when food is perceived as more healthful, and (3) buffered when the robot is machinized (rather than anthropomorphized).","[{'authorId': '67304494', 'name': 'Martin Mende'}, {'authorId': '12569647', 'name': 'Maura L.

The systematic review and meta-analysis sought to estimate the associations between emotion regulation patterns (repression, suppression, experiential avoidance and cognitive reappraisal) and psychological distress among cancer survivors. Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria for systematic review, and seven studies focussing on suppression were included in the meta-analysis. The systematic review pointed to a marked variability in associations among the emotion regulation patterns and psychological distress. The three meta-regressions of the relationships between suppression and psychological distress found significant fixed- and random-effect sizes (except marginal significance of a random-effect model for partial correlation). Subgroup analysis showed no moderation effect of time since diagnosis or study quality, but a significant difference (fixed-effect model only, p = 0.005) was found between correlative studies and those controlling for confounders. The current study suggests that suppression is related to elevated levels of psychological distress among cancer survivors, although large inconsistencies exist among studies and publication bias could not be ruled out. Further studies with large samples and a consistent approach are thus required to evaluate the associations of emotion regulation patterns and psychological distress.","[{'authorId': '1402229696', 'name': 'S.

Three emotion-associated constructs, namely, emotion regulation, emotional labor strategies, and burnout were studied within a single framework. In particular, it was hypothesized that English as a foreign language teachers’ emotion regulation and emotional labor strategies influence teacher burnout. The results yielded via structural equation modeling substantiated the negative role of these constructs in burnout. The emotion regulation was measured via the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire developed by Gross and John. The scale comprises two subscales: cognitive reappraisal (an antecedent-focused factor aimed at changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact) and expressive suppression (a response-focused element targeted at inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings). Emotional labor strategies were assessed through the Teacher Emotional Labor Strategy Scale designed by Yin. This test consists of three parts: surface acting (which refers to strategy in which people hinder and cover their felt emotions or fake unfelt feeling for the aim of showing the appropriate emotions needed for their profession), deep acting (which refers to the kind of strategy in which individuals try to change their felt emotions with the aid of some cognitive techniques, such as distraction so as the appropriate emotion occurs), and natural acting (which refers to the instance when individuals simultaneously experience and present the appropriate emotion for their job). Burnout was measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory comprising three subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.","[{'authorId': '70043847', 'name': 'A.

In order to address this issue, 29 boys with ASD varying in age between 4 and 17 years, and 38 age-matched typically developing (TD) boys were studied regarding their preference among six colors: red, pink, yellow, brown, green, and blue, in clinical settings. When mean rank of preference was computed in each of the ASD and TD groups with regard to each color, it was found that boys with ASD were significantly less likely than TD boys to prefer yellow and more likely than TD boys to prefer green and brown colors. These results appear to be caused by hyper-sensation characteristic of ASD, due to which boys with this disorder perceive yellow as being sensory-overloading.","[{'authorId': '49906072', 'name': 'M.

The authors' purpose was to document the dysmorphology in metopic synostosis and define subtype gradations. Methods: Demographic and computed tomographic information was recorded. Three-dimensional computed tomographic renderings were created digitally. Craniometric analysis was conducted for endocranial bifrontal angle, interzygomaticofrontal suture and interdacryon distance, and angle of orbital aperture to the midline. Results: Thirty-five computed tomographic scans were analyzed: 25 affected infants (median age, 5 months) and 10 controls (median age, 6 months). The endocranial bifrontal angle ranged from 100 to 148 degrees in metopic patients and 134 to 160 degrees in controls. The metopic group was split into severe metopic (100 to 124 degrees) and moderate metopic (124 to 148 degrees) synostosis. The endocranial bifrontal angle was significantly different among severe metopic, moderate metopic, and control patients. Interzygomaticofrontal suture of the severe group was less than in both moderate (p = 0.0043) and control (p = 0.011) groups. Interdacryon distance was smaller in severe versus moderate (p = 0.0083) and control (p = 0.0002) groups. The orbital rim angle of the severe group was more acute than that in the moderate (p = 0.0106) and control (p = 0.0062) groups. Except for endocranial bifrontal angle, there was no difference between moderate metopic and control groups in any analysis. Conclusions: Metopic synostosis can be divided into two distinct severity indices. The severe group has significantly narrower orbitofrontal dimensions, whereas the moderate group does not differ from control. Characterization of trigonocephaly may shed light on the etiopathogenesis of disease.

To explore the correlates of diabetes-related distress (DD) with psychometrically valid assessments of emotional regulation in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Adults with diabetes (n = 298) were assessed for psychological issues possibly associated with diabetes and were further evaluated with measures of negative emotional experience (ER-Exp) and skill at regulating such experiences (ER-Skill) and measures of DD, perceived psychosocial stress, diabetes literacy, and diabetes self-care.


RESULTS
ER-Exp was directly related to DD, while ER-Skill was inversely related to DD. Together, these ER variables displayed a medium-size relationship (β = 0.45) with DD. Inclusion of variables related to diabetes self-care and perceived psychosocial stress was associated with only an 18% reduction (i.e., β = 0.45 to β = 0.38) in the strength of this relationship, while the magnitude of relationships between DD and perceived psychosocial stress (β = 0.15) and diabetes self-care (β = -0.09) was relatively small.


CONCLUSIONS
These data suggest that DD is meaningfully linked with negative emotionality, and skill at regulating such emotions, in adults with diabetes. This relationship appears to be stronger than that between DD and perceived psychological stress or diabetes self-care. If so, DD (and possibly A1C) may be improved in those with diabetes and difficulties with negative emotionality.","[{'authorId': '5484534', 'name': 'E.

5e83294c8617cbd4358a898144583979b0111ed4,"A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.","[{'authorId': '2057029', 'name': 'M.

This study aimed to adapt the Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ) to Turkish, and to investigate its psychometric properties.  METHOD: A total of 467 volunteers with a mean age of 26.63 years participated to the study. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted after preparing the Turkish version of the IERQ. The relationships between IERQ and other emotion regulation scales were investigated for criterion-related validity. In order to assess reliability, internal consistency coefficients were calculated and subsequently, testretest analyses were repeated on 50 students.  RESULTS: As in the original form the Turkish version of IERQ has a 4- factor structure, 'social modelling', 'soothing', 'enhancing positive affect' and 'perspective taking'. As expected, these factors were related to various emotion regulation strategies. Particularly the social modelling and soothing factors differed according to the level of difficulties in emotion regulation. These factors were found to be related to depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Furthermore, the Turkish version of the IERQ satisfied the conditions of reliability. The internal consistency coefficients of factors were between .81 and .89. Test-retest correlation coefficients were found to be strong.  CONCLUSION: This study showed that the Turkish version of IERQ is a reliable and valid scale for the Turkish population.

The research framework defined the meaning, models, and methods that successfully guided four waves of research to date on the nature and processes involved in human resilience. The applied framework emerged in response to urgent needs of children and families faced by adversity and those charged with helping them, resulting in guidelines for translating the unfolding but incomplete research evidence into action. The application of a resilience approach transformed practice in many fields concerned with promoting resilience in people at risk for problems, revolutionizing the mission, models, measures, and methods of practice to align with the emphasis on positive adaptation and strengths defining a resilience-based approach. Yet these interventions rarely translated back to inform and refine resilience theory in ways that would accelerate progress to promote resilience more effectively. The concluding section on translational synergy discusses the potential for a synthesis of basic and applied resilience frameworks as the next steps toward realizing the original objective and promise of resilience science.","[{'authorId': '4486636', 'name': 'A.

With divorce increasingly becoming a normal life event, societal changes are now challenging this idea as regards to current cohorts. We hypothesize that the relative strong feelings of loneliness among divorcees, compared with married people, has diminished over time. Using 1992, 2002, and 2012 data sets of 54–65-year-old people, we examine the impact of divorce on loneliness over 20 years. We compare those who are divorced or remarried to people married for the first time, and differentiate the supportiveness of the partnership. The results show that for both emotional and social loneliness, divorcees were lonelier than respondents in their first marriage; remarried divorces were socially lonelier than respondents in their first marriage. Respondents with a supportive partnership were less emotionally and socially lonely than respondents without a partnership or with a less supportive partnership. The main finding is that, compared with 1992, the divorcees are less socially lonely in 2002, with a smaller and non-significant further decrease in loneliness in 2012. This suggests that the social position of divorcees has been improved over the past two decades.","[{'authorId': '115482680', 'name': 'T. V. van Tilburg'}, {'authorId': '4617063', 'name': 'M.

The source consistency hypothesis predicted that an actor will receive consistent attributions across all three types of information. The differential information hypothesis predicted that different personality dimensions are used to differentiate the actors within each type of information. In a 3 X 6 multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) design, each judge rated a single actor/information combination on scales of social evaluation, intellectual evaluation, activity, potency, emotionality, and sociability. Photographs of actors were differentiated primarily in terms of positive social and intellectual evaluation; the speech of actors was differentiated primarily along an activity dimension; and the writing of the actors was differentiated primarily along a potency dimension. This study supported the differential information hypothesis and suggested that these three types of information about an actor may lead judges to use different personality dimensions. Person perception studies have shown that observers readily make attributions about the personality traits, abilities, and emotions of other persons based on limited information. Three types of information have been extensively studied: facial appearance, expressive noncontent characteristics of speech (such as pitch, tone, and tempo), and handwriting. Numerous studies have reported that facial features and expression influence attributions about the attractiveness, pleasantness, intellectual and social skills, and mental health of the target person (Adams, 1977; Berscheid & Walster, 1974; Bull & Stevens, 1979; Dion, Ber","[{'authorId': '39424239', 'name': 'R.

Cryostat sections from a dorsomedial region of the postcentral gyrus close to the interhemispheric fissure and from a ventrolateral region close to the Sylvian fissure were examined. Neurotransmitter-binding sites were analyzed with quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Different muscarinic-binding sites were labeled with [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]oxotremorine-M, noradrenergic-binding sites with [3H]prazosin, different serotoninergic-binding sites with [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine and [3H]ketanserine, glutamate-binding sites with l-[3H]glutamate, and GABA-binding sites with [3H]muscimol. Adjacent sections were stained with a modified Nissl method for cytoarchitectonic analysis. The binding sites either were preferentially localized in the superficial layers ([3H]5-hydroxytryptamine, [3H]prazosin, l-[3H]glutamate, [3H]muscimol, and [3H]pirenzepine) or were more homogeneously distributed with highest densities in layers III-V ([3H]oxotremorine-M and [3H]ketanserine). Changes in the distribution patterns of [3H]oxotremorine-M- and [3H]ketanserine-binding sites precisely matched the borders between areas 4/3a, 3b/1, and 1/2, as defined cytoarchitectonically. In addition, the autoradiographs showed that area 1 possibly consists of two subregions which cannot be distinguished cytoarchitectonically. The results demonstrate that the regional and laminar distribution patterns of some, but not all, transmitter-binding sites are precisely correlated with the cytoarchitectonic parcelation of the human primary somatosensory cortex. In addition, binding sites may reveal new borders not detectable in Nissl-stained sections. Finally, the human primary somatosensory cortex differs clearly from the primary motor cortex due to higher densities of l-[3H]glutamate-, [3H]muscimol-, [3H]pirenzepine-, [3H]oxotremorine-M-, and [3H]ketanserine-binding sites.","[{'authorId': '152321010', 'name': 'S.

This study analyzed mental health status—particularly emotional problems—and the role of several sociodemographic and clinical variables; it also explored whether there is a positive relationship between self-compassion and better mental health status. A cross-sectional study was carried out in Spain with the participation of 917 fluent Spanish-speaking residents in a survey conducted approximately midway through the COVID-19 lockdown. The survey tested for anxiety, depression, and stress using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) to measure self-compassion values, and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Questionnaire (PVDQ) to assess the degree of risk perceived by participants. Around 30% of the individuals surveyed (recruited by snowball sampling) showed clinically significant levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. The variables most frequently associated with anxiety, depression, and stress were low levels of self-compassion, age, gender, previous physical symptoms, a previous mental disorder, being a student, and perceived vulnerability to disease. We discuss the hypothetical protective role against anxiety, depression, and stress of certain skills such as self-compassion and the possibility that increasing self-compassion may be used to promote better mental health in similar situations.","[{'authorId': '2051896259', 'name': 'María Elena Gutiérrez-Hernández'}, {'authorId': '6844966', 'name': 'L.

We conducted an fMRI study in healthy participants and in patients with an anxiety disorder (social phobia) to determine the impact of stress on the brain network involved in cognitive control. Participants performed two working memory tasks that differed in their level of performance‐induced stress. In both groups, the cognitive tasks activated a frontoparietal network, involved in working memory tasks. A supplementary activation was observed in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in patients during the more stressful cognitive task. Region of interest analyses showed that activation in the right VLPFC decreased in the more stressful condition as compared to the less stressful one in healthy subjects and remain at a similar level in the two cognitive tasks in patients. This pattern was specific to the right when compared to the left VLPFC activation. Anxiety was positively correlated with right VLPFC activation across groups. Finally, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation was higher in healthy subjects than in patients in the more stressful task. These findings demonstrate that in healthy subjects, stress induces an increased activation in left DLPFC, a critical region for cognitive control, and a decreased activation in the right VLPFC, an area associated with anxiety. In patients, the differential modulation between these dorsal and ventral PFC regions disappears. This absence of modulation may limit anxious patients' ability to adapt to demanding cognitive control tasks.

Some practitioners report that these practices can cause incredible transformations and cure a wide range of psychological conditions, including anxiety and depression. A considerable number of studies have tested these claims and found them to contain an element of truth, leading to their adoption by many psychotherapists and health services. Miguel Farias and Catherine Wikholm take their readers on an accessible and sympathetic yet critical review of both the research literature and the history of these practices. The book engagingly tells the story of their scientific investigation into various meditative practices. The reflexivity shown throughout the book is commendable. The authors make explicit the role that their personal experiences with the techniques, as well as the relationships they formed with others who use them, had in their evolving thoughts on the topic. By being clear about both their current and past beliefs, and how interactions with research material changed them, they add coherence and authenticity to the project. The combination of a critical eye and a sympathetic heart makes their conclusions more persuasive by allowing others to see and weigh all of the influences on their conclusions. In research that touches on existential and metaphysical beliefs this reflexivity is especially crucial yet often lacking. The book is intentionally accessible and a genuinely enjoyable read. It does not assume much knowledge of either psychology, meditative traditions or scientific methodologies, and this makes it suitable for a wide audience. A consequence of this decision to make the text accessible is that at times there is a lack of detail in the analysis, but the endnotes always guide the reader towards further research. Overview The early chapters introduce the rationale for the research project and provide an overview of the psychology behind potential change and transformation. Meditation, and in particular yoga, is being used within prisons to facilitate the transformation and rehabilitation of inmates but the evidence to support its effectiveness has a number of methodological limitations and inadequacies. A review of the considerable body of research into Transcendental Meditation concludes that it has moderate beneficial effects but that better and more elegant studies are required to address the grander claims made by its adherents. An examination of the evidence for personality change suggests that yoga and other meditative practices may have the potential to cause significant transformations as both extreme physical stimulation and psychotropic drugs can induce personality change. It is also suggested that meditative techniques may help some clients to transform how they experience their daily flow of thoughts and feelings in a way similar to many psychotherapeutic modalities. The authors suggest that as a good therapeutic alliance is more important than particular therapeutic techniques, it is plausible that meditative approaches which create a positive and supportive environment that encourages change may also be effective. The less intrusive and unthreatening nature of yoga and meditation, compared to more verbal approaches to rehabilitation, means they may be especially appropriate and effective with individuals who are defensive or closed to more traditional approaches. One of the central insights of the book is that change is not always a positive thing. Within Buddhism, meditation is traditionally only one part of a much wider program for transformation that also includes changes in goals and beliefs, and which highly values community rather than individualism. Without that supportive environment, any change that is achieved may be either less significant or even dangerous. It is observed that these negative consequences of meditation for some users have been documented by leading psychologists such as Lazarus (1976) but that the majority of research continues to ignore these risks.

The findings revealed several categories of compassion fatigue: risk factors, causes, process, and manifestations. The characteristics of each of these categories are specified and a connotative (theoretical) definition, model case, additional cases, empirical indicators, and a denotative (operational) definition are provided. Compassion fatigue progresses from a state of compassion discomfort to compassion stress and, finally, to compassion fatigue, which if not effaced in its early stages of compassion discomfort or compassion stress, can permanently alter the compassionate ability of the nurse.

This study used structural equation modelling to evaluate a gain cycle of future time perspective (FTP), positive emotion and student engagement, derived from the broaden-and-build theory (BBT). A further objective was to examine changes within study variables over time. Participants were 217 UK undergraduates sampled at the beginning of the academic year, and the start of the second term. Analysis revealed that levels of positive emotion and engagement decreased, whereas FTP increased. At both time points, FTP predicted higher engagement, and engagement predicted greater positive emotion. Additionally, Time 1 positive emotion led to increased Time 2 FTP, engagement and positive emotion. This outcome was congruent with the ‘build’ hypothesis of BBT, suggesting that positive emotions enable the development of psychological resources. Relatedly, interventions designed to enhance FTP and positive emotion can facilitate student engagement and retention.","[{'authorId': '3647959', 'name': 'A.

60c2973bdc52172a0b0bd1d1aaa960d00ecf4821,"Research on maternal socialization of child emotion regulation often involves measures of general parenting, yet little research has considered how maternal emotion regulation and emotion expressivity relate to children's ability to regulate their emotions. Because emotion regulation can be viewed as intergenerational, mothers who display higher levels of positive emotions and lower levels of negative emotions may create a more optimal emotional climate for children to learn and practice emotion regulation, aiding in the intergenerational transmission of optimal emotion regulation. We tested a mediation model where maternal positive expressivity was hypothesized to mediate the relation of maternal emotion regulation to child emotion regulation. We also examined maternal negative expressivity as a moderator of the association of maternal positive expressivity to child emotion regulation. Maternal emotion regulation, measured as the use of reappraisal, and maternal expressivity were self-reported when children were 4-5 years old (T1). Child emotion regulation, measured as effortful control, was observed at T1. When children were 8-9 years old (T2), a summary score of child emotion regulation was computed from observed and teacher-reported effortful control. Higher levels of maternal reappraisal were related to more maternal positive expressivity, which in turn was associated with better child emotion regulation (T2), controlling for prior levels of child regulation (T1), only when maternal negative expressivity was low. This longitudinal moderated mediation pathway suggests that adaptive emotion regulation strategies used by mothers can be transmitted to children through maternal emotional expressions, specifically the interplay of positive and negative emotions.

60db7743bb70cbb18fbadaca4eb019156edb9042,"Although the effectiveness of leader humility has been well documented, our understanding of how leader humility influences followers psychologically is limited. Surpassing a mere leader‐centric understanding of the leader influence process by more fully understanding how leadership behavior shapes followers psychologically has been identified as a critical need by leadership scholars. Drawing on self‐expansion theory, we argue that leader humility triggers followers’ self‐expansion and that this psychological change enhances followers’ self‐efficacy, which in turn contributes to followers’ task performance.

The aim of this article is to acquaint managers with intriguing new research that examines both emotional intelligence and the broader issue of emotion, which has been shown to play a powerful role in workplace settings. We show that this research has a strong potential for practical application in organizations within many broad human-resource functions such as selection, performance management, and training, as well as implications for more narrow domains like customer service. We conclude that the study of emotions in organizational settings has provided new and important insights into the way in which people in organizations behave, and we offer advice for managers to enable them to develop and to maintain a positive emotional climate in their organizations.","[{'authorId': '70294020', 'name': 'N.

We hypothesized that a low adherence to a Mediterranean diet would be positively associated with an increase in ADHD diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 120 children and adolescents (60 with newly diagnosed ADHD and 60 controls) were studied in a sex- and age-matched case-control study. ADHD diagnosis was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. Energy, dietary intake, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, and familial background were measured. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between the adherence to a Mediterranean diet and ADHD. RESULTS: Lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with ADHD diagnosis (odds ratio: 7.07; 95% confidence interval: 2.65–18.84; relative risk: 2.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.54–5.25). Both remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders. Lower frequency of consuming fruit, vegetables, pasta, and rice and higher frequency of skipping breakfast and eating at fast-food restaurants were associated with ADHD diagnosis (P < .05). High consumption of sugar, candy, cola beverages, and noncola soft drinks (P < .01) and low consumption of fatty fish (P < .05) were also associated with a higher prevalence of ADHD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although these cross-sectional associations do not establish causality, they raise the question of whether low adherence to a Mediterranean diet might play a role in ADHD development. Our data support the notion that not only “specific nutrients” but also the “whole diet” should be considered in ADHD.","[{'authorId': '1422401481', 'name': 'Alejandra Ríos-Hernández'}, {'authorId': '35527327', 'name': 'J.

Cultural variables explain differences in mean levels of SWB and appear to be due to objective factors such as wealth, to norms dictating appropriate feelings and how important SWB is considered to be, and to the relative approach versus avoidance tendencies of societies. Culture can also moderate which variables most influence SWB. Although it is challenging to assess SWB across societies, the measures have some degree of cross-cultural validity.

The aims of this study were to compare the frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms and stressful life events in cohorts of youth with (n = 95) and without (n = 100) chronic pain and their parents and to determine the association between PTSD symptoms, health-related quality of life, and pain symptoms within the chronic pain sample. All participants completed questionnaire measures through an online survey. Findings revealed that youth with chronic pain and their parents had significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms as compared with pain-free peers. More youth with chronic pain (32%) and their parents (20%) reported clinically significant elevations in PTSD symptoms than youth without chronic pain (8%) and their parents (1%). Youth with chronic pain also reported a greater number of stressful life events than those without chronic pain, and this was associated with higher PTSD symptoms. Among the chronic pain cohort, higher levels of PTSD symptoms were predictive of worse health-related quality of life and were associated with higher pain intensity, unpleasantness, and interference. Results suggest that elevated PTSD symptoms are common and linked to reduced functioning among youth with chronic pain. Future research is needed to examine PTSD at the diagnostic level and the underlying mechanisms that may explain why this co-occurrence exists.","[{'authorId': '145276983', 'name': 'M.

Research suggests that alexithymia is a significant element for emotion processing, while defense mechanisms proved to be important factors for adjusting to stressful life events and to cope with potential psychopathologies.


AIMS
The aims of the present study are to examine the relationships between alexithymia, defense mechanisms, depression, anxiety and eating disorders and to examine the mediation role of defense mechanisms in the relation between alexithymia and anxiety, depression and eating disorders.


MATERIAL
In a sample of 283 subjects, aged 18-49 (M=2.33, DS=4.81), instruments were administered to measure alexithymia, defense mechanisms, depression, anxiety and eating disorders.


RESULTS
This study showed that alexithymia was positively related to anxiety, depression, general psychological maladjustment, eating disorder risk, maladaptive style defense mechanisms, image-distorting style defense mechanisms, self-sacrificing style defense mechanisms, whereas it was negatively related to Mature Style Defense Mechanisms.

We examined the associations between aspects of social hierarchy and depressive symptoms with a specific focus on one potential psychological mechanism: emotion suppression. Suppressing negative emotion has mental health costs, but individuals with low social power and low social status may use these strategies to avoid conflict. Study 1 assessed perceived social power, tendency to suppress negative emotion, and depressive symptoms in a community sample of women. Low social power was related to greater depressive symptoms, and this relationship was partially mediated by emotion suppression. Study 2 examined education as a proxy for social hierarchy position, anger suppression, and depressive symptoms in a national, longitudinal cohort study (The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults [CARDIA] study; Cutter et al., 1991). Much as in Study 1, low education levels were correlated with greater depressive symptoms, and this relationship was partially mediated by anger suppression. Further, suppression mediated the relationship between low education and subsequent depression up to 15 years later. These findings support the theory that social hierarchy affects mental health in part through a process of emotion suppression.","[{'authorId': '13069371', 'name': 'C.

The instrument was administered to a sample of 686 people between the ages of 18 and 51. The sample was divided into two groups of 343 participants each so that exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis could be conducted. Results from the principal component analysis (first sample) corroborated the bifactorial structure identified in the original study of the measure, that is, a regulation of negative emotion factor (down regulation) and a regulation of positive emotion factor (up regulation). Furthermore, a set of confirmatory factor analysis (second sample) revealed that the proposed bifactorial structure showed good fit indices. Finally, it was possible to propose a reduced version of the ERP with six vignettes (three describing pleasant events and three describing unpleasant events) to adequately assess the different strategies people use when regulating their emotions.","[{'authorId': '81824640', 'name': 'S.

However, emotional behaviors, such as novelty and emergence responses have not been reported in μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice due to the disruptions of exon 2 and 3. Here, we report that μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice, with deletion of exon 2 and 3, display significant emotional behavior changes; they showed less anxiety in the elevated plus maze and emergence tests, reduced response to novel stimuli in the novelty test, and less depressive‐like behavior in the forced‐swim test. Analysis of the compensatory mechanism in μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice revealed that the M1 mRNA levels were reduced in the cortex, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus, and that M1 receptor levels were reduced in the nucleus accumbens, CA1, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, versus the wild‐type. However, 5‐HT1A receptor levels were significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex and in the hypothalamus of μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice versus the wild‐type. These aberrant emotional behavioral phenotypes are possibly related to M1 and 5‐HT1A receptor alterations in the μ‐opioid receptor knockout mice. Overall, our study suggests that μ‐opioid receptor may play a role in the modification of emotional responses to novelty, anxiety, and depression.

This study identified a high prevalence of burnout (38.2%) among Intensive Care, Plastics and Reconstruction and Burns clinicians, with Burns clinicians having a greatly increased prevalence of burnout compared to Intensive Care clinicians (OR =24.3, P=0.017). Additional factors contributing to compassion fatigue were those without children (P=0.016), divorced (P=0.035), of a younger age (P=0.019), and a registered nurse (P=0.05). Burnout increased clinicians’ risk of adverse professional and personal outcomes and correlated with less free time (P<0.001), increased risk of experiencing work-home disputes (P=0.05), increased depression (P=0.001) and decreased career satisfaction (P=0.01). Burnout was also associated with higher physical (mean difference =3.8, P<0.001) and lower mental (mean difference =−3.5, P<0.001) Quality of Life scores. Caring for burn survivors can lead to burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious trauma. Identifying strategies to abate these issues is essential to ensure improved clinicial environments and patient outcomes.","[{'authorId': '3973724', 'name': 'J.

62f0adee3d4e3891b7cd7f087444831090eb7fbe,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterised by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations. Cognitive models suggest that self-focused cognitive processes play a crucial role in generating and maintaining social anxiety, and that self-focused cognition occurs prior to, during, and following social situations (Clark & Wells, 1995; Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). There is a substantial body of empirical evidence demonstrating that socially anxious individuals engage in self-focused cognition during and following a social or performance situation. A smaller but growing body literature suggests that a similar process occurs prior to such situations, and that these three processes are interdependent. Furthermore, the vast majority of research to date indicates that self-focused cognitive processes are detrimental, and that they generate and maintain social anxiety in a variety of ways. However, there remains considerable scope for research to further explicate the role of these processes in the maintenance of SAD, and to enhance interventions designed to ameliorate their negative effects.","[{'authorId': '4949931', 'name': 'Alice R.

Intensive care unit (ICU) nurses work in a demanding environment where they are repetitively exposed to traumatic situations and stressful events. The psychological effects on nurses as a result of working in the ICU are relatively unknown.


OBJECTIVE
To determine whether there is an increased prevalence of psychological symptoms in ICU nurses when compared with general nurses.


METHODS
We surveyed ICU and general nurses from three different hospitals (n=351) and then surveyed ICU nurses throughout the metropolitan area (n=140).


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
In both cohorts of nurses, we determined the prevalence of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression using validated survey instruments. Within our hospital system, 24% (54/230) of the ICU nurses tested positive for symptoms of PTSD related to their work environment, compared with 14% (17/121) of the general nurses (p=0.03). ICU nurses did not report a greater amount of stress in their life outside of the hospital than general nurses. There was no difference in symptoms of depression or anxiety between ICU and general nurses. In the second survey of ICU nurses from our metropolitan area, 29% (41/140) of the respondents reported symptoms of PTSD, similar to our first cohort of ICU nurses.


CONCLUSIONS
ICU nurses have an increased prevalence of PTSD symptoms when compared with other general nurses. These results may increase awareness of these symptoms in nurses and lead to future interventions that improve their mental health and job satisfaction and help retain ICU nurses in their profession.","[{'authorId': '5026369', 'name': 'M.

However, these have usually been investigated independently of one another. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to explore a key gap in the current literature, that being, identifying whether HRV and interoception predict emotional regulation outcomes and strategies. Methods: The process of article retrieval and selection followed the PRISMA guidelines. Databases PsychINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, and MEDLINE were scanned for papers published. Preliminary inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified following the PICO framework, whilst the CHARMS framework was used to help formulate the research question, and critically assess for bias. Results: Two hundred and thirty-seven studies were identified after initial database searches. Of these, eight studies were included in the final selection. Six studies explored the associations between HRV and ER, whilst three investigated the associations between interoception and ER (one study included both). Results show that greater HRV and interoception are associated with better ER. Specifically, high parasympathetic activity largely predicted the use of adaptive ER strategies such as reappraisal, and better acceptance of emotions. High interoception, instead, was predictive of effective downregulation of negative emotions and handling of social uncertainty, there was no association with any specific ER strategy. Conclusions: Awareness of one's own bodily feelings and vagal activation seem to be of central importance for the effective regulation of emotional responses. However, one limitation is the small sample of studies found, thus more studies in this area are needed in the future.","[{'authorId': '153359194', 'name': 'T.

However, mechanisms for intervention effects have not been fully determined. This study tested emotion regulation strategies as mediators of intervention effects in a sample of younger women treated for breast cancer, a group at risk for psychological distress. We focused on two distinct strategies targeted by the intervention—rumination and self-kindness—and further examined the broader construct of mindfulness as a potential mediator. Method: Women (n = 71) with Stage 0-III breast cancer diagnosed at or before age 50 who had completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to a 6-week mindfulness intervention or wait-list control group. Assessments occurred at study entry, postintervention, and a 3-month follow-up. Results: In single mediator analyses, increases in self-kindness (CIB [−7.83, −1.93]), decreases in rumination (CIB [−5.05, −.31]), and increases in mindfulness (CIB [−6.58, −.82]) each mediated reductions in depressive symptoms from pre- to postintervention. Increases in self-kindness also mediated reductions in perceived stress (CIB [−5.37, −.62]) from pre- to postintervention, and increases in self-kindness (CIB [−5.67, −.22]) and in mindfulness (CIB [−5.51, −.16]) each mediated intervention effects on perceived stress from preintervention to 3-month follow-up. In multiple mediator analysis, only self-kindness mediated intervention effects on depressive symptoms from pre- to postintervention (CIB [−6.41, −.61]), and self-kindness and mindfulness together mediated intervention effects on perceived stress from preintervention to follow-up (CIB [−6.77, −.35]). Conclusions: Self-kindness played a consistent role in reducing distress in younger women with breast cancer. The efficacy of this understudied emotion regulation strategy should be evaluated in other clinical populations.","[{'authorId': '7197140', 'name': 'C. Boyle'}, {'authorId': '3185826', 'name': 'A.

Recent neuroimaging studies suggest a possible neurocognitive pathway for this process, but methodological limitations of previous studies have prevented strong inferences from being drawn. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of affect labeling was conducted to remedy these limitations. The results indicated that affect labeling, relative to other forms of encoding, diminished the response of the amygdala and other limbic regions to negative emotional images. Additionally, affect labeling produced increased activity in a single brain region, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (RVLPFC). Finally, RVLPFC and amygdala activity during affect labeling were inversely correlated, a relationship that was mediated by activity in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). These results suggest that affect labeling may diminish emotional reactivity along a pathway from RVLPFC to MPFC to the amygdala.","[{'authorId': '1920154', 'name': 'Matthew D.

63f5ca20c41de31d45e6742f0b7e14b0df178bbd,"We analyzed the topographical variability of human somatosensory area 2 in 10 postmortem brains. The brains were serially sectioned at 20 microm, and sections were stained for cell bodies. Area 2 was delineated with an observer-independent technique based on significant differences in the laminar densities of cell bodies. The sections were corrected with an MR scan of the same brain obtained before histological processing. Each brain's histological volume and representation of area 2 was subsequently reconstructed in 3-D. We found that the borders of area 2 are topographically variable. The rostral border lies between the convexity of the postcentral gyrus and some millimeters deep in the rostral wall of the postcentral sulcus. The caudal border lies between the fundus of the postcentral sulcus and some millimeters above it in the rostral wall. In contrast to Brodmann's map, area 2 does not extend onto the mesial cortical surface or into the intraparietal sulcus. When the postcentral sulcus is interrupted by a gyral bridge, area 2 crosses this bridge and is not separated into two segments. After cytoarchitectonic analysis, the histological volumes were warped to the reference brain of a computerized atlas and superimposed. A population map was generated in 3-D space, which describes how many brains have a representation of area 2 in a particular voxel. This microstructurally defined population map can be used to demonstrate activations of area 2 in functional imaging studies and therefore help to further understand the role of area 2 in somatosensory processing.","[{'authorId': '1824186', 'name': 'C.

Yet, it is not well known how EE in children is associated with body mass index (BMI) and health behaviours (i.e., diet, physical activity, sleep, and TV-viewing). In the present study, we examined these associations in a cross-sectional sample of 5426 (54% girls) 9–11-year-old children from 12 countries and five continents. EE, food consumption, and TV-viewing were measured using self-administered questionnaires, and physical activity and nocturnal sleep duration were measured with accelerometers. BMI was calculated using measured weights and heights. EE factor scores were computed using confirmatory factor analysis, and dietary patterns were identified using principal components analysis. The associations of EE with health behaviours and BMI z-scores were analyzed using multilevel models including age, gender, and household income as covariates. EE was positively and consistently (across 12 study sites) associated with an unhealthy dietary pattern (β = 0.29, SE = 0.02, p < 0.0001), suggesting that the association is not restricted to Western countries. Positive associations between EE and physical activity and TV viewing were not consistent across sites. Results tended to be similar in boys and girls. EE was unrelated to BMI in this sample, but prospective studies are needed to determine whether higher EE in children predicts the development of undesirable dietary patterns and obesity over time.","[{'authorId': '17879828', 'name': 'Elli Jalo'}, {'authorId': '3870211', 'name': 'H.

As a result, individuals with AN often report high levels of emotional loneliness. A new evidence-based treatment, Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT), and its underlying neuroregulatory theory, offer a novel way of understanding how self-starvation and social signaling deficits are used as maladaptive regulation strategies to reduce negative affect. RO-DBT proposes that rather than trying to be ‘emotionally regulated’ or achieving equanimity, long-term psychological well-being is achieved by increasing social connectedness. RO-DBT skills, including body posture, gestures, and facial expressions, activate brain regions that increase social safety responses that function to automatically enhance the open-minded and flexible social-signaling, which are crucial for establishing long-term intimate bonds with others and becoming part of a “tribe.”","[{'authorId': '2046163', 'name': 'Roelie J Hempel'}, {'authorId': '12418940', 'name': 'Emily N.

645c367144ac8303bee0e41fcae53bb441666f98,"We argue that infant meaning-making processes are a central mechanism governing both typical and pathological outcomes. Infants, as open dynamic systems, must constantly garner information to increase their complexity and coherence. They fulfill this demand by making nonverbal ""meaning""-affects, movements, representations-about themselves in relation to the world and themselves into a ""biopsychosocial state of consciousness,"" which shapes their ongoing engagement with the world. We focus on the operation of the infant-adult communication system, a dyadic, mutually regulated system that scaffolds infants' engagement with the world of people, things, and themselves, and consequently their meaning-making. We argue that infant mental health problems emerge when the meanings infants make in the moment, which increase their complexity and coherence and may be adaptive in the short run, selectively limit their subsequent engagement with the world and, in turn, the growth of their state of consciousness in the long run. When chronic and iterative, these altered meanings can interfere with infants' successful development and heighten their vulnerability to pathological outcomes. Cultural variations in meaning-making and implications for clinical practice are discussed.","[{'authorId': '83022844', 'name': 'E. Tronick'}, {'authorId': '6541396', 'name': 'M.

649ce5cf039d8bc6f0d359183e0afcd0448f19f1,"ABSTRACT The global spread of COVID-19 has caused a huge number of confirmed cases and deaths, which in return leads to a plethora of mental disorders across the world. In order to address citizens’ psychological problems, government agencies in many countries have employed AI-based chatbots to provide mental health services. However, there is a limited understanding of the determinants affecting citizens’ user experience and user satisfaction when mental health services supported by chatbots are provided. Thus, based on the Theory of Consumption Values (TCV), this study proposes an analytical framework to investigate the factors that are important to citizens’ user experience and user satisfaction when they interact with mental health chatbots. Analysis of data collected from 295 chatbot users in Wuhan and Chongqing reveals that personalization, enjoyment, learning, and condition are positively related to user experience and user satisfaction. However, voice interaction fails to devote to citizens’ user experience and user satisfaction. Thus, government agencies and their AI service contractors should enhance the functions and systems of mental health chatbots to ensure citizens’ user experience and user satisfaction. Also, they should more positively promote the use of mental health chatbots during the public health emergency.","[{'authorId': '153514177', 'name': 'Yonghan Zhu'}, {'authorId': '50817520', 'name': 'M.

The setting was a rural school, and this study took place in an environment with 28 children who are predominantly Caucasian and come from upper-middle-class families. Data was collected using a tally sheet, observational field notes, a small group discussion rubric and an observational rubric. Storytelling took place each day and stories centered around emotions like anger, sadness, and frustration. The adult would share a story first, then invite the children to share stories. After, there would be a small group discussion about the way the particular emotion might feel or look. The results concluded that storytelling did help children with their emotional development by giving them the language they would need to be able to express themselves. The action plan implications conclude that the study could be conducted using different methods of discussing emotions.","[{'authorId': '2056979828', 'name': 'Elizabeth Erickson'}]",8.0,,15.0,Effects of Storytelling on Emotional Development,2018.0

Personal technologies such as smartphones, computers, and gaming devices, are ubiquitous in the civilian world. Consequently they represent ideal vehicles for disseminating psychological and other health resources and interventions. However, almost nothing is known about personal technology use in the U.S. military. We conducted the most comprehensive survey to date of the use, availability, and need for personal technologies by U.S. military service members. Our survey asked detailed questions about computers and the Internet, phones and smartphones, other mobile or portable technologies, gaming devices, and TV and video media used during deployment and at permanent duty station or home.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We collected data by paper-and-pencil survey in 2010 and 2011 from 331 active Army service members at a processing and registration center in a large military installation in the western United States. Two cohorts were surveyed: Soldiers who had previously been deployed to a warzone and soldiers who had never been deployed.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
We measured high rates of personal technology use by service members at home across all popular electronic media. Soldiers at home essentially resembled civilian consumers in their use of popular technologies. Some technologies, including the Internet, gaming, and TV, were widespread on deployment. Others, most notably cellphones, were more restricted by availability, connectivity, opportunity, and military regulation in the warzone. Results will enable researchers and technology developers target their efforts on the most promising and popular technologies for psychological health in the military.","[{'authorId': '40146228', 'name': 'N.

To investigate whether adolescent online gaming time and the additive effect of gaming motives were associated with depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms. The hypothesis was that adolescents who engage in online gaming with escape motives and increased online gaming time have higher probability for depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms compared to adolescents with other online gaming motives and/or less online gaming time. Method. An anonymous and voluntary questionnaire was completed during class hours by 7,757 Swedish adolescents aged 13–18 years. The questionnaire included demographic background, gaming habits, and depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms. Results. It was found that increased online gaming time during weekdays increased the probability of having depressive, musculoskeletal, and psychosomatic symptoms. However, these relations with time spent gaming were further explained by online gaming motives. Weekday online gaming for more than five hours a day, in combination with escape motives, was associated with an increased probability of depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 4.614, 95% CI 3.230–6.590), musculoskeletal symptoms (OR 2.494, 95% CI 1.598–3.892), and psychosomatic symptoms (OR 4.437, 95% CI 2.966–6.637). The probability of ill health decreased when gaming was for fun or had social motives. Conclusion. Excessive gaming time and escape motives were found to be associated with increased probability of ill health among adolescents. Gaming motives may identify gamers in need of support to reduce unhealthy gaming behaviour as well as identify individuals at risk for ill health.","[{'authorId': '35912108', 'name': 'Charlotta Hellström'}, {'authorId': '40207403', 'name': 'K.

Leaders have an essential role in facilitating strategic change within organizations. As resistance to change is primarily an emotional reaction to change, the study of emotions and the emotional intelligence of the leader is of growing interest in modern organizations. 
 
 
From a strategic perspective, the process of how the emotional intelligence of a leader contributes to competitive advantage for an organization is unclear. 
 
 
Based on the resource-based view of the firm, this paper introduces a framework that links emotional intelligence to competitive advantage. Essentially, it is argued that emotional intelligence leads indirectly to competitive advantage by influencing the leadership capability necessary for implementing effective strategic change. 
 
 
In the current volatile business environment, it is argued that organizations possessing emotionally intelligent leaders will be more likely to obtain competitive advantage. Suggestions for organizations are discussed and directions for future research are also presented.

METHODS The Literacy Assessment for Diabetes (LAD) instrument was developed as a word recognition test composed of 3 graded word lists in ascending difficulty. This literacy test, which was specific to diabetes, measured a patient's ability to pronounce terms that they would encounter during clinic visits and in reading menu and self-care instructions. The majority of the terms were on a 4th-grade reading level, with the remaining words ranging from the 6th- through 16th-grade levels. To assess reliability and validity, the LAD was compared with the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT3) and the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) by administering all 3 tests to 203 participants in a test-retest study design. RESULTS All 3 tests (LAD, REALM, and WRAT3) reliably detected true intrasubject variation in word recognition from test to retest. In addition, LAD measured word recognition ability similar to the REALM and WRAT3. CONCLUSIONS The LAD is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring literacy in adults with diabetes. It can be administered in 3 minutes or less, and the raw score is scaled to a reading grade level.","[{'authorId': '2207043299', 'name': 'Charlotte Reese Nath'}, {'authorId': '2207351283', 'name': 'Shirley Theriot Sylvester'}, {'authorId': '5391536', 'name': 'V.

Results of confirmatory factor analyses supported the differentiation between the three categories of job characteristics in two samples (N 1 = 261 and N 2 = 441). Further, structural equation modelling confirmed the hypotheses that job hindrances associate positively with exhaustion (i.e., the main component of burnout) and negatively with vigour (i.e., the main component of work engagement). Job resources displayed the reversed pattern of relations. Job challenges were positively related to vigour. Rather unexpectedly, they were unrelated to exhaustion.

The purpose of the present study was to compare mental health symptoms of 430 children and adolescents who sought mental health services in the community before vs. during the pandemic. The study examined children's perceived burden of the pandemic, reports of emotional and behavioral problems (SDQ) anxiety (SCARED), depressed moods (SMFQ-C), and difficulty in emotional regulation (DERS), as well as intervening variables such as age and gender. Furthermore, the effect of difficulty in emotional regulation on children's mental health symptoms was explored. Findings indicate an increase in all mental health symptoms excluding anxiety, during the pandemic. Boys reported more difficulty in emotional regulation during the pandemic than before, and girls reported more emotional and behavioral problems. Children reported an increase in emotional and behavioral problems and adolescents in peer relationship problems. Difficulty in emotional regulation predicted all mental health symptoms in both samples, more so in girls and adolescents.

Materials and Methods : This work was a quasi- experimental study with pre – post-test design. All married women aged 20 to 50 years with obsessive- compulsive disorder referred to the counseling centers of Sanandaj City in 2016 were included in the study. Among these patients, 45 women were selected based on available sampling method. They were then randomely subgrouped into three groups of 15; acceptance and commitment therapy group, cognitive behavioral therapy group and control group. The first two groups s received 9 sessions of two-hour treatment. Data were collected using demographic questionnaires and ENRICH couple scale (1989) and the questionnaires were administered twice as pre-and post-test twice for the three groups. The data was then analyzed using Analysis of Covariance, Levine test and LSD follow up test. Results : The results of the study showed significant differences between the mean scores of the pre-test and post-test of the experimental group (p<0.001). In addition, results of the two experimental groups indicated that the acceptance and commitment therapy had a higher positive significant effect on marital satisfaction compared with the cognitive behavioral therapy (p<0.001).

To develop a reliable and valid parent-report screening instrument for mania, based on DSM-IVsymptoms.


METHOD
A 21-item Child Mania Rating Scale-Parent version (CMRS-P) was completed by parents of 150 children (42.3% female) ages 10.3 +/- 2.9 years (healthy controls = 50; bipolar disorder = 50; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] = 50). The Washington University Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia was used to determine DSM-IV diagnosis. The Young Mania Rating Scale, Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Mania Rating Scale, Child Behavior Checklist, and Child Depression Inventory were completed to estimate the construct validity of the measure.


RESULTS
Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the CMRS-P indicated that the scale was unidimensional. The internal consistency and retest reliability were both 0.96. Convergence of the CMRS-P with the Washington University Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia mania module, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Mania Rating Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale was excellent (.78-.83). The scale did not correlate as strongly with the Conners parent-rated ADHD scale, the Child Behavior Checklist -Attention Problems and Aggressive Behavior subscales, or the child self-report Child Depression Inventory (.29-.51). Criterion validity was demonstrated in analysis of receiver operating characteristics curves, which showed excellent sensitivity and specificity in differentiating children with mania from either healthy controls or children with ADHD (areas under the curve of.91 to.96).


CONCLUSION
The CMRS-P is a promising parent-report scale that can be used in screening for pediatric mania.","[{'authorId': '3358573', 'name': 'M. Pavuluri'}, {'authorId': '36156211', 'name': 'D.

To examine whether ERA would contribute to explaining teachers' depression, anxiety and stress symptoms beyond role ambiguity and role conflict.


Methods
We carried out a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. We used a correlation matrix and hierarchical regression models to analyse the data.


Results
Three hundred and thirty-six Spanish teachers (185 female) from several grade levels completed the surveys (40% response rate). Role ambiguity and role conflict were positively related to depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. ERA was negatively related to teachers' scores on depressive, anxious and stress symptoms, with predictive power above the main effects of role ambiguity and role conflict. An interaction between role ambiguity and ERA was also significant in predicting depression.


Conclusions
Our study provides preliminary evidence suggesting the development of integrative models considering work-related stressors along with personal resources such as ERA aiming to prevent teachers' mental ill-health. Future studies should examine the influence of ERA on psychological symptoms using longitudinal designs.","[{'authorId': '1403712929', 'name': 'S. Mérida-López'}, {'authorId': '4442478', 'name': 'N.

The Chinese government has launched a Healthy China 2030 plan in response to the health-related SDGs. The Chinese government has introduced different kinds of measures under Healthy China 2030 plan to achieve health-related SDGs through sport and physical activity. The Healthy China program is compatible with SDGs regarding health, sport, and physical activity. After introducing the program with sustainable built environment intervention for sport and physical activity, the elderly population of China is participating in sport and physical activity to improve the national fitness level and prevent NCDs. Sport is playing a vital role in preventing NCDs in the shape of increasing physical activity among the Chinese people. Sports and physical activity play a crucial role in the implementation of health-related SDGs and further help in the achievement of “Healthy China” 2030 goal. China’s localization policies for the realization of SDGs have a global impact through glocalization in the BRI participant’s countries and supporting them to make their public health system secure and promoting global health governance.","[{'authorId': '2087363148', 'name': 'Jianhui Dai'}, {'authorId': '5231590', 'name': 'R.

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a highly prevalent condition, characterised by excessive worry or anxiety about everyday events and problems. The effectiveness and effectiveness of psychological therapies as a group has not yet been evaluated in the treatment of GAD.


OBJECTIVES
To examine the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies, categorised as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy and supportive therapy, compared with treatment as usual/waiting list (TAU/WL) and compared with one another, for patients with GAD.


SEARCH STRATEGY
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Controlled Trials Register and conducted supplementary searches of MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, LILACS and controlledtrials.com in February 2006. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials conducted in non-inpatient settings, involving adults aged 18-75 years with a primary diagnosis of GAD, assigned to a psychological therapy condition compared with TAU/WL or another psychological therapy.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Data on patients, interventions and outcomes were extracted by two review authors independently, and the methodological quality of each study was assessed. The primary outcome was anxiety reduction, based on a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using relative risk (RR), and on a continuous measure of symptom reduction, using the standardised mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals.


MAIN RESULTS
Twenty five studies (1305 participants) were included in the review, of which 22 studies (1060 participants) contributed data to meta-analyses. Based on thirteen studies, psychological therapies, all using a CBT approach, were more effective than TAU/WL in achieving clinical response at post-treatment (RR 0.63, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.73), and also in reducing anxiety, worry and depression symptoms. No studies conducted longer-term assessments of CBT against TAU/WL. Six studies compared CBT against supportive therapy (non-directive therapy and attention-placebo conditions). No significant difference in clinical response was indicated between CBT and supportive therapy at post-treatment (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.70 to 1.06), however significant heterogeneity was indicated, which was partly explained by the number of therapy sessions.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Psychological therapy based on CBT principles is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms for short-term treatment of GAD. The body of evidence comparing CBT with other psychological therapies is small and heterogeneous, which precludes drawing conclusions about which psychological therapy is more effective. Further studies examining non-CBT models are required to inform health care policy on the most appropriate forms of psychological therapy in treating GAD.","[{'authorId': '7716937', 'name': 'V.

A bank manager runs for hours each morning to take his mind off his impending divorce. A politician is struggling to hide her joy over a rival’s downfall during a press conference. A CEO practices yoga to handle the stress of her demanding work life. A student works through a childhood trauma by keeping a diary on his innermost feelings. In these and in many other situations in everyday life, people are at once engaged in the selfregulation of action (briefly, selfregulation) and the selfregulation of emotion (briefly, emotion regulation). Selfregulation and emotion regulation are often so intertwined that it is hard to say where one ends and the other begins. Over the past few decades, both types of regulation have become the focus of considerable theoretical and empirical research (for reviews, see Baumeister, Schmeichel, & Vohs, 2007; Koole, 2009; for comprehensive overviews, see Gross, 2007; this volume). Nevertheless, the interface between selfregulation and emotion regulation has only recently received systematic attention. Learning how selfregulation interfaces with emotion regulation is likely to generate important new insights into both processes. Among other things, selfregulation research may illuminate how people function as active agents in managing their emotional lives. Conversely, emotion regulation research may illuminate how people direct their actions in emotionarousing contexts. In this chapter, we contribute to the ongoing integration between selfregulation and emotion regulation research by reviewing contemporary research on the selfregulation of emotion. Our plan in this chapter is fourfold. First, we consider the emotion part of emotion regulation by discussing the kinds of responses that people may target in the emotion regulation process.

Scales measuring lability in anxiety, depression, anger, and hypomania, and labile shifts between anxiety and depression and hypomania and depression were constructed. These scales were then evaluated for internal consistency, retest reliability, score stability across samples, and for discriminant validity through assessment of association with measures of dysphoria and intensity of affect. The final versions of the scales are short scales that yield highly stable estimates of affect lability.

This article uses multilevel models for 38 developed countries to test three hypotheses about societal differences. Data are used from the European and World Values Studies. Results show that, in most countries, the divorced have a lower level of well-being than the married, but the magnitude of this difference varies significantly across countries, even when compositional factors are taken into account. The results show that the effect of divorce is weaker in countries where the family is strong, in line with notions of support. The effect of divorce also appears to be weaker when divorce is more common, which points to the role of declining selectivity as divorce rates go up. Mixed evidence was found for the role of norms. The divorce effect is stronger in countries that have stronger norms against divorce, but this was only found for religious persons. Together, these three factors explain more than half of the variance in the divorce effect.

In Study 1, greater resting vagal tone was associated with reduced spontaneous avoidance in response to disgust-eliciting pictures, beyond anxiety and depression symptoms and emotional reactivity. In Study 2, resting vagal tone interacted with anxiety and depression symptoms to predict spontaneous avoidance in response to disgust-eliciting film clips. The positive association between symptoms and spontaneous avoidance was more pronounced among participants with reduced resting vagal tone. Thus, increased resting vagal tone might protect against the use of avoidance.

Numerous studies conducted in juvenile correctional institutions have reported that violence and serious antisocial behavior have been cut almost in half after implementing nutrient-dense diets that are consistent with the World Health Organization's guidelines for fats, sugar, starches, and protein ratios. Two controlled trials tested whether the cause of the behavioral improvements was psychological or biological in nature by comparing the behavior of offenders who either received placebos or vitamin-mineral supplements designed to provide the micronutrient equivalent of a well-balanced diet. These randomized trials reported that institutionalized offenders, aged 13 to 17 years or 18 to 26 years, when given active tablets produced about 40% less violent and other antisocial behavior than the placebo controls. However, generalization could not be made to typical schoolchildren without a controlled trial examining violence and antisocial behavior in public schools.


OBJECTIVES
To determine if schoolchildren, aged 6 to 12 years, who are given low dose vitamin-mineral tablets will produce significantly less violence and antisocial behavior in school than classmates who are given placebos.


DESIGN
A stratified randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with pretest and post-test measures of antisocial behavior on school property.


SETTINGS AND SUBJECTS
Two ""working class,"" primarily Hispanic elementary schools in Phoenix, Arizona. Approximately half of the potential schoolchildren participated, i.e., 468 students aged 6 to 12 years.


INTERVENTION
Daily vitamin-mineral supplementation at 50% of the U.S. recommended daily allowance (RDA) for 4 months versus placebo. The supplement was designed to raise vitamin-mineral intake up to the levels currently recommended by the National Academy of Sciences for children aged 6 to 11 years.


OUTCOME MEASURE
Violent and nonviolent delinquency as measured by official school disciplinary records.


RESULTS
Of the 468 students randomly assigned to active or placebo tablets, the 80 who were disciplined at least once between September 1st and May 1st served as the research sample. During intervention, the 40 children who received active tablets were disciplined, on average, 1 time each, a 47% lower mean rate of antisocial behavior than the 1.875 times each for the 40 children who received placebos (95% confidence interval, 29% to 65%, < 5 .020). The children who took active tablets produced lower rates of antisocial behavior in 8 types of recorded infractions: threats/fighting, vandalism, being disrespectful, disorderly conduct, defiance, obscenities, refusal to work or serve, endangering others, and nonspecified offenses.


CONCLUSION
Poor nutritional habits in children that lead to low concentrations of water-soluble vitamins in blood, impair brain function and subsequently cause violence and other serious antisocial behavior. Correction of nutrient intake, either through a well-balanced diet or low-dose vitamin-mineral supplementation, corrects the low concentrations of vitamins in blood, improves brain function and subsequently lowers institutional violence and antisocial behavior by almost half. This paper adds to the literature by enabling previous research to be generalized from older incarcerated subjects with a history of antisocial behavior to a normal population of younger children in an educational setting.","[{'authorId': '5378108', 'name': 'S.

Suicide attempts constitute a major risk factor for completed suicide, yet few interventions specifically designed to prevent suicide attempts have been evaluated.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the effectiveness of a 10-session cognitive therapy intervention designed to prevent repeat suicide attempts in adults who recently attempted suicide.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Randomized controlled trial of adults (N = 120) who attempted suicide and were evaluated at a hospital emergency department within 48 hours of the attempt. Potential participants (N = 350) were consecutively recruited from October 1999 to September 2002; 66 refused to participate and 164 were ineligible. Participants were followed up for 18 months.


INTERVENTION
Cognitive therapy or enhanced usual care with tracking and referral services.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Incidence of repeat suicide attempts and number of days until a repeat suicide attempt. Suicide ideation (dichotomized), hopelessness, and depression severity at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.


RESULTS
From baseline to the 18-month assessment, 13 participants (24.1%) in the cognitive therapy group and 23 participants (41.6%) in the usual care group made at least 1 subsequent suicide attempt (asymptotic z score, 1.97; P = .049). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the estimated 18-month reattempt-free probability in the cognitive therapy group was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.85) and in the usual care group was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.44-0.70). Participants in the cognitive therapy group had a significantly lower reattempt rate (Wald chi2(1) = 3.9; P = .049) and were 50% less likely to reattempt suicide than participants in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.997). The severity of self-reported depression was significantly lower for the cognitive therapy group than for the usual care group at 6 months (P= .02), 12 months (P = .009), and 18 months (P = .046). The cognitive therapy group reported significantly less hopelessness than the usual care group at 6 months (P = .045). There were no significant differences between groups based on rates of suicide ideation at any assessment point.

Fifty-seven Hong Kong Chinese SARS survivors completed self-administered questionnaires that assessed anxiety and depression symptoms, perceived health, appraisal, and post-traumatic growth. Results of regression analyses showed that factors of appraisal (‘perceived impact’ and ‘coping efficacy’) and of post-traumatic growth (‘personal growth’ and ‘relationship growth’) respectively accounted for a significant portion of variance in all of the outcome measures, after the effects of demographic and clinical features were controlled. Path analyses revealed that ‘perceived impact’ and ‘coping efficacy’ had direct and indirect effects on all outcome variables, whereas ‘personal growth’ only had a direct effect on depression. Appraisal and post-traumatic growth might be important constructs in accounting for differential outcomes in SARS survivors.

Mostly because of methodological problems, almost ¾ of an initially identified 595 studies had to be excluded. Most studies appear to have been conducted without sufficient theoretical background. To put the results into perspective, we briefly summarize the major theoretical approaches from both East and West. The 163 studies that allowed the calculation of effect sizes exhibited medium average effects (r = .28 for all studies and r = .27 for the n = 125 studies from reviewed journals), which cannot be explained by mere relaxation or cognitive restructuring effects. In general, results were strongest (medium to large) for changes in emotionality and relationship issues, less strong (about medium) for measures of attention, and weakest (small to medium) for more cognitive measures. However, specific findings varied across different approaches to meditation (transcendental meditation, mindfulness meditation, and other meditation techniques). Surprisingly, meditation experience only partially covaried with long-term impact on the variables examined. In general, the dependent variables used cover only some of the content areas about which predictions can be made from already existing theories about meditation; still, such predictions lack precision at present. We conclude that to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of why and how meditation works, emphasis should be placed on the development of more precise theories and measurement devices.","[{'authorId': '3203620', 'name': 'P.

The relationship between psychological factors and obesity has become a hot topic in psychosomatic research. The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies in Chinese adolescents with different weight status.


METHODS
Using stratified random cluster sampling, 700 and 321 adolescents were defined as adolescents with overweight status and obese status, respectively. One thousand and twenty-one adolescents with normal-weight status were also selected. All participants completed a general questionnaire and Chinese version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.


RESULTS
Adolescents in the obesity group obtained the highest scores on self-blame and rumination in three groups, and those from the obesity group obtained lower scores on acceptance, positive refocusing, and positive reappraisal than those from normal group (ps < 0.05). Cognitive emotion regulation strategies had a significant impact on BMI, accounting for 32.0% variance (p < 0.001). Higher scores on self-blame and rumination were associated with higher BMI, but greater acceptance and positive refocusing were associated with lower BMI (ps < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
Self-blame, rumination, acceptance, and positive refocusing have considerable effects on BMI in Chinese adolescents. The causal relationship of CER strategies and BMI should be explained more accurately and thoroughly to prevent and intervene in cases of adolescent obesity.","[{'authorId': '8250870', 'name': 'Y.

Methods The BarOn Emotional Intelligence Scale (EQ-I), WHO Well-Being Questionnaire (WHO-WBQ-22), WHO Quality of Life Measure (WHOQOL-Bref), and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) were administered to 184 patients with type 2 diabetes who volunteered to participate. Thirty-six patients with the lowest test scores on the WHO-WBQ-22, WHOQOL-Bref, and SF-36 were randomized into study and control groups (18 patients each). A 12-week emotional intelligence program was administered to the study group. At the end of the program, scales were readministered to both groups and again at 3 and 6 months. Results There were no differences between the quality of life, well-being, and emotional intelligence levels of the study and control groups before the commencement of the program ( P > .05). At the conclusion of the program, quality of life, well-being, and emotional intelligence levels of study group patients increased in comparison with those in the control group (P < .001). The positive effect of the program on study groups' quality of life, wellbeing, and emotional intelligence persisted at the 3- and 6-month follow-up.

Recent findings from structural MRI raise the question whether this condition could be associated with a functional uncoupling of the limbic networks and an impaired modulation of emotional stress. To address this, 40 subjects suffering from burnout symptoms attributed to chronic occupational stress and 70 controls were investigated using resting state functional MRI. The participants' ability to up- regulate, down-regulate, and maintain emotion was evaluated by recording their acoustic startle response while viewing neutral and negatively loaded images. Functional connectivity was calculated from amygdala seed regions, using explorative linear correlation analysis. Stressed subjects were less capable of down-regulating negative emotion, but had normal acoustic startle responses when asked to up-regulate or maintain emotion and when no regulation was required. The functional connectivity between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex correlated with the ability to down-regulate negative emotion. This connectivity was significantly weaker in the burnout group, as was the amygdala connectivity with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the motor cortex, whereas connectivity from the amygdala to the cerebellum and the insular cortex were stronger. In subjects suffering from chronic occupational stress, the functional couplings within the emotion- and stress-processing limbic networks seem to be altered, and associated with a reduced ability to down-regulate the response to emotional stress, providing a biological substrate for a further facilitation of the stress condition.","[{'authorId': '2635434', 'name': 'A.

Findings supported the positive relationships between mastery, approach goals, and academic performance, as well as the negative association between avoidance goals and academic performance. The model revealed that self-efficacy may play supportive and protective roles by increasing the positive effect of mastery and performance-approach goals and reducing the negative effect of avoidance goals on academic performance, respectively.

Sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (sNSC) is the most common form of NSC. The condition is associated with a high prevalence (> 50%) of deficits in executive function. The authors employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI to evaluate whether hypothesized structural and functional connectivity differences underlie the observed neurocognitive morbidity of sNSC.


METHODS
Using a 3-T Siemens Trio MRI system, the authors collected DTI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI data in 8 adolescent patients (mean age 12.3 years) with sNSC that had been previously corrected via total vault cranioplasty and 8 control children (mean age 12.3 years) without craniosynostosis. Data were analyzed using the FMRIB Software Library and BioImageSuite.


RESULTS
Analyses of the DTI data revealed white matter alterations approaching statistical significance in all supratentorial lobes. Statistically significant group differences (sNSC < control group) in mean diffusivity were localized to the right supramarginal gyrus. Analysis of the resting-state seed in relation to whole-brain data revealed significant increases in negative connectivity (anticorrelations) of Brodmann area 8 to the prefrontal cortex (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] center of mass coordinates [x, y, z]: -6, 53, 6) and anterior cingulate cortex (MNI coordinates 6, 43, 14) in the sNSC group relative to controls. Furthermore, in the sNSC patients versus controls, the Brodmann area 7, 39, and 40 seed had decreased connectivity to left angular gyrus (MNI coordinates -31, -61, 34), posterior cingulate cortex (MNI coordinates 13, -52, 18), precuneus (MNI coordinates 10, -55, 54), left and right parahippocampus (MNI coordinates -13, -52, 2 and MNI coordinates 11, -50, 2, respectively), lingual (MNI coordinates -11, -86, -10), and fusiform gyri (MNI coordinates -30, -79, -18). Intrinsic connectivity analysis also revealed altered connectivity between central nodes in the default mode network in sNSC relative to controls; the left and right posterior cingulate cortices (MNI coordinates -5, -35, 34 and MNI coordinates 6, -42, 39, respectively) were negatively correlated to right hemisphere precuneus (MNI coordinates 6, -71, 46), while the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (MNI coordinates 6, 34, -8) was negatively correlated to right middle frontal gyrus (MNI coordinates 40, 4, 33). All group comparisons (sNSC vs controls) were conducted at a whole brain-corrected threshold of p < 0.05.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates altered neocortical structural and functional connectivity in sNSC that may, in part or substantially, underlie the neuropsychological deficits commonly reported in this population. Future studies combining analysis of multimodal MRI and clinical characterization data in larger samples of participants are warranted.","[{'authorId': '40039169', 'name': 'Joel Beckett'}, {'authorId': '2060957541', 'name': 'Eric D.

In actual practice, the task is so difficult that some sampling bias occurs in almost all studies to a lesser or greater degree. In order to assess the degree of this bias, the informed reader of medical literature should have some understanding of the population from which the sample was drawn. The ultimate decision on whether the results of a particular study can be generalized to a larger population depends on this understanding. The subsequent deliberations dwell on sampling strategies for different types of research and also a brief description of different sampling methods.","[{'authorId': '1808494', 'name': 'A.

6a0888f0dcdd7b7821f4c09966d7638032bf9dc5,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating mental disorder that occurs following exposure to a traumatic event. However, most individuals do not develop PTSD following even a severe trauma, leading to a search for new variables, such as genetic and other molecular variation, associated with vulnerability and resilience in the face of trauma exposure. Method: We examined whether serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) promoter genotype and methylation status modified the association between number of traumatic events experienced and PTSD in a subset of 100 individuals from the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study. Results: Number of traumatic events was strongly associated with risk of PTSD. Neither SLC6A4 genotype nor methylation status was associated with PTSD in main effects models. However, SLC6A4 methylation levels modified the effect of the number of traumatic events on PTSD after controlling for SLC6A4 genotype. Persons with more traumatic events were at increased risk for PTSD, but only at lower methylation levels. At higher methylation levels, individuals with more traumatic events were protected from this disorder. This interaction was observed whether the outcome was PTSD diagnosis, symptom severity, or number of symptoms. Conclusions: Gene‐specific methylation patterns may offer potential molecular signatures of increased risk for and resilience to PTSD.

Chichester, England: John Wiley & Sons. 1997. 857 pp. ISBN 0-471-95913-8. $140.00 cloth. Steve Duck, Lee West, and Linda Acitelli underscore in the introduction to the Handbook of Personal Relationships the sentiment that ""real life relationships . . . happen to real people while. . . researchers are busy making other models"" (p. 20). Their main thesis is that a discrepancy exists between real life relationships and relationships depicted in research. To support that contention, they present several criticisms, two of which are emphasized here. They argue that researchers represent relationships too simplistically, and little focus is placed on sociocultural contexts of relationships. Contributors address the thesis by demonstrating how research can represent complexities of relating and relationships, thereby illustrating how the criticism can be overcome or by stressing sociocultural contexts in which relationships exist. Chapters in Section 1, ""Developmental Psychology,"" demonstrate that the study of relationship learning has moved beyond the dyadic level to the more complex systems level of influence. For example, Ross Parke and Robin O'Neil review research on family subsystems that describe how subsystems influence relationship learning and the processes through which that learning occurs. Maria von Salisch builds on Parke and O'Neil's work by describing how affect regulation is learned through experiencing emotions elicited by others. Two themes pervade Section 2, ""Social Psychology."" The first concerns how, within interdependent relationships, motives conflict. converge, and resolve into individual and joint outcomes. This theme is addressed through a data-analytic approach and through the perspectives of two theories-interdependence and self-expansion. The second theme concerns origins of personal dispositions leading to conflicts in relationships and is addressed in chapters covering evolutionary approaches to relationships, adult attachment formation, and interracial ties. For example, Stanley Gaines and William Ickes present the origins of differences between contrasting opinions of interracial relationships by examining such relationships from two perspectives-that of individuals observing them (outsiders) and that of individuals engaging in them (insiders). Gaines and Ickes explain that previous research, capturing only the outsiders' perspective, was incomplete. They argue that outsiders' and insiders' perspectives are needed to understand interracial relationships and that the interaction of these perspectives is important because tensions between the two can affect relationships. Complexities of interracial relationships are made more evident by records of frank conversations among insiders communicating with one another via the Internet. …","[{'authorId': '52540384', 'name': 'S.

Based on the prediction that in the marketplace of 2025, technology (e.g., service-providing humanoid robots) will be melded into numerous service experiences, this article spotlights technology’s ability to engage customers on a social level as a critical advancement of technology infusions. Specifically, it introduces the novel concept of automated social presence (ASP; i.e., the extent to which technology makes customers feel the presence of another social entity) to the services literature. The authors develop a typology that highlights different combinations of automated and human social presence in organizational frontlines and indicates literature gaps, thereby emphasizing avenues for future research. Moreover, the article presents a conceptual framework that focuses on (a) how the relationship between ASP and several key service and customer outcomes is mediated by social cognition and perceptions of psychological ownership as well as (b) three customer-related factors that moderate the relationship between ASP and social cognition and psychological ownership (i.e., a customer’s relationship orientation, tendency to anthropomorphize, and technology readiness). Finally, propositions are presented that can be a catalyst for future work to enhance the understanding of how technology infusion, particularly service robots, influences customers’ frontline experiences in the future.","[{'authorId': '2253338833', 'name': 'Dhruv Petersen'}, {'authorId': '2088604778', 'name': 'J.

Two hundred and thirty-two academics from 13 higher educational institutions in Shanghai, mainland China, responded to three self-report inventories, each assessing academics’ emotions in teaching, efficacy in teaching and research, and teaching styles, respectively. Results showed that academics’ emotions in teaching statistically predicted teaching styles, both directly and indirectly – through academic self-efficacy. Findings have enriched the literature on emotions in teaching, that on teaching styles, and that on teacher/academic self-efficacy.

Design Self-report panel data (2000, 2004) on mental health (symptoms of depression and generalised anxiety) and job demands, control and insecurity. Changes in exposures and outcomes were calculated by subtracting wave 1 from wave 2 scores. Changes in mental health were regressed onto changes in work conditions, adjusting for confounders. Sensitivity analyses assessed reverse causation, floor and ceiling effects. Setting Two adjoining cities in south-east Australia. Participants 1975 employees aged 40–48 years, 50% (n=995) male. Results Improvements and deterioration in each work condition were associated with corresponding improvements or deterioration in mental health. The association between changes in job insecurity and symptoms of depression was B=0.386 (95% CI 0.245 to 0.527) and with anxiety symptoms was B=0.434 (95% CI 0.267 to 0.601). Similarly, changes in job control were associated with changes in depressive (B=−0.548; 95% CI −0.791 to −0.304) and anxiety symptoms (B=−0.608; 95% CI −0.896 to −0.319) as were changes in job demands (B depression=0.386; 95% CI 0.245 to 0.527; B anxiety=0.434; 95% CI 0.267 to 0.601). Excluding people with severe symptoms at baseline did not alter the findings; however, path analyses indicated that depression may precede a worsening of work conditions. Conclusion Among mid-aged employees, deteriorating work conditions may amplify population health burdens, especially anxiety. Furthermore, better quality jobs, combining an array of positive conditions, could alleviate major population health burdens.","[{'authorId': '5966025', 'name': 'L.

Our interest in evaluating this type of intervention is based on the increasing accessibility of the Internet today, the growth of Internet-based interventions for various psychopathological problems, and the observation that despite the prevalence of stress among university students, only a fraction of students ever seek professional help. Methodology: “I’m managing my stress” (“Je gère mon stresse”), an Internet-based self-help program composed of four sessions, was examined in this study. The aforementioned program is based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and was inspired by the “Funambule” program in Quebec. Four questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Scale of Satisfaction in Studies, and General Health Questionnaire) uploaded online were answered thrice: during “preintervention”, “postintervention”, and “follow-up” stages, the latter of which occurred three months after the intervention. The sample comprised 128 university students, with the majority being women (81.25%). The subjects were divided randomly into two groups (an experimental group and a control group that did not follow the program). Results: The self-esteem scores of the control group were significantly higher than those of the experimental group at the preintervention stage, but this difference disappeared at the postintervention and follow-up stages. There were also significantly lower scores on the General Health Questionnaire subfactors of somatic symptoms and anxiety/insomnia in the experimental group than in the control group during the postintervention stage, though no differences were observed before the intervention. These differences no longer remained after three months. ANOVA revealed significant effects of the intervention over time in the experimental group. Effects were observed at both the postintervention and follow-up stages for self-esteem, perceived stress, satisfaction in studies, and in the somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia and severe depression aspects of the General Health Questionnaire (Cohen’s d = 0.38 to 4.58). In contrast, no effects were observed in the control group. Conclusion: This type of Internet-based program has the ability to reach a large number of students due to its rather short format and accessibility. It has already shown improvements in terms of the levels of perceived stress, psychological distress and satisfaction with studies. The option of online interventions could appeal specifically to students who do not seek professional help. However, even though these results are promising at the postintervention stage, they are limited, as indicated by the lack of significant differences between the two groups after the initial three months of follow-up. We still, specifically, need to improve this intervention program and, generally, need more research to address the methodological problems raised by this type of intervention.

6ae266e05cc8fe8d4dceaf46714fca8bc1cad53a,"Introduction: There has been an increase in a number of orphanages and children living in orphanages in last few years. The children living in orphanages often have psychological problems among which anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem are considered to be most prominent. Yoga is a noninvasive, cost-effective, and safe intervention among complementary and alternative medicine which is known to have a positive impact on psychological problems. Aims: The present pilot study intended to assess the effect of a two week Yoga intervention on anxiety, depression, and self-esteem of adolescents and young adults living in an orphanage. Materials and Methods: Adolescent and young adults participants who were the permanent residents of an orphanage (n = 34; males = 27, females = 7) between age ranges of 12–20 years underwent 2 week of Yoga intervention. Yoga intervention comprised Asana (Yogic postures), Pranayama (Yogic breathing practices), and Dharana-Dhyana (Yogic relaxation techniques) for 1 h daily over 15 days. Hospital anxiety and depression and Rosenberg self-esteem scale were administered at baseline and after the intervention to assess anxiety, depression, and self-esteem, respectively. Results: There was a significant reduction (P = 0.001) in anxiety, depression, and significant improvement in self-esteem (P = 0.001) at the end of 2 weeks Yoga intervention. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that 2 weeks of Yoga practice potentially reduced anxiety and depression and improved self-esteem of orphanage adolescents and young adults. These findings need confirmation from studies with a larger sample size and randomized controlled design, which are implicated in the future.","[{'authorId': '23208092', 'name': 'Ravishankar Tejvani'}, {'authorId': '4466705', 'name': 'K.

Optimal mental health care is dependent upon sensitive and early detection of mental health problems. We have introduced a state-of-the-art method for the current study for remote behavioral monitoring that transports assessment out of the clinic and into the environments in which individuals negotiate their daily lives. The objective of this study was to examine whether the information captured with multimodal smartphone sensors can serve as behavioral markers for one's mental health. We hypothesized that (a) unobtrusively collected smartphone sensor data would be associated with individuals' daily levels of stress, and (b) sensor data would be associated with changes in depression, stress, and subjective loneliness over time.


METHOD
A total of 47 young adults (age range: 19-30 years) were recruited for the study. Individuals were enrolled as a single cohort and participated in the study over a 10-week period. Participants were provided with smartphones embedded with a range of sensors and software that enabled continuous tracking of their geospatial activity (using the Global Positioning System and wireless fidelity), kinesthetic activity (using multiaxial accelerometers), sleep duration (modeled using device-usage data, accelerometer inferences, ambient sound features, and ambient light levels), and time spent proximal to human speech (i.e., speech duration using microphone and speech detection algorithms). Participants completed daily ratings of stress, as well as pre- and postmeasures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; Spitzer, Kroenke, & Williams, 1999), stress (Perceived Stress Scale; Cohen et al., 1983), and loneliness (Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale; Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980).


RESULTS
Mixed-effects linear modeling showed that sensor-derived geospatial activity (p < .05), sleep duration (p < .05), and variability in geospatial activity (p < .05), were associated with daily stress levels. Penalized functional regression showed associations between changes in depression and sensor-derived speech duration (p < .05), geospatial activity (p < .05), and sleep duration (p < .05). Changes in loneliness were associated with sensor-derived kinesthetic activity (p < .01).


CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
Smartphones can be harnessed as instruments for unobtrusive monitoring of several behavioral indicators of mental health. Creative leveraging of smartphone sensing could provide novel opportunities for close-to-invisible psychiatric assessment at a scale and efficiency that far exceeds what is currently feasible with existing assessment technologies.","[{'authorId': '101333432', 'name': 'D.

6b0633d25b90063a4f1fa16a0f52577e628a05ed,"Background A modifiable risk factor for many diseases is physical inactivity. In this modern era, physical activity is acknowledged as a vital strategy to promote good health. According to the WHO, regular physical activity has various benefits for psycho-physical health. Decreased physical inactivity is happening in China due to the increased participation of the Chinese population in physical activity. The human body needs a specific level of physical activity to maintain good health. Objective The main aim of the present study was to assess the Chinese people’s understanding of physical activity and participation in physical activity as a preventive measure against different diseases. Methods The present study was exploratory and conducted in the Kunshan county-level city in Jiangsu Province, China. A well-designed questionnaire was used to collect the data from the survey participants. A total of 3390 residents were selected from 1300 households through a simple random sampling technique. The collected data were analyzed through SPSS software. Both univariate and bivariate analysis were performed. Results The survey results showed that the majority of women are participating in physical activity. Most of the Kunshan people participate in physical activity one time or more than one time per week. They perform 30–60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity to improve physical fitness, recreation, and disease prevention. Fitness walking is the most common type of physical activity among Kunshan people, and most of them participate in physical activity at night. Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that post-test ranks are statistically higher than pre-test ranks (P<0.0039, 0.0039, 0.0039, 0.0020, 0.0001, 0.0156, 0.0313). Conclusion The study results showed that physical activity plays a catalyst role in improving human health on a natural path. It reduces the risk factor of non-communicable diseases and promotes general wellbeing. These findings show that physical activity level increases in Chinese society as more people participate in physical activity for health-being.","[{'authorId': '51286012', 'name': 'Zulkaif Ahmed Saqib'}, {'authorId': '2087363148', 'name': 'Jianhui Dai'}, {'authorId': '5231590', 'name': 'R.

The previous leap in understanding occurred 60 years ago, which led us to incorporate psychopharmacology into our curricula to address the chemical basis of neurotransmitter function, especially as explained through the then-popular catecholamine hypothesis. The current revolution is broader, consisting of the rapidly accumulating knowledge of how inflammation, microbiome imbalance (gut dysbiosis), oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondrial output affect brain function. Suitable interventions for fighting inflammation, restoring normal gut function, reducing oxidative stress, and improving mitochondrial metabolism incorporate lifestyle variables, including nutrients and probiotics.

Despite evidence that body dissatisfaction predicts the onset of eating pathology and depression, few prospective studies have investigated predictors of body dissatisfaction.


METHOD
We examined risk factors for body dissatisfaction using prospective data from 531 adolescent boys and girls.


RESULTS
Elevations in body mass, negative affect, and perceived pressure to be thin from peers, but not thin-ideal internalization, social support deficits, or perceived pressure to be thin from family, dating partners, or media, predicted increases in body dissatisfaction. Gender moderated the effect of body mass on body dissatisfaction and revealed a significant quadratic component for boys, but not girls. Gender also moderated negative affect.


DISCUSSION
Results support the assertion that certain sociocultural, biologic, and interpersonal factors increase the risk for body dissatisfaction, but differ for boys and girls. Results provided little support for other accepted risk factors for body dissatisfaction.","[{'authorId': '4397817', 'name': 'Katherine E Presnell'}, {'authorId': '5168449', 'name': 'S.

These questionnaires explore various domains, such as those delineated by the SF-36, Beck Depression Inventory, etc. These studies often document the impact of the medical illness on the patients’ perception of their quality of life. Moreover, the impact of quality of life domains on medical outcomes, as well as the relationships between these various domains have been noted. However, developing strategies to improve various quality of life domains has proved to be difficult. For example, although depression is documented as the most common psychological problem encountered in ESRD patients, few studies have looked at specific treatment strategies to improve the depressive symptoms of these patients [13]. And, studies that have developed strategies to treat depression have emphasized the difficulties encountered in employing successful algorithms [13]. No studies have documented that addressing or treating quality of life problems improves patient outcomes. Nevertheless, it is now recommended by K/DOQI that quality of life issues be monitored on an ongoing basis in ESRD patients [14]. The purpose of this monitoring is to define and document the quality of life status of the patient, hopefully identify therapies that can improve the patients’ quality of life, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Spirituality has been considered by some investigators to be an important arena to focus on in assessing the quality of life of patients. Several questionnaires have been developed to more closely examine the spirituality of patients [2–7,15,16].

6be77f85bb4ce0565b3add7d6c374c9b7f561a7a,"In recent years, an explosion of neuroimaging studies has examined cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing the way one thinks about a stimulus in order to change its affective impact. Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala, but they offer competing visions of how this is accomplished. One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala, whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC, and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions. This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus, and these altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala.","[{'authorId': '4522200', 'name': 'J.

This text argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, ignoring a crucial range of abilities that matter immensely in terms of how we do in life. Drawing on brain and behavioural research, the author shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors add up to a different way of succeeding in life - one the author terms ""emotional intelligence"". Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness and impulse control, persistence, zeal and self-motivation, empathy and social deftness. These are the qualities that mark people that excel. They are also the hallmarks of character and self-discipline, of altruism and compassion. As Goleman demonstrates, the personal costs of deficits in emotional intelligence can range from problems in marriage and poor physical health in adults to eating disorders and depression in children. But the news is hopeful. Emotional intelligence is not fixed at birth. Goleman's argument gives insights into the brain architecture underlying emotion and rationality. He shows how emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened in all of us. Since the emotional lessons a child learns actually sculpt the brain's circuitry, Goleman provides detailed guidance as to how parents and schools can benefit from this.","[{'authorId': '32297977', 'name': 'D.

6cb8f153348a18cfa0573a585e03c4e98cb8d892,"Over the past ten years, increasing attention has been given to how workers express emotions in a variety of work settings (Ashforth and Humphrey, 1995; Rafaeli and Sutton, 1987, 1989; Sutton, 1991; Wharton and Erickson, 1993). An underresearched, yet critical, aspect of the literature on emotions in organizational life concerns employers' attempts to control and direct how employees display emotions to customers. Emotional labor, generally defined as the act of expressing organizationally-desired emotions during service transactions (Ashforth and Humphrey, 1993; Hochschild, 1983), is the central focus of this study. This article seeks to extend previous theoretical and empirical research on emotional labor in four ways. First, a more rigorous conceptualization of emotional labor is presented. By drawing on previous emotional labor studies, psychological and anthropological research on emotions, and impression management studies, a three-component conceptualization of emotional labor will be advanced. The framework presented here suggests that emotional labor can best be described in terms of frequency of emotional labor, duration of emotional labor, and emotional dissonance experienced as a result of having to express emotions one may not actually feel. The second objective is to identify the organizational and job characteristics which might predict emotional labor. Previous researchers (Adelmann, 1989; Ashforth and Humphrey, 1993; Hochschild, 1983; Wharton, 1993) have suggested, but rarely tested, variables which may help to predict which work roles will require regulation of emotional expression and what conditions might influence employees' willingness and ability to express sanctioned emotions. The third objective is to explore the consequences of performing emotional labor on employees' well-being. Previous research has implicitly or explicitly concluded that emotional labor has negative and dysfunctional consequences for workers (Adelmann, 1989; Erickson, 1991; Hochschild, 1983). This study suggests the possibility that under certain conditions, performing emotional labor actually leads to favorable attitudinal and role behavior outcomes. Finally, the article examines the implications of this research for more effective management of emotions during service transactions. The rapid and significant increase in the number of jobs which require regulated displays of emotion, as well as the potential impact of emotional displays on service quality and customer satisfaction, certainly makes this issue one worthy of additional attention. THEORY Conceptualization of Emotional Labor According to Hochschild (1983), jobs involving regulated displays of emotion possess three characteristics: (1) they entail voice or facial contact with the public; (2) they require the worker to produce an emotional state or reaction in the customer; and (3) they provide the employer an opportunity to control the emotional activities of the employee. Displaying organizationally-sanctioned emotions to customers or clients has been argued to be a form of ""labor"" since it requires effort, planning, anticipation, and adjustment to situational factors in order to publicly display emotions that employees may not necessarily privately feel (James, 1989). Frequency of Interaction. A categorization of jobs requiring emotional labor provided by Hochschild (1983) established the foundation from which virtually every existing empirical study of emotional labor has since proceeded. The premise here is that external stakeholders (customers or clients) are more likely to comply with organizational goals when the affective bonds of liking, trust, and respect have been established through appropriate employee behavior. Thus, the more a work role requires contact with other people, the greater the organization's need to rely upon regulated displays of emotion to ensure compliance with organizational goals. …","[{'authorId': '30912713', 'name': 'J.

Methods This case–control study involved 96 patients with FM and 94 healthy women. The SD diagnosis was based on a psychiatric interview in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria. Mood and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview. Personality disorders were diagnosed according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, Revised Third Edition Personality Disorders. Results Fifty of the 96 patients (52.1%) suffered from SD. The most common SD was lack of sexual desire (n=36, 37.5%) and arousal disorder (n=10, 10.4%). Of the 96 patients, 45 (46.9%) had a mood or anxiety disorder and 13 (13.5%) had a personality disorder. The most common mood, anxiety, and personality disorders were major depression (26%), generalized anxiety disorder (8.3%), and histrionic personality disorder (10.4%).

Self-compassion is theorized to represent a system with 6 constituent components: self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and reduced self-judgment, isolation and overidentification. There has been controversy as to whether a total score on the SCS or if separate scores representing compassionate versus uncompassionate self-responding should be used. The current study examined the factor structure of the SCS using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) to examine 5 distinct models: 1-factor, 2-factor correlated, 6-factor correlated, single-bifactor (1 general self-compassion factor and 6 group factors), and 2-bifactor models (2 correlated general factors each with 3 group factors representing compassionate or uncompassionate self-responding). Results indicated that a 1- and 2-factor solution to the SCS had inadequate fit in every sample examined using both CFA and ESEM, whereas fit was excellent using ESEM for the 6-factor correlated, single-bifactor and correlated 2-bifactor models. However, factor loadings for the correlated 2-bifactor models indicated that 2 separate factors were not well specified. A general factor explained 95% of the reliable item variance in the single-bifactor model. Results support use of the SCS to examine 6 subscale scores (representing the constituent components of self-compassion) or a total score (representing overall self-compassion), but not separate scores representing compassionate and uncompassionate self-responding.","[{'authorId': '2969088', 'name': 'K.

We review previous research on ER in relation to stress and psychopathology, and note that a significant gap in prior research is that is has focused almost exclusively on a small number of deliberative ER strategies. We then highlight growing evidence that automatic and habitual forms of ER, characterized by low resource demands and low conscious awareness, have an important influence on the stress response and its link to psychopathology and well-being. We propose the Dynamic Fit Model of Stress and ER, which posits that (1) both deliberative and automatic ER contribute to the link between stress and psychopathology; (2) the fit between stress demands and ER strategy selection can be mapped along the dimensions of automaticity and flexibility; and (3) negative effects of stress on well-being and psychological functioning emerge when there is a poor fit between stress demands and ER. We discuss how the model delineates elements defining a “good fit” or “poor fit” and how the model can be used to articulate an agenda for future research and hypothesis generation.","[{'authorId': '23134429', 'name': 'Sarah Myruski'}, {'authorId': '7921251', 'name': 'Samantha Denefrio'}, {'authorId': '1397220437', 'name': 'T.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the psychometric properties for parent and teacher ratings in the Danish version of SDQ for different age groups of boys and girls. Methods The Danish versions of the SDQ were distributed to a total of 71,840 parent and teacher raters of 5-, 7- and 10- to 12-year-old children included in four large scale Danish cohorts. The internal reliability was assessed and exploratory factor analyses were carried out to replicate the originally proposed five factor structure. Mean scores and percentiles were examined in order to differentiate between low, medium and high levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties. Results The original five factor structure could be substantially confirmed. The Conduct items however did not solely load on the proposed Conduct scale and the Conduct scale was further contaminated by non-conduct items. Positively worded items tended to load on the Prosocial scale. This was more so the case for teachers than for parents. Parent and teacher means and percentiles were found to be lower compared to British figures but similar to or only slightly lower than those found in the other Nordic countries. The percentiles for girls were generally lower than for boys, markedly so for the teacher hyperactivity ratings. Conclusions The study supports the usefulness of the SDQ as a screening tool for boys and girls across age groups and raters in the general Danish population.","[{'authorId': '3842114', 'name': 'J.

Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (3, Serial No. 150). A distinction was made between the general level of a person's IQ (i.e., the average of his scores across age) and his profile contour (i.e., the developmental pattern of inflections in performance). Most research has focused on the general level of IQ and its correlates; this project systematically investigated patterns of IQ change with data from the Fels Longitudinal Study. Normal middle-class children changed an average of 28.5 IQ points between 21/2 and 17 years of age, and one in seven displayed shifts of more than 40 points. While siblings were more similar in their general level of IQ than unrelated children matched or unmatched for social class, the pattern of developmental changes in childhood IQs or infant DQs was not more similar among siblings than among unrelated children. Twins and triplets scored lower in general level and were less variable in IQ over age than singletons, thus potentially qualifying attempts to generalize IQ change results based upon multiple-birth samples to singletons. Parent-child IQ correlations were higher when the parent was assessed as an adult than if both parent and child were tested at the same chronological ages. A sample of 80 subjects who had relatively complete IQ data (maximum of 17 tests) between 2/2 and 17 years were clustered into five groups which represented different patterns of IQ change over age. These profiles were relatively simple linear or quadratic trends and not random fluctuations about a constant value. Major inflection points occurred at 6 and 10 years of age. It was not obvious that these patterns were simple products of repeated testing or the changing nature of the IQ test. The children in the five IQ profile clusters had parents who were different in the extent to which they attempted to accelerate their child's development and the severity of punishments they administered. These parental correlates appeared to hold up even when parental education and IQ as well as the general level of the child's IQ were statistically controlled. Given the assumptions prompted by these data, the changing nature of environmental circumstances across the childhood years for a given individual may be as potent in changing IQ as the differences between family environments.

THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN IQ Several reviews of the literature on the development of mental performance are available (Bayley 1970; Bloom 1964; Pinneau 1961). However, most of the research surveyed involves correlations between mental test performance at several different ages and correlations between personality and social variables with IQ at one age versus another. Such research strategies are valuable and have yielded important results, but they are ""developmental"" only in the sense that data are available at several ages on the same subjects and correlational relationships are derived within and across age periods. Because the correlation coefficient is independent of the means of the distributions, it is possible to obtain high correlational stability of IQ across age but marked fluctuations in the group mean. In short, cross-age correlations reveal little about the nature of absolute changes in level of performance, and they provide only partial information about individual differences in developmental pattern. This project focuses on developmental patterns of change in the level of mental performance as assessed by traditional intelligence tests.","[{'authorId': '143887530', 'name': 'R.

It examined how perceived academic control and academic emotions predict undergraduate students' academic success, conceptualized as both low dropout intention and high achievement (indicated by GPA). A cross-sectional survey was administered to 883 undergraduate students across all disciplines of a German STEM orientated university. The study additionally compared freshman students (N = 597) vs. second-year students (N = 286). Using structural equation modeling, for the overall sample of undergraduate students we found that perceived academic control positively predicted enjoyment and achievement, as well as negatively predicted boredom and anxiety. The prediction of dropout intention by perceived academic control was fully mediated via anxiety. When taking perceived academic control into account, we found no specific impact of enjoyment or boredom on the intention to dropout and no specific impact of all three academic emotions on achievement. The multi-group analysis showed, however, that perceived academic control, enjoyment, and boredom among second-year students had a direct relationship with dropout intention. A major contribution of the present study was demonstrating the important roles of perceived academic control and anxiety in undergraduate students' academic success.

6e9dd62deacc97a6fa07182323d1d9bc560e1ea2,"OBJECTIVES
To determine any long-term effects, 6 and 8 years after childhood enrollment, of the randomly assigned 14-month treatments in the NIMH Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA; N = 436); to test whether attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom trajectory through 3 years predicts outcome in subsequent years; and to examine functioning level of the MTA adolescents relative to their non-ADHD peers (local normative comparison group; N = 261).


METHOD
Mixed-effects regression models with planned contrasts at 6 and 8 years tested a wide range of symptom and impairment variables assessed by parent, teacher, and youth report.


RESULTS
In nearly every analysis, the originally randomized treatment groups did not differ significantly on repeated measures or newly analyzed variables (e.g., grades earned in school, arrests, psychiatric hospitalizations, other clinically relevant outcomes). Medication use decreased by 62% after the 14-month controlled trial, but adjusting for this did not change the results. ADHD symptom trajectory in the first 3 years predicted 55% of the outcomes. The MTA participants fared worse than the local normative comparison group on 91% of the variables tested.


CONCLUSIONS
Type or intensity of 14 months of treatment for ADHD in childhood (at age 7.0-9.9 years) does not predict functioning 6 to 8 years later. Rather, early ADHD symptom trajectory regardless of treatment type is prognostic. This finding implies that children with behavioral and sociodemographic advantage, with the best response to any treatment, will have the best long-term prognosis. As a group, however, despite initial symptom improvement during treatment that is largely maintained after treatment, children with combined-type ADHD exhibit significant impairment in adolescence. Innovative treatment approaches targeting specific areas of adolescent impairment are needed.","[{'authorId': '4595013', 'name': 'B. Molina'}, {'authorId': '3643684', 'name': 'S.

N.O., The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the main indicators of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) control on heart rate variability (HRV). We examined 62 patients at the age of 18-45 years with an average T1DM duration of 11.0 (5.0; 18.0) years. HRV in the time and frequency range was evaluated by analyzing a 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram (ECG). The following laboratory parameters were used as markers of course and compensation of T1DM: C-peptide, HbA1c, blood creatinine, albuminuria (AU), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by CKD-EPI formula. In addition, the maximum and minimum blood glucose levels and the blood glucose range (maximum minus minimum blood glucose values) were conducted by continuous glucose monitoring system iPro2 (Medtronic MiniMed, USA). The daily monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) was made in parallel with long term monitoring of blood glucose. Echocardiography in all patients was performed to exclude organic heart disease and the possibility of its influence on HRV. Poor control of T1DM negatively influences HRV through decrease in both frequency and time characteristics. The blood glucose range can be an additional negative factor for cardiovascular system in T1DM patients, regardless of HbA1c, whereas it positively correlates with HRV- relative hypersympathicotonia markers: LF/HF 24-h, ρ =0.43 (p<0.05), LF/HF day ρ =0.37 (p<0.05), ρ =0.38 LF/HF night. Diabetic nephropathy is another factor of cardiovascular disease progression in T1DM, since its criteria have reliably negative (for eGFR) and positive (for AU) correlations of mean force with all HRV characteristics. Selected markers of T1DM control cause 45, 73% of variance in HRV, mainly affecting TP 24-h, TP daytime, VLF 24-h, VLF daytime. Reduction of these frequency HRV characteristics may indicate autonomic neuropathy in patients with poor control of T1DM.","[{'authorId': '2254686841', 'name': 'вул'}, {'authorId': '2254686204', 'name': 'Вернадського'}, {'authorId': '2254686520', 'name': 'Дніпро'}]",309.0,,19.0,disease: meta-analysis and dose-response meta-regression,2020.0

Objective We sought to design a conversational agent that could express empathic support in ways that might approach, or even match, human capabilities. Another aim was to assess how users might appraise such a system. Methods Our system used a corpus-based approach to simulate expressed empathy. Responses from an existing pool of online peer support data were repurposed by the agent and presented to the user. Information retrieval techniques and word embeddings were used to select historical responses that best matched a user’s concerns. We collected ratings from 37,169 users to evaluate the system. Additionally, we conducted a controlled experiment (N=1284) to test whether the alleged source of a response (human or machine) might change user perceptions. Results The majority of responses created by the agent (2986/3770, 79.20%) were deemed acceptable by users. However, users significantly preferred the efforts of their peers (P<.001). This effect was maintained in a controlled study (P=.02), even when the only difference in responses was whether they were framed as coming from a human or a machine. Conclusions Our system illustrates a novel way for machines to construct nuanced and personalized empathic utterances. However, the design had significant limitations and further research is needed to make this approach viable. Our controlled study suggests that even in ideal conditions, nonhuman agents may struggle to express empathy as well as humans.

6f105d2ee3bbe6def8383731cfe8fcee146d0fab,"ABSTRACT In December, 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly to other parts of China and around the world. We aimed to identify high-risk groups whose mental health conditions were vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected from 7,236 self-selected participants measured by anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. People aged < 35 years reported a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms than people aged ≥ 35 years. Healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep compared to other occupations. Healthcare workers/younger people who spent a high level of time (≥ 3 hours/day) had a particular higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms than in those who spent less time (< 1 hours/day and 1-2 hours/day) on the outbreak. During the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers and younger people were at an especially high-risk of displaying psychological impact when they spent too much time thinking about the outbreak. Continuous monitoring of the psychological consequences for high-risk population should become routine as part of targeted interventions during times of crisis.I","[{'authorId': '2108609882', 'name': 'Yeen Huang'}, {'authorId': '2055269802', 'name': 'N.

6f44ddf8e09b6aa7c4ff9ee5187be63b4e5d70e2,"An accurate description of changes in the brain in healthy aging is needed to understand the basis of age-related changes in cognitive function. Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest thinning of the cerebral cortex, volumetric reductions of most subcortical structures, and ventricular expansion. However, there is a paucity of detailed longitudinal studies to support the cross-sectional findings. In the present study, 142 healthy elderly participants (60–91 years of age) were followed with repeated MRI, and were compared with 122 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Volume changes were measured across the entire cortex and in 48 regions of interest. Cortical reductions in the healthy elderly were extensive after only 1 year, especially evident in temporal and prefrontal cortices, where annual decline was ∼0.5%. All subcortical and ventricular regions except caudate nucleus and the fourth ventricle changed significantly over 1 year. Some of the atrophy occurred in areas vulnerable to AD, while other changes were observed in areas less characteristic of the disease in early stages. This suggests that the changes are not primarily driven by degenerative processes associated with AD, although it is likely that preclinical changes associated with AD are superposed on changes due to normal aging in some subjects, especially in the temporal lobes. Finally, atrophy was found to accelerate with increasing age, and this was especially prominent in areas vulnerable to AD. Thus, it is possible that the accelerating atrophy with increasing age is due to preclinical AD.","[{'authorId': '2098063', 'name': 'A. Fjell'}, {'authorId': '2939350', 'name': 'K.

The importance of negative affect and supportive personal relationships are highlighted. Recent data suggest that immune dysregulation may be one core mechanism for a spectrum of conditions associated with aging, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, Type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and frailty and functional decline; production of proinflammatory cytokines that influence these and other conditions can be stimulated directly by negative emotions and indirectly by prolonged infection.","[{'authorId': '1399992318', 'name': 'J.

6fb968167f3c9c76d00d085a57b265cb912ad012,"Data Mining Methods and Models is the second volume of a three-book series on data mining authored by Larose. The following review was performed independently of LaRose’s other two books. Paraphrasing from the Preface, the goal of this book is to “explore the process of data mining from the point of view of model building.” Nevertheless, the reader will soon be aware that this book is not intended to provide a systematic or comprehensive coverage of various data mining algorithms. Instead, it considers supervised learning or predictive modeling only, and it walks the reader through the data mining process merely with a few selected modeling methods such as (generalized) linear modeling and the Bayesian approach. The book has seven chapters. Chapter 1 introduces dimension reduction, with a focus on principal components analysis (PCA) types of techniques. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 provide a detailed coverage of simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression, respectively. Chapter 5 introduces naive Bayes estimation and Bayesian networks. In Chapter 6, the basic idea of genetic algorithms is discussed. Finally, Chapter 7 presents a case study example of modeling response to direct mail marketing within the CRISP (crossindustry standard process) framework. This book is very easy to read, and this is absolutely the strength which many readers, especially those nonstatistically oriented ones, will greatly appreciate. Predictive modeling is perhaps the most technical part in a data mining process. The author has done an excellent job in making this difficult topic accessible to a broad audience. For example, I like the way in which Bayesian networks are introduced in Chapter 5. After the reader goes through a churn example on naive Bayes estimation in a step-by-step manner, Bayesian belief networks become easily understood as natural extensions. The overall style of the book is clear and patient. The main limitation of the book is its limited coverage. An inspired reader would expect to see a much more extended list of topics. Hastie, Tibishirani, and Friedman (2001) gave a full and more technical account of various data mining algorithms. The inclusion of genetic algorithms in Chapter 6 seems novel when compared to Hastie, Tibishirani, and Friedman (2001), but at the same time, a little unexpected as a separate chapter, since a genetic algorithm involves a stochastics search scheme, which is somewhat involved given the elementary nature of this text. Another noteworthy issue is that the author does not make an attempt to distinguish between conventional statistical analysis and data mining. I found a few errors. On Page 25, for example, it should be ai = 1, instead of ai = 1/4. Also, in the frame on the top of Page 211, it might have been “Posterior Odds,” instead of “Posterior Odds Ratio.” The book uses three different software packages to implement the ideas including SPSS with Clementine, Minitab, and WEKA, which might not be appealing. On the other hand, it is justifiable as it allows one to perform data mining with affordable costs. In summary, I recommend this fairly readable book for adoption in a graduate-level introductory course on data mining, especially when the students come from varied backgrounds.","[{'authorId': '2057008238', 'name': 'Phil Wood'}]",8173.0,,6.0,Confirmatory Factor Analysis for Applied Research,2008.0

Path analysis revealed that help-seeking, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support positively influence expectancy-value beliefs and academic performance. Furthermore, the path analysis showed that academic overload and perceived stress exerted a negative influence on expectancy-value beliefs and academic performance, while expectancy-value beliefs had a positive influence with academic performance. Mediation analysis revealed that expectancy-value beliefs to OBE partially mediate the effects of the six psychological variables, namely help-seeking, self-esteem, self-efficacy, social support, academic overload and perceived stress, on academic performance.

One prerequisite of successful emotion regulation is the awareness of emotional states, which in turn is associated with the awareness of bodily signals [interoceptive awareness (IA)]. This study investigated the neural dynamics of reappraisal of emotional responses in 28 participants who differed with respect to IA. Electroencephalography was used to characterize the time course of emotion regulation. We found that reappraisal was accompanied by reduced arousal and significant modulation of late neural responses. What is more, higher IA facilitated downregulation of affect and was associated with more pronounced modulation of underlying neural activity. Therefore, we conclude that IA not only advances the consolidation of somatic markers required for guiding individual behaviour but also creates processing advantages in tasks referring to these bodily markers.","[{'authorId': '4960170', 'name': 'Jürgen Füstös'}, {'authorId': '3128704', 'name': 'K.

This article reviews recent evidence as well as earlier relevant studies regarding the characteristics, assessment, and treatment of anxiety in youth with ASD. Recent findings It is well established that the prevalence of anxiety in youth with an ASD is significantly greater than the prevalence of anxiety in the general population. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of informant, method, and instrument when measuring anxiety in this population. Despite the high prevalence, findings to date have been unable to identify any consistent risk factors for anxiety. New psychological treatments, including modified cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with high functioning ASD and co-occurring anxiety, are emerging. Pharmacological data, however, are scant. Existing studies show that youth with ASD are at increased risk for behavioral activation when taking SSRIs. Summary Clinicians working with youth with ASD are encouraged to routinely screen for anxiety. Until further data are available, clinical judgment is needed when prescribing treatments, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which require close monitoring of side-effects. Research on risk factors, pathophysiology, and treatment of this condition is needed.","[{'authorId': '1681446', 'name': 'R. Vasa'}, {'authorId': '2157684', 'name': 'M.

This study reports on the Type D Scale-14 (DS14) as a standard measure of NA, SI, and Type D. Methods: The study included 3813 participants (2508 from the general population, 573 cardiac patients, 732 hypertension patients). They all filled out the DS14, containing 7-item NA and SI subscales; 275 subjects also completed the NEO-FFI, and 121 patients filled out the DS14 twice. Results: Factor analysis of the DS14 yielded 2 dominant traits; all of the NA and SI items loaded between 0.62 to 0.82 on their corresponding factor (N = 3678). The NA scale covered dysphoria, worry, and irritability; the SI scale covered discomfort in social interactions, reticence, and lack of social poise. The NA and SI scales were internally consistent (&agr; = 0.88/0.86; N = 3678), stable over a 3-month period (test–retest r = 0.72/0.82) and not dependent on mood and health status (N = 121). NA correlated positively with neuroticism (r = 0.68); SI correlated negatively with extraversion (r = −0.59/−0.65). Scale-level factor analysis confirmed the construct validity of the DS14 against the NEO-FFI. Using a cutoff of 10 (NA ≥10 and SI ≥10), 1027 subjects (28%) were classified as Type D, 21% in the general population versus 28% in coronary heart disease and 53% in hypertension (p ≤ .001). Age, sex, and Type D (odds ratio, 3.98; 95% confidence interval, 3.2–4.6; p <.0001) were independently associated with cardiovascular morbidity.

Emotion regulation can be defined as the process, which enables individuals to regulate experiences and express emotions. Objectives: The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) on emotion regulation in methamphetamine-dependent individuals undergoing rehabilitation. Patients and Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study of pretest-posttest design with a control group (where follow-up was also done). The population under study consisted of Methamphetamine-dependent individuals undergoing rehabilitation (MDUR), who were inpatients and outpatients of Tehran’s medical centers. First, 30 MDUR, who were in the withdrawal stage were selected. Then, based on interest to participate in group therapy and matching, they were assigned to the test and control group. Mindfulness-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in eight sessions (eight weeks) with 1.5-hour duration was done. The tool used for this project was Gratz and Roemer’s difficulties in emotion regulation scale. Repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for analyzing the data. Results: Group ACT caused a significant decrease in emotion regulation scores (P < 0.001) and its following dimensions, including non-acceptance (P = 0.03), difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior (P = 0.002), impulse control difficulties (P = 0.027), and limited access to emotion regulation strategies (P = 0.038). However, it could not significantly decrease the lack of emotional awareness and clarity dimensions. Conclusions: Group acceptance and commitment therapy improved emotion regulation in methamphetamine-dependent individuals and enabled them to regulate experiences and express emotions that are very effective in controlling cravings and retention in treatment and prevention of recurrence.","[{'authorId': '113775073', 'name': 'Hamid Khakbaz'}, {'authorId': '6064221', 'name': 'A.

We used structural equation modeling to estimate the reliability of IAc, and the proportions of individual differences in IAc, explained by a trait and occasion-specific effects of situation and person-situation interactions. We assessed IAc in 59 healthy participants (40 women, MAge  = 23.4 years) on three consecutive measurement occasions, approximately 1 week apart, in a rest and poststress condition, using a heartbeat counting and a heartbeat discrimination task. The results showed fair temporal stability (intraclass correlation coefficients ≥ 0.38) and good reliability (Mdn = .63; range .49-.83) for both methods. While around 40% of the variance of a single IAc measurement could be explained by a trait, approximately 27% was accounted for by occasion-specific effects of situation and person-situation interaction. These results suggest that IAc measures are relatively consistent and that situations and person-situation interactions impact IAc as measured at a certain point in time.

We conducted a survey with professionals familiar with interacting with chatbots in a work environment. The results show a significant effect of anthropomorphic design features on perceived usefulness, with a strength four times the size of the effect of functional chatbot features.

In this chapter therefore, beginning with a multi-level perspective taken from the OB literature, we introduce the roles played by emotions and emotional regulation in the workplace and discuss their implications for HRM. We do so by considering five levels of analysis: (1) within-person temporal variations, (2) between persons (individual differences), (3) interpersonal processes; (4) groups and teams, and (5) the organization as a whole. We focus especially on processes of emotional regulation in both self and others, including discussion of emotional labor and emotional intelligence. In the opening sections of the chapter, we discuss the nature of emotions and emotional regulation from an OB perspective by introducing the five-level model, and explaining in particular how emotions and emotional regulation play a role at each of the levels. We then apply these ideas to four major domains of concern to HR managers: (1) recruitment, selection, and socialization; (2) performance management; (3) training and development; and (4) compensation and benefits. In concluding, we stress the interconnectedness of emotions and emotional regulation across the five levels of the model, arguing that emotions and emotional regulation at each level can influence effects at other levels, ultimately culminating in the organization’s affective climate.","[{'authorId': '70294020', 'name': 'N.

Specifically, structural and functional remodeling of several brain regions following prolonged stress exposure have been described; importantly, some of these changes are eventually reversible. Recently, we showed the impact of stress on resting state networks (RSNs), but nothing is known about the plasticity of RSNs after recovery from stress. Herein, we examined the “plasticity” of RSNs, both at functional and structural levels, by comparing the same individuals before and after recovery from the exposure to chronic stress; results were also contrasted with a control group. Here we show that the stressed individuals after recovery displayed a decreased resting functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN), ventral attention network (VAN), and sensorimotor network (SMN) when compared to themselves immediately after stress; however, this functional plastic recovery was only partial as when compared with the control group, as there were still areas of increased connectivity in dorsal attention network (DAN), SMN and primary visual network (VN) in participants recovered from stress. Data also shows that participants after recovery from stress displayed increased deactivations in DMN, SMN, and auditory network (AN), to levels similar to those of controls, showing a normalization of the deactivation pattern in RSNs after recovery from stress. In contrast, structural changes (volumetry) of the brain areas involving these networks are absent after the recovery period. These results reveal plastic phenomena in specific RSNs and a functional remodeling of the activation-deactivation pattern following recovery from chronic-stress, which is not accompanied by significant structural plasticity.","[{'authorId': '143778980', 'name': 'J.

I propose that it is also necessary to recognize that strength of engagement can contribute to experienced value through its contribution to the experience of motivational force--an experience of the intensity of the force of attraction to or repulsion from the value target. The subjective pleasure/pain properties of a value target influence strength of engagement, but factors separate from the hedonic properties of the value target also influence engagement strength and thus contribute to the experience of attraction or repulsion. These additional sources of engagement strength include opposition to interfering forces, overcoming personal resistance, using the right or proper means of goal pursuit, and regulatory fit between the orientation and manner of goal pursuit. Implications of the contribution of engagement strength to value are discussed for judgment and decision making, persuasion, and emotional experiences.","[{'authorId': '2882679', 'name': 'E.

However, the effectiveness of patient education relies largely on the nurse’s level of awareness of the current hypertension guidelines. The purpose of this study was to examine the level of awareness of hypertension guidelines and associated factors among nurses in Taiwan. Subjects and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 10 hospitals in northern Taiwan. The Hypertension Management Questionnaire was developed based on the Taiwan Hypertension Guidelines and the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Results: The survey return rate was 95.9%. A total of 1418 nurses were included in the analysis. Adequate guideline awareness was found in 49.5% of the total sample. Among the 7 dimensions of the Hypertension Management Questionnaire, the definition of hypertension, methods for blood pressure measurements, and impact of high blood pressure on cardiovascular disease had the lowest rates of correct answers. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the nurses’ clinical experience, educational level, work setting, in-service education training on hypertension, and level of the hospital (R = 35.4%, F = 52.89, P G .001) independently predicted the nurse’s level of awareness.

Isolated craniosynostosis, however, has been thought to be a benign condition primarily reconstructed for aesthetic purposes. On the basis of subjective developmental improvement postoperatively, an objective radiographic analysis (single positron emission computed tomography [SPECT]) was used to assess differences in cerebral perfusion in the areas compressed secondary to the fused cranial suture both before and after cranial reconstructive surgery in patients with simple craniosynostosis. Seven children with craniosynostosis, six boys and one girl (age range, 3–28 months), were enrolled in this prospective study. Six of the seven had cranial asymmetry on preoperative cranial computed tomographic scans, and one had a symmetric defect and was used as a control. Each subject had a preoperative SPECT scan approximately 3 to 5 days before the cranial reconstruction procedure and a follow-up scan 6 to 10 weeks postoperatively. Preoperative asymmetries in cerebral perfusion ranged from 0 to 30 (mean, 13±) in the areas compressed secondary to the premature suture fusion. In five patients cerebral blood flow, which was asymmetric before surgery, became symmetric after craniofacial reconstruction, and no new perfusion defects were documented. The control patient and one other patient had symmetric perfusion both pre- and postoperatively. Craniosynostosis may be associated with decreased cerebral blood flow as a result of the constriction of the brain from the prematurely fused suture. The correction of asymmetric cranial single-suture synostosis is more than a cosmetic procedure in that it allows for normalization of cerebral blood flow. This difference in blood flow supports early surgical intervention to prevent any potential central nervous system compromise secondary to abnormal blood flow.","[{'authorId': '144290979', 'name': 'L.

The validity of these norms is influenced by the observed secular increase in body weight and BMI. We hypothesized that the performance of children in health‐related physical fitness tests would be negatively related to increased BMIs, and therefore fitness tests might be used as criteria for developing a more appropriate set of BMI norms. We evaluated the existing data from a nation‐wide fitness survey for students in Taiwan (444 652 boys and 433 555 girls) to examine the relationship between BMI and fitness tests. The fitness tests used included: an 800/1600‐m run/walk; a standing long jump; bent‐leg curl‐ups; and a sit‐and‐reach test. The BMI percentiles developed from the subgroup whose test scores were better than the ‘poor’ quartile in all four tests were compared with those of the whole population and linked to the adult criteria for overweight and obesity. The BMIs were significantly related to the results of fitness testing. A total of 43% of students had scores better than the poorest quartile in all of their tests. The upper BMI percentile curves of this fitter subgroup were lower than those of the total population. The 85th and 95th BMI percentile values of the fitter 18‐year‐old‐students (23.7 and 25.5 kg m−2 for boys; 22.6 and 24.6 kg m−2 for girls) linked well with the adult cut‐off points of 23 and 25 kg m−2, which have been recommended as the Asian criteria for adult overweight and obesity. Hence, the BMI norms for children and adolescents could be created from selected subgroups that have better physical fitness. We expect that the new norms based on this approach will be used not only to assess the current status of obesity or overweight, but also to encourage activity and exercise.","[{'authorId': '2111897612', 'name': 'Walter Chen'}, {'authorId': '143838325', 'name': 'Cheng-Chieh Lin'}, {'authorId': '2113566689', 'name': 'Ching-Tien Peng'}, {'authorId': '2004645193', 'name': 'Chia-Ing Li'}, {'authorId': '2196428980', 'name': 'H.‐C.

Their collective effects are particularly prevalent to numerous aspects of brain function, including energy production, DNA/RNA synthesis/repair, genomic and non-genomic methylation, and the synthesis of numerous neurochemicals and signaling molecules.

This review describes the closely inter-related functions of the eight B-vitamins and marshals evidence suggesting that adequate levels of all members of this group of micronutrients are essential for optimal physiological and neurological functioning. Furthermore, evidence from human research clearly shows both that a significant proportion of the populations of developed countries suffer from deficiencies or insufficiencies in one or more of this group of vitamins, and that, in the absence of an optimal diet, administration of the entire B-vitamin group, rather than a small sub-set, at doses greatly in excess of the current governmental recommendations, would be a rational approach for preserving brain health.","[{'authorId': '2079650', 'name': 'D.

Despite extensive data about physician burnout, to our knowledge, no national study has evaluated rates of burnout among US physicians, explored differences by specialty, or compared physicians with US workers in other fields.


METHODS
We conducted a national study of burnout in a large sample of US physicians from all specialty disciplines using the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile and surveyed a probability-based sample of the general US population for comparison. Burnout was measured using validated instruments. Satisfaction with work-life balance was explored.


RESULTS
Of 27 276 physicians who received an invitation to participate, 7288 (26.7%) completed surveys. When assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, 45.8% of physicians reported at least 1 symptom of burnout. Substantial differences in burnout were observed by specialty, with the highest rates among physicians at the front line of care access (family medicine, general internal medicine, and emergency medicine). Compared with a probability-based sample of 3442 working US adults, physicians were more likely to have symptoms of burnout (37.9% vs 27.8%) and to be dissatisfied with work-life balance (40.2% vs 23.2%) (P < .001 for both). Highest level of education completed also related to burnout in a pooled multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, relationship status, and hours worked per week. Compared with high school graduates, individuals with an MD or DO degree were at increased risk for burnout (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; P < .001), whereas individuals with a bachelor's degree (OR, 0.80; P = .048), master's degree (OR, 0.71; P = .01), or professional or doctoral degree other than an MD or DO degree (OR, 0.64; P = .04) were at lower risk for burnout.


CONCLUSIONS
Burnout is more common among physicians than among other US workers. Physicians in specialties at the front line of care access seem to be at greatest risk.","[{'authorId': '4182975', 'name': 'T.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the manner in which acute alcohol consumption and provocation affect aggressive behavior in men and women.


METHOD
Subjects were 102 (56 men) healthy social drinkers between 21 and 35 years of age. Aggression was measured using a modified version of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm, in which electric shocks are received from and administered to a fictitious opponent during a competitive task.


RESULTS
Provocation was a stronger elicitor of aggression than either gender or alcohol. Under low provocation, men were more aggressive than were women. Under high provocation, men and women were equally aggressive, except in the case of extreme aggression, in which men again exhibited higher levels than did women. Alcohol increased aggression for men but not for women.


CONCLUSIONS
These results are important because there now appears to be some convergence among studies indicating that, whereas provocation and alcohol are effective in lifting inhibitions against the expression of aggression for men, only provocation seems to be an effective aggression-elicitor for women.","[{'authorId': '6058555', 'name': 'P.

Poor mental health is associated with a significant global cost burden, from disability to economic impacts. The field of lifestyle medicine, which emphasizes the role of lifestyle factors in the onset and treatment of disease and well-being, is well suited to address mental health. More recently, there has been attention to the need to incorporate mental health into the field of lifestyle medicine and to attend to the bidirectional role of mental health and lifestyle. Thus, there is a critical opportunity for the field of lifestyle medicine to incorporate mental health into each of the foundational pillars (diet, exercise, substance use, psychological well-being/stress, relationships, sleep) while also specifically targeting lifestyle interventions for populations with mental disorders. The current article provides a framework for the role of mental health within lifestyle medicine by addressing the scope of the problem, clarification regarding mental health, and areas of practice (ie, psychiatry), and providing an overview of the relevant mental health literature for each pillar.

However, the authors propose negative downstream consequences of brand humanization; that is, the anthropomorphization of a brand can negatively affect consumers’ brand evaluations when the brand faces negative publicity caused by product wrongdoings. They find that consumers who believe in personality stability (i.e., entity theorists) view anthropomorphized brands that undergo negative publicity less favorably than nonanthropomorphized brands. In contrast, consumers who advocate personality malleability (i.e., incremental theorists) are less likely to devalue an anthropomorphized brand from a single instance of negative publicity. Finally, the authors explore three firm response strategies (i.e., denial, apology, and compensation) that can affect the evaluations of anthropomorphized brands for consumers with different implicit theory perspectives.

In this study, 23 adolescents were excluded during a ball-tossing game in which they believed they were playing with two other adolescents during an fMRI scan; in reality, participants played with a preset computer program. Afterwards, participants reported their exclusion-related distress and rejection sensitivity, and parents reported participants' interpersonal competence. Similar to findings in adults, during social exclusion adolescents displayed insular activity that was positively related to self-reported distress, and right ventrolateral prefrontal activity that was negatively related to self-reported distress. Findings unique to adolescents indicated that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subACC) related to greater distress, and that activity in the ventral striatum related to less distress and appeared to play a role in regulating activity in the subACC and other regions involved in emotional distress. Finally, adolescents with higher rejection sensitivity and interpersonal competence scores displayed greater neural evidence of emotional distress, and adolescents with higher interpersonal competence scores also displayed greater neural evidence of regulation, perhaps suggesting that adolescents who are vigilant regarding peer acceptance may be most sensitive to rejection experiences.","[{'authorId': '2845363', 'name': 'Carrie L.

Research suggests that self-compassion may improve mental health by promoting emotion regulation (Berking & Whitley, ). This review aimed to identify studies which investigated the relationship between self-compassion, emotion regulation, and mental health in order to examine the role of emotional regulation as a mechanism of change.


METHODS
Searches were conducted in PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline complete, Web of Science and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria required publications to be: peer reviewed, published in English, contain validated measures of self-compassion and emotion regulation, and report a direct analysis on the relationship between these constructs.


RESULTS
The search yielded five studies which met inclusion criteria. Emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between self-compassion and mental health. This pattern was consistent across community and clinical samples, for a range of mental health symptoms including stress, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. A critical limitation of the review was that all included studies used cross-sectional data, limiting interpretations regarding causation.


CONCLUSIONS
Results provide preliminary evidence that emotion regulation may be a mechanism of change in the relationship between self-compassion and mental health. Self-compassion may be a pertinent preliminary treatment target for individuals who avoid experiences of emotions.","[{'authorId': '51041535', 'name': 'Elisa Inwood'}, {'authorId': '32265785', 'name': 'Madeleine Ferrari'}]",214.0,,34.0,"Mechanisms of Change in the Relationship between Self-Compassion, Emotion Regulation, and Mental Health: A Systematic Review.",2018.0
72feec9aa10458fb711ce7f1a59899640e224111,"OBJECTIVES
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain syndrome associated with adverse symptoms of cognitive, behavioural, and emotional dysfunction. Accumulating evidence supports the notion that sleep dysfunction, which affects almost all FM patients, has a reciprocal influence on pain. Yet, little is known about the relationship between sleep and other FM symptoms. The present study analysed the role of sleep dysfunction as a mediator of the impact of pain intensity on anxiety, depression, and daily functioning, comparing them with the mediating role of self-efficacy.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional design was used.


METHODS
A sample of 104 women with FM and 86 healthy control women completed a semi-structured interview and self-reported measures of pain, sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and daily functioning. Multiple mediation models were proposed and a bootstrapping approach was used to test these models.


RESULTS
Women diagnosed with FM had more dysfunctional scores on the variables examined than control participants, and there were significant relationships between all the variables examined in the mediation models for the FM group. The mediation analyses suggested that sleep quality and self-efficacy significantly mediated the relationship between pain and emotional distress. Additionally, self-efficacy was a significant mediator and sleep quality a likely mediator that was marginally significant in the relationship between pain and functioning.


CONCLUSIONS
Sleep dysfunction is importantly related to FM symptoms and deserves more attention in both research and clinical practice. Our results suggest that, in addition to the usual treatment of FM, improving sleep could optimize the current management of the syndrome.","[{'authorId': '145985959', 'name': 'E.

Research suggests that emotions and emotion regulation processes can influence both the sensory (e.g., intensity) and the affective (unpleasantness) components of pain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factor structure and validity of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz and Roemer, 2004) in medical sample with persistent pain.


METHOD
Data were collected from 207 chronic pain patients (82.6% female; mean age = 51.96). We applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test measurement model of emotion dysregulation and CFA with covariates to test construct and convergent validity of the DERS.


RESULTS
The original factor structure of the DERS was not supported in our medical sample. However, after some modifications the DERS yielded good fit. Validity of the DERS was confirmed. All the subscales had significant relationship with depression measure, and all the subscales except one correlated with Difficulties in Identifying Feelings component of alexithymia.

Parents’ and infant’s affective states were coded in one-second frames, and synchrony was measured with timeseries analysis. The orientation, intensity, and temporal pattern of infant positive arousal were assessed. Synchrony between same-gender parent–infant dyads was more optimal in terms of stronger lagged associations between parent and infant affect, more frequent mutual synchrony, and shorter lags to responsiveness. Infants’ arousal during mother–infant interaction cycled between medium and low levels, and high positive affect appeared gradually and was embedded within a social episode. During father– child play, positive arousal was high, sudden, and organized in multiple peaks that appeared more frequently as play progressed. Mother–infant synchrony was linked to the partners’ social orientation and was inversely related to maternal depression and infant negative emotionality. Father–child synchrony was related to the intensity of positive arousal and to father attachment security. Results contribute to research on the regulation of positive emotions and describe the unique modes of affective sharing that infants coconstruct with mother and father. RESUMEN: Para examinar la co-regulación del afecto positivo durante las interacciones entre la madre y su hijo y el padre y su hijo, cien parejas y sus hijos primerizos fueron grabadas en vı́deo en sesiones de interacciones cara a cara. Los estados afectivos de los padres y de los infantes fueron codificados en marcos de un segundo, y la sincronı́a se midió por medio de un análisis de tiempo en serie. Se evaluaron la orientación, la intensidad, y el patrón temporal del despertar positivo del infante. La sincronı́a entre las dı́adas del mismo sexo (madre-hija o padre-hijo) fue más óptima en términos de más fuertes asociaciones espaciadas del afecto entre padre/madre e infante, la más frecuente mutua sincronı́a, y más cortos espacios de sensibilidad.. El despertar de los niños durante la interacción entre la madre y su infante osciló entre los niveles medio y bajo, y el afecto positivo alto apareció gradualmente y se encontraba metido dentro de una situación social. Durante el juego entre el padre y su infante, el despertar positivo fue alto, rápido y organizado en múltiples puntos máximos que aparecieron con mayor frecuencia a medida que el juego progresaba. La sincronı́a entre la madre y su infante fue asociada con la orientación social de los participantes y fue inversamente relacionada con la depresión maternal y la negativa emocionalidad del infante. La sincronı́a entre el padre y su infante fue relacionada con la intensidad del despertar positivo y con la seguridad de la afectividad paterna. Los resultados contribuyen a la investigación sobre la regulación de las emociones positivas y describen los modelos únicos de la afectividad compartida que los infantes co-construyen con la madre y el padre.

737f4e8b270b57ff695b2f9b3d059e0ad02333e9,"Abstract Background Depression is a prevalent and impairing condition. Behavioral activation (BA) is a parsimonious, cost-effective, and easily disseminated psychological intervention for depression. The current meta-analysis expands on the existing literature supporting the efficacy of BA for depression by examining the effects of BA on additional relevant outcomes for patients with depression, namely the reduction in anxiety symptoms and increase in activation. Methods Randomized controlled trials of BA for depression compared to active and inactive control were identified via a systematic review. Effect sizes using Hedges's g were calculated for each outcome compared to both active and inactive control using random effects models. Subgroup analyses were used to examine the inclusion of a discussion of values as a moderator of depression symptom outcome in BA. Results Twenty-eight studies were included. Meta-analyses of symptom change between groups from baseline-to-post intervention indicated that BA outperformed inactive control conditions for improvements in depression (g = 0.83), anxiety (g = 0.37), and activation (g = 0.64). The difference between BA and active control conditions was not significant for improvements in depression (g = 0.15), anxiety (g = 0.03), and activation (g = 0.04). There was no evidence for a discussion of values augmenting BA efficacy. Study quality was generally low, and there was evidence of publication bias. Conclusions In addition to improving depression, BA shows efficacy for reducing symptoms of anxiety and increasing activation. BA may not offer better outcomes relative to other active interventions. There is room for improvement in the quality of research in this area.","[{'authorId': '51256809', 'name': 'Aliza T.

Study One examined this association in seven domains – psychopathology, positive psychological health, emotional intelligence, self-concept, body image, motivation, and interpersonal functioning – and found that while reduced negative self-responding had a stronger link to negative emotionality and self-evaluation than positive self-responding, they were roughly equivalent predictors in other domains. Study Two examined the association of compassionate and reduced uncompassionate behavior with sympathetic nervous system and inflammatory activity after stress, and found they equally predicted salivary alpha amylase and interleukin-6 levels in individuals after a stressful situation. Overall, results suggest that both compassionate and reduced uncompassionate self-responding are central to self-compassion and that both help to explain its link to healthy psychological functioning.","[{'authorId': '2969088', 'name': 'K.

73b2144fdf444f710e94dbf75d10851dc5a1673b,"Many aspects of human development and disease are influenced by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Understanding how our genes respond to the environment is central to managing health and disease, and is one of the major contemporary challenges in human genetics. Various epigenetic processes affect chromosome structure and accessibility of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to the enzymatic machinery that leads to expression of genes. One important epigenetic mechanism that appears to underlie the interaction between environmental factors, including diet, and our genome, is chemical modification of the DNA. The best understood of these modifications is methylation of cytosine residues in DNA. It is now recognized that the pattern of methylated cytosines throughout our genomes (the ‘methylome’) can change during development and in response to environmental cues, often with profound effects on gene expression. Many dietary constituents may indirectly influence genomic pathways that methylate DNA, and there is evidence for biochemical links between nutritional quality and mental health. Deficiency of both macro- and micronutrients has been associated with increased behavioural problems, and nutritional supplementation has proven efficacious in treatment of certain neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review we examine evidence from the fields of nutrition, developmental biology, and mental health that supports dietary impacts on epigenetic processes, particularly DNA methylation. We then consider whether such processes could underlie the demonstrated efficacy of dietary supplementation in treatment of mental disorders, and whether targeted manipulation of DNA methylation patterns using controlled dietary supplementation may be of wider clinical value.","[{'authorId': '2201011', 'name': 'Aaron J.

To test cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for persistent attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in a sample of medication-treated adolescents.


METHODS
Forty-six adolescents (ages 14-18), with clinically significant ADHD symptoms despite stable medication treatment were randomly assigned to receive CBT for ADHD or wait list control in a cross-over design. Twenty-four were randomized to CBT, 22 to wait list, and 15 crossed-over from wait list to CBT. A blind independent evaluator (IE) rated symptom severity on the ADHD Current Symptom Scale, by adolescent and parent report, and rated each subject using the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI), a global measure of distress and impairment. These assessments were performed at baseline, 4-months (post-CBT or post wait list), and 8-months (post-treatment for those originally assigned to the wait list condition and 4-month follow-up for those originally assigned to CBT).


TRIAL REGISTRATION
http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01019252.


RESULTS
Using all available data, mixed effects modeling, and pooling for the wait list cross-over, participants who received CBT received a mean score 10.93 lower on the IE-rated parent assessment of symptom severity (95% CI: -12.93, -8.93; p < .0001), 5.24 lower on the IE-rated adolescent assessment of symptom severity (95% CI: -7.21, -3.28; p < .0001), and 1.17 lower IE-rated CGI (95% CI: -1.39, -.94; p < .0001). Results were consistent across 100 multiple imputations (all p < .0001). There was a greater proportion of responders after CBT by parent (50% vs. 18%, p = .00) and adolescent (58% vs. 18% p = .02) report.

Internet addiction (IA), defined as excessive, time consuming, uncontrollable use of the internet, has become a widespread problem. In this study, we investigated the impact of internet addiction on depression, physical activity level, and latent trigger point sensitivity in Turkish university students.


METHODS
A total of 215 university students (155 females and 60 males) who were between 18-25 years of age participated in the study. Using the Addiction Profile Index Internet Addiction Form (APIINT), we identified 51 people as non-internet-addicted (non-IA) (Group 1: 10 male/41 female) and 51 as internet-addicted (IA) (Group 2: 7 male/44 female). APIINT, International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short-Form (IPAQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Neck Disability Index (NDI) were administered to both groups, and the pressure-pain threshold (PPT) in upper/middle trapezius latent trigger points area was measured.


RESULTS
The internet addiction rate was 24.3% in our students. Compared with the non-IA group, the daily internet use time and BDI and NDI scores were higher (all p< 0.05), while the IPAQ walking (p< 0.01), IPAQ total (p< 0.05), and PPT values (p< 0.05) were lower in the IA group.


CONCLUSIONS
IA is a growing problem. This addiction may lead to musculoskeletal problems and can have consequences involving the level of physical activity, depression, and musculoskeletal disorders, particularly in the neck.","[{'authorId': '6715135', 'name': 'N.

748d1c0d9e0ed7df25c74fed427587536eaf87ba,"OBJECTIVE
Depression is common among patients with diabetes, but its relationship to glycemic control has not been systematically reviewed. Our objective was to determine whether depression is associated with poor glycemic control.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Medline and PsycINFO databases and published reference lists were used to identify studies that measured the association of depression with glycemic control. Meta-analytic procedures were used to convert the findings to a common metric, calculate effect sizes (ESs), and statistically analyze the collective data.


RESULTS
A total of 24 studies satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Depression was significantly associated with hyperglycemia (Z = 5.4, P < 0.0001). The standardized ES was in the small-to-moderate range (0.17) and was consistent, as the 95% CI was narrow (0.13-0.21). The ES was similar in studies of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes (ES 0.19 vs. 0.16) and larger when standardized interviews and diagnostic criteria rather than self-report questionnaires were used to assess depression (ES 0.28 vs. 0.15).


CONCLUSIONS
Depression is associated with hyperglycemia in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to establish the directional nature of this relationship and to determine the effects of depression treatment on glycemic control and the long-term course of diabetes.","[{'authorId': '6574169', 'name': 'P.

Large-sample theory provides a chi-square goodness-of-fit test for comparing a model against a general alternative model based on correlated variables. This model comparison is insufficient for model evaluation: In large samples virtually any model tends to be rejected as inadequate, and in small samples various competing models, if evaluated, might be equally acceptable. A general null model based on modified independence among variables is proposed to provide an additional reference point for the statistical and scientific evaluation of covariance structure models. Use of the null model in the context of a procedure that sequentially evaluates the statistical necessity of various sets of parameters places statistical methods in covariance structure analysis into a more complete framework. The concepts of ideal models and pseudo chi-square tests are introduced, and their roles in hypothesis testing are developed. The importance of supplementing statistical evaluation with incremental fit indices associated with the comparison of hierarchical models is also emphasized.

The current study focused on (a) identifying subgroups of young children displaying a combination of CP and CU behaviors and (b) examining the extent to which executive functioning (EF) and emotion regulation (ER) are associated with CU behaviors. Participants included 249 preschoolers (N = 249, 78% boys, M age = 4.95 years; 81% Latino/Hispanic) referred to treatment because of externalizing behavior problems. CU behaviors and CP were measured via a combination of teacher/parent rating scales. A multimethod approach was used to measure EF and ER including parent/teacher rating scales, neuropsychological, and observational tasks. Poorer ER as rated by parents/teachers and observed was associated with greater levels of CU behaviors. Latent profile analyses identified three subgroups of children displaying (a) low CU/low CP, (b) moderate CU/moderate CP, and (c) high CU/high CP. Children in the high CU/high-CP group were rated as having significantly poorer rated ER compared to all other groups and poorer observed ER compared to the low-CU/low-CP group. Exploratory analyses found that children in the high-CU/high-CP group displayed marginally lower levels of rated ER but significantly better EF performance on standardized neuropsychological tasks compared to children in a low-CU/high-CP group.Children with higher levels of reported CU behaviors and CP display poorer ER yet may display relatively better EF performance compared to children with lower levels of CU behaviors and CP.","[{'authorId': '4583640', 'name': 'P.

Construct an age adapted version of the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) for measurement of restrained, emotional and external eating in 7- to 12-year-old children: the DEBQ-C.


METHOD
The DEBQ-C was constructed and tested for its reliability, factorial validity, factorial invariance for sex, overweight (BMI-status), and age, and correlations with measures for unhealthy life style in one sample (382 boys and 387 girls). In a second sample (252 boys and 263 girls) correlations were obtained with measures for body dissatisfaction and parental feeding styles. Single and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses were used.


RESULTS
The fit measures for the three factor model and the factorial invariance models with respect to sex, BMI-status, and age were satisfactory. In the (sub) samples of the 7- to 12-year-olds Cronbach's alpha's ranged from .73 to .82 and there were satisfactory correlations (p < .01) with other measures.


CONCLUSION
The DEBQ-C should provide a useful measure for young children's emerging dietary restraint and overeating tendencies. The low prevalence of emotional eating indicates that most young children show the natural reaction to emotional stressors (loss of appetite when feeling lonely, depressed or afraid) and that emotional (over) eating at this age is quite abnormal.","[{'authorId': '88609066', 'name': 'T. van Strien'}, {'authorId': '6285913', 'name': 'P.

These factors cohere to form a COVID stress syndrome, which we sought to further delineate in the present study. Methods A population‐representative sample of 6,854 American and Canadian adults completed a self‐report survey comprising questions about current mental health and COVID‐19‐related experiences, distress, and coping. Results Network analysis revealed that worry about the dangerousness of COVID‐19 is the central feature of the syndrome. Latent class analysis indicated that the syndrome is quasi‐dimensional, comprising five classes differing in syndrome severity. Sixteen percent of participants were in the most severe class and possibly needing mental health services. Syndrome severity was correlated with preexisting psychopathology and with excessive COVID‐19‐related avoidance, panic buying, and coping difficulties during self‐isolation.

750dd67fa2b1034b1d10be161e0322d61baf9328,"Eating disorders are multifactorial conditions that can involve a combination of genetic, metabolic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Studies in humans and laboratory animals show that eating can also be regulated by factors unrelated to metabolic control. Several studies suggest a link between stress, access to highly palatable food, and eating disorders. Eating “comfort foods” in response to a negative emotional state, for example, suggests that some individuals overeat to self-medicate. Clinical data suggest that some individuals may develop addiction-like behaviors from consuming palatable foods. Based on this observation, “food addiction” has emerged as an area of intense scientific research. A growing body of evidence suggests that some aspects of food addiction, such as compulsive eating behavior, can be modeled in animals. Moreover, several areas of the brain, including various neurotransmitter systems, are involved in the reinforcement effects of both food and drugs, suggesting that natural and pharmacological stimuli activate similar neural systems. In addition, several recent studies have identified a putative connection between neural circuits activated in the seeking and intake of both palatable food and drugs. The development of well-characterized animal models will increase our understanding of the etiological factors of food addiction and will help identify the neural substrates involved in eating disorders such as compulsive overeating. Such models will facilitate the development and validation of targeted pharmacological therapies.","[{'authorId': '134383412', 'name': 'Matteo Di Segni'}, {'authorId': '6499963', 'name': 'E.

During home confinement due to lockdown, people face multidimensional issues. The present study explored the psychological impacts of COVID-19 home confinement during the lockdown period and Wuhan’s residents’ attitude toward physical activity. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted to collect the primary data according to the study objectives. The population was Wuhan residents (+ 18 years) who were in home confinement. A total of 2280 participant’s reply to the online questionnaire survey and collected data after quantifying the data, about 2200 (96.49%); about (49.8%) female, about (49.4%) male, others about (0.2%), and about (0.6%) were not disclosed their gender participants responses were used for analysis. The collected data were analyzed through appropriate statistical techniques. Results According to results, H1 is supported with β = −40.793, t = 57.835, p = 0.000, which claimed a negative association between COVID-19 lockdown policy and behavior and attitude. Results for H2 reveals that the COVID-19 lockdown policy have negative influence on emotional control with β = −0.769, t = 46.766, p = 0.000 and it is supported. H3 documented a significant positive relationship between COVID-19 lockdown policy and lockdown period psychological impact, which means lockdown policy, is the main reason to increase the lockdown psychological impact. Further, COVID-19 lockdown policy have negative influence on physical activity (H4) and self-belief (H5) with β = −0.657, t = 32.766, p = 0.000 and β = −0.620, t = −6.766, p = 0.000 respectively. H6 stated that there is a positive impact of behavior and attitude toward physical activity. The results for H6, behavior, and attitude affecting the physical activity with β = 0.401, t = 10, p = 0.000, which is supported. Conclusion COVID-19 home confinement created various psychological impacts, negatively affecting the emotional state due to depression and anxiety. Physical activity is the best strategy to manage human nature’s psychological issues, and people’s attitudes were positive toward physical activity during home confinement. However, the lockdown policy also affects physical activity participation negatively, and a sedentary lifestyle prevailed during home confinement.","[{'authorId': '2038004567', 'name': 'Xuehui Sang'}, {'authorId': '5231590', 'name': 'R.

Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that each one depends upon interactions between pFC, interpreted as implementing cognitive control, and limbic regions, interpreted as mediating emotional responses. However, no study has directly compared distraction with reappraisal, and it remains unclear whether they draw upon different neural mechanisms and have different emotional consequences. The present fMRI study compared distraction and reappraisal and found both similarities and differences between the two forms of emotion regulation. Both resulted in decreased negative affect, decreased activation in the amygdala, and increased activation in prefrontal and cingulate regions. Relative to distraction, reappraisal led to greater decreases in negative affect and to greater increases in a network of regions associated with processing affective meaning (medial prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices). Relative to reappraisal, distraction led to greater decreases in amygdala activation and to greater increases in activation in prefrontal and parietal regions. Taken together, these data suggest that distraction and reappraisal differentially engage neural systems involved in attentional deployment and cognitive reframing and have different emotional consequences.","[{'authorId': '38264874', 'name': 'Kateri McRae'}, {'authorId': '32445791', 'name': 'Brent L.

In girls, trends were similar, but associations were not statistically significant. Associations were similar among overweight youth. In no instances, were lower levels of body satisfaction significantly associated with higher physical activity levels. These findings suggest that interventions that strive for increased physical activity in youth should avoid strategies that may lead to decreases in body satisfaction. Rather, programs should simultaneously strive to increase physical activity and improve body satisfaction.

The purposes of this study were to identify age-related changes in objectively recorded sleep patterns across the human life span in healthy individuals and to clarify whether sleep latency and percentages of stage 1, stage 2, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep significantly change with age.


DESIGN
Review of literature of articles published between 1960 and 2003 in peer-reviewed journals and meta-analysis.


PARTICIPANTS
65 studies representing 3,577 subjects aged 5 years to 102 years.


MEASUREMENT
The research reports included in this meta-analysis met the following criteria: (1) included nonclinical participants aged 5 years or older; (2) included measures of sleep characteristics by ""all night"" polysomnography or actigraphy on sleep latency, sleep efficiency, total sleep time, stage 1 sleep, stage 2 sleep, slow-wave sleep, REM sleep, REM latency, or minutes awake after sleep onset; (3) included numeric presentation of the data; and (4) were published between 1960 and 2003 in peer-reviewed journals.


RESULTS
In children and adolescents, total sleep time decreased with age only in studies performed on school days. Percentage of slow-wave sleep was significantly negatively correlated with age. Percentages of stage 2 and REM sleep significantly changed with age. In adults, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage of slow-wave sleep, percentage of REM sleep, and REM latency all significantly decreased with age, while sleep latency, percentage of stage 1 sleep, percentage of stage 2 sleep, and wake after sleep onset significantly increased with age. However, only sleep efficiency continued to significantly decrease after 60 years of age. The magnitudes of the effect sizes noted changed depending on whether or not studied participants were screened for mental disorders, organic diseases, use of drug or alcohol, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, or other sleep disorders.


CONCLUSIONS
In adults, it appeared that sleep latency, percentages of stage 1 and stage 2 significantly increased with age while percentage of REM sleep decreased. However, effect sizes for the different sleep parameters were greatly modified by the quality of subject screening, diminishing or even masking age associations with different sleep parameters. The number of studies that examined the evolution of sleep parameters with age are scant among school-aged children, adolescents, and middle-aged adults. There are also very few studies that examined the effect of race on polysomnographic sleep parameters.","[{'authorId': '5184811', 'name': 'M. Ohayon'}, {'authorId': '2679055', 'name': 'M.

Our aim was to compare emotion processing and regulation between 102 women with morbid obesity who apply for bariatric surgery and 102 women from the general population (control group) and to examine in the group with morbid obesity the association of emotion processing and regulation with emotional eating. The group with morbid obesity reported higher scores on difficulty identifying feelings (alexithymia, p = 0.002) and suppression of emotions (p = 0.003) than the control group. In the women with morbid obesity, more negative affect and a higher difficulty identifying feelings were correlated with more emotional eating (r = 0.36 and r = 0.35, p < 0.001).

METHODS 2998 subjects aged 20 years or above were randomly selected by stratified multistage cluster sampling from the censuses of 20 municipalities. Trained rheumatologists carried out structured visits at which subjects were asked about rheumatic symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics, completed validated instruments for measuring function (HAQ) and quality of life (SF-12), and underwent a standardised physical examination. Cases were defined by previously validated criteria. RESULTS The estimated prevalences with 95% confidence intervals were as follows: RA lifetime cumulative: 0.5% (0.3 to 0.9); low back pain: 14.8% (12.2 to 17.4); symptomatic knee OA: 10.2% (8.5 to 11.9); hand OA: 6.2% (5.9 to 6.5); fibromyalgia: 2.4% (1.5 to 3.2). Most conditions significantly impaired function and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS The EPISER study has internal and external validity for application of the results to the adult Spanish population.

Eating disorders (EDs) are complex conditions associated with disability and a high rate of mortality. Typical characteristics of these diseases are dissociation, alexithymia and impulse dysregulation, all strategies dealing with negative emotions and regulate negative affect and anxiety. Our study aimed to assess the effectiveness of intensive psychological treatment for EDs, with particular reference to the above mentioned clinical characteristics.


METHODS
Eight outpatients with eating disorders in psychotherapeutic treatment were evaluated in two stages after one year (T1 and T2), using the Eating Disorder Inventory II, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale.


RESULTS
Wilcoxon test showed significant reductions in DES score as well as in two subscales of the EDI-2, Impulse Regulation and Body Dissatisfaction (I-EDI2 and BD-EDI2), while alexithymia levels did not show any difference.


CONCLUSIONS
We can confirm the effectiveness of psychotherapy in people with EDs as regards dissociative moments, impulsivity and body dissatisfaction. However, alexithymia remains unchanged, possibly because of its deep emotional nature.","[{'authorId': '7762862', 'name': 'M. Caslini'}, {'authorId': '2094819988', 'name': 'L.

Research on the regulation of negative emotions has additionally been conducted in social psychology, developmental psychology, neuropsychology, health psychology, and clinical psychology. A close reading of this broader literature, however, reveals that the conceptualization and use of the term “emotion regulation” varies within each research field as well as across these fields. The main focus of our chapter is to make sense of the term “emotion regulation” in the workplace by considering its use across a broad range of psychology disciplines. We then develop an overarching theoretical framework using disambiguating terminology to highlight what we argue are the important constructs involved in the process of intrapersonal emotion generation, emotional experience regulation, and emotional expression regulation in the workplace (e.g., emotional intelligence, emotion regulation strategies, emotion expression displays). We anticipate this chapter will enable researchers and industrial and organizational psychologists to identify the conditions under which functional regulation outcomes are more likely to occur and then build interventions around these findings.","[{'authorId': '38992648', 'name': 'S.

Aim:  This study aimed to identify the main sources of stress for students of nursing and the evolution of the stressors when training in nursing competences. 
 
Background:  Levels of stress are higher for health professionals than for other workers. A higher number of stressors with negative health consequences are present, especially among nursing professionals. Stress is a psychosocial factor that influences the academic performance and well-being of this group. The interest in analysing sources of stress in nursing students is due to the influence that their training period may have on their perceptions of stress on their future work. 
 
Methods:  We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature on stressors in nursing students. The search comprised all the articles published at the end of 2010. 
 
Results:  The most common sources of stress relate to academics (reviews, workload and problems associated with studying, among others). Other sources of stress include clinical sources (such as fear of unknown situations, mistakes with patients or handling of technical equipment). In general, no changes occur at the different years of the student's education. 
 
Conclusion:  Comparing studies is difficult because of the differences among them (designs, instruments, number of stressors, etc.). However, our revision gives a current state-of-the-art and includes descriptive information that might be very useful for future research. Furthermore, we offer some recommendations for improving the design of curricula taking into account sources of stress.","[{'authorId': '1405313836', 'name': 'M.

According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

The meta-analysis is based on 494 individual correlations drawn from a final sample of 95 independent studies. Results revealed substantial relationships of emotion-rule dissonance and surface acting with indicators of impaired well-being (ρs between .39 and .48) and job attitudes (ρs between -.24 and -.40) and a small negative relationship with performance outcomes (ρs between -.20 and -.05). Overall, deep acting displayed weak relationships with indicators of impaired well-being and job attitudes but positive relationships with emotional performance and customer satisfaction (ρs .18 and .37). A meta-analytic regression analysis provides information on the unique contribution of emotion-rule dissonance, surface acting, and deep acting in statistically predicting well-being and performance outcomes. Furthermore, a mediation analysis confirms theoretical models of emotional labor which suggest that surface acting partially mediates the relationship of emotion-rule dissonance with well-being.

In a multiple-group analysis for good self-control, the paths from negative life events to substance use level and from level to behavior problems were lower among persons scoring higher on good behavioral self-control. In a multiple-group analysis for poor regulation, the paths from negative life events and peer use to level of substance use were greater among persons scoring higher on poor behavioral (but not emotional) regulation; an inverse path from academic competence to level was greater among persons scoring higher on both aspects of poor regulation. Paths from level to impaired-control and behavior problems were greater among persons scoring higher on both poor behavioral and poor emotional regulation.

METHODS In total, 134 male cirrhotic patients prospectively completed clinical evaluations and nutritional assessment by BIA to obtain PAs during a 36-mo follow-up period. Mortality risk was analyzed by applying the PA cutoff point recently proposed as a malnutrition marker (PA ≤ 4.9°) in Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression models. RESULTS The patients were divided into two groups according to the PA cutoff value (PA > 4.9°, n = 73; PA ≤ 4.9°, n = 61). Weight, height, and body mass index were similar in both groups, but patients with PAs > 4.9° were younger and had higher mid-arm muscle circumference, albumin, and handgrip-strength values and lower severe ascites and encephalopathy incidences, interleukin (IL)-6/IL-10 ratios and C-reactive protein levels than did patients with PAs ≤ 4.9° (P ≤ 0.05). Forty-eight (35.80%) patients died due to cirrhosis, with a median of 18 mo (interquartile range, 3.3-25.6 mo) follow-up until death. Thirty-one (64.60%) of these patients were from the PA ≤ 4.9° group. PA ≤ 4.9° significantly and independently affected the mortality model adjusted for Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score and age (hazard ratio = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.11-3.77, P = 0.021). In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with PAs ≤ 4.9° were significantly more likely to die. CONCLUSION In male patients with cirrhosis, the PA ≤ 4.9° cutoff was associated independently with mortality and identified patients with worse metabolic, nutritional, and disease progression profiles. The PA may be a useful and reliable bedside tool to evaluate prognosis in cirrhosis.","[{'authorId': '2248110655', 'name': 'Stefano Bianchi'}, {'authorId': '15648945', 'name': 'A.

7865118d23041cd99cdafc46afa4cb95711a772a,"A dynamic interactive theory of person construal is proposed. It assumes that the perception of other people is accomplished by a dynamical system involving continuous interaction between social categories, stereotypes, high-level cognitive states, and the low-level processing of facial, vocal, and bodily cues. This system permits lower-level sensory perception and higher-order social cognition to dynamically coordinate across multiple interactive levels of processing to give rise to stable person construals. A recurrent connectionist model of this system is described, which accounts for major findings on (a) partial parallel activation and dynamic competition in categorization and stereotyping, (b) top-down influences of high-level cognitive states and stereotype activations on categorization, (c) bottom-up category interactions due to shared perceptual features, and (d) contextual and cross-modal effects on categorization. The system's probabilistic and continuously evolving activation states permit multiple construals to be flexibly active in parallel. These activation states are also able to be tightly yoked to ongoing changes in external perceptual cues and to ongoing changes in high-level cognitive states.

This process was apparently automatic, as participants asked to imagine exclusion overestimated explicit distress and underestimated implicit positivity (Experiment 3). Four final experiments showed that this automatic emotion regulation process was found among participants low (but not high) in depressive symptoms (Experiments 5 and 6) and among participants high (but not low) in self-esteem (Experiments 7 and 8).

As hospital systems run far over capacity, facing possible shortages of critical care medical resources and personal protective equipment as well as clinician deaths, the psychological stressors necessitate a strong well-being support model for staff. At the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City, health care workers have been heroically providing frontline care to COVID-19 patients while facing their own appropriate fears for their personal safety in the setting of contagion. This moral obligation cannot be burdened by unacceptable risks; the health system’s full support is required to address the needs of its workforce. In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe how an MSHS Employee, Faculty, and Trainee Crisis Support Task Force—created in early March 2020 and composed of behavioral health, human resources, and well-being leaders from across the health system—used a rapid needs assessment model to capture the concerns of the workforce related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force identified 3 priority areas central to promoting and maintaining the well-being of the entire MSHS workforce during the pandemic: meeting basic daily needs; enhancing communications for delivery of current, reliable, and reassuring messages; and developing robust psychosocial and mental health support options. Using a work group strategy, the task force operationalized the rollout of support initiatives for each priority area. Attending to the emotional well-being of health care workers has emerged as a central element in the MSHS COVID-19 response, which continues to be committed to the physical and emotional needs of a workforce that courageously faces this crisis.","[{'authorId': '4353831', 'name': 'J.

To explore the direct and indirect associations of maternal emotion control, executive functioning, and social cognitions maternal with harsh verbal parenting and child behavior and to do so guided by social information processing theory.


Background
Studies have demonstrated a relationship between maternal harsh parenting and increased child conduct problems. However, less is known about how maternal emotion and cognitive control capacities and social cognitions intersect with harsh parenting and child behavior.


Method
Structural equation modeling was used with a convenience sample of 152 mothers from Appalachia who had a child between 3 and 7 years of age.


Results
Maternal emotion control and executive functioning were both inversely associated with child conduct problems. That is, stronger maternal emotion control was associated with less harsh verbal parenting and lower hostile attribution bias, and higher maternal executive functioning was related to less controlling parenting attitudes.


Conclusion
The results suggest maternal emotion and cognitive control capacities affect how mothers interact with their children and ultimately child conduct problems.


Implications
To more effectively reduce harsh verbal parenting and child conduct problems, interventions should help mothers to improve their emotion and cognitive control capacities.","[{'authorId': '11495686', 'name': 'A.

This study appealed to ‘ interoceptive inference ’ , under the FEP, to seek new insights into autonomic (dys)function and brain – body integration by examining the relationship between cardiac interoception and autonomic cardiac control in healthy controls and patients with forms of or- thostatic intolerance (OI); to (i) seek empirical support for interoceptive inference and (ii) delineate if this relationship was sensitive to increased interoceptive prediction error in OI patients during head-up tilt (HUT)/ symptom provocation. Measures of interoception and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded whilst supine and during HUT in healthy controls (N=20), postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS, N=20) and vasovagal syncope (VVS, N=20) patients. Compared to controls, interoceptive accuracy was reduced in both OI groups. Healthy controls' interoceptive sensibility positively correlated with HRV whilst supine. Conversely, both OI groups' interoceptive awareness negatively correlated with HRV during HUT. Our pilot study o ﬀ ers initial support for interoceptive inference and suggests OI cohorts share a central pathophysiology underlying interoceptive de ﬁ cits expressed across distinct cardiovascular autonomic pathophysiology.

To examine if cognitive restructuring (CR), behavioral activation (BA), and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) result in differential effects in the treatment of adult depression.


METHOD
We extracted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from a database updated yearly from PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Network and pairwise meta-analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of CR, BA, and CBT delivered in a face-to-face individual format, compared with waiting list (WL) and care-as-usual (CAU), on adult depression. The primary outcome was a standardized mean difference (SMD) in posttreatment depression severity. Tolerability of treatments and depression severity at follow-up were also assessed.


RESULTS
A total of 45 studies with 3,382 participants were included. There was no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between CR, BA, and CBT. All three interventions were superior to CAU; SMD 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI 0.08-1.07]; 0.52 [0.34-0.71]; 0.44 [0.28-0.60], respectively and WL 1.20 [0.69-1.70]; 1.15 [0.90-1.40]; 1.07 [0.87-1.26]. No difference in tolerability was found (risk ratio [RR] vs. CAU: 1.01 [0.04-22.81], 0.84 [0.63-1.11], and 0.96 [0.76-1.21], respectively). Metaregression and sensitivity analyses did not produce material differences.


CONCLUSIONS
Results suggest that CR or BA alone and their combination (CBT) may be effective interventions in comparison to WL and CAU in the treatment of adult depression. There was no evidence suggesting differences in effectiveness among the three treatments. More research is needed to derive conclusions about the performance of CR.

Specifically, it was tested whether attention allocation processes differ between individuals with overweight and normal weight using transient changes of food-related and neutral pictures. Change detection latencies in objects of central interest (CI) or objects of marginal interest (MI) were measured as an index of attention allocation in a sample of fifty-three students with overweight/obesity and sixty students with normal weight during a flicker paradigm with neutral, hypercaloric and hypocaloric food pictures. Both groups of participants showed an attentional bias for food-related pictures as compared to neutral pictures. However, the bias was larger in individuals with overweight than in individuals with normal weight when changes were of marginal interest, suggesting a stronger avoidance of the food-related picture. This study showed that food-related stimuli influence attention allocation processes in both participants with overweight and normal weight. In particular, as compared to individuals with normal weight, those with overweight seem to be characterised by a stronger attentional avoidance of (or smaller attention maintenance on) food-related stimuli that could be considered as a voluntary strategy to resist food consumption.","[{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

Comparability is achieved by establishing metrological traceability, which ensures that measurement procedures measure the same quantity and that the calibration of measurement procedures is traceable to a common reference system consisting of reference methods and materials. Whereas standardization ensures traceability to the International System of Units, harmonization ensures traceability to a reference system agreed on by convention. This article provides an overview of standardization and harmonization with an emphasis on commutability as an important variable that affects testing accuracy. Commutability of reference materials is required to ensure that traceability is established appropriately and that laboratory results are comparable. The use of noncommutable reference materials leads to inaccurate results. Whereas procedures and protocols for standardizing measurements are established and have been successfully applied in efforts such as the Hormones Standardization Program of the CDC, harmonization activities require new, more complex procedures and approaches. The American Association for Clinical Chemistry, together with its domestic and international partners, formed the International Consortium for Harmonization of Clinical Laboratory Results to coordinate harmonization efforts. Reference systems, as well as procedures and protocols to establish traceability of clinical laboratory tests, have been established and continue to be developed by national and international groups and organizations. Serum tests of thyroid function, including those for the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, are among the clinical procedures for which standardization efforts are well under way. Approaches to the harmonization of measurement procedures for serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone are likewise under development.","[{'authorId': '6839690', 'name': 'H.

Short-term emotions, defined as facial or vocal displays of emotion generally lasting less than 10 seconds and elicited by a specific and proximal event, were observed during recess in 71 children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, who were between 4 and 8 years old. Internalizing and externalizing symptomatology was assessed through parent and teacher questionnaire. Sociometric ratings were obtained from peers on children's anger and aggression. It was hypothesized following Tomkins (1979) and others that one affect becomes predominant in the emotional experience of the individual. Different operationalizations of this concept were examined. Using regression analyses, externalizing symptomatology was found to be predicted by higher levels of anger, lower levels of happiness, and lower levels of sadness. Internalizing symptomatology was found to be predicted by higher levels of sadness and lower levels of anger. It was concluded on the basis of these data that the relationship between short-term emotion and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology is best understood as the balance between different short-term emotions. Results are discussed in the context of theories of emotion and their functions.","[{'authorId': '6545070', 'name': 'J. Jenkins'}, {'authorId': '2297721', 'name': 'K.

To describe the psychometric properties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief measure of the prosocial behavior and psychopathology of 3-16-year-olds that can be completed by parents, teachers, or youths.


METHOD
A nationwide epidemiological sample of 10,438 British 5-15-year-olds obtained SDQs from 96% of parents, 70% of teachers, and 91% of 11-15-year-olds. Blind to the SDQ findings, all subjects were also assigned DSM-IVdiagnoses based on a clinical review of detailed interview measures.


RESULTS
The predicted five-factor structure (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity-inattention, peer, prosocial) was confirmed. Internalizing and externalizing scales were relatively ""uncontaminated"" by one another. Reliability was generally satisfactory, whether judged by internal consistency (mean Cronbach a: .73), cross-informant correlation (mean: 0.34), or retest stability after 4 to 6 months (mean: 0.62). SDQ scores above the 90th percentile predicted a substantially raised probability of independently diagnosed psychiatric disorders (mean odds ratio: 15.7 for parent scales, 15.2 for teacher scales, 6.2 for youth scales).


CONCLUSION
The reliability and validity of the SDQ make it a useful brief measure of the adjustment and psychopathology of children and adolescents.","[{'authorId': '2144914', 'name': 'R. Goodman'}]",5726.0,,18.0,Psychometric properties of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire.,2001.0

Nevertheless, empirical studies investigating this assumed relationship remain sparse. This study aimed to examine interrelations between the ability to perceive heartbeats accurately (interoceptive awareness), depressive symptoms, and anxiety in healthy participants. Methods: A well‐validated heartbeat perception task to measure interoceptive awareness together with two questionnaires indexing anxiety and depression were administered to 119 participants. Results: As main results we observed a negative correlation between heartbeat perception and depression. Only when focussing on high anxiety levels this negative correlation coefficient between depression and interoception remained significant. Conclusions: Our results highlight the possible relationship between depressive symptoms and interoceptive awareness and may have further implications for theoretical models of anxiety disorders and their treatment.

798f2229a7fe12881278232b363ff2ae9e510707,"OBJECTIVES
Self-compassion and emotional regulation have been identified as constructive attitudes towards the self which can reduce emotional distress. This study is the first to examine the role of a self-compassionate attitude towards the self in reducing symptoms of social anxiety. The study also explored the role of emotional regulation strategies of cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES) as mechanisms that mediate the impact of self-compassion on social anxiety.


DESIGN
Structural equation modelling (SEM) was conducted on cross-sectional correlational data with MPlus version 6.


METHODS
A sample of 750 undergraduate students (378 men and 372 women) completed an online survey comprised of well validated self-report measures of social anxiety, emotional regulation and self-compassion.


RESULTS
Structural equation modelling showed that self-compassion predicted lower social anxiety directly and indirectly through lower ES. Higher self-compassion also predicted higher CR. Contrary to expectation, CR did not predict lower social anxiety. Exploratory analyses of self-compassion divided into Compassionate Self-responding (CSR) and Refraining from Non-compassionate Responding (RUSR) identified RUSR as a predictor of lower social anxiety directly and indirectly via ES and CR. CSR had no direct effect on social anxiety but did so indirectly via CR.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings provide preliminary evidence that self-compassion can play an important role in alleviating social anxiety and that emotion regulation through ES and CR are important mechanisms of that influence.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
Adopting a more compassionate attitude towards the self can reduce the symptoms of social anxiety Emotional regulation through reducing emotional suppression may be a mechanism whereby higher levels of self-compassion reduce symptoms of social anxiety. Although higher levels of self-compassion predict greater use of emotional regulation through cognitive appraisal, cognitive appraisal does not predict levels of symptoms of social anxiety The capacity to refrain from non-compassionate self-responding may reduce symptoms of social anxiety directly and indirectly through lower levels of emotional suppression and greater cognitive reappraisal (CR). However, compassionate self-responding only influences symptoms of social anxiety through CR.","[{'authorId': '34620978', 'name': 'G. Bates'}, {'authorId': '52167054', 'name': 'B.

However, their memory for social stress events has received far less attention. The aim of the study was to investigate infants’ memory for a stressful social event (i.e., maternal unresponsiveness during the Still-Face paradigm) after a 15-day recall interval using changes in behavioral responses and salivary post-stress cortisol reactivity as measures of memory. Thirty-seven infants were exposed to social stress two times (experimental condition); the first time when they were 4 months of age and second exposure after a 2 week interval. Infants in the control condition (N = 37) were exposed to social stress just one time, at the age corresponding to the second exposure for infants in the experimental condition (4 months plus 2 weeks). Given individual differences in infants’ reactivity to social stress events, we categorized infants as increasers or decreasers based on their cortisol reactivity after their initial exposure to the stress of the maternal still-face. Infants in the experimental condition, both increasers and decreasers, showed a significant change in cortisol response after the second exposure to the maternal still-face, though change was different for each reactivity group. In contrast, age-matched infants with no prior exposure to the maternal still-face showed similar post-stress cortisol reactivity to the reactivity of the experimental infants at their first exposure. There were no behavioral differences between increasers and decreasers during the Still-Face paradigm and exposures to the social stress. Thus differences between the experimental and control groups’ post-stress cortisol reactivity was associated with the experimental group having previous experience with the social stress. These findings indicate long-term memory for social stress in infants as young as 4 months of age.","[{'authorId': '6062290', 'name': 'R. Montirosso'}, {'authorId': '83022844', 'name': 'E.

Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties.

(3) Results: The results showed that the COVID-19 lockdown rules had an impact on Emotional Regulation and on a re-balancing of PES. Moreover, pre-pandemic expressive–suppressive ERQ strategies and ANPS SADNESS scores appeared as relevant risk factors, which predicted higher Global Severity Index (GSI) scores during lockdown.

7a280e10b73803e4ec6c38e4ea41bab532629b5e,"Physicians experience many emotionally challenging situations in their professional lives, influencing their emotional state through emotion contagion or social appraisal processes. Successful emotion regulation is crucial to sustain health, enable well-being, foster resilience, and prevent burnout or compassion fatigue. Despite the alarmingly high rate of stress-related disorders in physicians, affecting not only physician well-being, but also outcomes such as physician performance, quality of care, or patient satisfaction, research on how to deal with emotionally challenging situations in physicians is lacking. Based on extant literature, the present article proposes a theoretical model depicting emotions, emotion regulation, and empathy-related processes and their relation to well-being in provider-client interactions. This model serves as a basis for future research and interventions aiming at improving physician well-being and professional functioning. As a first step, interviews with 21 psychiatrists were conducted. Results of qualitative and initial quantitative analyses provided detailed descriptions of the model's components confirming its usefulness for detecting mechanisms linking emotion regulation and well-being in psychiatrist-patient interactions. Additionally, results lend preliminary support for the validity of the model, suggesting that successful regulation of emotions (i.e., achieving a desired emotional state) elicited by cyclical transfer processes in provider-client interactions is associated with both short- and long-term well-being and resilience. Furthermore, empathy-related emotions and their regulation seem to be linked to well-being. Based on the results of the present study, a prospective longitudinal study is under preparation, which is intended to inform effective interventions targeting emotion transfer, empathy-related processes, and emotion regulation in physicians' professional lives. The model and results are also potentially applicable to other health care and social services providers.","[{'authorId': '51210685', 'name': 'Sonja Weilenmann'}, {'authorId': '47675704', 'name': 'U.

The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a precise estimate of the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among outpatients in different clinical specialties. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources and eligibility criteria The PubMed and PsycINFO, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify observational studies that contained information on the prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in outpatients. All studies included were published before January 2016. Data characteristics were extracted independently by two investigators. The point prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms was measured using validated self-report questionnaires or structured interviews. Assessments were pooled using a random-effects model. Differences in study-level characteristics were estimated by meta-regression analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using standard χ2 tests and the I2 statistic. The study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO under number CRD42017054738. Results Eighty-three cross-sectional studies involving 41 344 individuals were included in this study. The overall pooled prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms was 27.0% (10 943/41 344 individuals; 95% CI 24.0% to 29.0%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (p<0.0001, τ2=0.3742, I2=96.7%). Notably, a significantly higher prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms was observed in outpatients than in the healthy controls (OR 3.16, 95% CI 2.66 to 3.76, I2=72.0%, χ2=25.33). The highest depression/depressive symptom prevalence estimates occurred in studies of outpatients from otolaryngology clinics (53.0%), followed by dermatology clinics (39.0%) and neurology clinics (35.0%). Subgroup analyses showed that the prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in different specialties varied from 17.0% to 53.0%. The prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms was higher among outpatients in developing countries than in outpatients from developed countries. Moreover, the prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in outpatients slightly decreased from 1996 to 2010. Regarding screening instruments, the Beck Depression Inventory led to a higher estimate of the prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms (1316/4702, 36.0%, 95% CI 29.0% to 44.0%, I2=94.8%) than the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (1003/2025, 22.0%, 95% CI 12.0% to 35.0%, I2=96.6%). Conclusion Our study provides evidence that a significant proportion of outpatients experience depression or depressive symptoms, highlighting the importance of developing effective management strategies for the early identification and treatment of these conditions among outpatients in clinical practice.

We hypothesized that trait self-esteem would be related to social pain responsiveness, and we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to experimentally investigate this potential relationship. Participants (n = 26) performed a cyberball task, a computerized game of catch during which the participants were excluded from the game. Participants then rated the degree of social pain experienced during both inclusion in and exclusion from the game. Individuals with lower trait self-esteem reported increased social pain relative to individuals with higher trait self-esteem, and such individuals also demonstrated a greater degree of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation. A psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed a positive connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices for the lower trait self-esteem group, and a corresponding negative connectivity for the higher trait self-esteem group. Heightened dorsal anterior cortex activity and a corresponding connection with the prefrontal cortex might be one possible explanation for the greater levels of social pain observed experienced by individuals with low trait self-esteem.","[{'authorId': '2660754', 'name': 'K.

Methods Cross-sectional data from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 were analysed (n = 17,777 ≥ 15 years; 52% females; self-weighting sample). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form was used to measure PA. Total PA MET-minutes/week were calculated, and participants were divided into two categories: 1) Less than 600 MET-minutes/week. 2) At least 600 MET-minutes/week, equivalent to meeting current PA recommendations. Cataracts were self-reported in response to the question “Have you ever been diagnosed with cataracts?”. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations overall and by age groups (15–49, 50–64, and 65–69 years; 15–49 and 50–69 years). Covariates included in the analysis were sex, education, BMI (Body Mass Index), multimorbidity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Results The overall prevalence of cataract was 3.7%, and the overall prevalence of participating in less than 600 MET-minutes/week of PA was 30.2%. In the adjusted overall analysis, less than 600 MET-minutes/week of PA was associated with significantly higher odds for cataract: OR = 1.324 (95% CI = 1.116–1.571). Age-stratified analyses showed that the association between PA and cataract was significant only in the age groups of 65–69 years and 50–69 years. Conclusions A significant association between PA and cataract was observed in people aged 15–69 years residing in Spain. Considering the impact on health and quality of life due to reduced PA in people with cataract, at least 600 MET-minutes/week activity should be promoted.","[{'authorId': '1401719372', 'name': 'G.

Religious attendance is associated with U.S. adult mortality in a graded fashion: People who never attend exhibit 1.87 times the risk of death in the follow-up period compared with people who attend more than once a week. This translates into a seven-year difference in life expectancy at age 20 between those who never attend and those who attend more than once a week. Health selectivity is responsible for a portion of the religious attendance effect: People who do not attend church or religious services are also more likely to be unhealthy and, conse-quently, to die. However, religious attendance also works through increased social ties and behavioral factors to decrease the risks of death. And although the magnitude of the association between religious attendance and mortality varies by cause of death, the direction of the association is consistent across causes.","[{'authorId': '5945819', 'name': 'R.

Material and Methods: A total number of 529 type 1 and type 2 diabetes outpatients were included in the study. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess the construct validity, Cronbach’s Alpha for internal consistency and Pearson’s correlation for predictive properties. Results: Distress level was lower in Romanian diabetes patients when compared to other studies. Model fit for the scale was moderate. The four factor structure of the original scale was maintained, with a good internal consistency for the entire scale (0.824) and for the four subscales: emotional burden (0.775), distress related to the physician (0.798), distress related to diabetes regimen (0.708), and interpersonal distress (0.733). Regarding predictive properties, DDS-Ro was positively correlated to depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (r = 0.415, p < 0.05) and to diabetes self-care activities measured with the Summary of Diabetes-Self-Care Activities, with the strongest correlation between diabetes regimen distress and physical activities (r = - 0.358, p < 0.01). Conclusions: DDS-Ro has good psychometric properties in Romanian diabetes patients and can be used when diabetes emotional impact is assessed.","[{'authorId': '34639999', 'name': 'A.

Recent research suggests that self-compassion is a promising construct for psychologists in terms of its ability to promote psychological wellbeing and resilience to stress; however, the potential benefits of self-compassion are yet to be thoroughly explored amongst this occupational group. Additionally, while a growing body of research supports self-compassion as a key predictor of psychopathology, understanding of the processes by which self-compassion exerts effects on mental health outcomes is limited. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test an emotion regulation model of self-compassion and stress among psychologists, including postgraduate trainees undertaking clinical work (n = 198). Self-compassion significantly negatively predicted emotion regulation difficulties and stress symptoms. Support was also found for our preliminary explanatory model of self-compassion, which demonstrates the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties in the self-compassion-stress relationship. The final self-compassion model accounted for 26.2% of variance in stress symptoms. Implications of the findings and limitations of the study are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2256279782', 'name': 'Amy Finlay‐Jones'}, {'authorId': '3206857', 'name': 'C.

Building on meta-analytic data, this study finds greater support for the causal relationships implied by a psychological construal of the construct and reveals that CO influences frontline employees' job outcomes through its effects on stress and engagement. Moderation analyses also indicate that CO's influence on model variables is stronger when frontline employees' customer workloads increase and is weaker as the need for customer persuasion increases. These findings contradict widely held assumptions rooted in a behavioral view of CO—namely, that CO is a consequence of job states, a proximate determinant of job outcomes, and most beneficial when ample opportunity for customer engagement exists. Overall, the results support a broadened perspective that recognizes that CO improves job outcomes because it enhances frontline employees' psychological welfare in addition to being good for business. These findings suggest that managers should consider CO an important criterion in frontline employee decisions, recognize CO as beneficial when limited opportunity for customer engagement exists, and avoid efforts to curtail CO's costs at the frontline employee level.","[{'authorId': '7391583', 'name': 'A.

This paper explains the reason by introducing service context. Two situational experiments are used to demonstrate that under the context of high perceived control, customers expect AI service agents with more anthropomorphic designs to perform better and prefer highly human-like AI service agents. However, under the context of low perceived control, customers perceive stronger threat in facing AI service agents with more anthropomorphic designs and prefer less human-like AI service agents. Moreover, we find that this effect is significant only in social scenarios. These findings provide new insights into previous inconsistent evidence regarding anthropomorphic design’s influence on customers’ willingness to use AI service agents. Our findings also have important implications for AI service agents design in different service contexts and advance the literature on human–robot interaction and marketing.","[{'authorId': '2152917048', 'name': 'Yang Yang'}, {'authorId': '2119034585', 'name': 'Yue Liu'}, {'authorId': '121868286', 'name': 'Xingyang Lv'}, {'authorId': '2055059671', 'name': 'Jin Ai'}, {'authorId': '2110489183', 'name': 'Yifan Li'}]",63.0,,86.0,Anthropomorphism and customers’ willingness to use artificial intelligence service agents,2021.0

Patients were scanned on 12 occasions in the same session, with each scan paired with brief exposure to one of a hierarchy of contaminants that elicited increasingly intense urges to ritualise. The relationship between symptom intensity and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF; an index of neural activity) was subsequently examined in the group and in individual patients. The group showed significant positive correlations between symptom intensity and blood flow in the right inferior frontal gyrus, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus, and the left hippocampus and posterior cingulate gyrus. Negative correlations were evident in the right superior prefrontal cortex, and the temporoparietal junction, particularly on the right side. The pattern in single subjects was broadly similar, although individual differences in neural response were also observed. A graded relationship between symptom intensity and regional brain activity can thus be identified in obsessive–compulsive disorder. It is hypothesised that the increases in rCBF in the orbitofrontal cortex, neostriatum, global pallidus and thalamus were related to urges to perform compulsive movements, while those in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex corresponded to the anxiety that accompanied them.","[{'authorId': '2059328622', 'name': 'P.

 Perception and expression of emotion are key factors to the success of dialogue systems or conversational agents. However, this problem has not been studied in large-scale conversation generation so far. In this paper, we propose Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM) that can generate appropriate responses not only in content (relevant and grammatical) but also in emotion (emotionally consistent). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM addresses the factor using three new mechanisms that respectively (1) models the high-level abstraction of emotion expressions by embedding emotion categories, (2) captures the change of implicit internal emotion states, and (3) uses explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary. Experiments show that the proposed model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion.

The aim is to explore what type of challenges trigger group-level emotion regulation and what kind of co- and socially shared emotion regulation strategies emerge in relation to these challenges. The participants are 62 higher education students, who collaborated in groups during a six-week mathematics course. The data consist of 87 h of video-recorded learning sessions. In the analysis, first, the challenges emerging during collaborative learning were located. Second, co- and socially shared emotion regulation activated in the face of challenges were traced and the related emotion regulation strategies were classified. The results provide evidence about the collaborative groups’ emotion regulation, highlighting that group-level emotion regulation can be activated in relation to different types of challenges. The results also revealed four different types of strategies which the group members used to manifest emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '2445256', 'name': 'H.

Participants (n = 236) completed measures of coping styles, dispositional gratitude, and measures of well–being. Gratitude correlated positively with seeking both emotional and instrumental social support, positive reinterpretation and growth, active coping, and planning. Gratitude correlated negatively with behavioural disengagement, self–blame, substance use, and denial. Coping styles mediated up to 51% of the relationship between gratitude and stress, but did not substantially mediate the relationship between gratitude and either happiness, depression, or satisfaction with life. We suggest that different mechanisms relate gratitude to separate aspects of well–being.

7c95d8fe969693dd71573dd803493d0869a915bd,"Abstract A model of the neuropsychology of anxiety is proposed. The model is based in the first instance upon an analysis of the behavioural effects of the antianxiety drugs (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol) in animals. From such psychopharmacologi-cal experiments the concept of a “behavioural inhibition system” (BIS) has been developed. This system responds to novel stimuli or to those associated with punishment or nonreward by inhibiting ongoing behaviour and increasing arousal and attention to the environment. It is activity in the BIS that constitutes anxiety and that is reduced by antianxiety drugs. The effects of the antianxiety drugs in the brain also suggest hypotheses concerning the neural substrate of anxiety. Although the benzodiazepines and barbiturates facilitate the effects of γ-aminobutyrate, this is insufficient to explain their highly specific behavioural effects. Because of similarities between the behavioural effects of certain lesions and those of the antianxiety drugs, it is proposed that these drugs reduce anxiety by impairing the functioning of a widespread neural system including the septo-hippocampal system (SHS), the Papez circuit, the prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways which innervate these forebrain structures. Analysis of the functions of this system (based on anatomical, physiological, and behavioural data) suggests that it acts as a comparator: it compares predicted to actual sensory events and activates the outputs of the BIS when there is a mismatch or when the predicted event is aversive. Suggestions are made as to the functions of particular pathways within this overall brain system. The resulting theory is applied to the symptoms and treatment of anxiety in man, its relations to depression, and the personality of individuals who are susceptible to anxiety or depression.","[{'authorId': '2237635445', 'name': 'J.

Of particular interest was the effect of parent-and-child gender match on these relationships. Materials and Methods: This was a population-based parent-and-child dyad health survey utilizing a random sampling technique. Adolescent IA was measured by the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) designed by Young. The mental health status of the parents was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS). Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Model (SEM) techniques with stratification by parent-and-child gender match. Results: One thousand ninety-eight (n = 1,098) parent-and-child dyads were recruited, and useful information was obtained. The mean IAT score was 28.6 (SD = 9.9) for parents and 41.7 (SD = 12.4) for adolescents. Results of the SEM suggested that the effect of parental depression on adolescent IA was mediated through adolescent mental health mainly through adolescent stress (regression weight = 0.33, p < 0.001) and less so through adolescent depression (regression weight = 0.19, p < 0.001) or parental IA (regression weight = 0.13, p < 0.001). Further analysis revealed that these mediating relationships are more significantly manifested in the father-and-son and mother-and-daughter dyads. Conclusions: Result suggested that the relationship between parental mental health and adolescent IA is complex and that adolescent mental health and parental IA also play important roles as mediating factors.

BA involves the identification and enactment of activities that are reinforcing to the individual and consistent with his or her long-term goals. The application of BA for the treatment of chronic pain is fully consistent with models of chronic pain which post that fear and avoidance leads to a cycle of physical deconditioning, increased pain as a result of deconditioning, lack of positive reinforcement, and low mood, and further reduced motivation to physically engage. The present paper will detail the assessment and use of BA to treat ""Veteran,"" a patient with low back and bilateral foot pain.

Review methods All included studies were randomised controlled trials in children (including adolescents) or adults with type 1 diabetes that evaluated the effect of a psychological therapy (counselling, cognitive behaviour therapy, family systems therapy, and psychodynamic therapy) on control of diabetes. Data were extracted on sample size, age, duration of diabetes, type of psychological therapy, its mode of delivery, and type of intervention in control group. Main outcome measures Glycaemic control measured by percentage of glycated haemoglobin and psychological distress. Pooled standardised effect sizes were calculated. Results 29 trials were eligible for the systematic review and 21 trials for the meta-analysis. In the 10 studies of children and adolescents included in the meta-analysis, the mean percentage of glycated haemoglobin was significantly reduced in those who had received a psychological intervention compared with those in the control group (pooled standardised mean difference −0.35 (95% confidence interval −0.66 to −0.04), equivalent to a 0.48% (0.05% to 0.91%) absolute reduction in glycated haemoglobin. In the 11 studies in adults the pooled standardised mean difference was −0.17 (−0.45 to 0.10), equivalent to 0.22% (−0.13% to 0.56%) absolute reduction in glycated haemoglobin. Psychological distress was significantly lower in the intervention groups in children and adolescents (pooled standardised effect size −0.46, −0.83 to −0.10) but not in adults (−0.25, −0.51 to 0.01). Conclusion Psychological treatments can slightly improve glycaemic control in children and adolescents with diabetes but have no effect in adults.","[{'authorId': '144437617', 'name': 'K.

7dc7805207d6fcd242f231af0f74fdc40b2907e3,"ABSTRACT Background: Emotion regulation difficulties are common among individuals from refugee backgrounds. Little is known, however, about whether there are specific patterns relating to the types of emotion regulation strategies commonly employed by refugees, nor how this relates to psychopathology. Moreover, wider literature on emotion regulation has primarily focused on examining specific emotion regulation strategies in isolation, rather than patterns of emotion regulation across multiple strategies. Objective: The current study was the first to identify individual differences in patterns of habitual emotion regulation among refugees, and explore their unique associations with trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. Method: Levels of trait reappraisal and suppression were measured among 93 refugees, using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the White Bear Suppression Inventory. A latent class analysis was conducted to identify distinct classes of participants based on differing levels of habitual engagement in reappraisal and suppression. The association between class membership and key variables indexing refugee experiences (e.g. trauma exposure) and psychopathology (e.g. PTSD symptoms and emotion dysregulation) were also examined. Results: Latent class analysis revealed three distinct profiles of habitual emotion regulation: a high regulators class (55.7%; high trait reappraisal/high trait suppression), an adaptive regulators class (23.6%; high trait reappraisal/moderate trait suppression), and a maladaptive regulators class (20.6%; low trait reappraisal/high trait suppression). Each class evidenced unique relations with trauma exposure and psychopathology. Compared to adaptive regulators, maladaptive regulators had more PTSD symptoms, experienced greater emotion dysregulation, and were more likely to be female, while high regulators had experienced more types of traumatic events. Conclusions: This study identified distinct patterns of emotion regulation among refugees. Our findings demonstrate the importance of measuring multiple strategies to uncover patterns of emotion regulation and better understand the links between emotion regulation and psychopathology, which has important implications for the development of effective treatment with traumatized refugees. HIGHLIGHTS • A latent class analysis of habitual engagement in key emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal and suppression) was conducted among refugees.• Three distinct emotion regulation profiles emerged: high regulators (55.7%; high trait reappraisal/high trait suppression), adaptive regulators (23.6%; high trait reappraisal/moderate trait suppression), and maladaptive regulators (20.6%; low trait reappraisal/high trait suppression).• Compared to adaptive regulators, maladaptive regulators had more PTSD symptoms, while high regulators had been exposed to more types of traumatic events.","[{'authorId': '46217289', 'name': 'Philippa Specker'}, {'authorId': '145530893', 'name': 'A.

Fear of falling is common in older people, occurring on average in 50% of those who have fallen in the previous year. Little is known about the psychological correlates of fear of falling. The purpose of this study was to determine whether clinically significant depression and anxiety were independently associated with fear of falling.


METHODS
This was a cross-sectional study of 105 persons age > or =60 years, admitted to medical or orthopedic wards, who had fallen at least once in the previous 12 months. Fear of falling was assessed using two different constructs: 1) intensity of fear; and 2) self-efficacy. Depressive and anxiety disorders were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Depression and anxiety severity were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Demographic, physical, functional, and social variables previously found to be associated with fear of falling were also measured. Logistic-regression and multiple-regression analyses were used to examine the independent association of affective variables with fear of falling.


RESULTS
Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, depression severity, and anxiety severity had significant independent associations with both constructs of fear of falling. Of all the variables that were measured, depressive disorders and depression severity had the strongest associations with fear of falling.


CONCLUSION
Affective variables had a stronger association with fear of falling than non-affective variables in a hospital-based group of subjects. Further research is needed to determine whether similar findings occur in a community-based sample of older people.","[{'authorId': '36501901', 'name': 'Nadine Gagnon'}, {'authorId': '144262868', 'name': 'A.

Mentalization theory as well as the dialectical behaviour therapy and emotion-focused therapy literature specifies particular beliefs thought to be related to emotion dysregulation and therefore to a label of borderline personality disorder. The current study aimed to develop a questionnaire to measure the beliefs about emotions as specified by this literature and to test the relationship of this new measure to various aspects of emotion regulation in a non-clinical sample of 289 participants. A factor analysis extracted six factors, which described beliefs about emotions as (a) overwhelming and uncontrollable; (b) shameful and irrational; (c) invalid and meaningless; (d) useless; (e) damaging; and (f) contagious. The final measure showed some promising psychometric properties. All of the questionnaire subscales were related to aspects of emotion dysregulation including distress, borderline personality disorder symptoms and behaviours associated with dysregulation of emotion, suggesting that beliefs about emotions could be an important metacognitive construct involved in the ability to regulate emotions. Beliefs about emotions may be a useful direct or indirect target for treatment of difficulties regulating emotions, and this could be achieved through the use of various therapeutic modalities.","[{'authorId': '40589342', 'name': 'R.

7e0638a2de9bfc7dda555f021f2ff841017ef59a,"The autonomic nervous system and theories of emotion Overview Descriptions of emotion frequently include both a physiological and a facial expressive component. The physiological component has been described as changes in the peripheral autonomic nervous system often characterized by increased sweating, throbbing of the heart, pupillary dilation, facial flush, and gastric motility. These physiological responses have been hypothesized as either a necessary mediating mechanism or a peripheral correlate of the emotional experience (Cannon, 1927; James, 1884). Moreover, there is renewed speculation that some physiological signatures are associated with specific emotional states (e.g., Ekman, Levenson, & Friesen, 1983). In contrast with the research that has eloquently described detailed facial patterns and the social contexts associated with specific emotions, the role of physiology in the development of expressivity and the regulation of affect has not been adequately investigated. Although in the temperament literature a physiological substrate is commonly assumed to be related to the regulation of affect (e.g., Bates, Freeland, & Lounsbury, 1979; Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981), physiological measures are seldom quantified. Moreover, physiological constructs rarely motivate this area of research or provide insight into individual variations in the regulation and expression of affect.","[{'authorId': '4226466', 'name': 'S.

7e76e5500d01426017eb8715c03e2a3cec007196,"BACKGROUND
Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder causing intellectual disability. Children with WS often exhibit various kinds of maladaptive behaviours that affect their social functioning. In order to determine whether these behaviours are syndrome-specific, it would be necessary to compare children with WS with children with other syndromes as well as to provide data on the socio-emotional profile in WS from a variety of cultures. The present study investigated the behavioural profile and its relation to maternal stress in Greek young children with WS in comparison with young children with Down syndrome and typically developing (TD) children.


METHODS
Participants were 60 mothers, 20 in each syndrome group and 20 in the control group. The three groups were matched for mental age. The behavioural profile of the participants was investigated through the Child Behaviour Checklist (1.5-5 years) and maternal stress through the Parental Stress Index.


RESULTS
In accordance with studies in other cultures, it was found that young children with WS received significantly higher rates in emotional problems and anxiety/depression, compared with both children with Down syndrome and TD children. Moreover, mothers of children with WS reported significantly higher scores in the Total Stress index compared with mothers of TD children. However, in contrast with previous studies, only 25% of children with WS fell into the clinical range in the total Child Behavior Checklist score.


CONCLUSION
The consistency of the socio-emotional characteristics of children with WS across cultures and developmental stages implies a strong influence of the genetic phenotype. However, Greek mothers avoided to characterize these behaviours as pathological. Implications of these findings for clinical practice are also discussed.","[{'authorId': '6631252', 'name': 'C.

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Community sample drawn from eastern Sydney, Australia. Participants 500 men and women aged 70–90 years. Main outcome measures Baseline assessment of medical, physiological, and neuropsychological measures, with physiological fall risk estimated with the physiological profile assessment, and perceived fall risk estimated with the falls efficacy scale international. Participants were followed up monthly for falls over one year. Results Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that perceived and physiological fall risk were both independent predictors of future falls. Classification tree analysis was used to split the sample into four groups (vigorous, anxious, stoic, and aware) based on the disparity between physiological and perceived risk of falling. Perceived fall risk was congruent with physiological fall risk in the vigorous (144 (29%)) and aware (202 (40%)) groups. The anxious group (54 (11%)) had a low physiological risk but high perceived fall risk, which was related to depressive symptoms (P=0.029), neurotic personality traits (P=0.026), and decreased executive functioning (P=0.010). The stoic group (100 (20%)) had a high physiological risk but low perceived fall risk, which was protective for falling and mediated through a positive outlook on life (P=0.001) and maintained physical activity and community participation (P=0.048). Conclusion Many elderly people underestimated or overestimated their risk of falling. Such disparities between perceived and physiological fall risk were primarily associated with psychological measures and strongly influenced the probability of falling. Measures of both physiological and perceived fall risk should be included in fall risk assessments to allow tailoring of interventions for preventing falls in elderly people.","[{'authorId': '2926333', 'name': 'K.

In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future.

Here we used somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) to investigate whether mere observation of painful and tactile stimuli delivered to a model would modulate neural activity in the somatic system of an onlooker. Viewing video clips showing pain and tactile stimuli delivered to others, respectively, increased and decreased the amplitude of the P45 SEP component that reflects the activity of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). These modulations correlated with the intensity but not with the unpleasantness of the pain and touch ascribed to the model or the aversion induced in the onlooker by the video clips. Thus, modulation of S1 activity contingent upon observation of others' pain and touch may reflect the mapping of sensory qualities of observed painful and tactile stimuli. Results indicate that the S1 is not only involved in the actual perception of pain and touch but also plays an important role in extracting somatic features from social interactions.","[{'authorId': '2892673', 'name': 'I.

Sixty-four parents of preschoolers (50% girls) completed questionnaires assessing their own regulation practices (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression), parenting behaviors (i.e., parental warmth/nurturance, inductive discipline), and children’s prosocial behavior (voluntary behavior intended to benefit another). The authors hypothesized that cognitive reappraisal would be positively and expressive suppression would be negatively related to parenting behaviors and children’s prosocial behavior. They further hypothesized that parental warmth and inductive discipline would mediate the relations between parents’ own regulation strategies and children’s prosocial behavior. Results demonstrated that parental cognitive reappraisal was positively associated with warmth, and expressive suppression was negatively associated with inductive discipline and children’s prosocial behavior. Parental warmth, but not inductive discipline, mediated the relations between cognitive reappraisal and children’s prosocial behavior. The results highlight adults’ own regulatory strategies as predictors of socialization behaviors and the potential processes for socialization of children’s moral emotions and positive social development.","[{'authorId': '79572373', 'name': 'Sonya Xinyue Xiao'}, {'authorId': '2255586037', 'name': 'Tracy L.

Each ballot was used and evaluated by the subjects using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the pre-and post-fatigue means were compared, with no significant differences found. Although the reduction in variance did not affect the results, it was discovered that sequential usability judgments may result in decision fatigue.

This study aims to define alexithymia’s connections with shame, trauma, dissociation, and body image disorders. Methods We administered the Dissociative Experience Scale-II, Trauma Symptom Inventory, Experience of Shame Scale, Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, and Body Uneasiness Test questionnaires to 143 ED subjects. Extensive statistical analyses were performed. Results The subjects showed higher scores on alexithymia, shame, dissociation, and traumatic feelings scales than the nonclinical population. These aspects are linked with each other in a statistically significant way. Partial correlations highlighted that feelings of shame are correlated to body dissatisfaction, irrespective of trauma or depressed mood. Multiple regression analysis demonstrates that shame (anorexic patients) and perceived traumatic conditions (bulimic and ED not otherwise specified) are associated with adverse image disorders. Conclusion Shame seems to hold a central role in the perception of an adverse self-image. Alexithymia may be interpreted as being a consequence of previous unelaborated traumatic experiences and feelings of shame, and it could therefore be conceptualized as a maladaptive–reactive construct.","[{'authorId': '6182820', 'name': 'E.

Despite academic demands, university students also face new stressors, such as different social networks, financial changes, and adaptation to new family and social roles that may have a negative impact on their mental health (Pidgeon & Pickett, 2017). In this sense, resilience literature has gained acceptance explaining how some students successfully adapt to university life while others find great challenges. Since resilience has been defined as the ability to successfully adapt in the face of stress and adversity, it is important to determine what psychological factors contribute enhancing this resilience levels. One of the factors related to life adaptation is optimism, understood as the general expectancy of obtaining positive outcomes in the future (Scheier & Carver, 1985). Hence, the aim of this study is to study the relationship between optimism and resilience among a sample of university students in Spain. The sample was comprised of 132 students from the University of Cadiz (Spain). Participants were selected by quota sampling from first to last year of studies. The majority of students (72.5%) were female and average age was 21.71 (range = 18–48, SD = 3.75). Participants completed the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale (Spanish version adapted by Novella, 2002) and Life Orientation Test (LOT-R Spanish version adapted by Ferrando, Chico & Tous). We performed hierarchical multiple regression analysis and obtained that optimism explained 25% of resilience among university students (R2 = .25, â = .49). No gender and age differences were observed. Thus, identifying the factors that influence students’ adjustment to university life can improve the targeting of interventions to improve university academic performance. Moreover, this research could contribute helping students to successfully face this life transition, increasing their well-being and life satisfaction levels and decreasing university absenteeism.","[{'authorId': '117556881', 'name': 'Rocío Gómez Molinero'}, {'authorId': '29944266', 'name': 'Antonio Zayas'}, {'authorId': '1413479919', 'name': 'Paula Ruiz-González'}, {'authorId': '5819342', 'name': 'R.

One of the most widely used fit measures is Bentler and Bonett's (1980) normed index. This article has three purposes: (1) to propose a new incremental fit measure that provides an adjustment to the normed index for sample size and degrees of freedom, (2) to explain the relation between this new fit measure and the other ones, and (3) to illustrate its properties with an empirical example and a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation suggests that the mean of the sampling distribution of the new fit measure stays at about one for different sample sizes whereas that for the normed fit index increases with N. In addition, the standard deviation of the new measure is relatively low compared to some other measures (e.g., Tucker and Lewis's (1973) and Bentler and Bonett's (1980) nonnormed index). The empirical example suggests that the new fit measure is relatively stable for the same model in different samples.

However, there is little work to guide decisions on the optimum number of trials to use, which should balance reliability and power against task duration and participant burden. Here, 174 participants completed 100 trials of a widely used heartbeat detection task where participants attempt to detect whether presented tones occurred synchronously or asynchronously with their heartbeats. First, we quantified measurement reliability of the participant's accuracy derived from differing numbers of trials of the task using a correlation metric; we found that at least 40-60 trials were required to yield sufficient reliability. Next, we quantified power by simulating how the number of trials influenced the ability to detect a correlation between cardiac interoceptive sensitivity and other variables that differ across participants, including a variable measured from our sample (body mass index) as well as simulated variables of varying effect sizes. Using these simulations, we quantified the trade-offs between sample size, effect size, and number of trials in the heartbeat detection task such that a researcher can easily determine any one of these variables at given values of the other two variables. We conclude that using fewer than 40 trials is typically insufficient due to poor reliability and low power in estimating an effect size, although the optimal number of trials can differ by study.","[{'authorId': '87262323', 'name': 'I.

The five criteria for equivalence were based on comparisons of meaning or predictions of similar responses to original or translated versions. The factors of content, difficulty, language and content-language interaction were significant, and the five equivalence criteria proved workable.

Furthermore, they assess whether customer verbal abuse is only a critical issue for employees in jobs requiring emotional labor, measured with both O*NET job codes and self-reported display rules. With a national random sample of U.S. employees (n = 2446) and a convenience sample of U.S. employees who have customer contact (n = 121), the authors find that verbal abuse from outsiders (1) occurs more frequently than insider verbal abuse, particularly for those with higher emotional labor requirements, and (2) predicts emotional exhaustion over and above insider verbal abuse, regardless of emotional labor requirements.

This disorder affects important aspects of a person’s life such as professional quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between post-traumatic stress symptoms and professional quality of life among psychiatric nurses. Methods & Materials: In this descriptive analytical study, 160 nurses in psychiatric wards affiliated to Kerman University of Medical Sciences, were selected using census sampling in 2013. Data were collected using questionnaires including professional and demographic characteristics, the Weathers’ PTSD checklist (PCL-C) and Hudnall Stamm’s Professional Quality of Life (PQOL). Data were analyzed by the SPSS software v.20 using the Pearson correlation coefficient, independent t-test, one-way ANOVA and linear regression. Results: There was a significant correlation between PTSD score and professional quality of life scores in psychiatric nurses (r=0.32, P<0.001). Also, PTSD was positively correlated with burnout (r=0.36, P<0.001) and secondary traumatic stress (r=0.61, P<0.001), and conversely correlated with compassion satisfaction (r=-0.29, P<0.001). After removing the effects of age, work experience, previous experience of traumatic events, the correlation between two main research variables was significant as well (P<0.001). Conclusion: Post-traumatic stress has a correlation with professional quality of life in psychiatric nurses.

to influence the amount of stress among employees. Furthermore, it identifies the perception of risk as 
a mediating factor in the relation between self efficacy and job stress. A total of 83 (57%) employees 
filled in a digital survey. The survey consisted of 49 statements measured by a five-point likert scale. 
The results confirm a main effect of self efficacy on job stress, and a mediating effect of risk perception with a reverse causal effect. These results lead to a conclusion that during a recession, self efficacy of change negatively relates to job stress, and supports the general notion that self efficacy will effect job stress. Because of the confirmation of the reversed causality, a mediating effect of risk perception cannot be confirmed. However, it is made clear that there is a relation between job stress and risk perception.

The third study examined differences in verbal and nonverbal behaviors displayed by high and low CAs in employment interview situations. In general, these studies indicate that high CAs avoid thinking about interviews, avoid preparing for them, and use a pattern of communicative minimization (few gestures, few words, etc.) in employment interviews.

Two valid and reliable instruments were used to assess emotional intelligence and academic self-efficacy while participants’ first semester result was used as a measure of academic achievement. Descriptive statistics, Pearson Product Moment Correlation and hierarchical regression analysis were used to analyse the data. The result demonstrated that emotional intelligence and academic self-efficacy significantly correlated with academic achievement. The moderating effect of emotional intelligence on the relationship between academic self-efficacy and achievement was also established. On the basis of the findings, it is suggested that emotional intelligence should be integrated into undergraduate curriculum. The study further advocated for the promulgation of educational policy on emotional intelligence and academic self-efficacy.","[{'authorId': '12276141', 'name': 'D. A.

Investigate the psychometric characteristics of the coping self-efficacy (CSE) scale, a 26-item measure of one's confidence in performing coping behaviors when faced with life challenges.


DESIGN
Data came from two randomized clinical trials (N1=149, N2=199) evaluating a theory-based Coping Effectiveness Training (CET) intervention in reducing psychological distress and increasing positive mood in persons coping with chronic illness.


METHODS
The 348 participants were HIV-seropositive men with depressed mood who have sex with men. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention and comparison conditions and assessed pre- and post-intervention. Outcome variables included the CSE scale, ways of coping, and measures of social support and psychological distress and well-being.


RESULTS
Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) revealed a 13-item reduced form of the CSE scale with three factors: Use problem-focused coping (6 items, alpha=.91), stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts (4 items, alpha=.91), and get support from friends and family (3 items, alpha=.80). Internal consistency and test-retest reliability are strong for all three factors. Concurrent validity analyses showed these factors assess self-efficacy for different types of coping. Predictive validity analyses showed that residualized change scores in using problem- and emotion-focused coping skills were predictive of reduced psychological distress and increased psychological well-being over time.


CONCLUSIONS
The CSE scale provides a measure of a person's perceived ability to cope effectively with life challenges, as well as a way to assess changes in CSE over time in intervention research.","[{'authorId': '144965996', 'name': 'M.

Study 1 participants were far more likely to experience a violent impulse during conflictual interaction with their romantic partner than they were to enact a violent behavior, suggesting that self-regulatory processes help individuals refrain from perpetrating IPV when they experience a violent impulse. Study 2 participants high in dispositional self-control were less likely to perpetrate IPV, in both cross-sectional and residualized-lagged analyses, than were participants low in dispositional self-control. Study 3 participants verbalized more IPV-related cognitions if they responded immediately to partner provocations than if they responded after a 10-s delay. Study 4 participants whose self-regulatory resources were experimentally depleted were more violent in response to partner provocation (but not when unprovoked) than were nondepleted participants. Finally, Study 5 participants whose self-regulatory resources were experimentally bolstered via a 2-week training regimen exhibited less violent inclinations than did participants whose self-regulatory resources had not been bolstered. These findings hint at the power of incorporating self-regulation dynamics into predictive models of IPV perpetration.","[{'authorId': '3367382', 'name': 'E.

At three time points, data were collected from an online survey about playing crowdsourcing games. Time-lagged regression, cross-temporal correlation, and structural equation modeling were performed to examine determinants of the acceptance of crowdsourcing games. Results indicate that the revised UTAUT2 is applicable to explaining the acceptance of crowdsourcing games. Not only did effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and social influence directly affect users’ continuance intention toward crowdsourcing games, but time-based variations also emerged in users’ perceptions and acceptance of the games and in how their perceptions affect their acceptance. The findings answer the call for a context-specific acceptance model and the identification of factors of adopting gamification.","[{'authorId': '48630717', 'name': 'Xiaohui Wang'}, {'authorId': '1731861', 'name': 'D.

To develop an empirically grounded conceptualization of personal autonomy in the context of chronic physical illness and to investigate the impact of two chronic illnesses on autonomy. Method. Grounded theory study consisting of 13 in-depth interviews with older adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or diabetes mellitus type 2 (diabetes). Results. The results indicate that autonomy involves taking account of current circumstances as the frame of reference in which people can arrange their lives. Chronic illness disturbed autonomy by limiting opportunities and by prompting a reappraisal of the value that people placed on different activities or aspects of life. The participants responded to this disturbance differently, in ways that did not always restore autonomy. Limited opportunities occurred more often with COPD, while reappraisal occurred more often with diabetes. Conclusions. Personal autonomy in the context of chronic physical illness might be conceptualized as correspondence between the way people's lives are actually arranged and the way people want their lives to be arranged, considering the circumstances. Health professionals could stimulate their clients to prevent and overcome impasses in the realisation of autonomy, while broad self-management interventions might improve people's skills for coping with the impact of chronic illness on autonomy.","[{'authorId': '11175518', 'name': 'Godelief M.

According to popular opinion and work-place testimonials, emotional intelligence increases performance and productivity; however, there has been a general lack of independent, systematic analysis substantiating that claim. The authors investigated whether emotional intelligence would account for increases in individual cognitive-based performance over and above the level attributable to traditional general intelligence. The authors measured emotional intelligence with the Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale (MEIS; J. D. Mayer, P. Salovey, & D. R. Caruso, 1997). As measured by the MEIS, overall emotional intelligence is a composite of the 3 distinct emotional reasoning abilities: perceiving, understanding, and regulating emotions (J. D. Mayer & P. Salovey, 1997). Although further psychometric analysis of the MEIS is warranted, the authors found that overall emotional intelligence, emotional perception, and emotional regulation uniquely explained individual cognitive-based performance over and beyond the level attributable to general intelligence.","[{'authorId': '2070533112', 'name': 'Laura Thi Lam'}, {'authorId': '49933831', 'name': 'S.

82ca45ca411a0cb4e9bb28ec0f3bf26a5f0681f5,"Mounting evidence suggests that response inhibition involves both proactive and reactive inhibitory control, yet its underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive. In particular, the roles of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal lobe (IPL) in proactive and reactive inhibitory control are still under debate. This study aimed at examining the causal role of the right IFG and IPL in proactive and reactive inhibitory control, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and the stop signal task. Twenty-two participants completed three sessions of the stop signal task, under anodal tDCS in the right IFG, the right IPL, or the primary visual cortex (VC; 1.5 mA for 15 min), respectively. The VC stimulation served as the active control condition. The tDCS effect for each condition was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-tDCS performance. Proactive control was indexed by the RT increase for go trials (or preparatory cost), and reactive control by the stop signal RT. Compared to the VC stimulation, anodal stimulation of the right IFG, but not that of the IPL, facilitated both proactive and reactive control. However, the facilitation of reactive control was not mediated by the facilitation of proactive control. Furthermore, tDCS did not affect the intraindividual variability in go RT. These results suggest a causal role of the right IFG, but not the right IPL, in both reactive and proactive inhibitory control.","[{'authorId': '2116972603', 'name': 'Ying Cai'}, {'authorId': '1390905572', 'name': 'Siyao Li'}, {'authorId': '2153466659', 'name': 'Jing Liu'}, {'authorId': '46599097', 'name': 'Dawei Li'}, {'authorId': '1853355', 'name': 'Zifang Feng'}, {'authorId': '1896016766', 'name': 'Qiang Wang'}, {'authorId': '49752037', 'name': 'Chuansheng Chen'}, {'authorId': '143877322', 'name': 'G.

Currently, the literature does not allow to determine stable similarities and differences in the use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) in anxiety and depression, especially concerning the adaptive strategies. Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify the overlapping and distinctive patterns of CERS use in the recently proposed types of anxiety and depression in a general population. In this dimensional approach, types of anxiety and depression are considered as personality types and distinguished based on their specific structural composition and functional role (reactive or regulative) in stimulation processing. 1,632 participants from a representative sample completed the Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire (measuring the Arousal and Apprehension Types of anxiety and the Valence and Anhedonic Types of depression) and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Regression analyses were conducted with the affective types as predictors. The co-occurrence of the types was accounted for in order to examine their independent relationships with the CERS. We found that reactive arousal anxiety was not related to any strategies, while regulative apprehension anxiety primarily predicted the use of rumination, which is presumably related to the type's cognitive structural components. The strategy specific to reactive valence depression was other-blame (as predicted by the high negative affect in its structure), and the regulative, most structurally complex anhedonic depression predicted the use of the largest number of strategies, including the adaptive ones. The relationships between the types of depression and self-blame and refocus on planning were moderated by sex but the effects were small. These findings fit into the current trend of exploring the shared and specific features of anxiety and depression, which might facilitate their differentiation by identifying CERS that are characteristic for the specific types. This information can be used for supporting diagnosis and targeting selected strategies in therapy both in clinical and non-clinical populations.","[{'authorId': '6293163', 'name': 'Ewa Domaradzka'}, {'authorId': '8814671', 'name': 'Małgorzata Fajkowska'}]",42.0,,55.0,Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies in Anxiety and Depression Understood as Types of Personality,2018.0

To replicate and extend work on the psychometric properties of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), a child and parent self-report instrument used to screen for children with anxiety disorders.


METHOD
The 41-item version of the SCARED was administered to a new sample of 190 outpatient children and adolescents and 166 parents. The internal consistency, discriminant, and convergent validity were assessed. In addition, using discriminant function analysis, a briefer version of the SCARED was developed.


RESULTS
Using item analyses and factor analyses on the 41-item version, 5 factors were obtained: panic/somatic, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, and school phobia. In general, the total score and each of the 5 factors for both the child and parent SCARED demonstrated good internal consistency and discriminant validity (both between anxiety and depressive and disruptive disorders and within anxiety disorders). A reduced version of the SCARED yielded 5 items and showed similar psychometrics to the full SCARED.


CONCLUSIONS
In a new sample, the authors replicated their initial psychometric findings that the SCARED is a reliable and valid instrument to screen for childhood anxiety disorders in clinical settings. Furthermore, pending future research, the 5-item SCARED appears to be a promising brief screening inventory for anxiety disorders in epidemiological studies.","[{'authorId': '5141715', 'name': 'B.

Typically, aging is associated with decreases in the amount of slow wave sleep and increases in stage 1 and 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep, often attributed to an increased number of spontaneous arousals that occur in the elderly. Elderly individuals tend to go to sleep earlier in the evening and wake earlier due to a phase advance in their normal circadian sleep cycle. Furthermore the development of sleep-related respiratory disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea or Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA-CSR) associated with congestive heart failure (CHF) occur with increasing prevalence in the elderly. The development of such disorders is often of major concern because they are associated with systemic hypertension and cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders such as diabetes, and impaired neurocognition.

The current study aims to examine the mediating role of coping strategies in the relationship between risk perception of COVID-19 and psychological well-being, as well as the relationship between meaning-based resources and psychological well-being amongst healthcare personnel in southern Poland. Two hundred and twenty-six healthcare personnel who worked in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and medical laboratories during the first few months of the coronavirus pandemic (March–May 2020) filled in questionnaires measuring risk perception of COVID-19, meaning-based resources, coping, and psychological well-being. The results demonstrate that risk perception was negatively related to psychological well-being, whereas meaning-based resources were positively associated with well-being. Two coping strategies—problem-focused and meaning-focused coping—mediated the relationship between risk perception and psychological well-being as well as the relationship between meaning-based resources and psychological well-being.

Instead, participants indicated after the speech to what extent they used self-motivated expressive suppression or reappraisal during the task. The results show that suppression is associated with less anxiety expression, greater physiological responding, and less memory for the speech while having no impact on negative affect. In contrast, reappraisal has no impact on physiology and memory while leading to less expression and affect.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a smartphone app to improve stress coping skills, suicidal ideation, and perceived reasons for living among patients at elevated risk of suicide and self-harm.


METHODS
The authors conducted a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with two groups of U.S. service veterans in active mental health treatment who had recently expressed suicidal ideation. Between March 2014 and April 2015, 118 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to use the VHB (N=58) or to a control group that received printed materials about coping with suicidality (N=60) to supplement treatment as usual over a 12-week period. Three measures-the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Brief Reasons for Living Inventory-were collected at baseline (before randomization) and three, six, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures-the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-were collected at baseline and 12 weeks.


RESULTS
VHB users reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (Coping Self-Efficacy Scale) at three (b=2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.29-4.55) and 12 weeks (b=2.99, 95% CI=.08-5.90) compared with the control group. No significant advantage was found on other outcome measures for treatment augmented by the VHB.


CONCLUSIONS
The VHB is a demonstrably useful accessory to treatment-an easily accessible tool that can increase stress coping skills. Because the app is easily disseminated across a large population, it is likely to have broad, positive utility in behavioral health care.","[{'authorId': '40146228', 'name': 'N.

Although previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains (e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. Our model converses by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation. The strength of our model is that it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this straightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training dataset. Our preliminary results suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to converse well. It is able extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find a solution to a technical problem via conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense reasoning.

Purpose
Emotional intelligence (EI) is crucial to determine the emotional labor (EL) strategies and satisfaction of teachers. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships of EI with EL strategies, emotional exhaustion and teaching satisfaction (TS) of secondary teachers in private schools.


Design/methodology/approach
A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data conveniently from 322 secondary teachers working in 22 private schools.


Findings
Results indicate that teachers’ EI positively affect surface acting, expression of naturally felt emotions (ENFE) and TS. Surface acting and ENFE are positively related with TS. Deep acting and ENFE exhibit positive relations with emotional exhaustion of teachers. The study also confirms direct as well as indirect effects of EI on TS through surface acting and ENFE.


Practical implications
This study recommends teachers to make a higher use of surface acting and ENFE because they produce the most TS and the least emotional exhaustion.


Originality/value
This is the first study that examines the mediating role of EL strategies for EI and TS.

Many studies have examined the variables that can affect burnout amongst ER nurses, but little is known about factors that can protect ER nurses against work-related stress.


METHOD
A multi-centre cross-sectional design was used. Burnout level intensity, dispositional mindfulness facets, difficulties in emotion regulation and empathy dimensions were assessed using valid and reliable self-report questionnaires in a sample of ER nurses (N = 97) from three different hospitals.


RESULTS
Higher dispositional mindfulness and cognitive empathy levels and lower difficulties in emotion regulation, were negatively associated with emotional exhaustion levels.


CONCLUSION
ER nurses with more mindful, emotion regulation and empathy skills are more able to manage work-related distress.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
Experiential interventions to promote mindfulness skills, emotion regulation variability and flexibility in a clinical context and the cognitive side of empathy are recommended for ER nurses to reduce professional distress, and to enhance personal and work satisfaction. Future research should assess the effectiveness of new multi-factorial interventions which combine the development of mindfulness, emotion regulation and empathy skills in ER nurses.","[{'authorId': '87605352', 'name': 'Valerio Salvarani'}, {'authorId': '87894630', 'name': 'G.

Young children’s mood quality as well as mothers’ mood quality, flexibility/rigidity, emotion dysregulation, parenting stress, cumulated severity of stress, and emotion-focused coping added unique incremental variance to the prediction of child maltreatment potential, accounting for 67% of the variance overall. Further, mothers’ emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between mothers’ flexibility/rigidity and child maltreatment potential. Consequently, emotion regulation skills represent an important point of intervention for mothers of young children who are at increased risk for child maltreatment due to difficult temperament characteristics.","[{'authorId': '48828365', 'name': 'Amanda F.

Burnout is usually defined as a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors, characterrized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and lack of social accomplishment. Coping mechanisms and job satisfaction are associated with the incidence of burnout symptoms in a work context.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The aim of this paper was to make a systematic analysis of the literature related to nurses' stress and the incidence of burnout syndrome in intensive care nurses, and also to determine the research into associations between coping mechanisms and job satisfaction on one side, and burnout on the other side. Appropriate databases (Scopus, PubMed) were searched with the aim of finding relevant studies and articles published in the last 15 years. The keywords were burnout, coping mechanisms, job satisfaction, nurses, and intensive care. Two independent reviewers carried out a selection of the studies.


RESULTS
The literature review found 786 studies about burnout and its association with different variables. Twenty-nine original research papers were discovered in this review process. Open questions still remain concerning burnout and the associations between the considered variables. We also found that studies using a qualitative approach, which could provide better insight into the investigation of burnout, was insufficient in this area.


CONCLUSION
Burnout syndrome is serious problem for healthcare systems and affects almost all profiles of healthcare workers. Although burnout is an evidence-based public health problem, there is still no systematic approach to prevention. Prevention activities to reduce stress and the incidence of burnout should be provided for nurses, especially those in very demanding posts.","[{'authorId': '25711864', 'name': 'Adriano Friganović'}, {'authorId': '4602030', 'name': 'P.

However, the perceived changes in psychological adjustment during home confinement with respect to the period before the pandemic have not been addressed yet. Moreover, little is known about the role of coparenting and specific COVID‐19 contextual variables on parental stress and children's behavioral difficulties in the Italian context. Using a cross‐sectional survey, we collected data on 841 Italian parents of children aged 3–11 years with typical development during the home confinement (20th April–18th May). We analyzed levels of parental stress, coparenting, and child externalizing behaviors before and during the home confinement. Additionally, hierarchical regressions were performed to investigate predictors of parental stress and child externalizing behaviors during the lockdown. Results showed that parental stress (especially in mothers) and child externalizing behaviors increased during the lockdown period. Coparenting was a strong predictor of parental stress, together with being a mother, younger child age, less time dedicated to the child, and scarce feasibility of remote working. Besides, child externalizing behaviors were predicted by male gender, less parental time dedicated to the child, higher parental stress, and child distance learning workload. Our findings indicate a negative impact of COVID‐19 lockdown in both parents and children, suggesting that positive coparenting and time dedicated to children may help to reduce the detrimental effect of pandemic restrictions on family adjustment.","[{'authorId': '1386995068', 'name': 'M.

Burnout is a pervasive health condition affecting many doctors at various stages in their careers. Characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment it can result in significant personal and professional consequences putting patient care at risk. Emotion regulation describes a capacity to self-modulate emotions to achieve desirable emotional outcomes. Emotional intelligence theory suggests that emotion regulation skills facilitate the maintenance of appropriate emotions, reducing or adapting undesirable emotions in oneself and others. Emotion regulation is usually automatic but can be controlled through learnt strategies. There is evidence that occupationally stressed individuals are less capable of down-regulating negative emotions. This paper systematically reviews studies of the role of emotion regulation in burnout in doctors.


Aims
To examine the relationship between emotion regulation and burnout among doctors.


Methods
Four online databases (Psych Info 1833-2017, Medline 1928-2017, Scopus 1960-2017 and Embase 1974-2017) were searched in August 2017. Searches returned 15 539 citations, which after de-duplication yielded 12 295 citations. After title and abstracts screening 12 273 citations were excluded. Twenty-two full text articles were read and eight excluded for ineligibility. Following data extraction, bias and methodological quality assessment, findings were synthesized using descriptive analysis and presented according to relevant themes.


Results
A correlative relationship was observed between emotion regulation and burnout in doctors. Findings also indicated that-using self-regulatory or taught emotion regulation skills or interventions such as mindfulness were associated with a reduction in burnout.


Conclusion
Emotion regulation is an important psychological variable associated with burnout.","[{'authorId': '1429777237', 'name': 'G. Jackson-Koku'}, {'authorId': '49423379', 'name': 'P. Grime'}]",34.0,,51.0,Emotion regulation and burnout in doctors: a systematic review.,2019.0
87468c641c54257f4c7bb4adb5b4523d5f2ec1fc,"Based on a basic emotions perspective, a dominant view in psychology is that the primary function of the amygdala is to govern the emotion of fear. In this view, the amygdala is necessary for a person to feel afraid, and when amygdala activity is detected, one can infer that a person is feeling afraid or threatened. In this paper, we review current research on amygdala function that calls into question this threat-specific view and propose a more general view of amygdala functioning based on appraisal theory and psychological constructivism. Specifically, we examine the hypothesis that the amygdala is involved in processing stimulus relevance for the goals and motivations of the perceiver. Thus, although threatening stimuli are almost always considered a relevant stimulus, novel, ambiguous, and extremely positive stimuli can also be relevant for different people in different situations. Once deemed relevant, the amygdala guides processing to orchestrate an appropriate response.","[{'authorId': '2792268', 'name': 'William A. Cunningham'}, {'authorId': '2256291', 'name': 'T.

875d7fb323f9c0e840dbdb3f7d7d4675d96773dd,"This paper explores the potential for certain types of stressors to build resilience in the occupational setting. Using the challenge-hindrance stressor framework (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, & Boudreau, 2000), we propose that challenge stressors have the potential to promote the capacity for resilience, whereas hindrance stressors experienced in the workplace erode resilient functioning. Employing a 2-wave longitudinal design we examined the effects of challenge and hindrance stressors on psychological resilience and strain 3 months later. Two-hundred and 8 working adults (48.1% female) participated in both surveys. Findings indicated that Time 1 challenge stressors had a significant effect on psychological resilience 3 months later (Time 2). In contrast, Time 1 hindrance stressors positively predicted Time 2 strain and negatively predicted psychological resilience. Moreover, resilience mediated the relationship between Time 1 stressors and Time 2 strain. These results demonstrate the potential positive and negative impacts of workplace stressor types on psychological resilience, and provide an exploration of a mechanism through which challenge and hindrance stressors influence well-being. This analysis also investigated the role of resilience in moderating the relationship between hindrances and strain. Some evidence emerged for the moderating role of resilience in the hindrance-strain relationship. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

More recently, a converging body of literature has shown that the somatosensory cortex also plays an important role in each stage of emotional processing, including identification of emotional significance in a stimulus, generation of emotional states, and regulation of emotion. Importantly, studies conducted in individuals suffering from mental disorders associated with abnormal emotional regulation, such as major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and panic disorders, specific phobia, obesity, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, have found structural and functional changes in the somatosensory cortex. Common observations in the somatosensory cortices of individuals with mood disorders include alterations in gray matter volume, cortical thickness, abnormal functional connectivity with other brain regions, and changes in metabolic rates.

Results revealed that emotion-regulation abilities moderated both the association between perceived stress and depression/happiness for the total sample.

In short, when males reported a high level of perceived stress, those with high scores in regulating emotions reported higher scores in subjective happiness and lower depression symptoms than those with low regulating emotions. However, no interaction effect of regulating emotions and stress for predicting subjective happiness and depression was found for females.

This cognitive control process, termed response inhibition, refers to the ability to inhibit an action once initiated and has been localized to the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) based on functional imaging and brain lesion studies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a brain stimulation technique that can facilitate as well as impair cortical function. To explore whether response inhibition can be improved through rIFG electrical stimulation, we administered focal tDCS before subjects performed the stop signal task (SST), which measures response inhibition. Notably, activation of the rIFG by unilateral anodal stimulation significantly improved response inhibition, relative to a sham condition, whereas the same tDCS protocol did not affect response time in the go trials of the SST and in a control task. Furthermore, the SST was not affected by tDCS at a control site, the right angular gyrus. Our results are the first demonstration of response inhibition improvement with brain stimulation over rIFG and further confirm the rIFG involvement in this task.

8874cd40e18ebad1ceccbd09382aa92e9fe0f07c,"Abstract Objective: To assess the sensitivity to within person change over time of an outcome measure for practitioners in primary care that is applicable to a wide range of illness. Design: Comparison of a new patient generated instrument, the measure yourself medical outcome profile (MYMOP), with the SF-36 health profile and a five point change score; all scales were completed during the consultation with practitioners and repeated after four weeks. 103 patients were followed up for 16 weeks and their results charted; seven practitioners were interviewed. Setting: Established practice of the four NHS general practitioners and four of the private complementary practitioners working in one medical centre. Subjects: Systematic sample of 218 patients from general practice and all 47 patients of complementary practitioners; patients had had symptoms for more than seven days. Outcome measures: Standardised response mean and index of responsiveness; views of practitioners. Results: The index of responsiveness, relating to the minimal clinically important difference, was high for MYMOP: 1.14 for the first symptom, 1.33 for activity, and 0.85 for the profile compared with <0.45 for SF-36. MYMOP's validity was supported by significant correlation between the change score and the change in the MYMOP score and the ability of this instrument to detect more improvement in acute than in chronic conditions. Practitioners found that MYMOP was practical and applicable to all patients with symptoms and that its use increased their awareness of patients' priorities. Conclusion: MYMOP shows promise as an outcome measure for primary care and for complementary treatment. It is more sensitive to change than the SF-36 and has the added bonus of improving patient-practitioner communication. Key messages A generic health status instrument provides a useful profile of an individual or population, but is not necessarily responsive to change An instrument that is patient generated may be responsive while remaining brief The use of a patient generated measure within the consultation helps the practitioner to be more patient centred Outcome measurements in chronic disease are more meaningful if charted alongside the diverse treatment options that patients use.","[{'authorId': '2222025', 'name': 'C.

88820f251399f4787721c446974cbd1afb027ecd,"This research aimed to identify whether improvement in working conditions, children’s classroom behavior and work-life balance can lower teacher burnout ratio in Pakistan’s special schools by using techniques such as emotions regulation. The researcher employed a quantitative research methodology to fulfill the research’s purpose. The data for this research was collected using a questionnaire-based instrument. The confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques were used to test the construct validity and underlying structural relationships. The findings demonstrated that the impacts of all three variables are significant in reducing job burnout in teachers. Emotional regulation helps decrease the impact of working conditions and the children’s behavior. Nevertheless, it does not aid work-life balance as it requires other techniques of emotional regulation. The research is significant as it highlights the importance of overall working conditions’ improvement for teachers working with special needs children. The improvements are essential because the teachers must take extra effort and emotions into their job compared to a typical teacher. The researcher has highlighted the key finding, implications and limitations of this research besides suggesting directions for future research to facilitate peer researchers.","[{'authorId': '1578187297', 'name': 'S.

This study tested a meditation model linking leader charisma to organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) via work engagement. The authors administered 91 participants the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, the OCB Scale, and the Work Engagement Scale. The results indicated a significant positive relation between charismatic leadership and work engagement, between work engagement and OCB, and between charismatic leadership and OCB. Results also indicate a full mediation of leadership's effects on OCB via work engagement. This mediation relation suggests some of the mechanisms of charismatic leadership, and it provides an interesting avenue for future research.","[{'authorId': '1423318203', 'name': 'Meredith Elaine Babcock-Roberson'}, {'authorId': '37334882', 'name': 'O.

In short, the authors’ model suggests that effective emotion regulation and self-leadership, as mediated through positive affect and self-efficacy, has the potential to facilitate stress coping among students. A primary implication of the model is that basic emotion regulation and self-leadership strategies could be included in introductory management courses to potentially increase management students’ abilities to cope with stress. Furthermore, because the model has the potential to generalize to the workplace, management students exposed to emotion regulation and self-leadership strategies may be better equipped to effectively manage stress in their future careers.","[{'authorId': '35461166', 'name': 'Jeffery D.

In this study, we examined the frequency with which popularly used tests disagree, whether the method an investigator uses makes a difference in the conclusion he or she will reach, and whether there is a most trustworthy test that can be recommended to balance practical and performance considerations. We found that tests agree much more frequently than they disagree, but disagreements are more common when an indirect effect exists than when it does not. We recommend the bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval as the most trustworthy test if power is of utmost concern, although it can be slightly liberal in some circumstances. Investigators concerned about Type I errors should choose the Monte Carlo confidence interval or the distribution-of-the-product approach, which rarely disagree. The percentile bootstrap confidence interval is a good compromise test.","[{'authorId': '23662196', 'name': 'A.

AB sparing was not attributable to a variety of nonaffective stimulus factors that could result in augmented distinctiveness. Arousal value, not the valence of stimulus events, was found to be responsible for AB sparing.

8901c0d50b7bcc780220a6e1ebfcb5726e792fdb,"Previous findings have shown that impulsivity and Behavioral Inhibition/Approach System (BIS/BAS) have substantial effects on adolescents’ Internet addiction, but the mechanisms underlying these associations and gender differences in these effects have received little attention. We examined the mediating effects of coping styles from impulsivity, and BIS/BAS to Internet addiction as well as gender differences in these associations. A total of 416 Chinese adolescents were examined using a cross-sectional survey involving Young’s Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, BIS/BAS scales, and Coping Style Scale for Middle School Students. The data were analyzed using the independent sample t-test, chi-square test, Pearson correlation, and structure equation modeling. The results from the multiple-group (by adolescent gender) structural model analysis revealed that both impulsivity (p < 0.001) and BIS (p = 0.001) directly predicted positive Internet addiction in girls, while both impulsivity (p = 0.011) and BAS (p = 0.048) directly predicted positive Internet addiction in boys. Furthermore, emotion-focused coping mediated the relationship between impulsivity and Internet addiction (β = 0.080, 95% CI: 0.023–0.168) and the relationship between BIS and Internet addiction (β = 0.064, 95% CI: 0.013–0.153) in girls, while in boys, problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping mediated the association between impulsivity and Internet addiction (β = 0.118, 95% CI: 0.031–0.251; β = 0.065, 95% CI: 0.010–0.160, respectively) and problem-focused coping mediated the association between BAS and Internet addiction [β = −0.058, 95% CI: (−0.142)–(−0.003)]. These findings extend our insight into the mechanisms underlying the associations among impulsivity, BIS/BAS, and Internet addiction in adolescents and suggest that gender-sensitive training approaches to decrease adolescents’ Internet addiction are indispensable. These interventions should focus on the different gender predictors of adolescent Internet addiction and on the development of specific coping styles for boys and girls respectively.","[{'authorId': '2118912224', 'name': 'Qi Li'}, {'authorId': '4763844', 'name': 'Weine Dai'}, {'authorId': '144999700', 'name': 'Yang Zhong'}, {'authorId': '2151976135', 'name': 'Lingxiao Wang'}, {'authorId': '12206612', 'name': 'Bibing Dai'}, {'authorId': '2130028915', 'name': 'Xun Liu'}]",61.0,,116.0,"The Mediating Role of Coping Styles on Impulsivity, Behavioral Inhibition/Approach System, and Internet Addiction in Adolescents From a Gender Perspective",2019.0

89197409e5d2695788bb43787ccfa895f44b6caa,"Purpose: Professional service firms' clients often develop stronger attachments to their key contact employee than to the service firm. Since professionals are highly mobile, buyers of professional business services constantly have to decide whether to follow their key contact employee or remain with their incumbent firm, while service firms face the threat of losing customers if the employee leaves. This study examines how the key contact employee's human capital, the social capital between the contact employee and the client, and the service company's structural capital affect the decision whether to follow the key contact employee to another professional service firm. Methodology/approach: The model is tested on a sample of 120 organizational buyers of advertising services by using partial last squares, a structural equation modelling technique. Findings: Professional service firms' investments in company-specific structural capital create a deterrent for clients to follow the contact employee, because remaining with the service firm will increase clients' return on the service providers' structural capital. Furthermore, higher levels of structural capital reduce the value of the contact employee's investments in human capital should the employee leave. Conversely, human capital creates motivation to follow the contact employee, while social capital only provides value in combination with human capital. Research implications: This study employs concepts developed in economics and economic sociology rather than relationship marketing variables to examine attachments to individual professional service providers and to professional service firms. Practical implications: The findings underline the importance of competence, both at the company and individual level, for retaining clients of professional services. These results contrast previous studies emphasizing close interpersonal relationships and service firms' relationship-building activities. Originality/value/contribution: Human, social, and structural capital provide value to clients and therefore apply well to professional services. Hence, these variables provide alternative explanations to service firms' client retention or desertion than traditional relationship marketing variables do. The findings add to our understanding of service provider–client relationships in professional services and knowledge intensive firms.","[{'authorId': '118968803', 'name': 'Harald Biong'}, {'authorId': '119990073', 'name': 'A.

The authors also investigated the moderating role of maternal BPD symptoms in the relation between infant temperamental anger and fear and punitive/minimizing emotion socialization. Using a sample of 99 mother-infant dyads, the authors found that maternal BPD symptoms were significantly related to punitive/minimizing emotion socialization and that maternal emotion regulation difficulties mediated this relation. Moreover, maternal BPD symptoms strengthened the association between mother-reported infant anger and punitive/minimizing emotion socialization.

Different measures have been adopted worldwide to contain the COVID-19, and these measures have various impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (CP) and lockdown policy on physical health (PH)–psychological health (PsH), physical activity (PA), and overall well-being (OW) in the context of HRQoL, exploring the mediating role of emotional regulation (ER). Method: The current study was conducted in two provincial cities of China. An online survey was conducted in both the cities to collect the data. After quantifying the data, a total of 2,200 respondents data were analyzed through appropriate statistical techniques. Results: The study results indicate that CP was found significantly and negatively related to PH (β = −0.157, t = 9.444, p < 0.001). A significant relationship was found between CP and PsH (β = 0.779, t = 45.013, p < 0.001). The third prediction revealed a significant negative relationship between the CP and OW (β = −0.080, t = 5.261, p < 0.001). The CP and PA had a significant negative relationship (β = −0.047, t = 3.351, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The PH, PsH, and OW of the Chinese people were affected due to the CP and lockdown measures. It is suggested that ER intervention reduces the negative psychological impacts for improving quality of life. ER can function one's sentiments in their social environment effectively for quality of life.","[{'authorId': '2087363148', 'name': 'Jianhui Dai'}, {'authorId': '2038004567', 'name': 'Xuehui Sang'}, {'authorId': '5231590', 'name': 'R.

Ademas, se encontro que la reactividad emocional era explicada en un 24% por el funcionamiento familiar, mientras que el corte emocional era predicho en un 42% por la edad de adopcion y el funcionamiento familiar. Un analisis de moderacion no encontro que el funcionamiento familiar moderara la relacion entre la edad de adopcion y el corte emocional. Por otro lado, se observo que la ansiedad en las relaciones de apego era explicada en un 13% por la cohesion familiar, y que la evitacion del apego se predecia en un 9% por la edad de adopcion. Asimismo, la ansiedad fue explicada en un 22% por la reactividad emocional, y la evitacion fue predicha en un 58% por el corte emocional. Por ultimo, la diferenciacion del self compartia el 50% de la varianza con la evitacion y la ansiedad. Se discute la relevancia de los resultados. EnglishIn the present research, the associations of various sociodemographic variables of the adult adoptee and the adoptive family, of the adoptive process and the family dynamics (family functioning and communication about adoption) with the level of differentiation of self and of attachment of adults adopted in Spain are analyzed. The study involved 50 adopted adults, national and international, of both sexes, between 18 and 51 years of age. To assess the variables, a self-made socio-demographic questionnaire, the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale-20Esp, the Adoption Communication Scale-Spanish, the Differentiation of Self Scale and the Experiences in Close Relationships-Spanish questionnaire were used. The results showed that differentiation of self of the adopted adults was explained in 27% by family functioning and in 9% by communication about adoption with the mother. It was also observed that differentiation of self was predicted in 58% by avoidance, anxiety and family functioning. In addition, emotional reactivity was explained in 24% by family functioning, while emotional cutoff was predicted in 42% by age of adoption and family functioning. A moderation analysis did not find that family functioning moderated the relationship between age of adoption and emotional cutoff. On the other hand, anxiety was explained in 13% by cohesion, and avoidance was predicted in 9% by adoption age. Likewise, anxiety was explained in 22% by emotional reactivity, and avoidance was predicted in 58% by emotional cutoff. Finally, differentiation of self shared 50% of the variance with avoidance and anxiety. The relevance of the results are discussed.","[{'authorId': '113020833', 'name': 'Jesús Oliver Pece'}]",2.0,,0.0,Variables familiares relacionadas con la diferenciación del self y el apego de las personas adultas adoptadas,2016.0

When used in the higher education sector, interventions tend to be used in psychology, psychotherapy and mindfulness programmes with successful outcomes in terms of student engagement, learning and well-being.

This triangulated action research study utilised student self-reported feedback to explore the link between positive psychology interventions and student engagement in a non-psychology related classroom. The study involved two intervention and one control group. In contrast to results obtained from psychology students, findings in this study showed a lack of student engagement in both intervention groups and a significant increase in student engagement in the control group compared to one of the intervention groups.

Given the common use of self-ratings and other-ratings (e.g., supervisor or coworker) of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the extent to which these rating sources provide comparable information. The current study's results provided three important lines of evidence supporting the use and construct-related validity of self-rated OCB. The meta-analysis of mean differences demonstrated that the mean difference in OCB ratings is actually quite small between self- and other-raters. Importantly, the difference between self- and other-raters was influenced by neither the response scale (i.e., agreement vs. frequency) nor the use of antithetical/reverse-worded items on OCB scales. The meta-analysis of correlations showed that self- and other-ratings are moderately correlated but that self–other convergence is higher when antithetical items are not used and when agreement response scales are used. In addition, self-ratings and supervisor-ratings showed significantly more convergence than self-ratings and coworker-ratings. Finally, an evaluation of self-rated and other-rated OCB nomological networks showed that although self-rated and other-rated OCBs have similar patterns of relationships with common correlates, other-rated OCB generally contributed negligible incremental variance to correlates and only contributed appreciable incremental variance to other-rated behavioral variables (e.g., task performance and counterproductive work behavior). Implications and future research directions are discussed, particularly regarding the need to establish a nomological network for other-rated OCB.

There is a paucity of data regarding possible differences in long-term neuropsychological outcomes following treatment with whole-vault cranioplasty or endoscopic strip craniectomy. This study provides the first comparative analysis examining the effects of the two techniques related to long-term intellectual functioning. Methods: A total of 70 patients were enrolled in this multicenter study, 29 of whom had previously undergone endoscopic strip craniectomy and 41 of whom had previously undergone whole-vault cranioplasty. All patients completed a battery of neurodevelopmental tests (Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, and Wechsler Fundamentals) to evaluate various domains of neuropsychological function. Results: In a group comparison of those treated before 6 months of age, whole-vault patients obtained higher scores relative to endoscopic strip craniectomy patients on visuomotor integration, full-scale intelligence quotient, verbal intelligence quotient, word reading, and reading comprehension (p < 0.05 for all). When compared against strip craniectomy performed before 3 months of age, the whole-vault group still showed significantly higher scores in verbal intelligence quotient, reading comprehension, and word reading (p < 0.05 for all). Conclusions: The type of surgical intervention for isolated sagittal synostosis impacts long-term neuropsychological outcomes. Patients undergoing early whole-vault cranioplasty attained higher intelligence quotient and achievement scores relative to those undergoing strip craniectomy. Surgical management with whole-vault cranioplasty performed before 6 months of age provides the most favorable long-term intellectual outcomes in patients with isolated sagittal synostosis.

Yet, only a tiny percentage of the disability literature addresses families of children with disabilities. A review of recently published family studies reveals salient trends and gaps. Recent findings Consistent with previous work, high levels of parent stress, illness, anxiety, and depression are apparent. Studies in the USA focused on parents of children with autism; in contrast, studies on parents of children with intellectual disabilities were almost always conduced abroad. Compared to other disabilities, families of children with psychiatric disorders and genetic syndromes are understudied. The majority of family studies are descriptive, with very few trials or interventions aimed at reducing parental stress. Of these, mindfulness practices and a peer-mentor model of treatment delivery hold much promise for effective stress reduction. Psychoeducational programs and respite care are differentially beneficial. Summary A new era of family intervention research is in order. This work can take advantage of many advances in telemedicine, peer-mentor models, smart technology, and biomarkers as indices of change. Benefit could also stem from group interventions with parents who share similar concerns, regardless of their child's diagnostic label.","[{'authorId': '2791518', 'name': 'E.

Emotions are vital to effective parenting. When invested in the interest of children, emotions organize sensitive, responsive parenting. Emotions undermine parenting, however, when they are too weak, too strong, or poorly matched to child rearing tasks. In harmonious relationships emotions are, on average, positive because parents manage interactions so that children's and parents' concerns are promoted.

The Multimodal Treatment Study (MTA) began as a 14-month randomized clinical trial of behavioral and pharmacological treatments of 579 children (7-10 years of age) diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-combined type. It transitioned into an observational long-term follow-up of 515 cases consented for continuation and 289 classmates (258 without ADHD) added as a local normative comparison group (LNCG), with assessments 2-16 years after baseline.


METHODS
Primary (symptom severity) and secondary (adult height) outcomes in adulthood were specified. Treatment was monitored to age 18, and naturalistic subgroups were formed based on three patterns of long-term use of stimulant medication (Consistent, Inconsistent, and Negligible). For the follow-up, hypothesis-generating analyses were performed on outcomes in early adulthood (at 25 years of age). Planned comparisons were used to estimate ADHD-LNCG differences reflecting persistence of symptoms and naturalistic subgroup differences reflecting benefit (symptom reduction) and cost (height suppression) associated with extended use of medication.


RESULTS
For ratings of symptom severity, the ADHD-LNCG comparison was statistically significant for the parent/self-report average (0.51 ± 0.04, p < .0001, d = 1.11), documenting symptom persistence, and for the parent/self-report difference (0.21 ± 0.04, p < .0001, d = .60), documenting source discrepancy, but the comparisons of naturalistic subgroups reflecting medication effects were not significant. For adult height, the ADHD group was 1.29 ± 0.55 cm shorter than the LNCG (p < .01, d = .21), and the comparisons of the naturalistic subgroups were significant: the treated group with the Consistent or Inconsistent pattern was 2.55 ± 0.73 cm shorter than the subgroup with the Negligible pattern (p < .0005, d = .42), and within the treated group, the subgroup with the Consistent pattern was 2.36 ± 1.13 cm shorter than the subgroup with the Inconsistent pattern (p < .04, d = .38).


CONCLUSIONS
In the MTA follow-up into adulthood, the ADHD group showed symptom persistence compared to local norms from the LNCG. Within naturalistic subgroups of ADHD cases, extended use of medication was associated with suppression of adult height but not with reduction of symptom severity.","[{'authorId': '1934612', 'name': 'J.

This study aims to evaluate the theory of mind ability in a sample of obese patients with and without binge eating disorder (BED) and to explore the correlations between emotional and clinical assessments.


METHODS
Overall, 20 non-BED, 16 under-threshold BED and 22 BED obese patients completed a battery of tests assessing social cognition and eating disorder psychopathology.


RESULTS
Binge eating disorder, non-BED and under-threshold-BED obese patients showed similar ability to recognise others' emotions, but BED obese patients exhibited a deficit in recognising their own emotions as demonstrated by more impaired levels of alexithymia and interoceptive awareness and were more depressed. High positive correlations were evident between binging, depression, interoceptive awareness and alexithymia.


CONCLUSIONS
Binge eating disorder patients have a comparable ability to understand others' emotions but a more impaired capacity to understand and code their own emotions compared with non-BED obese patients. This impairment is highly correlated with depression. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.","[{'authorId': '3843474', 'name': 'M.

The authors compared emotional responses, behavior, and neural activity between 19 severely irritable children (operationalized using criteria for severe mood dysregulation) and 23 healthy comparison children during a cued-attention task completed under nonfrustrating and frustrating conditions.


RESULTS
Children in both the severe mood dysregulation and the healthy comparison groups reported increased frustration and exhibited decreased ability to shift spatial attention during the frustration condition relative to the nonfrustration condition. However, these effects of frustration were more marked in the severe mood dysregulation group than in the comparison group. During the frustration condition, participants in the severe mood dysregulation group exhibited deactivation of the left amygdala, the left and right striatum, the parietal cortex, and the posterior cingulate on negative feedback trials, relative to the comparison group (i.e., between-group effect) and to the severe mood dysregulation group's responses on positive feedback trials (i.e., within-group effect). In contrast, neural response to positive feedback during the frustration condition did not differ between groups.


CONCLUSIONS
In response to negative feedback received in the context of frustration, children with severe, chronic irritability showed abnormally reduced activation in regions implicated in emotion, attention, and reward processing. Frustration appears to reduce attention flexibility, particularly in severely irritable children, which may contribute to emotion regulation deficits in this population. Further research is needed to relate these findings to irritability specifically, rather than to other clinical features of severe mood dysregulation.","[{'authorId': '6844929', 'name': 'C.

8bb65ab950e5e89212a2fe8e1eb685f7be43ec66,"ABSTRACT Background: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has demonstrated efficacy in treating disorders such as alcohol dependence that are characterized by emotional dysregulation. Preliminary evidence has revealed the feasibility of DBT skills training (ST) as a stand-alone treatment for such disorders. Although emotional dysregulation plays a significant role in alcohol dependence, there are no previous reports of using DBT-ST to treat it. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the duration of abstinence and changes in emotional regulation in a 3-month DBT-ST program for alcohol-dependent patients and to look for relations between abstinence and emotional regulation. Methods: We administered the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and used urine toxicology screening to monitor alcohol/substance intake among the 244 subjects admitted to the program. Results: Among the 157 patients who completed the treatment, 73.2% were abstinent at the end of the program, and their emotional regulation improved. Improvement was independent of the initial severity of both alcohol use and emotional dysregulation. For substance use outcomes, we found a partial mediation role of improved emotional regulation. Conclusions: This is the first open trial to show improved alcohol-related behavior and emotional regulation in alcohol-dependent patients treated with DBT-ST and to posit a partial but significant relation between improved emotional regulation and alcohol use outcomes. In the treatment of alcohol dependence, emotional regulation may be a relevant factor for therapists to consider.","[{'authorId': '1844651', 'name': 'C. Maffei'}, {'authorId': '40651868', 'name': 'M.

When researchers find an association between two variables, it is useful to evaluate the role of other constructs in this association. While assessing these mediation effects, it is important to determine if results are equal for different groups. It is possible that the strength of a mediation effect may differ for males and females, for example - such an effect is known as moderated mediation.


DESIGN
Participants were 2532 adolescents from diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds and equally distributed across gender. The goal of this study was to investigate parental respect as a potential mediator of the relationship between gender and delinquency and mental health, and to determine whether observed mediation is moderated by gender.


FINDINGS
Parental respect mediated the association between gender and both delinquency and mental health. Specifically, parental respect was a protective factor against delinquency and mental health problems for both females and males.


PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
Demonstrated the process of estimating models in Lavaan, using two approaches (i.e. single group regression and multiple group regression model), and including covariates in both models.","[{'authorId': '7792934', 'name': 'J.

8c7d7c1c3be9c76116ca62409d29a399c0f9299f,"The hypothesis that cognitive reappraisal will have different effects on emotion as a function of regulatory goal and the timing with which reappraisals are enacted within an emotion episode was tested. Forty-one participants reappraised situations depicted in unpleasant pictures by imagining those situations getting worse (increase), staying the same (maintain), or getting better (decrease). Reappraisal instructions were delivered 2 s before (anticipatory) or 4 s after (online) picture onset. Measures of rated unpleasantness, expressive behavior (corrugator muscle activity), heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA) were collected. Increase reappraisals produced higher rated unpleasantness, corrugator muscle activity, HR, and EDA relative to maintain reappraisals. For corrugator muscle activity and EDA, the effect of increase reappraisals was only apparent when enacted online. Decrease reappraisals produced lower rated unpleasantness relative to maintain reappraisals but had no effect on expressive behavior or autonomic physiology. The effect of decrease reappraisals did not depend on when reappraisal was enacted. These data underscore the importance of regulatory goals and the impact of regulatory timing as a moderator of emotion regulatory success within an emotion episode. Imagine you are sitting on a dais about to deliver an oral presentation to an audience. You're feeling jittery, your eyes are wide, your brow is furrowed, your heart is racing, and you're considering the relative probability that tomatoes will be thrown and where the closest exit is. In a nutshell, you're anxious. At some level of intensity and duration, this is a natural response to a situation of social evaluative threat, but if the anxiety runs rampant , your ability to give a good presentation will be compromised. It may, therefore, be advantageous to find a way to quell the anxiety. How might you do that? There are many avenues to meeting this emotion regulatory goal. You might, for example, count to 10 or think about the items you need to buy at the store later. You might remind yourself that the people in the audience are interested in the ideas you're about to share and that the consequences of saying something foolish are much less severe than you're imagining. You might take deep slow breaths to encourage your heart to stop beating so frantically. You might try to adopt a calm, confident facade in the hopes that the old adage to "" fake it 'til you make it "" does you some good.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were cross-sectional from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1988–1994, 1999–2002, 2003–2006, and 2007–2010. Participants were 4,926 adults aged ≥20 years who self-reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes and completed the household interview and physical examination (n = 1,558 for valid LDL levels). Main outcome measures were A1C, BP, and LDL cholesterol, in accordance with the American Diabetes Association recommendations, and current use of statins. RESULTS In 2007–2010, 52.5% of people with diabetes achieved A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol), 51.1% achieved BP <130/80 mmHg, 56.2% achieved LDL <100 mg/dL, and 18.8% achieved all three ABCs. These levels of control were significant improvements from 1988 to 1994 (all P < 0.05). Statin use significantly increased between 1988–1994 (4.2%) and 2007–2010 (51.4%, P < 0.01). Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Americans were less likely to meet A1C and LDL goals (P < 0.03), and non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to meet BP and LDL goals (P < 0.02). Compared with non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans were less likely to meet A1C goals (P < 0.01). Younger individuals were less likely to meet A1C and LDL goals. CONCLUSIONS Despite significant improvement during the past decade, achieving the ABC goals remains suboptimal among adults with diabetes, particularly in some minority groups. Substantial opportunity exists to further improve diabetes control and, thus, to reduce diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.","[{'authorId': '116264093', 'name': 'Sarah Stark Casagrande'}, {'authorId': '5933667', 'name': 'J.

Baby FACS criteria were used to code the duration and intensity of infant smiles and the presence or absence of cry faces and fussy vocalizations within each episode. Infants in both groups showed the still-face effect: a significant reduction in smiling from episode 1 (baseline) to episode 2 (maternal still-face) and partial return to baseline in episode 3 (recovery). A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) for big smiles yielded significant main effects for group and episode and a significant group x episode interaction. Preterm infants spent less time than full-term infants displaying big smiles in episode 1 and a less pronounced decrease in big smiles in episode 2. Maternal depressive symptoms did not differ significantly between groups. Counter to our expectations, depressive symptoms were positively associated with small-to-medium smiles in the baseline episode but not with big smiles in any episode. These findings confirm the robustness of the still-face paradigm and its potential usefulness for research on individual as well as group differences in affective communication in infants.","[{'authorId': '2255612615', 'name': 'Laura B.

Some researchers propose that people apply the same social norms to computers as they do to humans, suggesting that social psychological knowledge can be applied to our interactions with computers. In contrast, theories of human–automation interaction postulate that humans respond to machines in unique and specific ways. We believe that anthropomorphism—the degree to which an agent exhibits human characteristics—is the critical variable that may resolve this apparent contradiction across the formation, violation, and repair stages of trust. Three experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints by varying the appearance and behavior of automated agents. Participants received advice that deteriorated gradually in reliability from a computer, avatar, or human agent. Our results showed (a) that anthropomorphic agents were associated with greater trust resilience, a higher resistance to breakdowns in trust; (b) that these effects were magnified by greater uncertainty; and c) that incorporating human-like trust repair behavior largely erased differences between the agents. Automation anthropomorphism is therefore a critical variable that should be carefully incorporated into any general theory of human–agent trust as well as novel automation design.","[{'authorId': '113889522', 'name': 'E.

Kevin Thompson-is ""to attempt to integrate theory, assessment, and treatment for the field of body image; to provide a guide for researchers and clinicians interested in the field of body image disturbance and to bridge research and practice."" After reading this text, the clinician would hope to come away with a clear sense of the etiology of body-image disturbances and then to be able to identify the best clinical treatment that would match patient diagnostic presentation. Although the research material is well handled, the treatment aspect is somewhat incomplete. The authors present a good overall view of the origin of body image and body-image disturbance, and an excellent historical review of research in the field of eating disorders, i.e., anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, as well as bingeeating disorder and obesity. The book also addresses the complexity of defining, measuring, and creating theoretical models while exploring the social and cultural aspects of body image and the public media emphasis on thinness. And it outlines the current thinking about making a differential diagnosis of body-dysmorphic disorder, often a difficult matter. Some important work in body-dysmorphic disorder is missing, however, such as that of Eric Hollander, M.D. The book's forte is presenting the reader with a strong array of models for measurements and assessment and different testing methodologies, as well as including helpful tables, appendices, and references. The 11 chapters are divided into five parts: 1. An Overview: Prevalence, Diversity, Assessment, and Treatment; 2. Societal and Social Approaches; 3. Interpersonal Approaches; 4. Feminist Approaches; and 5. Behavioral, Cognitive, and Integrative Approaches. The term ""approaches"" is somewhat misleading because it infers presentation of several different treatment methodologies that the book only partially delivers. The authors conclude that the cognitive-behavioral modality of treatment, supported by ""empirical findings,"" has been the most successful in the treatment of body image thus far, and they are not nearly as exhaustive in covering other treatment modalities, such as the feminist perspective. …","[{'authorId': '39817091', 'name': 'F.

For a long time, it has represented a sort of “oral encyclopedia” which, through narrative, has passed down from generation to generation traditions, customs and knowledge (Halverson, 1992). The role that storytelling played, even before the discovery of writing, in the diffusion of knowledge, in the construction of interpersonal relationships and in the birth of new societies, is well known. Without doubt writing is the earliest “technology” invented by man, through which culture and knowledge have been passed down over time, after having been transmitted orally for a long time. According to Barthes and Duisit (1975), in fact, storytelling begins with the same story of the human race, almost as if to represent an ontogenetically distinctive trait of the species, which unites homo sapiens with the homo digitalis of today’s society (Montag & Diefenbach, 2018). Other authors (Kenyon et al., 1996) argue that men and women not only have stories to tell, but that they are the stories they tell. Storytelling, therefore, always reinterprets in a new way and with different tools a natural propensity of human beings to tell about themselves, to build memories capable of projecting the past into the future.","[{'authorId': '100833814', 'name': 'Davide Capperucci'}]",2.0,,28.0,STORYTELLING FOR INCLUSION,2020.0

There are several software options, including the use of native smartphone applications and text messages (short message service, SMS). Little is known about the strengths and limitations of these two approaches in monitoring symptoms in individuals with serious mental illness. Objective The objective of this study was to compare two different delivery modalities of the same diagnostic assessment for individuals with non-affective psychosis—a native smartphone application employing a graphical, touch user interface against an SMS text-only implementation. The overall hypothesis of the study was that patient participants with sewrious mental illness would find both delivery modalities feasible and acceptable to use, measured by the quantitative post-assessment feedback questionnaire scores, the number of data points completed, and the time taken to complete the assessment. It was also predicted that a native smartphone application would (1) yield a greater number of data points, (2) take less time, and (3) be more positively appraised by patient participant users than the text-based system. Methods A randomized repeated measures crossover design was employed. Participants with currently treated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fourth Edition) schizophrenia or related disorders (n=24) were randomly allocated to completing 6 days of assessment (four sets of questions per day) with a native smartphone application or the SMS text-only implementation. There was then a 1-week break before completing a further 6 days with the alternative delivery modality. Quantitative feedback questionnaires were administered at the end of each period of sampling. Results A greater proportion of data points were completed with the native smartphone application in comparison to the SMS text-only implementation (β = -.25, SE=.11, P=.02), which also took significantly less time to complete (β =.78, SE= .09, P<.001). Although there were no significant differences in participants’ quantitative feedback for the two delivery modalities, most participants reported preferring the native smartphone application (67%; n=16) and found it easier to use (71%; n=16). 33% of participants reported that they would be willing to complete mobile phone assessment for 5 weeks or longer. Conclusions Native smartphone applications and SMS text are both valuable methods of delivering real-time assessment in individuals with schizophrenia. However, a more streamlined graphical user interface may lead to better compliance and shorter entry times. Further research is needed to test the efficacy of this technology within clinical services, to assess validity over longer periods of time and when delivered on patients’ own phones.","[{'authorId': '145138477', 'name': 'J.

8e5d7405ece81f0ac9fcb4574e53bf0c827e9ad7,"Contemporary emotion regulation research emphasizes intrapersonal processes such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, but people experiencing affect commonly choose not to go it alone. Instead, individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a framework. We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person's emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes--response-dependent and response-independent--that could support interpersonal regulation. This framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse, heretofore independent data on ""pieces"" of interpersonal regulation, and identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.","[{'authorId': '2268731', 'name': 'Jamil Zaki'}, {'authorId': '2055993791', 'name': 'W.

However, a causal relationship between rVLPFC function and explicit emotional regulation is not clear in the context of social exclusion. This study employed anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to activate rVLPFC while participants used emotional regulation to reappraise pictures of social exclusion. Forty-four participants were randomly assigned to an active tDCS group or a sham group. Both groups viewed social exclusion images under two conditions: in the no-reappraisal condition, participants were instructed to passively view social exclusion images; in the reappraisal condition, they reappraised the images to down-regulate negative emotional responses. Compared to sham stimulation, anodal tDCS over the rVLPFC resulted in less negative emotion ratings, and produced significantly smaller pupil diameter in the reappraisal, compared to no-reappraisal block. The tDCS also led to longer fixation durations to rejectees and shorter fixation durations to rejecters. Taken together, these findings suggest a causal role for rVLPFC in down-regulation of negative emotions produced by social exclusion. This study has implications for clinical interventions targeting emotional regulation deficits.","[{'authorId': '29344809', 'name': 'Zhenhong He'}, {'authorId': '47903824', 'name': 'Yiqin Lin'}, {'authorId': '8848142', 'name': 'Lisheng Xia'}, {'authorId': '46271416', 'name': 'Zhenli Liu'}, {'authorId': '143682725', 'name': 'Dandan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '49691586', 'name': 'R.

8eb9f4b6137f549ac01888febf481f977fc840fc,"In recent years there has been a growth of support, guidance and orientation programs – collectively known as induction – for beginning elementary and secondary teachers during the transition into their first teaching jobs. This study examines whether such programs have a positive effect on the retention of beginning teachers. We focus on a number of different types and components of induction, including mentoring programs, group induction activities and the provision of extra resources and reduced workloads. The data used in the analysis are from the nationally representative 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. The results indicate that beginning teachers who were provided with mentors from the same subject field and who participated in collective induction activities, such as planning and collaboration with other teachers, were less likely to move to other schools and less likely to leave the teaching occupation after their first year of teaching. While, some of the components of induction we examined did not, individually, have a statistically significant impact on teacher turnover, most did collectively. That is, teachers participating in a combination or packages of mentoring and group induction activities were far less likely to depart their jobs at the end of their first year. What Are the Effects of Induction In recent years there has been a growth of support, guidance and orientation programs – collectively known as induction – for beginning elementary and secondary teachers during the transition into their first teaching jobs. Historically, the teaching occupation has not had the kind of structured induction and initiation processes common to many white-collar occupations and characteristic of many of the traditional professions (Waller, 1932; Lortie, 1975; Tyack, 1974). Although elementary and secondary teaching involves intensive interaction with youngsters, ironically the work of teachers is largely done in isolation from colleagues (e.g., Sizer, 1992; Johnson, 1990; Ingersoll, 2003a). This is especially consequential for new entrants, who upon accepting a teaching position in a school, are often left on their own to succeed or fail within the confines of their own classrooms – an experience likened by some to being “lost at sea.” (e.g., Kauffman, Johnson, Kardos, Liu, & Peske, 2002; Johnson & Birkeland, 2003). Indeed, critics have long assailed teaching as an occupation that “cannibalizes its young” and in which the initiation of new teachers is akin to a “sink or swim,” “trial by fire,” or “boot camp” experience. Perhaps not surprisingly, teaching has also traditionally been characterized as an occupation with high levels of attrition, especially among beginners (Lortie, 1975; Grissmer & Kirby, 1987, 1992, 1997; Veenman, 1985). All occupations, of course, experience some loss of new entrants – either voluntarily because newcomers decide not to remain or involuntarily because employers deem them to be unsuitable. But, researchers have held that teaching has long had high rates of attrition among newcomers. A number of studies have found as many as 50 percent of new teachers leave within the first five years of entry into the occupation (e.g., Murnane et al., 1991; Ingersoll & Smith, 2003; Huling-Austin, 1990; Hafner & Owings, 1991). Moreover, several studies have found a significant correlation between a teacher’s likelihood of What Are the Effects of Induction 2 retention and their scores on exams, such as the SAT. The “best and the brightest” amongst the newcomers appear to be those most likely to leave (Murnane et al., 1991; Schlecty & Vance, 1981; Henke et al., 2000). In recent research we have also documented what many educators have long suspected – a strong link between the perennially high rates of beginning teacher attrition and the perennial teacher shortages that plague teaching. It is widely believed that one of the pivotal causes of inadequate school performance is the inability of schools to adequately staff classrooms with qualified teachers as a result of teacher shortages. However, in analyses of national data we found that school staffing problems are not solely, or even primarily, due to teacher shortages, in the sense of too few new teachers being produced. In contrast, the data indicate that school staffing problems are to a large extent a result of a ”revolving door” – where large numbers of existing teachers depart their teaching jobs long before retirement (Ingersoll, 2001, 2003b). These are the kinds of occupational ills that effective organizational induction programs are supposed to cure and, accordingly, in recent decades a growing number of states and school districts have developed and implemented a variety of such programs (for reviews of theory, policy, and research on teacher induction see, e.g., Arends & Rigazio-DiGilio, 2000; Holloway, 2001; Feiman-Nemser et al., 1999; Gold, 1999; Hegsted ,1999; Fideler & Haselkorn, 1999; Scherer, 1999; Serpell & Bozeman, 1999). Teacher induction, it is important to clarify, is distinct from both pre-service and inservice teacher training programs. Pre-service refers to the training and preparation candidates receive prior to employment (including clinical training, such as student teaching). In-service refers to periodic upgrading and additional training received on-the-job, during employment. Theoretically, induction programs are not additional training per se, but are designed for those What Are the Effects of Induction 3 who have already completed basic training. These programs are often conceived as a “bridge” from student of teaching to teacher of students. Of course, these analytic distinctions can easily become blurred in real situations. Like the induction processes common to other occupations, there are a number of different, and sometimes conflicting, purposes behind teacher induction programs. Moreover, teacher induction can refer to a variety of different activities – workshops, collaboration, support systems, orientation seminars, and especially, mentoring. The latter refers to the personal guidance provided, usually by seasoned veterans, to beginning teachers in schools. Over the past two decades teacher mentoring programs have become the dominant form of teacher induction (Fideler & Haselkorn 1999); indeed, the two terms are currently often used interchangeably. What kinds of induction programs exist, and to what extent they help, are clearly fundamental questions for the field and for policymakers faced with decisions about supporting such programs. Accordingly, with the growth of beginning teacher induction there has also been a growing interest in empirical research on both the variety and effects of these initiatives. Over the past two decades, numerous descriptive studies have documented that the content and characteristics of different types of programs themselves widely vary (e.g., Fideler & Haselkorn, 1999; Scherer, 1999; Ganser, 1997; 2002; Schaffer et al., 1992; Wollman-Bonilla 1997). This research has shown that duration and intensity are important sources of variation: induction programs can vary from a single orientation meeting at the beginning of a school year to a highly structured program involving multiple activities and frequent meetings over a couple of years. Programs vary according to the numbers of new teachers they serve; some include anyone new to a particular school, even those with previous teaching experience; while others focus solely upon inexperienced candidates new to teaching. Programs vary according to their purpose. What Are the Effects of Induction 4 Some for instance are primarily developmental and designed to foster growth on the part of newcomers; others are also designed to assess, and perhaps weed out, those deemed ill suited to the job. Finally, mentoring programs themselves differ along these same dimensions. For example, they vary as to whether they include training for the mentors and how much attention they devote to the match between mentor and mentee and the degree to which the mentor is compensated for their efforts, either with a salary supplement or a reduction in other duties. Further, while some programs strive to see that new secondary math teachers, for instance, are provided with mentors who have had actual experience teaching secondary-level math; others do not. In addition to descriptive studies of the content of induction programs, there have been numerous evaluative studies examining the effects of induction, particularly mentoring, on various teacher outcomes. These outcome measures typically fall into two categories: teacher attitudes (e.g., teacher’s job satisfaction, efficacy, and commitment); and teacher retention or turnover. A number of studies do seem to provide support for the hypothesis that well-conceived and well-implemented teacher mentoring and induction programs are successful in increasing the job satisfaction, efficacy and retention of new teachers (e.g., Holloway 2001; Fuller 2003; Wilson, Darling-Hammond & Berry, 2001; Strong & St John, 2001). In turn, educational advocates and reformers frequently cite examples drawn from this research to secure additional funding, to garner political support, or to confirm a particular educational perspective. There are, however, important limitations to the existing empirical research on the effects of teacher induction and mentoring programs. First, the majority of these empirical studies are program evaluations that collected data on outcomes solely from those who had participated in the particular programs being assessed (e.g., Wilson, Darling-Hammond & Berry, 2001; Mitchell What Are the Effects of Induction 5 & Scott, 1999; Gregson & Piper, 1993; Strong & St John, 2001; Fletcher, Strong & Villar, 2004; Strong, 1998; Stroot et al. 1999; Scott 1999).

The factorial validity of the UWES-9 was demonstrated using confirmatory factor analyses, and the three scale scores have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Furthermore, a two-factor model with a reduced Burnout factor (including exhaustion and cynicism) and an expanded Engagement factor (including vigor, dedication, absorption, and professional efficacy) fit best to the data. These results confirm that work engagement may be conceived as the positive antipode of burnout. It is concluded that the UWES-9 scores has acceptable psychometric properties and that the instrument can be used in studies on positive organizational behavior.","[{'authorId': '2215744', 'name': 'W.

As for political discourse, it is perhaps the communicator, the linguistic personality, who plays the most important role in the communication. The linguistic personality of a politician is of particular interest in political discourse content-analysis, since it has the greatest influence on the public consciousness via mass media. Using text as a source of psychological and cognitive information has been gaining popularity. Researchers use a variety of methods to analyze texts, but Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) has proved to be the most common technique. The analysis of linguistic patterns of political discourse shows that in the context of political speech events such as media interviews, politicians make a unique choice of lexical units, which can be interpreted as a manifestation of certain personality traits. However, despite the significance of the results, there are clear limitations to the use of computerized methodologies to make political discourse content-analysis, such as the limited interpretive capacity of software to understand pragmatic and contextual use of lexical units.","[{'authorId': '1396516010', 'name': 'A.

CR is distinct from attentional deployment (AD), an ER process that is theorized to operate via changes in attention. However, a recent neuroimaging study has suggested that the ER effects of CR might largely be explained by AD. In this study, I manipulated CR while holding visual AD constant across CR conditions. In a randomized within-subjects design, 54 participants used CR to increase and decrease emotion in response to unpleasant pictures. This was compared with simply viewing the pictures. On all trials, gaze was directed to a circumscribed area of the pictures. Even with gaze held constant across conditions, increase reappraisals led to higher ratings of emotional intensity, greater corrugator activity, and greater autonomic arousal. In addition, decrease reappraisals led to lower ratings of emotional intensity and lower corrugator activity, the latter of which held only when gaze was directed to arousing information. Overall, the results suggest that changes in appraisal are the likely mechanism for the ER effects of CR.","[{'authorId': '2074197', 'name': 'H. L.

In the last decades, there has been a growing interest in the prevalence and characteristics of dual diagnosis, since it has been argued that DD patients show more clinical treatment difficulties and higher morbidity. Few works have studied the neuropsychological aspects of patients with DD, although neuropsychological deficits have been widely described both in patients showing a severe mental health condition and in those with a drug abuse and/or dependence disorder. Knowledge of the type and severity of potential neuropsychological deficits in patients with DD is of great relevance since it could be an interviewing factor for clinical treatment and prognosis. The present work aims to review the main data on attention, memory, and executive functions in dual diagnosis patients, from an explanatory point of view. We focus on the diagnoses of Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder since these have shown the highest prevalence and severity in DD and have provided a wealth of data. We describe the differences in neuropsychological performance found in these patients and the implications for clinical treatment and psychosocial functioning.

Several studies have shown associations between student misbehaviour and teacher burnout. However, researchers have rarely incorporated a direct measure of teachers' perceptions of student behaviour in their own classroom. The main aims of the present study of 100 British primary school teachers were: (a) to explore the properties of a measure of student behaviour in the classroom (the Pupil Behaviour Patterns scale PBP; Friedman, 1995) and (b) to test the prediction of burnout dimensions from dimensions of student behaviour assessed by the PBP. An exploratory factor analysis confirmed the PBP domains of disrespectful behaviour, sociability and attentiveness. Furthermore, reliability analyses supported the internal consistency of the scales. Regression analysis of teacher burnout showed differential prediction by PBP sub-domains: disrespect predicted emotional exhaustion and depersonalization burnout, and lack of sociability predicted depersonalization and personal accomplishment burnout. Methodological problems are discussed along with suggestions for future theoretical and empirical development. In particular, we focus on the potential role of psychological variables such as teacher self-efficacy and coping strategies in explaining how teacher well-being is affected by student behaviour in the classroom.","[{'authorId': '1891230', 'name': 'R.

Method: Eleven 5–7 year-old children participated in a CBT-group while parents participated in psychoeducation. Children were randomly assigned to an experimental or delayed-treatment control group. Results: From pre- to post-treatment, all children had less parent reported negativity/lability, better parent reported emotion regulation, and shorter outbursts, and also generated more coping strategies in response to vignettes. Parents also reported increases in their own confidence and their child's ability to deal with anger and anxiety. Conclusions: This study suggests that young children with high functioning ASD may benefit from CBT to improve regulation of anger and anxiety, and parent training may improve parental self-efficacy. Future studies are needed to make conclusions about its efficacy.","[{'authorId': '2404523', 'name': 'A. Scarpa'}, {'authorId': '8961282', 'name': 'N.

Conversations of twelve 6th-grade triads were analyzed utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. Neither prior achievement of group members nor the generation of correct ideas for solution could account for between-triad differences in problem-solving outcomes. Instead, both characteristics of proposals and partner responsiveness were important correlates of the uptake and documentation of correct ideas by the group. Less successful groups ignored or rejected correct proposals, whereas more successful groups discussed or accepted them. Conversations in less successful groups were relatively incoherent as measured by the extent that proposals for solutions in these groups were connected with preceding discussions. Performance differences observed in triads extended to subsequent problem-solving sessions during which all students solved the same kinds of problems independently. These findings suggest that the quality of interaction had implications for learning. Case study descriptions illustrate the interweaving of social and cognitive factors involved in establishing a joint problem-solving space. A dual-space model of what collaboration requires of participants is described to clarify how the content of the problem and the relational context are interdependent aspects of the collaborative situation. How participants manage these interacting spaces is critical to the outcome of their work and helps account for variability in collaborative outcomes. Directions for future research that may help teachers, students, and designers of educational environments learn to see and foster productive interactional practices are proposed.","[{'authorId': '145930086', 'name': 'Brigid Barron'}]",1298.0,,97.0,When Smart Groups Fail,2003.0

This study used a dyadic multilevel modeling approach to explore the coregulation of spouses' mood states and cortisol levels in 30 married couples who sampled saliva and reported on mood states 4 times per day for 3 days. For both husbands and wives, own cortisol level was positively associated with partner's cortisol level, even after sampling time was controlled. For wives, marital satisfaction weakened the strength of this effect. Partner's negative mood was positively associated with own negative mood for both husbands and wives. Marital satisfaction fully moderated this effect, reducing the strength of the association between one's own and one's partner's negative mood states. Spouses' positive moods were not correlated. As expected, within-couple coregulation coefficients were stronger when mood and cortisol were sampled in the early morning and evening, when spouses were together at home, than during the workday. The results suggest that spouses' fluctuations in negative mood and cortisol levels are linked over several days and that marital satisfaction may buffer spouses from their partners' negative mood or stress state.","[{'authorId': '6283440', 'name': 'D.

Although it was developed mainly for research purposes, the FFSF paradigm has potential clinical implications for the assessment of socio-emotional regulation of infants with neurodevelopmental disabilities (ND) and to supporting parenting. Aim: The present paper describes the application of the FFSF paradigm as an evaluation and intervention tool in clinical practice with infants with ND and their parents. Methods: Theoretical and methodological insights for the use of the FFSF paradigm in the clinical setting are provided. Single-case vignettes from clinical practice further illustrate and provide exemplifications for the use of the FFSF with infants with ND and their parents. Results: From a clinical point of view, the use of the FFSF paradigm (1) offers a unique observational perspective on socio-emotional regulation in infants with ND and (2) enhances parents’ sensitivity to their infants’ behavior. Discussion: The FFSF paradigm appears to be a useful tool for clinical assessment of socio-emotional regulation in infants with ND and promote the quality of parenting and early parent-infant interaction.","[{'authorId': '39103349', 'name': 'Lorenzo Giusti'}, {'authorId': '4040954', 'name': 'L.

90fc0abf135f7b423506df82cc3780163f38123f,"ABSTRACT The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a significant effect on our mental health. In this research, we aim to analyse gender-related differences in the psychological impact of the Covid-19 lockdown in Spain. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey (n = 1041) with two measurements: at two and five weeks after the declaration of the state of emergency and stay-at-home order in Spain. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being were evaluated. Linear mixed models with random slopes were calculated for each variable in the study in order to analyse the effect of longitudinal measures and interaction with gender.

91095b8ba4fa6ce8bbdbf02fedfe0b575d85040c,"ABSTRA C T : It is usually observed that nursing students undergo tremendous stress during various stages of their course but the knowledge about the stress process and depressive symptoms in this population is limited. The Aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of psychological distress, anxiety and depression among nursing students in Greece. For that purpose 170 nursing students (34 males, 136 females) of the Department of Nursing of the Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki completed 3 self-report questionnaires, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The mean age was 21.5 years. No difference in stress and depression on the basis of gender was observed. Our results showed that the scores on the GHQ, BDI and STAI tend to increase in the year 2 and 3. The majority of students reported relatively high scores on the GHQ suggesting increased psychiatric morbidity. 52.4% of students experienced depressive symptoms (34.7% mild, 12.9% moderate and 4.7% severe). The scores on the state scale were higher in the years 2 and 3, while the majority of students who had no or mild stress was observed in the first and the last year. Low stress personality traits were also observed in the first and the last year. However, no significant differences between the four years were observed. Our results suggest that nursing students experience different levels of stress and depression and that these factors are positively correlated.","[{'authorId': '1399039100', 'name': 'D.

JD-R theory combines the two research traditions, and explains how job demands and (job and personal) resources have unique and multiplicative effects on job stress and motivation. In addition, JD-R theory proposes reversed causal effects: whereas burned-out employees may create more job demands over time for themselves, engaged workers mobilize their own job resources to stay engaged.

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of empowering work conditions and workplace incivility on nurses' experiences of burnout and important nurse retention factors identified in the literature.


BACKGROUND
A major cause of turnover among nurses is related to unsatisfying workplaces. Recently, there have been numerous anecdotal reports of uncivil behaviour in health care settings.


METHOD
We examined the impact of workplace empowerment, supervisor and coworker incivility, and burnout on three employee retention outcomes: job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions in a sample of 612 Canadian staff nurses.


RESULTS
Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses revealed that empowerment, workplace incivility, and burnout explained significant variance in all three retention factors: job satisfaction (R(2) = 0.46), organizational commitment (R(2) = 0.29) and turnover intentions (R(2) = 0.28). Empowerment, supervisor incivility, and cynicism most strongly predicted job dissatisfaction and low commitment (P < 0.001), whereas emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and supervisor incivility most strongly predicted turnover intentions.


CONCLUSIONS
In our study, nurses' perceptions of empowerment, supervisor incivility, and cynicism were strongly related to job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT
Managerial strategies that empower nurses for professional practice may be helpful in preventing workplace incivility, and ultimately, burnout.","[{'authorId': '7331207', 'name': 'H. S.

This study investigated interoceptive awareness in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a chronic pain condition accompanied by various affective symptoms. Interoceptive awareness was assessed in 45 FMS patients and 31 healthy individuals using a heartbeat perception task. Cognitive performance, comorbid psychiatric disorders and medication use were assessed as possible confounding variables. Concerning the primary outcome, patients exhibited markedly reduced heartbeat perception compared to healthy individuals. Moreover, there was an inverse relationship between interoceptive awareness and FMS symptom severity. Reduced interoceptive awareness may be involved in the affective aspects of FMS pathology. Poor access to bodily signals may restrict patients´ ability to integrate these signals during emotional processing, which, by extension, may preclude optimal emotional self-regulation.","[{'authorId': '5108557', 'name': 'S.

Two components of emotion regulation were distinguished: regulation and negativity. Results revealed that mothers’ proactive sensitivity and their supportive reactions were related to their children’s regulation, whereas unsupportive reactions were related to children`s negativity. Child gender moderated the associations between mothers’ socialization beliefs and children’s emotion regulation: mothers’ proactive sensitivity was more strongly associated with competent regulation in girls than in boys.

Little is known about the specific pathways through which maternal posttraumatic symptoms and deficits in emotion regulation contribute to emotional dysregulation. Inspired by the intergenerational process of relational posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in which posttraumatic distress is transmitted from mothers to children, we suggest an analogous concept of relational emotion regulation, by which maternal emotion regulation problems may contribute to child emotion regulation deficits. Child emotion regulation problems were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist-Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP; T.M. Achenbach & I. Rescorla, 2000), which is comprised of three subscales of the CBCL: Attention, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression. Maternal PTSD symptoms were assessed by the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (E.B. Foa, L. Cashman, L. Jaycox, & K. Perry, 1997) and maternal emotion regulation by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (K.L. Gratz & L. Roemer, 2004). Results showed that the child's emotion regulation problems were associated with both maternal posttraumatic symptoms and maternal emotion dysregulation. Further, maternal emotion regulation mediated the association between maternal posttraumatic symptoms and the child's regulation deficits. These findings highlight the central role of mothers' emotion regulation skills in the aftermath of trauma as it relates to children's emotion regulation skills. The degree of mothers' regulatory skills in the context of posttraumatic stress symptoms reflects a key process through which the intergenerational transmission of trauma may occur. Study results have critical implications for planning and developing clinical interventions geared toward the treatment of families in the aftermath of trauma and, in particular, the enhancement of mothers' emotion regulation skills after trauma.","[{'authorId': '1398855064', 'name': 'R.

In children, irritability, or dysregulated negative affect, has been the primary focus, as it predicts later negative outcomes even in very young children. However, dysregulation of positive emotion is increasingly recognized as a contributor to psychopathology. Here we used an exploratory factor analysis and defined four factors of emotion dysregulation: irritability, excitability, sadness, and anhedonia, in the preschool-age psychiatric assessment collected in a sample of 302 children ages 3–5 years enriched for early onset depression. The irritability and excitability factor scores defined in preschoolers predicted later diagnosis of mood and externalizing disorders when controlling for other factor scores, social adversity, maternal history of mood disorders, and externalizing diagnoses at baseline. The preschool excitability factor score predicted emotion lability in late childhood and early adolescence when controlling for other factor scores, social adversity, and maternal history. Both excitability and irritability factor scores in preschoolers predicted global functioning into the teen years and early adolescence, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of positive, as well as negative, affect dysregulation as early as the preschool years in predicting later psychopathology, which deserves both further study and clinical consideration.","[{'authorId': '113273839', 'name': 'Alecia C.

Binge eating disorder (BED) may manifest itself differently in children than adults. Recently researchers have proposed provisional criteria for measuring BED in children. The purpose of this study was to develop a brief, simple, structured, interviewer-administered scale (C-BEDS) to measure BED in children according to the provisional criteria and to compare diagnostic results with SCID diagnoses.


METHOD
A total of 55 children between the ages of 5 and 13 were interviewed with both the SCID and the C-BEDS.


RESULTS
There was a significant association between the two measures (p = .001). Both measures adequately identified children with binge eating behaviors.


CONCLUSION
Both the provisional criteria and the C-BEDS may be developmentally appropriate for use with children, although the C-BEDS may be a better screening instrument as it quickly identified children with subsyndromal BED. If used by physicians and other health providers, this brief measure may assist with identifying early onset binge eating behaviors and avoiding the associated consequences, including adult BED, obesity, and other comorbidities.","[{'authorId': '4583626', 'name': 'J.

How should we organize the myriad ways people attempt to regulate their emotions? We explore the utility of a framework that distinguishes among four fundamental classes of emotion regulation strategies. The framework describes each strategy class in terms their behavioral characteristics, underlying psychological processes and supporting neural systems. A key feature of this multi-level framework is its conceptualization of the psychological processes in terms of two orthogonal dimensions that describe (i) the nature of the emotion regulation goal (ranging from to implicit to explicit) and (ii) the nature of the emotion change process (ranging from more automatic to more controlled). After describing the core elements of the framework, we use it to review human and animal research on the neural bases of emotion regulation and to suggest key directions for future research on emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '2066223876', 'name': 'Laura Martin Braunstein'}, {'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches on the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems that already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures yields a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT’15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker. 1","[{'authorId': '1821711', 'name': 'Thang Luong'}, {'authorId': '143950636', 'name': 'Hieu Pham'}, {'authorId': '144783904', 'name': 'Christopher D.

This study examined whether parents' physiological and emotion regulation abilities corresponded to children's physiological and emotional responding to a structured laboratory-based disappointment task. Ninety-seven 3- to 7-year-olds (56 girls; M = 5.79 years) and one parent participated in a multi-method assessment of parents' and children's regulatory functioning. Direct (coaching children to use reappraisal) and indirect (resting physiology, dispositional use of reappraisal) aspects of parents' regulatory abilities were assessed. As expected, an adaptive pattern of parent regulatory abilities composed of higher resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia, use of reappraisal, and coaching reappraisal was associated with children's physiological reactivity after a disappointment indicative of more effective physiological calming in a recovery context (increased parasympathetic activation). In contrast, parents' regulatory abilities did not relate to changes in children's expressions of emotional distress.","[{'authorId': '31733461', 'name': 'Emily W.

For a parent of a child with a disability, the child's characteristics and possible limitations can make positive parenting behaviors challenging, and yet, these interactions need to be a focus of early intervention to promote optimal family and child development. Family-centered practice, which includes strengthening parenting skills, has been advocated by the early intervention field. Although early intervention programs realize the importance of supporting parent-child interaction as part of family-centered practice, it has not been an emphasis of most early intervention programs. The lack of easy-to-use, psychometrically strong parenting measures is an issue in early intervention. The Parenting Interactions with Children: Checklist of Observations Linked to Outcomes (PICCOLO) provides a practical observation measure of parenting with young children. We tested the reliability and validity of this measure with parents of children with an identified disability. Early parenting behaviors predicted cognitive and language outcomes for children with an identified disability up to 9 years after the first assessment. The PICCOLO demonstrated strong reliability and both construct and predictive validity, and shows promise as a useful measure for practitioners working with parents who have a child with a disability.

In an Italian undergraduate sample (N = 416), the two-scale ERQ structure was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis, and each of the two scales (Reappraisal and Suppression) showed good internal consistency. The Italian ERQ also showed the predicted associations with measures of coping, affect, personality, and social functioning. Specifically, Reappraisal was positively correlated with positive reinterpretation, positive affect, and extraversion, and negatively correlated with negative affect and neuroticism. Suppression, by contrast, was negatively correlated with the venting of emotions, positive affect, extraversion, social support and social diversion. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Italian ERQ is a reliable and valid measure that inherits the nomological network of associations from the original version of the ERQ.","[{'authorId': '2217183', 'name': 'S.

This brain region may also influence the experience of social pain, which has been shown to activate similar neural networks as seen in response to physical pain. Here, we applied sham or active low-frequency (1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left DLPFC, previously shown to exert bilateral effects in pain perception, in healthy participants. Following stimulation, participants played the “Cyberball Task”; an online ball-tossing game in which the subject participant is included or excluded. Compared to sham, rTMS did not modulate behavioural response to social exclusion. However, within the active rTMS group only, greater trait personal distress was related to enhanced negative outcomes to social exclusion. These results add further support to the notion that the effect of brain stimulation is not homogenous across individuals, and indicates the need to consider baseline individual differences when assessing response to brain stimulation. This seems particularly relevant in social neuroscience investigations, where trait factors may have a meaningful effect.","[{'authorId': '1805764', 'name': 'B.

For example, persons who face a threatening experience prefer to affiliate with threatened others rather than with nonthreatened others (Schachter, 1959), and persons in groups in which reward is equally distributed are less satisfied compared with persons in groups that include one particularly unfortunate member (Brickman, 1975). The purpose of this article is to show that these phenomena are best construed as social comparison processes and that various phenomena derive from one basic process termed downward comparison; the essence of this process is that persons can enhance their own subjective well-being by comparing themselves with a less fortunate other. In this article I show that downward comparison is a process evoked by negative affect, that there is considerable evidence for self-enhancing comparison processes, and that downward comparison effects are involved in several areas of social-psycho logical research.","[{'authorId': '4181146', 'name': 'T.

To this end, a wide range of punishing behaviours may first be employed but if these are not successful, the individual may be permanently excluded. Therefore a person may be the subject of ostracism even if not excluded from the group: Where the punishing behaviours of the group persuade an individual to change their behaviour, the process will have served its function and will cease. The possibility that some bullying at school may be the result of this process emerged during the qualitative analysis of retrospective accounts from adults who are deaf. This resulted in a review of the relevant literature and a set of codes which were employed to reanalyse the data.

This study presents data on the use of complementary and alternative therapies to treat anxiety and depression in the United States.


METHOD
The data came from a nationally representative survey of 2,055 respondents (1997-1998) that obtained information on the use of 24 complementary and alternative therapies for the treatment of specific chronic conditions.


RESULTS
A total of 9.4% of the respondents reported suffering from ""anxiety attacks"" in the past 12 months; 7.2% reported ""severe depression."" A total of 56.7% of those with anxiety attacks and 53.6% of those with severe depression reported using complementary and alternative therapies to treat these conditions during the past 12 months. Only 20.0% of those with anxiety attacks and 19.3% of those with severe depression visited a complementary or alternative therapist. A total of 65.9% of the respondents seen by a conventional provider for anxiety attacks and 66.7% of those seen by a conventional provider for severe depression also used complementary and alternative therapies to treat these conditions. The perceived helpfulness of these therapies in treating anxiety and depression was similar to that of conventional therapies.


CONCLUSIONS
Complementary and alternative therapies are used more than conventional therapies by people with self-defined anxiety attacks and severe depression. Most patients visiting conventional mental health providers for these problems also use complementary and alternative therapies. Use of these therapies will likely increase as insurance coverage expands. Asking patients about their use could prevent adverse effects and maximize the usefulness of therapies subsequently proven to be effective.","[{'authorId': '2072749492', 'name': 'Ronald C.

In this study, we use a quasi-experimental pre-test & post-test design with intentional selection of the sample, and analyse training needs on the area of social skills related to Emotional Intelligence (EI) of 142 students from seven secondary schools, who attend Initial Vocational Training Programmes (PCPI). The evaluation process use four questionnaires: The Form 5 about self-concept / AF5 by Musitu Garcia (2001), the Assessment Questionnaire about Interpersonal Difficulties in Adolescence / CEDIA by Saura, Mendez and Hidalgo (2000), Social Skills Scale / EHS by Gismero (2000) and the Assertive Conduct Self-report / ADCA by Garcia Perez and Magaz Lago (1994). The data analysis describe characteristics and needs and evaluate information obtained regarding deficits and improvements before and after intervention with these students, through an intervention programme to improve that skills. The information collected has allowed to highlight the changes needed by these young people in their socio-emotional response, since they are in constant risk, and have a lack of skills to avoid certain conflicting behaviours.

To examine the association between trait emotional intelligence and learning strategies and their influence on academic performance among first-year accelerated nursing students.


DESIGN
The study used a prospective survey design.


METHODS
A sample size of 81 students (100% response rate) who undertook the accelerated nursing course at a large university in Sydney participated in the study. Emotional intelligence was measured using the adapted version of the 144-item Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. Four subscales of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire were used to measure extrinsic goal motivation, peer learning, help seeking and critical thinking among the students. The grade point average score obtained at the end of six months was used to measure academic achievement.


RESULTS
The results demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between emotional intelligence scores and critical thinking (r = 0.41; p < 0.001), help seeking (r = 0.33; p < 0.003) and peer learning (r = 0.32; p < 0.004) but not with extrinsic goal orientation (r = -0.05; p < 0.677). Emotional intelligence emerged as a significant predictor of academic achievement (β = 0.25; p = 0.023).


CONCLUSION
In addition to their learning styles, higher levels of awareness and understanding of their own emotions have a positive impact on students' academic achievement. Higher emotional intelligence may lead students to pursue their interests more vigorously and think more expansively about subjects of interest, which could be an explanatory factor for higher academic performance in this group of nursing students.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The concepts of emotional intelligence are central to clinical practice as nurses need to know how to deal with their own emotions as well as provide emotional support to patients and their families. It is therefore essential that these skills are developed among student nurses to enhance the quality of their clinical practice.","[{'authorId': '145365117', 'name': 'R.

To assess the association between levels of worry about the possibility of catching swine flu and the volume of media reporting about it; the role of psychological factors in predicting likely uptake of the swine flu vaccine; and the role of media coverage and advertising in predicting other swine flu-related behaviours.


DESIGN
Data from a series of random-digit-dial telephone surveys were analysed. A time series analysis tested the association between levels of worry and the volume of media reporting on the start day of each survey. Cross-sectional regression analyses assessed the relationships between likely vaccine uptake or behaviour and predictor variables.


SETTING
Thirty-six surveys were run at, on average, weekly intervals across the UK between 1 May 2009 and 10 January 2010. Five surveys (run between 14 August and 13 September) were used to assess likely vaccine uptake. Five surveys (1-17 May) provided data relating to other behaviours.


PARTICIPANTS
Between 1047 and 1173 people aged 16 years or over took part in each survey: 5175 participants provided data about their likely uptake of the swine flu vaccine; 5419 participants provided data relating to other behaviours.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
All participants were asked to state how worried they were about the possibility of personally catching swine flu. Subsets were asked how likely they were to take up a swine flu vaccination if offered it and whether they had recently carried tissues with them, bought sanitising hand gel, avoided using public transport or had been to see a general practitioner, visited a hospital or called NHS Direct for a flu-related reason.


RESULTS
The percentage of 'very' or 'fairly' worried participants fluctuated between 9.6% and 32.9%. This figure was associated with the volume of media reporting, even after adjusting for the changing severity of the outbreak [chi2(1) = 6.6, p = 0.010, coefficient for log-transformed data = 2.6]. However, this effect only occurred during the UK's first summer wave of swine flu. In total, 56.1% of respondents were very or fairly likely to accept the swine flu vaccine. The strongest predictors were being very worried about the possibility of oneself [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2 to 7.0] or one's child (aOR 8.0, 95% CI 4.6 to 13.9) catching swine flu. Overall, 33.1% of participants reporting carrying tissues with them, 9.5% had bought sanitising gel, 2.0% had avoided public transport and 1.6% had sought medical advice. Exposure to media coverage or advertising about swine flu increased tissue carrying or buying of sanitising hand gel, and reduced avoidance of public transport or consultation with health services during early May 2009. Path analyses showed that media coverage and advertising had these differential effects because they raised the perceived efficacy of hygiene behaviours but decreased the perceived efficacy of avoidance behaviours.


CONCLUSIONS
During the swine flu outbreak, uptake rates for protective behaviours and likely acceptance rates for vaccination were low. One reason for this may in part be explained by was the low level of public worry about the possibility of catching swine flu. When levels of worry are generally low, acting to increase the volume of mass media and advertising coverage is likely to increase the perceived efficacy of recommended behaviours, which, in turn, is likely to increase their uptake.","[{'authorId': '9200475', 'name': 'G.

9545664193f966b5f8cf284f218c9834571b3df3,"Bowen's multigenerational theory provides an account of how the internalization of experiences within the family of origin promotes development of the ability to maintain a distinct self whilst also making intimate connections with others. Differentiated people can maintain their I-position in intimate relationships. They can remain calm in conflictual relationships, resolve relational problems effectively, and reach compromises. Fusion with others, emotional cut-off, and emotional reactivity instead are common reactions to relational stress in undifferentiated people. Emotional reactivity is the tendency to react to stressors with irrational and intense emotional arousal. Fusion with others is an excessive emotional involvement in significant relationships, whilst emotional cut-off is the tendency to manage relationship anxiety through physical and emotional distance. This study is based on Bowen's theory, starting from the assumption that dyadic adjustment can be affected both by a member's differentiation of self (actor effect) and by his or her partner's differentiation of self (partner effect). We used the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model to study the relationship between differentiation of self and dyadic adjustment in a convenience sample of 137 heterosexual Italian couples (nonindependent, dyadic data). The couples completed the Differentiation of Self Inventory and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Men's dyadic adjustment depended only on their personal I-position, whereas women's dyadic adjustment was affected by their personal I-position and emotional cut-off as well as by their partner's I-position and emotional cut-off. The empirical and clinical implications of the results are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2086602110', 'name': 'J. Lampis'}, {'authorId': '39775648', 'name': 'S.

At Time 3 (T3), the sample included 139 adolescents and their parents from a predominantly affluent, well-educated, Caucasian population. Parenting types were identified that differ on the bases of commitment and balance of demandingness and responsiveness. Authoritative parents who are highly demanding and highly responsive were remarkably successful in protecting their adolescents from problem drug use, and in generating competence. Authoritative upbringing, although sufficient, is not a necessary condition to produce competent children. Casual recreational drug use was not associated with pathological attributes, either precursive or concurrent, although nonusers showed an increment in competence from Time 2 (T2) to Time 3 (T3).","[{'authorId': '3555347', 'name': 'D.

Negative emotions and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies play a role in the onset and maintenance of binge eating in BED. Anger and sadness, along with negative emotions related to interpersonal experiences (i.e., disappointment, being hurt or loneliness), seem to be particularly relevant. Individuals with BED have a tendency to suppress and ruminate on their unwanted emotions, which leads to increased psychopathological thoughts and symptoms. Compared to healthy controls, they use adaptive strategies, such as reappraisal, less frequently. Evidence concerning the causal relation between negative affect and binge eating is inconclusive and still very limited. While experimental studies in a laboratory setting lack ecological validity, ecological momentary assessment studies offer more promise at unraveling the causal relationship between emotions and binge eating. Increases in negative affect are found to be antecedents of binge eating in BED. However, there seems to be less support for the possibility that binge eating serves as a means to alleviate negative affect. Finally, BED seems to be related to other forms of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as substance abuse and self-harm.","[{'authorId': '3662212', 'name': 'A.

One way to accomplish these aims is to anthropomorphize a product's appearance. The current research investigates how people decode emotional “facial” expressions from product shapes and how this affects liking of the design, using three studies in the domain of cars and one in the domain of cellular phones. In accordance with theories on the perception of human faces, the first study shows that perception of friendliness is limited to the grille (mouth), while aggressiveness can be communicated with both grille and headlights (eyes). The next study examines the best-liked combination of these two emotional expressions and finds that consumers prefer the combination of an upturned (friendly) grille with slanted (aggressive) headlights. The authors further explain this finding on a process level by showing that this combination triggers a positive affective state of both high pleasure and arousal. The third study validates the results with automobile sales data, and a fourth study extends the findings to another product category.","[{'authorId': '2179772', 'name': 'Jan R.

We examine which procedure demonstrates parameter estimates and model fit indices closer to those of complete data. The performance of PD and MI are compared under a wide range of conditions, including number of response categories, sample size, percent of missingness, and degree of model misfit. Results indicate that both PD and MI yield parameter estimates similar to those from analysis of complete data under conditions where the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). When the data are missing at random (MAR), PD parameter estimates are shown to be severely biased across parameter combinations in the study. When the percentage of missingness is less than 50%, MI yields parameter estimates that are similar to results from complete data. However, the fit indices (i.e., χ2, RMSEA, and WRMR) yield estimates that suggested a worse fit than results observed in complete data. We recommend that applied researchers use MI when fitting ordinal factor models with missing data.

The study reported here was carried out using a stratified random sample of all categories of staff (academic and non‐academic) from 14 UK universities and colleges. Levels of occupational stress were measured using the ASSET model. The results showed that the most significant source of stress for all higher education staff (irrespective of category of employee) was job insecurity. In comparison to the normative data, staff also reported significantly higher levels of stress relating to work relationships, control, and resources and communication, and significantly lower levels of commitment both from and to their organization. However, they also reported significantly lower levels of stress relating to work‐life balance, overload and job overall, and lower levels of physical ill‐health. Significant differences were identified between staff working at Old versus New universities and by category of employee.

Second, early sensory input regions in occipital, temporal, piriform, mid-insular, and primary sensory cortex were frequently engaged during affective experiences driven by visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and somatosensory inputs. A classification analysis demonstrated that the pattern of neural activity across a contrast map diagnosed the stimulus modality driving the affective experience.

At the Task × Person level, that is, the level at which SRL events take place, metacognitive experiences, such as feeling of difficulty, and online affective states play a major role in task motivation and bottom-up self-regulation.

The present study aims to shed light on this relation by investigating the mediating role of four self-control strategies: situation selection, attentional deployment, reappraisal, and inhibition. To test the hypothesis that self-control strategies mediate trait self-control’s effect on well-being, an online questionnaire on trait self-control, self-control strategies, and cognitive and affective well-being was administered to 4,036 participants from four countries (ages 18–65 and 56.4% female), whose responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Our analysis replicates previous studies that trait self-control positively relates to subjective well-being. Moreover, our analysis provides evidence that this relation is indeed mediated by the tendency to employ particular self-control strategies. Attentional deployment and reappraisal positively relate to subjective well-being, whereas inhibition exhibits a negative relation. Situation selection was unrelated to subjective well-being. The incorporation of self-control strategies represents the first attempt to empirically disentangle the positive relation between trait self-control and subjective well-being. The heterogeneous effects of self-control strategies suggest the importance of obtaining a better understanding of which aspects of trait self-control positively contributes to subjective well-being.","[{'authorId': '47136007', 'name': 'K.

Complex interactions between biological, behavioural, social and environmental factors are involved in regulation of energy balance and fat stores. A comprehensive history, physical examination and laboratory assessment relevant to the patient's obesity should be obtained. Appropriate goals of weight management emphasise realistic weight loss to achieve a reduction in health risks and should include promotion of weight loss, maintenance and prevention of weight regain. Management of co-morbidities and improving quality of life of obese patients are also included in treatment aims. Balanced hypocaloric diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasise. Aerobic training is the optimal mode of exercise for reducing fat mass while a programme including resistance training is needed for increasing lean mass in middle-aged and overweight/obese individuals. Cognitive behavioural therapy directly addresses behaviours that require change for successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Pharmacotherapy can help patients to maintain compliance and ameliorate obesity-related health risks. Surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity in terms of long-term weight loss. A comprehensive obesity management can only be accomplished by a multidisciplinary obesity management team. We conclude that physicians have a responsibility to recognise obesity as a disease and help obese patients with appropriate prevention and treatment. Treatment should be based on good clinical care, and evidence-based interventions; should focus on realistic goals and lifelong multidisciplinary management.","[{'authorId': '9947728', 'name': 'V.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), specifically the dorsal ACC, has been targeted as a key substrate in the physical and social pain matrix and was hypothesized to regulate activation response to various facial conditions. We show that participants demonstrated greatest ACC activation when being excluded by self-resembling and same-race faces, relative to other-race faces. Additionally, participants expressed greater distress and showed increased ACC activation as a result of exclusion in the same-race condition relative to the other-race condition. A positive correlation between implicit racial bias and activation in the amygdala was also evident. Implicit attitude about other-race faces partly explains levels of concern about exclusion by out-group individuals. These findings suggest that individuals are more distressed and their brain (i.e. neural alarm system) responds with greater activation when being excluded by individuals whom they are more likely to share group membership with.","[{'authorId': '39272772', 'name': 'Austen L.

Academic self-efficacy, when operationalized as mastery over domain-specific knowledge, has been found to be a predictor of academic achievement and emotions. Although academic emotions are also a predictor of academic achievement, there is limited evidence for reciprocal relations with academic achievement.


AIMS
To examine whether academic self-efficacy, when operationalized as confidence in study-related skills and behaviours, is also a predictor of academic achievement and emotions and to test reciprocal relations between academic emotions and achievement.


SAMPLE
Two hundred and six first-year undergraduate students.


METHODS
Academic self-efficacy was measured at the beginning of the first semester and learning-related emotions (LREs) at the beginning of the second semester. Academic performance was aggregated across assessments in semester one and semester two.


RESULTS
Self-efficacy in study-related skills and behaviours predicted: (1) better semester one academic performance and (2) more pleasant and fewer unpleasant LREs at the beginning of the second semester directly and (3) indirectly through semester one academic performance. Reciprocal relations between academic performance and emotions were supported, but only for pleasant emotions.


CONCLUSIONS
Self-efficacy in study-related skills was the critical academic self-efficacy variable in this study. It may play an important role in maintaining challenge appraisals to maintain pleasant emotions and better academic performance. Accordingly, practitioners in higher education may wish to consider the value of assessing and developing students' self-efficacy in relation to their independent study skills.","[{'authorId': '7606397', 'name': 'D.

Participants saw a pair of faces, one emotional and one neutral, and then a dot probe that appeared in the location of one of the faces. In two experiments, older adults responded faster to the dot if it was presented on the same side as a neutral face than if it was presented on the same side as a negative face. Younger adults did not exhibit this attentional bias. Interactions of age and valence were also found for memory for the faces, with older adults remembering positive better than negative faces. These findings reveal that in their initial attention, older adults avoid negative information. This attentional bias is consistent with older adults' generally better emotional well-being and their tendency to remember negative less well than positive information.","[{'authorId': '2145954', 'name': 'M.

Forty-five schoolchildren 5–6 years old from two classes were clustered randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 23) or a control group (n = 22). During the physical education classes, the students of the experimental group performed a 1-minute stretching programme twice a week for 8 weeks. Subsequently, these participants underwent a 5-week detraining period. The classic sit-and-reach test was performed at the beginning and at the end of the development programme, as well as at the end of the detraining period. The results of the two-way ANOVA showed that the intervention programme increased significantly the students’ sit-and-reach scores ( p < 0.001). However, after 5 weeks of detraining, children’s flexibility reverted back to the baseline levels ( p > 0.05). Although an only 1-minute stretching programme seems to develop the schoolchildren’s flexibility, after the 5-week detraining period students’ score reverts back to its initial level. This knowledge could help physical education teachers to design programmes that permit students to increase and maintain flexibility levels along the entire academic year.","[{'authorId': '1403278286', 'name': 'R.

Sigmund Freud, then Melanie Klein, Anna Freud, Donald Winnicott, and, finally, Margaret Mahler, all psychoanalysts, influenced its development. Direct observation of very young infants and their mothers began in the latter half of the 20th century, and the subsequent course shifted through the influence of developmental psychologists and ethologists. This review concludes with Dr. Stern’s predictions and fears about future directions of the field.","[{'authorId': '118118147', 'name': 'J.

However, how to generate high-quality, emotional and subhuman conversation still a troublesome work. The key factor of man-machine dialogue is whether the chatbot can give a good response in content and emotional level. How to ensure that the robot understands the user’s emotions, and consider the user’s emotions then give a satisfactory response. In this paper, we add the emotional tags to the post and response from the dataset respectively. The emotional tags, as the emotional tags of post and response, represent the emotions expressed by this sentence. The purpose of our emotional tags is to make the chatbot understood the emotion of the input sequence more directly so that it has a recognition of the emotional dimension. In this paper, we apply the mechanism of GAN network on our conversation model. For the generator: We make full use of Encoder-Decoder structure form a seq2seq model, which is used to generate a sentence’s response. For the discriminator: distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones.The outputs from the discriminator are used as rewards for the generative model, pushing the system to generate dialogues that mostly resemble human dialogues. We cast our task as an RL(Reinforcement Learning) problem, using a policy gradient method to reward more subhuman conversational sequences, and in addition we have added an emotion tags to represent the response we want to get, which we will use as a rewarding part of it, so that the emotions of real responses can be closer to the emotions we specify. Our experiment shows that through the introduction of emotional intelligence, our model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion, which can be used to control and adjust users emotion. Compared with our previous work, we get a better performance on the same data set, and we get less ’’safe’’ response than before, but there will be a certain degree of existence.","[{'authorId': '1390891968', 'name': 'Xiao Sun'}, {'authorId': '2109164072', 'name': 'Xinmiao Chen'}, {'authorId': '83550749', 'name': 'Zhengmeng Pei'}, {'authorId': '145366409', 'name': 'F.

In particular, the study focused on how emotion regulation strategies (i.e., reappraisal and suppression) mediate these relationships. Data collected from a questionnaire survey of 1115 primary school teachers in Hong Kong was analyzed to test the hypothesized relationships. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that: (1) the emotional job demands of teaching were detrimental to teacher well-being, whereas trust in colleagues was beneficial; (2) both emotion regulation strategies mediated the relationships between both emotional job demands and trust in colleagues and teacher well-being; and (3) teachers who tend to use more reappraisal may be psychologically healthier than those tend to adopt more suppression. These findings support the applicability of the JD-R model to school settings and highlight the role of teachers’ emotion regulation in teachers’ well-being.

The current study examined the relationships among these factors in a sample of adolescents with sexual abuse-related PTSD. It was hypothesized that (a) self-perceived emotion regulation difficulties would predict severity of PTSD and depressive symptoms, and that (b) depressive symptoms would mediate the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and PTSD. Method: Ninety treatment-seeking female adolescents with a history of sexual abuse were evaluated using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale-Interview and completed the Negative Mood Regulation Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory as part of a baseline evaluation. Results: Greater emotion regulation difficulties were associated with greater severity of PTSD and depressive symptoms. In addition, the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and PTSD severity was mediated by depressive symptoms. However, the reverse was also true: the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms was mediated by PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Mediation analyses showed that emotion regulation difficulties were associated with both PTSD and depressive symptoms rather than fitting a unidirectional model.

Further, this research identified the moderating role of technology anxiety.Design/methodology/approachAn online survey was carried out to investigate the role of personalization on continuance intention toward branded mobile apps. In total, 348 valid responses were analyzed to test hypotheses using structural equation modeling.FindingsThe results show that personalization had significantly affected perceived benefit, perceived risk and perceived ease of use. Perceived benefit had positive effects on perceived value of disclosure, but perceived risk did not affect perceived value of disclosure. Perceived value of disclosure and perceived ease of use were linked to trust. Trust, in turn, positively affected intentions to use mobile apps. With regard to the moderating effect of technology anxiety, it had a significant moderating impact on the relationship between personalization and perceived risk. However, it did not moderate the relationship between personalization and perceived benefit.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study could provide useful theoretical and practical implications related to the successful implementation of mobile marketing.Originality/valueThis study proposes the integrated model of privacy calculus theory and the TAM for deeper understanding of the customers’ responses toward personalization of branded mobile apps.","[{'authorId': '93874796', 'name': 'Jee-Won Kang'}, {'authorId': '39323443', 'name': 'Young Namkung'}]",79.0,,76.0,The role of personalization on continuance intention in food service mobile apps,2019.0

These processes belong either to the “automatic” (preconscious and fast) or the “elaborative” (conscious and slow) mode. This study aims to determine the role of these variables in the work setting and to analyze their relationship with positive and negative affect, engagement and burnout. Method: 350 employees (54.8% men and 45.2% women) were presented with several instruments measuring burnout, engagement, affect and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in a prospective study. An explanatory model was tested through structural equation modeling analysis. Results: Acceptable fit indices and a significant explanatory value both for burnout (61%) and engagement (58%) were obtained. The use of “automatic” cognitive regulation strategies was associated with the presence of negative affect and burnout whereas “elaborative” processes were associated with positive affect and engagement. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of the role of cognitive emotion regulation in organizational settings. &NA; Procesos cognitivos de regulación emocional, burnout y engagement en el trabajo.

They were randomly distributed in two databases, which were submitted to exploratory (sample 1) and confirmatory factor analysis (sample 2). The exploratory results indicated a three-factor structure: Cognitive Reappraisal, Redirection of Attentional Focus and Emotional Suppression, which together explained 59.3% of the total variance (α = 0,67; α = 0,63; α = 0,64). For the confirmatory analyses, the following goodness-of-fit indices were found: χ² (24) = 67.02, p <0.001; χ² / df = 2.79, GFI = 0.93; AGFI = 0.88; CFI = 0.88 and RMSEA = 0.08 (IC 90% = 0.064-0.100).

The frequency of burnout and itself level were calculated and compared between genders and year of training using the Chi-square. Eighty-two residents responded to the survey (100% of attendees and 91.1% of all residents in the department); 74.2% were male and 25.8% of female, 38.7% were in their 1st year of training, 24.2% in their 2nd year, 29.0% in their 3rd year, and 8.1% in their 4th year. The overall burnout frequency was 41.9% (29% with moderate burnout, and 12.9% with severe burnout). Overall twice as many female residents had burnout than males (P = 0.017). The prevalence of “moderate burnout” among males and females was 19.8% and 56.3%, respectively. However, no difference between males and females was seen in the “severe burnout” category (13% and 12.5%, respectively). The overall burnout rate was the lowest in the 1st year of training (33.3%) and the highest in the last (60%) but with no statistical significance (P = 0.4).

Somatosensory cortical function has been implicated in emotional recognition, risk-taking and affective responses through sensory modalities. This study investigates anatomy and function of the somatosensory cortex in euthymic bipolar women. Methods: In total, 68 right-handed euthymic women (bipolar disorder = 32 and healthy controls = 36) between 16 and 45 years of age underwent high-resolution anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging during the mid-follicular menstrual phase. The somatosensory cortex was used as a seed region for resting-state functional connectivity analysis. Voxel-based morphometry was used to evaluate somatosensory cortical gray matter volume between groups. Results: We found increased resting-state functional connectivity between the somatosensory cortex and insular cortex, inferior prefrontal gyrus and frontal orbital cortex in euthymic bipolar disorder subjects compared to healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry analysis showed decreased gray matter in the left somatosensory cortex in the bipolar disorder group. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis controlled by age did not reveal any additional significant difference between groups. Conclusion: This study is the first to date to evaluate anatomy and function of the somatosensory cortex in a well-characterized sample of euthymic bipolar disorder females.

We developed a simulation model to estimate the risk of adult obesity at the age of 35 years for the current population of children in the United States. METHODS We pooled height and weight data from five nationally representative longitudinal studies totaling 176,720 observations from 41,567 children and adults. We simulated growth trajectories across the life course and adjusted for secular trends. We created 1000 virtual populations of 1 million children through the age of 19 years that were representative of the 2016 population of the United States and projected their trajectories in height and weight up to the age of 35 years. Severe obesity was defined as a body‐mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 35 or higher in adults and 120% or more of the 95th percentile in children. RESULTS Given the current level of childhood obesity, the models predicted that a majority of today's children (57.3%; 95% uncertainly interval [UI], 55.2 to 60.0) will be obese at the age of 35 years, and roughly half of the projected prevalence will occur during childhood. Our simulations indicated that the relative risk of adult obesity increased with age and BMI, from 1.17 (95% UI, 1.09 to 1.29) for overweight 2‐year‐olds to 3.10 (95% UI, 2.43 to 3.65) for 19‐year‐olds with severe obesity. For children with severe obesity, the chance they will no longer be obese at the age of 35 years fell from 21.0% (95% UI, 7.3 to 47.3) at the age of 2 years to 6.1% (95% UI, 2.1 to 9.9) at the age of 19 years. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of our simulation models, childhood obesity and overweight will continue to be a major health problem in the United States. Early development of obesity predicted obesity in adulthood, especially for children who were severely obese. (Funded by the JPB Foundation and others.)","[{'authorId': '4002058', 'name': 'Z.

Animal models show that epigenetic modifications mediate the effects of maternal separation and environmental stress on susceptibility to disease and psychobehavioral problems later in life. Epigenetic research has the potential to lead to the identification of biological markers, gene expression profiles, and profile changes that occur overtime in response to early-life experiences. Combined with knowledge gained through the use of advanced technologies, epigenetic studies have the promise to refine our understanding about how the brain matures and functions from multiple perspectives including the effect of the environment on brain growth and maturation. Such an understanding will pave the way for care practices that will allow the premature brain to develop to its full capacity and will lead to the best possible outcomes. Neonatal epigenetic research is emerging and rapidly advancing. As scientists overcome biological, technical, and cost-related challenges, such research has a great potential in determining key environmental factors that affect the preterm genome, allowing for targeted interventions. The purpose of this article is to explore existing literature related to epigenetic mechanisms that potentially mediate the effects of the environment on preterm infant brain development.","[{'authorId': '12945141', 'name': 'H.

Nonpharmacological treatments are available for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although their efficacy remains uncertain. The authors undertook meta-analyses of the efficacy of dietary (restricted elimination diets, artificial food color exclusions, and free fatty acid supplementation) and psychological (cognitive training, neurofeedback, and behavioral interventions) ADHD treatments.


METHOD
Using a common systematic search and a rigorous coding and data extraction strategy across domains, the authors searched electronic databases to identify published randomized controlled trials that involved individuals who were diagnosed with ADHD (or who met a validated cutoff on a recognized rating scale) and that included an ADHD outcome.


RESULTS
Fifty-four of the 2,904 nonduplicate screened records were included in the analyses. Two different analyses were performed. When the outcome measure was based on ADHD assessments by raters closest to the therapeutic setting, all dietary (standardized mean differences=0.21-0.48) and psychological (standardized mean differences=0.40-0.64) treatments produced statistically significant effects. However, when the best probably blinded assessment was employed, effects remained significant for free fatty acid supplementation (standardized mean difference=0.16) and artificial food color exclusion (standardized mean difference=0.42) but were substantially attenuated to nonsignificant levels for other treatments.


CONCLUSIONS
Free fatty acid supplementation produced small but significant reductions in ADHD symptoms even with probably blinded assessments, although the clinical significance of these effects remains to be determined. Artificial food color exclusion produced larger effects but often in individuals selected for food sensitivities. Better evidence for efficacy from blinded assessments is required for behavioral interventions, neurofeedback, cognitive training, and restricted elimination diets before they can be supported as treatments for core ADHD symptoms.","[{'authorId': '1394809123', 'name': 'E.

The central hypothesis was that job demands would be the most important predictors of absenteeism, through their relationship with health problems (i.e., exhaustion and Repetitive Strain Injury—RSI), whereas job resources would be the most important predictors of turnover intentions, through their relationship with involvement (i.e., organizational commitment and dedication). Results of a series of SEM analyses largely supported these dual processes. In the first energy-driven process, job demands (i.e., work pressure, computer problems, emotional demands, and changes in tasks) were the most important predictors of health problems, which, in turn, were related to sickness absence (duration and long-term absence). In the second motivation-driven process, job resources (i.e., social support, supervisory coaching, performance feedback and time control) were the only predictors of involvement, which, in turn, was related to turnover intentions. Additionally, job resources had a weak negative relationship with health problems, and health problems positively influenced turnover intentions. The application of the JD – R model as a human resource management tool in call centres as well as in other organizations is discussed.","[{'authorId': '1776932', 'name': 'A.

Although expression of caring and understanding is valued in supportive human communications, do we want the same from a chatbot, or do we simply reject it due to its artificiality and uncanniness? To answer this question, we conducted two experiments with a chatbot providing online medical information advice about a sensitive personal issue. In Study 1, participants (N = 158) simply read a dialogue between a chatbot and a human user. In Study 2, participants (N = 88) interacted with a real chatbot. We tested the effect of three types of empathic expression-sympathy, cognitive empathy, and affective empathy-on individuals' perceptions of the service and the chatbot.

Despite the evidence for the influence of positive mental well-being on health, there is, to our knowledge, no research examining the possible effects of positive antenatal mental health on the development of the offspring. Using exploratory bifactor analysis, this prospective study (n = 1,066) demonstrated the feasibility of using common psychiatric screening tools to examine the effect of positive maternal mental health. Antenatal mental health was assessed during 26th week of pregnancy. The effects on offspring were assessed when the child was 12, 18, and 24 months old. Results showed that positive antenatal mental health was uniquely associated with the offspring's cognitive, language and parentally rated competences. This study shows that the effects of positive maternal mental health are likely to be specific and distinct from the sheer absence of symptoms of depression or anxiety.","[{'authorId': '3275870', 'name': 'D.

The main instruments used were the basic psychological needs scale, the emotional regulation scale and the academic stress questionnaire. Results show a positive relationship between the need of autonomy and the two dimensions of emotional regulation – cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression-. Cognitive reappraisal did not exhibit any relationship within the social science students examined. Further, the needs of autonomy and competence were positively related with cognitive reappraisal, and negatively related with expressive suppression. The greatest correlation strength was revealed in students studying health sciences. Finally, it was revealed that health science students made better use of emotional regulation in order to control academic stress.

The thalamus and cerebral cortex are connected via topographically organized, reciprocal connections. Previous studies have revealed thalamic abnormalities in schizophrenia; however, it is not known whether thalamocortical networks are differentially affected in the disorder. To explore this possibility, the authors examined functional connectivity in intrinsic low-frequency blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations between major divisions of the cortex and thalamus using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI).


METHOD
Seventy-seven healthy subjects and 62 patients with schizophrenia underwent resting-state fMRI. To identify functional subdivisions of the thalamus, the authors parceled the cortex into six regions of interest: the prefrontal cortex, motor cortex/supplementary motor area, somatosensory cortex, temporal lobe, posterior parietal cortex, and occipital lobe. Mean BOLD time series were extracted for each region of interest and entered into a seed-based functional connectivity analysis.


RESULTS
Consistent with previous reports, activity in distinct cortical areas correlated with specific, largely nonoverlapping regions of the thalamus in both healthy comparison subjects and schizophrenia patients. Direct comparison between groups revealed reduced prefrontal-thalamic connectivity and increased motor/somatosensory-thalamic connectivity in schizophrenia. The changes in connectivity were unrelated to local gray matter content within the thalamus and to antipsychotic medication dosage. No differences were observed in temporal, posterior parietal, or occipital cortex connectivity with the thalamus.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings establish differential abnormalities of thalamocortical networks in schizophrenia. The etiology of schizophrenia may disrupt the development of prefrontal-thalamic connectivity and refinement of somatomotor connectivity with the thalamus that occurs during brain maturation.","[{'authorId': '1941486', 'name': 'N.

The aim of this paper is to conduct the first comprehensive systematic meta-review of the evidence linking work to the development of common mental health problems, specifically depression, anxiety and/or work-related stress and to consider how the risk factors identified may relate to each other. MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Embase, the Cochrane Collaboration and grey literature databases were systematically searched for review articles that examined work-based risk factors for common mental health problems. All included reviews were subjected to a quality appraisal. 37 review studies were identified, of which 7 were at least moderate quality. 3 broad categories of work-related factors were identified to explain how work may contribute to the development of depression and/or anxiety: imbalanced job design, occupational uncertainty and lack of value and respect in the workplace. Within these broad categories, there was moderate level evidence from multiple prospective studies that high job demands, low job control, high effort–reward imbalance, low relational justice, low procedural justice, role stress, bullying and low social support in the workplace are associated with a greater risk of developing common mental health problems. While methodological limitations continue to preclude more definitive statements on causation between work and mental disorders, there is now a range of promising targets for individual and organisational-level interventions aimed at minimising mental health problems in the workplace.","[{'authorId': '31767950', 'name': 'S.

Path analysis using data from 179 healthy young participants (110 women, 69 men) revealed that stronger promotion orientation was significantly associated with less anxiety, and that the use of reappraisal and suppression partially mediated this association. Prevention was associated with more suppression but was not directly associated with anxiety. There were no gender differences in these effects. Collectively, these findings suggest that effective ER, through heightened use of reappraisal and dampened use of suppression, serves as a mechanism through which promotion confers protection against anxiety.

This article provides evidence for the buffering role of various job resources on the impact of various job demands on burnout. In the present article, we look back on the first 10 years of the JD-R model (2001–2010), and discuss how the model matured into JD-R theory (2011–2016). Moreover, we look at the future of the theory and outline which new issues in JD-R theory are worthwhile of investigation. We also discuss practical applications. It is our hope that JD-R theory will continue to inspire researchers and practitioners who want to promote employee well-being and effective organizational functioning.","[{'authorId': '1776932', 'name': 'A.

Research purpose: To provide an overview of the JD–R model, which incorporates many possible working conditions and focuses on both negative and positive indicators of employee well-being. Moreover, the studies of the special issue were introduced. Research design: Qualitative and quantitative studies on the JD–R model were reviewed to enlighten the health and motivational processes suggested by the model. Main findings: Next to the confirmation of the two suggested processes of the JD–R model, the studies of the special issue showed that the model can be used to predict work-place bullying, incidences of upper respiratory track infection, work-based identity, and early retirement intentions. Moreover, whilst psychological safety climate could be considered as a hypothetical precursor of job demands and resources, compassion satisfaction moderated the health process of the model. Contribution/value-add: The findings of previous studies and the studies of the special issue were integrated in the JD–R model that can be used to predict well-being and performance at work. New avenues for future research were suggested. Practical/managerial implications: The JD–R model is a framework that can be used for organisations to improve employee health and motivation, whilst simultaneously improving various organisational outcomes.","[{'authorId': '4847518', 'name': 'E.

Information Technology can have an effect on quality and efficiency of care. Aims: The aim of this study is to gain the viewpoint of service users from a local mental health service in developing a mental health app. Method: A qualitative descriptive approach was used. Eight volunteers aged 18–49 years were interviewed with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: Interviewees defined a good app by its ease of use. Common themes included availability of contact information, identifying triggers, the ability to rate mood/anxiety levels on a scale, guided relaxation techniques, and the option to personalise the app. The researchers will aim to produce an app that is easily accessible, highly personalisable and will include functions highlighted as important (i.e. contact information, etc.). Conclusions: This research will assist in the development of an easy-to-use app that could increase access to services, and allow service users to take an active role in their care. In previous studies, apps were developed without the involvement of service users. This study recognises the important role of service users in this area.","[{'authorId': '13233290', 'name': 'J.

9e603d32746dd4eaba556795f5b3218ed3ca8eff,"CONTEXT
Major depressive disorder is associated with impairments in processing emotional stimuli, and residual impairments are observed during remission, possibly indicating trait vulnerability. Stimuli with social context represent a distinct class of emotional stimuli, which in healthy volunteers are associated with specific neural substrates but have not previously been studied relative to vulnerability to depression.


OBJECTIVE
To explore whether individuals with remitted major depressive disorder had altered neuronal processing of social emotional stimuli.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional design using functional magnetic resonance imaging, combined with a cognitive activation task.


SETTING
General community of greater Manchester, England.


PARTICIPANTS
Twenty-five unmedicated participants fully remitted from major depressive disorder and 29 age-matched control subjects.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Neuronal responses to positive and negative social interaction images vs valence-matched images with less overt social context.


RESULTS
Participants with remitted depression showed attenuated frontopolar response relative to controls for positive and negative images depicting social interactions. For negative social images, participants with remitted depression also showed reduced latero-orbitofrontal response relative to controls.


CONCLUSIONS
In the absence of current symptoms, individuals with remitted major depressive disorder showed reduced frontopolar processing of stimuli showing social interactions, a reduction not seen for stimuli showing individual successes and failures and, therefore, not simply an effect of emotional valence. These results suggest a specific trait abnormality in social emotional processing associated with vulnerability to depression, which may have implications for understanding social cognition mechanisms and for developing effective psychological therapies.","[{'authorId': '49691586', 'name': 'R.

OCS were rated for clinical data, and a neuropsychological battery was administered to 14 patients on the day of the scan. Absolute rCMRglu for whole cortex, and normalized prefrontal lateral cortex metabolic rates, were both significantly lower in OCS than in NC. No significant difference between treated (n= 10) and drug‐free (n= 6) OCS was found for those variables. OCS were significantly impaired in the neuropsychological tasks assessing memory and attention. The rCMRglu for prefrontal lateral cortex were negatively correlated to Stroop‐test subscores. This “frontal‐oriented” task assessed the ability of OCS to inhibit immediate but inappropriate responses. These results suggest, in OCS, a modification of the general activating systems of cortical function and a relationship between the lateral prefrontal rCMRglu decrease and a selective attention deficit.","[{'authorId': '2451948', 'name': 'J.

9ee36271cc7d04cfb43bf7e9cb510bc01e39f251,"We used positron emission tomography to study cortical regions mediating tactile attention. Cues selectively directed subjects to attend to the roughness or duration of contact with embossed gratings that rubbed against a single fingertip with controlled speed and force. The task required discriminating between paired gratings that differed in tactile features of roughness and/or length. For different blocks of trials, cues directed attention to one tactile feature or indicated a divided attention strategy to a change in either feature. All attention conditions unambiguously activated several somatosensory foci in the parietal cortex, including somatotopically appropriate portions of the primary somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus (S1) and the secondary somatosensory region (S2) within parietal opercular regions. There was no evidence for separate processing foci for selective and divided attention strategies, or for selectively attending to roughness versus stimulus duration. We observed a greater magnitude blood flow change in S2 versus S1 during attention tasks, which suggests that S2 might actually influence S1 activity. Despite these differences, modulation of S1 and S2 supports concepts of early selection in tactile attention. There were also examples of non-sensory foci in frontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and bilateral superior parietal regions at the fundus of the postcentral sulcus. Posterior parietal regions observed in this study did not overlap foci seen in studies of visual attention. Thus, the posterior parietal region may be subdivided into modality-specific subregions, each of which processes information needed to attend to a specific modality. These non-sensory areas may constitute a network that provides a source of modulating influences on the earlier stage, sensory areas.","[{'authorId': '2140424472', 'name': 'H.

Introduction: The aim of this research was to validate the General Health Questionnaire28 (GHQ-28) as a screening instrument of mental disorders in the population of aged 15 yr and above in Tehran City, capital of Iran. Methods: Overall, 879 people (455 females and 424 males) were chosen by the randomized cluster sampling from families under the coverage of health centers of the universities of Tehran, Iran and Shahid Beheshty. The study was carried out in two stage procedures. In the first step the GPs completed the GHQ-28, and in the second step all the samples were clinically interviewed by psychiatric residents based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Results: By using conventional scoring method of GHQ, the cut off point for the sample was 6. The sensitivity and specificity of this questionnaire were 84.7% and 93.8% respectively, and the overall misclassification rate was 8.2%. Likert scoring method of GHQ showed a cut off point of 24 and the sensitivity, specificity and the overall misclassification rate of 70.5%, 92.3% and 12.3% respectively. The concurrent validity of this questionnaire carried out by the Symptom Checklist90Revised indicated that there was a meaningful correlation between scores of samples within the scales of these instruments. The Pearson correlation between the scales and total scores of GHQ-28 suggested that fluctuation of anxiety symptoms had an important character in predicting abnormality than the other scales. Conclusion: The evaluation of reliability of GHQ-28 carried out by the testretest procedure a week after the first stage, and validation of this instrument indicated that the instrument could be used successfully in the epidemiological study of mental disorders as a screening instrument.","[{'authorId': '13497612', 'name': 'A.

9f793383987cf1e1edb4a1ce6a6007afb3a95a3f,"Emerging evidence suggests that there is a reduction in overall cortical excitatory to inhibitory balance in major depressive disorder (MDD), which afflicts ∼14%-20% of individuals. Reduced pyramidal cell arborization occurs with stress and MDD, and may diminish excitatory neurotransmission. Enhanced deposition of perineuronal net (PNN) components also occurs with stress. Since parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are the predominant cell population that is enveloped by PNNs, which enhance their ability to release GABA, excess PNN deposition likely increases pyramidal cell inhibition. In the present study, we investigate the potential for matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), an endopeptidase secreted in response to neuronal activity, to contribute to the antidepressant efficacy of the serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine in male mice. Chronic venlafaxine increases MMP-9 levels in murine cortex, and increases both pyramidal cell arborization and PSD-95 expression in the cortex of WT but not MMP-9-null mice. We have previously shown that venlafaxine reduces PNN deposition and increases the power of ex vivo γ oscillations in conventionally housed mice. γ power is increased with pyramidal cell disinhibition and with remission from MDD. Herein we observe that PNN expression is increased in a corticosterone-induced stress model of disease and reduced by venlafaxine. Compared with mice that receive concurrent venlafaxine, corticosterone-treated mice also display reduced ex vivo γ power and impaired working memory. Autopsy-derived PFC samples show elevated MMP-9 levels in antidepressant-treated MDD patients compared with controls. These preclinical and postmortem findings highlight a link between extracellular matrix regulation and MDD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Reduced excitatory neurotransmission occurs with major depressive disorder, and may be normalized by antidepressant treatment. Underlying molecular mechanisms are, however, not well understood. Herein we investigate a potential role for an extracellular protease, released from neurons and known to play a role in learning and memory, in antidepressant-associated increases in excitatory transmission. Our data suggest that this protease, matrix metalloprotease-9, increases branching of excitatory neurons and concomitantly attenuates the perineuronal net to potentially reduce inhibitory input to these neurons. Matrix metalloprotease-9 may thus enhance overall excitatory/inhibitory balance and neuronal population dynamics, which are important to mood and memory.","[{'authorId': '38254612', 'name': 'Seham Alaiyed'}, {'authorId': '40862909', 'name': 'Mondona S.

In the current article, the authors propose and then test a theoretical model that integrates these factors. They specify a progressive (cascading) pattern among ability-based EI facets, in which emotion perception must causally precede emotion understanding, which in turn precedes conscious emotion regulation and job performance. The sequential elements in this progressive model are believed to selectively reflect Conscientiousness, cognitive ability, and Neuroticism, respectively. ""Mixed-based"" measures of EI are expected to explain variance in job performance beyond cognitive ability and personality. The cascading model of EI is empirically confirmed via meta-analytic data, although relationships between ability-based EI and job performance are shown to be inconsistent (i.e., EI positively predicts performance for high emotional labor jobs and negatively predicts performance for low emotional labor jobs). Gender and race differences in EI are also meta-analyzed.

The concept of emotion regulation features in many models of psychopathology and it has been proposed that individuals with poorly regulated emotions often engage in maladaptive behaviours to escape from or down-regulate their emotions, creating risk for a range of disorders. One such disorder may be pathological gambling. To our knowledge, no study had assessed the use of emotion-regulation strategies in this population. The goal of the present study was therefore to examine emotion-regulation difficulties among a sample of pathological gamblers (n= 56), a mixed clinical comparison group (n= 50), and a sample of healthy community controls (n= 49).

Participants were recruited from the community and a gambling treatment unit in Australia and completed clinical diagnostic interviews (ADIS-IV; SCIP), self-report measures of psychopathology (DASS-21), substance use (AUDIT), and emotion-regulation difficulties (DERS; ERQ).


RESULTS
Pathological gamblers and the clinical comparison group reported significantly less use of reappraisal as an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy, and reported a greater lack of emotional clarity and more impulsivity than individuals in the healthy community comparison group. Pathological gamblers reported a greater lack of emotional awareness compared to the healthy control group and reported differences in access to effective emotion-regulation strategies compared to both comparison groups.


CONCLUSIONS
The results support specific deficits of emotion regulation in pathological gamblers and emphasize the need to address these underlying vulnerabilities in addition to directly targeting gambling behaviours in therapy.","[{'authorId': '39470551', 'name': 'Alishia D.

Families are comprised of individuals who interact across levels in a socio-ecological system. Family resiliency does not develop through evasion of risk, but through successful application of protective factors to engage in adverse situations and emerge from them stronger. In an effort to move away from pathological labelling, this review provides a foundation for strength-based family interventions. Thirteen peerreviewed databases were searched for articles and information regarding family resiliency. Careful review yielded 24 protective factors that foster resiliency across three distinct but interactive levels: individual, family and community. The protective factors identified in this review of the literature offer an excellent starting point for development of clinical interventions to support family resiliency.","[{'authorId': '5076060', 'name': 'K.

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with managers from a range of backgrounds, and with varying experience of recruitment and selection. Findings – Findings revealed that reasons for the use of intuition included personal preferences, resource constraints and recognition of the limitations of more structured approaches. Intuition was used an indicator for performance, personality and person-environment fit. Intuition tended to be used with requisite caution; participants were aware of its limits, the potential for bias and the difficulties in justifying its use; several participants used their intuitions in concert with more structured, non-intuition based approaches.

Whole-vault cranioplasty and strip craniectomy are performed at various times in individuals with sagittal-suture craniosynostosis. This study used comprehensive neurological testing to examine the relationship between age at time of surgery and long-term neuropsychological function. Methods: Seventy sagittal-suture craniosynostosis patients who had previously undergone either whole-vault cranioplasty or strip craniectomy were examined divided into three groups: treatment before 6 months (n = 41), between 6 and 12 months (n = 21), and after 12 months (n = 8). To examine long-term cognitive functioning, participants between the ages of 5 and 25 years underwent neurodevelopmental tests to evaluate intelligence, achievement, and learning disabilities. Results: Compared with those treated between 6 and 12 months and after 12 months, patients who underwent surgery before 6 months demonstrated higher full-scale IQ (p < 0.01) and verbal IQ (p < 0.01). Patients who received surgery before 6 months also demonstrated superior abilities in word reading (p < 0.01), reading comprehension (p < 0.01), spelling (p < 0.01), and numerical operations (p < 0.05) relative to those who had surgery between 6 and 12 months old. A statistically significant higher percentage of patients treated after 6 months had one or more reading-related learning disabilities as compared with those undergoing earlier surgery. Conclusions: This study suggests that surgery before 6 months old results in improved long-term neurological outcomes. Future studies should examine how the technique of surgery impacts these neuropsychological measures.

In response to the criticisms of the construct, we argue that the protagonists have not distinguished adequately between the streams, and have inappropriately characterized emotional intelligence as a variant of social intelligence. More significantly, two of the critical authors assert incorrectly that emotional intelligence research is driven by a utopian political agenda, rather than scientific interest. We argue, on the contrary, that emotional intelligence research is grounded in recent scientific advances in the study of emotion; specifically regarding the role emotion plays in organizational behavior. We conclude that emotional intelligence is attracting deserved continuing research interest as an individual difference variable in organizational behavior related to the way members perceive, understand, and manage their emotions.","[{'authorId': '70294020', 'name': 'N.

We tested an aspect of this model by recruiting medically and psychiatrically healthy young adults (N = 32) who differed on one key criterion—exposure to early social trauma. In terms of core affective personality traits as measured by the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS), those not exposed to early social trauma scored significantly higher on SEEKING; the groups did not differ on SADNESS. Importantly, the groups also responded differently to a low-dose opioid challenge (0.2 mg sublingual buprenorphine vs. placebo). Buprenorphine administration had little effect on emotion in controls, but it reduced experience of both positive and negative emotion in trauma-exposed participants. The latter also showed a significant negative bias in social cognition that was not attenuated by buprenorphine, whereas controls were more likely to show a positive bias on buprenorphine (relative to trauma-exposed participants). The groups’ differing responses to buprenorphine suggest that their opioid systems are functioning differently. These data constitute preliminary proof of concept for a key aspect of the model. Further investigation of the role of endogenous opioids in depression subsequent to early social trauma is warranted.","[{'authorId': '1398207686', 'name': 'S.

As empirical research on resilience has burgeoned in recent years, criticisms have been levied at work in this area. These critiques have generally focused on ambiguities in definitions and central terminology; heterogeneity in risks experienced and competence achieved by individuals viewed as resilient; instability of the phenomenon of resilience; and concerns regarding the usefulness of resilience as a theoretical construct. We address each identified criticism in turn, proposing solutions for those we view as legitimate and clarifying misunderstandings surrounding those we believe to be less valid. We conclude that work on resilience possesses substantial potential for augmenting the understanding of processes affecting at-risk individuals. Realization of the potential embodied by this construct, however, will remain constrained without continued scientific attention to some of the serious conceptual and methodological pitfalls that have been noted by skeptics and proponents alike.","[{'authorId': '5106361', 'name': 'S.

We manipulated both the gender of the employees being evaluated and whether the company's core values emphasized meritocracy in evaluations and compensation. The main finding is consistent across the three studies: when an organization is explicitly presented as meritocratic, individuals in managerial positions favor a male employee over an equally qualified female employee by awarding him a larger monetary reward. This finding demonstrates that the pursuit of meritocracy at the workplace may be more difficult than it first appears and that there may be unrecognized risks behind certain organizational efforts used to reward merit. We discuss possible underlying mechanisms leading to the paradox of meritocracy effect as well as the scope conditions under which we expect the effect to occur.","[{'authorId': '15707170', 'name': 'Emilio J.

a11ae3264fc85ecdd800244321fc0a611f2e5606,"Research shows that cognitive reappraisal is an effective emotion regulation (ER) strategy that often has clear benefits. Yet, surprisingly, recent findings demonstrate that people use cognitive reappraisal less frequently than might be expected (Suri, Whittaker, & Gross, 2015). We employ cognitive energetics theory (CET) to explain this puzzling behavior. CET posits that the likelihood of launching any cognitive process is a function of two opposing forces: the driving force (i.e., the motivation to launch the process) and the restraining force (i.e., task difficulty). We thus hypothesized that people choose to use cognitive reappraisal relatively rarely because of the difficulty of implementing it. We also postulated that the decision to reappraise (or not) does not simply depend on stimuli emotional intensity because the latter is associated with both the driving and the restraining forces. In support of our hypotheses, we found that when the images' emotional intensity posed difficulty for reappraisal (i.e., highly intense images), reducing this difficulty by asking participants to merely predict others' (Study 1) or their own choices (Study 2) increased reappraisal choice. Finally, in Study 3, we show that a relatively easy to implement reappraisal strategy was chosen more often than the more difficult one for high (but not low) intensity images. These findings illustrate the relevance of a CET-based motivational analysis to emotion regulation choice.

Current information on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among older adults in the United States is lacking. Prevalence of anxiety, mood, and substance disorders was examined by age (18-44, 45-64, 65-74, and 75 years and older) and sex. Covariates of disorders for older adults (65 years and older) were explored.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional epidemiologic study, using data from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication.


SETTING
Community-based epidemiologic survey.


PARTICIPANTS
Representative national sample of community-dwelling adults in the United States.


MEASUREMENTS
The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition psychiatric disorders.


RESULTS
Prevalence of 12-month and lifetime mood, anxiety, and substance-use disorders was lower for older adults (65 years and older) than younger age groups: 2.6% for mood disorder, 7.0% for anxiety disorder, 0 for any substance-use disorder, and 8.5% for any of these disorders (for any disorder, 18-44 years = 27.6%, 45-64 years = 22.4%). Among older adults, presence of a 12-month anxiety disorder was associated with female sex, lower education, being unmarried, and three or more chronic conditions. Presence of a 12-month mood disorder was associated with disability. Similar patterns were noted for lifetime disorders (any disorder: 18-44 years = 46.4%, 45-64 years = 43.7%, and 65 years and older = 20.9%).


CONCLUSIONS
This study documents the continued pattern of lower rates of formal diagnoses for elders. These rates likely underestimate the burden of late-life psychiatric disorders, given the potential for underdiagnosis, clinical significance of subthreshold symptoms, and lack of representation from high-risk older adults (e.g., medically ill, long-term care residents).","[{'authorId': '5560849', 'name': 'A.

O paciente nao sabe como processar suas proprias emocoes e deixam de externalizar o que sentem. A investigacao de possivel relacao entre fibromialgia e alexitimia pode aumentar o conhecimento sobre as caracteristicas clinicas resultantes de ambas as doencas, especialmente porque alexitimia e pouco explorada e tem um impacto significativo na qualidade de vida dos pacientes. Objetivos: Executar uma revisao da literatura em busca de uma associacao clinica entre alexitimia e fibromialgia (FM), com destaque para os aspectos psicologicos e psiquiatricos.

Distance-learning students are particularly burdened and have limited access to conventional university health services. Interventions for stress are sought after in distance learners and may help increase treatment coverage. Internet-based interventions have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating depression, but it remains unclear if interventions directed at academic stress also have this potential. Aim: The trial presented here investigates the effectiveness of an Internet- and App-based stress intervention in distance-learning students with elevated levels of depression. Methods: A sample of N = 200 students of a large German distance university with elevated levels of depression [Center for Epidemiological Studies’ Depression Scale (CES-D) ≥ 16] will be randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress management intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program for academic stress. The IG consists of eight Internet-based sessions promoting stress management skills using cognitive–behavioral and problem-solving techniques. A mobile App will be employed to facilitate training transfer. Self-report data will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1; 7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up (T2). Potential moderators will be assessed at baseline. The primary outcome is depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and academic outcomes. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle along with sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. Additional health economic analyses will be conducted. Discussion: Results will provide the basis to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of Internet-delivered stress interventions in distance-learning students with symptoms of depression.

To assess the validity of the RDI, 70 mothers of infant and preschool children with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy were administered the RDI, and the security of each child's attachment to his or her mother was assessed using the Strange Situation. Results indicate that parental resolution versus nonresolution of the child's diagnosis is strongly associated with secure versus insecure child-parent attachment. Results are discussed in terms of the validity of the RDI, implications for clinical research and theory, and the potential use of the RDI as a clinical assessment procedure.","[{'authorId': '5005428', 'name': 'R.

Evaluation of broad-spectrum micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) treatment for childhood ADHD has been limited to open-label studies that highlight beneficial effects across many aspects of psychological functioning.


METHOD
This is the first fully blinded randomized controlled trial of medication-free children (n = 93) with ADHD (7-12 years) assigned to either micronutrients (n = 47) or placebo (n = 46) in a 1:1 ratio, for 10 weeks. All children received standardized ADHD assessments. Data were collected from clinicians, parents, participants and teachers across a range of measures assessing ADHD symptoms, general functioning and impairment, mood, aggression and emotional regulation.


RESULTS
Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant between-group differences favouring micronutrient treatment on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (ES = 0.46), with 47% of those on micronutrients identified as 'much' to 'very much' improved versus 28% on placebo. No group differences were identified on clinician, parent and teacher ratings of overall ADHD symptoms (ES ranged 0.03-0.17). However, according to clinicians, 32% of those on micronutrients versus 9% of those on placebo showed a clinically meaningful improvement on inattentive (OR = 4.9; 95% CI: 1.5-16.3), but no group differences on improvement in hyperactive-impulsive symptoms (OR = 1.0; 95% CI: 0.4-2.5). Based on clinician, parent and teacher report, those on micronutrients showed greater improvements in emotional regulation, aggression and general functioning compared to placebo (ES ranged 0.35-0.66). There were two dropouts per group, no group differences in adverse events and no serious adverse events identified. Blinding was successful with guessing no better than chance.


CONCLUSIONS
Micronutrients improved overall function, reduced impairment and improved inattention, emotional regulation and aggression, but not hyperactive/impulsive symptoms, in this sample of children with ADHD. Although direct benefit for core ADHD symptoms was modest, with mixed findings across raters, the low rate of adverse effects and the benefits reported across multiple areas of functioning indicate micronutrients may be a favourable option for some children, particularly those with both ADHD and emotional dysregulation.

Through this lens, this review documents the current exploration of emotional labor in academia, specifically in communication studies. While a paucity of literature on this topic exists, I explore how a neoliberal agenda creates an expectation for communication faculty to perform emotional labor (and how this expectation is greater compared with other fields), the ways in which emotional labor is differentially experienced for women, and how communication studies as a gendered field exacerbates expectations to perform such labor. Moreover, I highlight the shifting perception of the field and the related moves to expand emotional labor. Finally, I discuss ways to move forward in a neoliberal academia.","[{'authorId': '114929441', 'name': 'Brandi Lawless'}]",33.0,,58.0,Documenting a labor of love: emotional labor as academic labor,2018.0

Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using a hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers. Through a thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility.","[{'authorId': '22858671', 'name': 'M.

The experimental group received a psychoeducational intervention in 4 two-hour weekly sessions. Measures of resilience, coping strategies, protective factors, and symptomatology were administered pre- and postintervention to both groups. Results: Analyses indicated that the experimental group had significantly higher resilience scores, more effective coping strategies (ie, higher problem solving, lower avoidant), higher scores on protective factors (ie, positive affect, self-esteem, self-leadership), and lower scores on symptomatology (ie, depressive symptoms, negative affect, perceived stress) postintervention than did the wait-list control group.

Fibromyalgia symptoms are not restricted to pain. Besides the painful setting, these patients often complain of fatigue, sleep disturbances, morning stiffness, and paresthesia on the extremities, subjective edema sensations and cognitive disturbances. Many patients experience cognitive dysfunction known as ""fibrofog"" which may be characterized by impaired concentration. Cognitive symptoms in these patients may be exacerbated by the presence of depression, anxiety, sleep problems, endocrine disturbances, and pain. Association with other comorbidities is often found, contributing to the suffering and decline in quality of life of these patients. Among the most frequent comorbidities found, it can be mentioned depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome, myofascial syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome and nonspecific urethral syndrome (2). Various researches show that there were relation between chronic pain and cognitive dysfunction in FM patients. Managing chronic pain may take some cognitive effort and this may interfere with performance on cognitive tasks. This is important because even though FMS patients report cognitive symptoms, physicians and scientists must consider the possibility that because FM patients experience many symptoms, there may be a tendency to mistake normal, everyday lapses on cognition as something more serious (3).","[{'authorId': '32469929', 'name': 'E.

In addition, we attempted to explore the relationship between stressful work factors, work overload and disturbed interpersonal relationships, and the appearance of their symptoms. Methods Nurses received an anonymous three-part questionnaire including PTSS-10 and HADS inventories. Results In the case of general nurses the most prevalent symptoms were of anxiety (44%), followed by symptoms of depression (15%) and then posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (7%). Similarly, for intensive care unit (ICU) nurses anxiety symptoms were the most prevalent (28%), followed by symptoms of depression (15%) and PTSD (3%). We identified certain specific traumatic factors present in particular workplaces (care for dying patients and the bodies of the deceased, and participation in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, all found in general units, and care for potential organ donors in ICUs). General nurses were less satisfied with their job and their workload was high. It seems that in both workplaces, the occurrence of symptoms of anxiety best correlated with several estimated markers of high workload. Conclusion The study revealed a high incidence of symptoms of anxiety, especially in general nurses, and it pointed to the low incidence of symptoms of PTSD.

Objective: The aim of the present study was to analyse the role of the behavioural inhibition system (BIS), behavioural approach system (BAS) and experiential avoidance (EA) in pain adjustment (i.e. pain intensity, daily functioning and pain-related impairment) in patients with chronic pain and PTSS. Methods: A battery of instruments was administered to 388 chronic pain patients. The sample was divided into those with PTSS (n = 194) and those without PTSS (n =194). Results: Significant differences were found between groups in the BIS, EA, impairment and daily functioning. No differences were found between groups in the BAS. Structural equation modelling showed that the BIS and EA were associated with worse adjustment in the 194 patients with both chronic pain and PTSS. The BAS was associated with a lower level of pain and greater daily functioning. Conclusion: The findings provide evidence that BIS and BAS activation and EA play a role in adjustment to chronic pain in patients with concurrent PTSS. These results may help guide the development of psychological treatments for patients with both conditions.

Beyond intracortical effects, functional imaging as well as behavioral studies are suggesting additional tDCS‐driven alterations of subcortical areas, however, direct evidence for such effects is scarce. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortico‐subcortical functional networks by seed functional connectivity analysis of different striatal and thalamic regions to prove tDCS‐induced alterations of the cortico‐striato‐thalamic circuit. fMRI resting state data sets were acquired immediately before and after 10 min of bipolar tDCS during rest, with the anode/cathode placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the cathode/anode over the contralateral frontopolar cortex. To control for possible placebo effects, an additional sham stimulation session was carried out. Functional coupling between the left thalamus and the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) significantly increased following anodal stimulation over M1. Additionally, functional connectivity between the left caudate nucleus and parietal association cortices was significantly strengthened. In contrast, cathodal tDCS over M1 decreased functional coupling between left M1 and contralateral putamen. In summary, in this study, we show for the first time that tDCS modulates functional connectivity of cortico‐striatal and thalamo‐cortical circuits. Here we highlight that anodal tDCS over M1 is capable of modulating elements of the cortico‐striato‐thalamo‐cortical functional motor circuit.

Self-compassion describes a positive and caring attitude of a person toward her- or himself in the face of failures and individual shortcomings. As a result of this caring attitude, individuals high in self-compassion are assumed to experience higher individual well-being. The present meta-analysis examines the relationship between self-compassion and different forms of well-being.


METHOD
The authors combined k = 79 samples, with an overall sample size of N = 16,416, and analyzed the central tendencies of effect sizes (Pearson correlation coefficients) with a random-effect model.


RESULTS
We found an overall magnitude of the relationship between self-compassion and well-being of r = .47. The relationship was stronger for cognitive and psychological well-being compared to affective well-being. Sample characteristics and self-esteem were tested as potential moderators. In addition, a subsample of studies indicated a causal effect of self-compassion on well-being.


CONCLUSIONS
The results clearly highlight the importance of self-compassion for individuals' well-being. Future research should further investigate the relationship between self-compassion and the different forms of well-being, and focus on the examination of possible additional moderators.","[{'authorId': '7353043', 'name': 'Ulli Zessin'}, {'authorId': '118391006', 'name': 'O.

The reliability of composite scores is of interest in a wide variety of contexts due to their widespread use and applicability to many disciplines. The psychometric literature has devoted considerable time to discussing how to best estimate the population reliability value. However, all point estimates of a reliability coefficient fail to convey the uncertainty associated with the estimate as it estimates the population value. Correspondingly, a confidence interval is recommended to convey the uncertainty with which the population value of the reliability coefficient has been estimated. However, many confidence interval methods for bracketing the population reliability coefficient exist and it is not clear which method is most appropriate in general or in a variety of specific circumstances. We evaluate these confidence interval methods for 4 reliability coefficients (coefficient alpha, coefficient omega, hierarchical omega, and categorical omega) under a variety of conditions with 3 large-scale Monte Carlo simulation studies. Our findings lead us to generally recommend bootstrap confidence intervals for hierarchical omega for continuous items and categorical omega for categorical items. All of the methods we discuss are implemented in the freely available R language and environment via the MBESS package.","[{'authorId': '145894204', 'name': 'Ken Kelley'}, {'authorId': '46684261', 'name': 'Sunthud Pornprasertmanit'}]",175.0,,80.0,"Confidence intervals for population reliability coefficients: Evaluation of methods, recommendations, and software for composite measures.",2016.0
a3dff66b60240d1515cb92fe72e3a415bd8aafa6,"This paper examines cognitive beliefs and affect influencing one's intention to continue using (continuance) information systems (IS). Expectation-confirmation theory is adapted from the consumer behavior literature and integrated with theoretical and empirical findings from prior IS usage research to theorize a model of IS continuance. Five research hypotheses derived from this model are empirically validated using a field survey of online banking users. The results suggest that users' continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with IS use and perceived usefulness of continued IS use. User satisfaction, in turn, is influenced by their confirmation of expectation from prior IS use and perceived usefulness. Post-acceptance perceived usefulness is influenced by users' confirmation level. This study draws attention to the substantive differences between acceptance and continuance behaviors, theorizes and validates one of the earliest theoretical models of IS continuance, integrates confirmation and user satisfaction constructs within our current understanding of IS use, conceptualizes and creates an initial scale for measuring IS continuance, and offers an initial explanation for the acceptance-discontinuance anomaly.","[{'authorId': '1772304', 'name': 'Anol Bhattacherjee'}]",6367.0,,56.0,Understanding Information Systems Continuance: An Expectation-Confirmation Model,2001.0

Several studies have suggested that the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and some psychopathological disorders is mediated by experiential avoidance, an affect‐related regulatory process that involves unwillingness to endure private experiences.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of anxiety sensitivity and experiential avoidance as dispositional variables in pain fear‐avoidance. Two alternative hypothetical models were tested: one in which anxiety sensitivity and experiential avoidance would be independently associated with pain fear‐avoidance; and second, one in which experiential avoidance would mediate the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and pain fear‐avoidance.","[{'authorId': '144362030', 'name': 'R.

This study uses customer value theory to examine brand engagement of users in terms of promoting companies in the context of Korean SNS marketing. This study identifies the antecedents of brand engagement based on customer value theory. Our findings show the significance of three factors of SNS marketing, namely, price discount, relationship support, and convenience, on brand engagement.

Hu and Bentler (1999) proposed a more rigorous approach to evaluating decision rules based on GOF indexes and, on this basis, proposed new and more stringent cutoff values for many indexes. This article discusses potential problems underlying the hypothesis-testing rationale of their research, which is more appropriate to testing statistical significance than evaluating GOF. Many of their misspecified models resulted in a fit that should have been deemed acceptable according to even their new, more demanding criteria. Hence, rejection of these acceptable-misspecified models should have constituted a Type 1 error (incorrect rejection of an ""acceptable"" model), leading to the seemingly paradoxical results whereby the probability of correctly rejecting misspecified models decreased substantially with increasing N. In contrast to the application of cutoff values to evaluate each solution in isolation, all the GOF indexes were more effective at identifying differences in misspecification based on nested models. Whereas Hu and Bentler (1999) offered cautions about the use of GOF indexes, current practice seems to have incorporated their new guidelines without sufficient attention to the limitations noted by Hu and Bentler (1999).","[{'authorId': '35098092', 'name': 'H.

The terms thoughts, feelings, and behaviors include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be imagined or implied suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations. In general, social psychologists have a preference for laboratory-based, empirical findings. Social psychology theories tend to be specific and focused, rather than global and general. Social psychology is an interdisciplinary domain that bridges the gap between psychology and sociology. During the years immediately following World War II, there was frequent collaboration between psychologists and sociologists.[2] However, the two disciplines have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists focusing on ""macro variables"" (e.g., social structure) to a much greater extent. Nevertheless, sociological approaches to social psychology remain an important counterpart to psychological research in this area. In addition to the split between psychology and sociology, there has been a somewhat less pronounced difference in emphasis between American social psychologists and European social psychologists. As a broad generalization, American researchers traditionally have focused more on the individual, whereas Europeans have paid more attention to group level phenomena (see group dynamics).[3]","[{'authorId': '2053554703', 'name': 'M.

Physicians have anecdotally reported that children with simple craniosynostosis often seem to have a higher proportion of learning disabilities and cognitive problems than their nonafflicted peers. These problems have not been systematically studied, however. This study examined the long-term neuropsychological effects of single-suture sagittal craniosynostosis on selected aspects of neurological development. It did so by going beyond global measures of mental function (intelligence quotient) in an attempt to assess the incidence of subtle neuropsychological sequelae. Retrospective inspection of the Yale Department of Neurosurgery records between 1980 and 1990 was used to identify study subjects born with nonsyndromic sagittal suture craniosynostosis who were between 6 and 16 years of age at the time of the study. Of the 16 study subjects born with sagittal synostosis, which is thought to be among the most benign of the single-suture craniosynostoses, this study found that 50% had a reading and/or spelling learning disability. Although children with single-suture sagittal craniosynostosis fall within the normal range for intelligence, there is a significantly higher incidence of learning disabilities in this group than in the general population.","[{'authorId': '3522524', 'name': 'Sheela N.

Additionally, very little data exist on the classification of dissociation, namely psychoform and somatoform, in anorexia nervosa (AN). This review aimed to provide an updated view on the literature about dissociation in AN, with a focus on AN subtypes (i.e., restricter and binge-purging) as well as dissociation type (i.e., psychoform and somatoform), when available. We screened 304 studies and, after title and abstract selection and full-text reading, 29 of them were included in the review. Most of the studies investigated psychoform dissociation, while just 4 publications considered somatoform dissociation. Dissociation resulted to be present in AN more than in healthy controls and in individuals with other psychiatric disorders, and it was related mostly to the binge-purging subtype of AN. Moreover, dissociation was linked with traumatic events, self-harm, and negative treatment outcomes, especially in patients affected by the binge-purging subtype of AN. However, results on these topics are scarce and partially discordant. The methodological assessment we performed revealed an overall fair quality of the included studies, although several flaws emerged as well. The present review reported on one hand the relevance of dissociation in AN, but on the other hand the need to stimulate the scientific debate on a) a deeper investigation of somatoform dissociation in AN, and b) the relationship between dissociation and both clinical severity and treatment response/resistance in AN.","[{'authorId': '1939982218', 'name': 'Longo Paola'}, {'authorId': '1939989406', 'name': 'P.

To the most common consequences, the authors add addiction of the teenager to the Internet. This addiction is related to many negative physical and mental problems, including depression, substance abuse and social isolation. Methods: In the study, SSBS (Student School Burnout Scale) was used to measure the level of burnout, and the level of Internet addiction was measured using PUI (Internet Addiction Test). The research was carried out among 230 individuals aged 17–20 years. Results: The results of the research showed that higher level of school burnout is related to higher Internet addiction indicators, and connection was stronger in the male group. Gender significantly predicted Internet addiction and moderated the link between school burnout and Internet addiction. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses confirmed different predictors of Internet addiction for male and female students. However, for both groups, higher burnout due to parents was a significant predictor of Internet addiction (IA). Discussion: Internet addiction was predicted by school burnout, appearing as a result of parental pressure for high school achievements. In addition, school burnout and school-related characteristics have greater prediction power of Internet addiction and its indicators in a male group.","[{'authorId': '7461730', 'name': 'K.

This research study aimed to investigate how social media marketing application moderates the association between corporate social responsibility and sustainable performance of the firms located in Multan Division, Pakistan. This study applied a simple random sampling approach to execute this research, and the authors sent a questionnaire with an invitation letter and informed consent form to 752 respondents. Based on 548 valid responses from the targeted population, the first step was to screen and analyze data through Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS-V25) and the Smart PLS V-3.2.8. The results indicated that corporate social responsibility presented a positive impact on firms’ sustainable performance. The findings also revealed that social media marketing tools moderated the relationship between CSR and sustainable production of business firms. As a final point, the study only included respondents from Multan Division, therefore, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other Pakistani business firms. The implications of this study may provide further directions for researchers and academicians to consider the larger sample size and the addition of new variables in other regions worldwide. The findings are useful for filling the gap between the relationship of environmental effects, CSR, and social media marketing application to calculate the sustainable performance of business firms.","[{'authorId': '46487319', 'name': 'Jaffar Abbas'}, {'authorId': '48672432', 'name': 'S.

The main aim of the present study was to investigate for the first time the relationship between alexithymia and coping strategies on the one hand, and alexithymia and perceived social support on the other, in a sample of FM patients. To reach this aim, 153 FM patients completed a battery of tests assessing coping strategies, perceived social support, alexithymia, psychological distress and pain intensity. Four regression analyses were performed to assess whether alexithymia was still a significant predictor of coping strategies and perceived social support, after controlling for psychological distress. High levels of both psychological distress and alexithymia were found in our sample of FM patients. Regarding coping strategies, FM patients reported higher scores on problem-focused coping, with respect to the other two coping strategies. The regression analyses showed that the externally-oriented thinking factor of alexithymia significantly explained both problem- and emotion-focused coping, while the difficulty-describing feelings factor of alexithymia proved to be a significant predictor of perceived social support. Only the variance of dysfunctional coping ceased to be uniquely explained by alexithymia (difficulty identifying feelings factor), after controlling for psychological distress, particularly anxiety. These results highlight a negative relationship between alexithymia and both the use of effective coping strategies and the levels of perceived social support in FM patients. An adequate assessment of both alexithymia and psychological distress should therefore be included in clinical practice with these patients.","[{'authorId': '6072449', 'name': 'M.

In a meta-analysis of 203 independent samples (N = 186,440), we found support for a health impairment process and for a motivational process as mechanisms through which job demands and resources relate to safety outcomes. In particular, we found that job demands such as risks and hazards and complexity impair employees' health and positively relate to burnout. Likewise, we found support for job resources such as knowledge, autonomy, and a supportive environment motivating employees and positively relating to engagement. Job demands were found to hinder an employee with a negative relationship to engagement, whereas job resources were found to negatively relate to burnout. Finally, we found that burnout was negatively related to working safely but that engagement motivated employees and was positively related to working safely. Across industries, risks and hazards was the most consistent job demand and a supportive environment was the most consistent job resource in terms of explaining variance in burnout, engagement, and safety outcomes. The type of job demand that explained the most variance differed by industry, whereas a supportive environment remained consistent in explaining the most variance in all industries.","[{'authorId': '34312385', 'name': 'J.

Emotional neglect can be characterized as cold or critical parenting and denotes a parent intentionally or unintentionally overlooking the signs that a child needs comfort or attention and ignoring its emotional needs. Parental emotional neglect is widely posited as an antecedent of anxiety disorder, with attachment researchers arguing for anxious-ambivalent attachment style as a mediating factor.


METHOD
Childhood experience of neglect and abuse, including antipathy (cold, critical parenting), attachment styles, and anxiety disorders were assessed in a high-risk sample of 160 adolescents and young adults by means of interview measures.


RESULTS
Antipathy was associated with 12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders in the sample. Anxious-ambivalent attachment scores statistically mediated the relationship between antipathy and anxiety disorders.


CONCLUSIONS
Clinicians treating anxiety disorders in youths need to consider that emotional neglect in childhood in the form of antipathy could lead to anxious-ambivalent internal working models operating around fear of rejection and fear of separation.","[{'authorId': '5955962', 'name': 'A.

The purpose of the present study was to analyze THA and TKA case volumes in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The Premier Healthcare Database was utilized to identify adults undergoing primary elective THA or TKA from January 2017 to December 2020. The National Inpatient Sample was cross-referenced to provide nationwide representative sampling weights. Patients undergoing revision total joint arthroplasty (TJA) or non-elective surgery were excluded. Two quantitative models were created from both databases to estimate TJA case volume in 2020. Descriptive statistics were utilized to report monthly changes in elective TJA utilization throughout 2020. Univariate analyses were performed to compare differences between subgroups. Results: From 2017 to 2019, it was estimated that 1,006,000 elective inpatient TJAs (64.2% TKA and 35.8% THA) were performed annually. In 2020, an estimated 526,000 to 538,000 cases (62.0% TKA and 38.0% THA) were performed, representing a 46.5% to 47.7% decrease in nationwide volume from the prior 3-year average. Moreover, the elective TJA case volume for April 2020 was 1.9% of the average for that month from 2017 through 2019. Subsequently, case volumes for May and June increased compared with the volumes for those months from 2017 through 2019. There was then a decrease in cases for July, corresponding with the “second wave” of COVID-19, followed by an additional steady monthly decline through December, corresponding with the “third wave.” Finally, the elective TJA cases for December 2020 represented only 41.0% of the average case volume for that month from 2017 through 2019. Conclusions: In the midst of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 526,000 to 538,000 elective inpatient TJA cases were performed, representing a 46.5% to 47.7% decrease compared with the 3 previous years.

Results confirm the double identity of the online consumer as a shopper and a computer user because both shopping enjoyment and perceived usefulness of the site strongly predict intention to return.

The ERQ has two subscales measuring an individual’s use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression as emotion regulation strategies. A random non-referred sample of parents of 1433 children aged 10-13 years completed the ERQ and other questions targeting the family functioning and couple adjustment (Warmth/Conflict in the family; Dyadic Adjustment Scale-short form) and parental strategies (Parent Practices Interview). The results indicated adequate internal consistencies (Cronbach’s alpha) of the two subscales (cognitive reappraisal .81; expressive suppression .73). Confirmatory factor analysis resulted in close to acceptable fit (RMSEA = 0.089; CFI = 0.912; GFI = 0.93). Norms are presented as percentiles for mothers and fathers. The ERQ cognitive reappraisal scale correlated positively with marital adjustment (DAS), family warmth, appropriate discipline (PPI), and negatively with harsh discipline (PPI). The ERQ expressive suppression subscale was negatively correlated with marital satisfaction (DAS) and family warmth, and positively with harsh discipline (PPI). To conclude, this study showed the adequate reliability and construct validity of the ERQ in a large sample of Swedish parents.

The current study compared two perspectives of emotional labor as predictors of burnout beyond the effects of negative affectivity: job-focused emotional labor (work demands regarding emotion expression) and employee-focused emotional labor (regulation of feelings and emotional expression). Significant differences existed in the emotional demands reported by five occupational groupings. The use of surface-level emotional labor, or faking, predicted depersonalization beyond the work demands. Perceiving the demand to display positive emotions and using deep-level regulation were associated with a heightened sense of personal accomplishment, suggesting positive benefits to this aspect of work. These findings suggest new antecedents of employee burnout and clarify the emotional labor literature by comparing different conceptualizations of this concept.","[{'authorId': '3152475', 'name': 'C.

The purpose of this study was to describe the development of the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), a new instrument for the assessment of diabetes-related emotional distress, based on four independent patient samples.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In consultation with patients and professionals from multiple disciplines, a preliminary scale of 28 items was developed, based a priori on four distress-related domains: emotional burden subscale, physician-related distress subscale, regimen-related distress subscale, and diabetes-related interpersonal distress. The new instrument was included in a larger battery of questionnaires used in diabetes studies at four diverse sites: waiting room at a primary care clinic (n = 200), waiting room at a diabetes specialty clinic (n = 179), a diabetes management study program (n = 167), and an ongoing diabetes management program (n = 158).


RESULTS
Exploratory factor analyses revealed four factors consistent across sites (involving 17 of the 28 items) that matched the critical content domains identified earlier. The correlation between the 28-item and 17-item scales was very high (r = 0.99). The mean correlation between the 17-item total score (DDS) and the four subscales was high (r = 0.82), but the pattern of interscale correlations suggested that the subscales, although not totally independent, tapped into relatively different areas of diabetes-related distress. Internal reliability of the DDS and the four subscales was adequate (alpha > 0.87), and validity coefficients yielded significant linkages with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, meal planning, exercise, and total cholesterol. Insulin users evidenced the highest mean DDS total scores, whereas diet-controlled subjects displayed the lowest scores (P < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
The DDS has a consistent, generalizable factor structure and good internal reliability and validity across four different clinical sites. The new instrument may serve as a valuable measure of diabetes-related emotional distress for use in research and clinical practice.","[{'authorId': '6755157', 'name': 'W.

a8feab0217ce06866bc964a54868f5bcb85a0150,"Introduction While many areas in education are experiencing teacher shortages (McKnab, 1995; Merrow, 1999), the retention of special education teachers in particular is a critical concern in many schools across the nation. Even prior to the developing national teacher shortage, educators were voicing concerns about higher burnout and/or teacher attrition rates in special education as compared to general education (National Association of State Directors of Special Education, 1990). Many anticipate that the national teacher shortage may only exacerbate this growing need for special educators. McKnab (1995), for example, estimated the annual attrition rate for special education teachers as between 9% and 10%, as compared to 6% among educators in other areas. More recently, a national survey of over 1,000 special educators conducted by the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) concluded: ""Poor teacher working conditions contribute to the high rate of special educators leaving the field, teacher burnout, and substandard quality of education for students with special needs"" (CEC, 1998). Clearly, hidden within the growing national teacher shortage in all certification areas, the ongoing burnout of special education teachers has become an important liability in the provision of appropriate educational services to students with disabilities. The purpose of this paper is to describe the burnout/teacher retention problem in the field of special education, within the context of today's classrooms. Further we will synthesize the available information in order to suggest steps that may be undertaken to ameliorate this problem. First, a synthesis of research on teacher burnout within special education is presented. Next, several specific and malleable factors are explored more completely--teacher stress and mentoring for new teachers. Finally, suggestions for increasing retention of teachers in special education are presented. Research has both documented higher turnover among special education teachers, and suggested a number of reasons for this phenomenon (Boe, Bobbit, Cook, Whitener, & Weber, 1997; Brownell, Smith, McNellis, & Miller, 1997; McKnab, 1995; Singh & Billingsley, 1996). Table I presents a synopsis of the research that has been published since 1995. Many of these studies are recent enough to reflect the evolving nature of special education instruction, such as the recent expectations for inclusive instruction, the changes in disciplinary tactics as reflected in the recently mandated behavioral intervention plans, and the ever-increasing paperwork load on special education teachers. As one example of this research effort, Boe, Bobbit, and Cook (1997) conducted a study using a national survey done by the National Center for Educational Statistics in 1987/1988. Surveys from 4, 812 public school teachers were used to provide data that tracked teacher transfers across schools, school districts, state boundaries, public and private sectors, teaching specializations, and out of the teaching profession. Also, the educators were given a follow-up survey as a longitudinal component that was conducted during the 1988-1989 school year. The results indicated that the attrition rate of 20% for special education teachers was higher than for general educators (attrition rate of 13%) in 1987-88. Of the teachers who left education, 12% of the special education teachers, versus 7% of the general education teachers transferred to a different school. Also, more special education teachers (8%) than general educators (6%) left public school teaching altogether. With these data on turnover and burnout in special education, one may well inquire as to the reasons for the higher attrition rates among special educators. Brownell, Smith, McNellis, and Miller (1997), addressed that issue in a study using 93 randomly selected Florida teachers who did not return to their special education teaching positions after the 1992-93 school year. …","[{'authorId': '48360746', 'name': 'Cecil Fore'}, {'authorId': '90538513', 'name': 'Christopher Martin'}, {'authorId': '49246248', 'name': 'W.

Occupational burnout as a complex syndrome is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and lower professional efficacy. Moreover, the growing amount of research on the neural correlates of burnout broadens the existing knowledge on the mechanisms underlying this syndrome. Aim of the Study The aim of the study is to explore possible differences in brain activity between burnout and nonburnout employees. Frequency-specific EEG power analyses in a resting-state condition in burnout subjects and controls are presented. Materials and Methods Burnout employees (N=46; 19 men) were matched with the control group (N=49; 19 men; mean age: 36.14 years, SD=7.89). The Maslach Burnout Inventory–General Survey (MBI-GS) and the Areas of Worklife Survey (AWS) scale were used to measure burnout symptoms and work conditions, respectively. A 256-channel EEG (EGI System 300) was used to collect psychophysiological data. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed with condition (eyes-open vs. eyes-closed) and region (6 levels: extracted scalp regions) factors; burnout (2 levels: burnout vs. no burnout) was the grouping factor. Results A significant difference was observed only in the alpha frequency band: the burnout group revealed significantly lower alpha power in the eyes-open condition compared to the controls (p<0.05). The correlation analysis revealed that gender may significantly change the pattern of relations between EEG spectral characteristics and burnout symptoms. Conclusions Reduced alpha power in burnout individuals suggests cortical hyperactivity and may be related to greater mental effort and the possible development of compensatory mechanisms by burnout subjects.","[{'authorId': '4604659', 'name': 'Krystyna Golonka'}, {'authorId': '152434224', 'name': 'M.

In the context of a longitudinal study beginning when the children were 5 years old and ending when they were 8 years old, a theoretical model and path analytic models are presented that relate parental meta-emotion philosophy to parenting, to child regulatory physiology, to emotion regulation abilities in the child, and to child outcomes in middle childhood. The importance of parenting practices for children's long-term psychological adjustment has been a central tenet in developmental and family psychology. In this article, we introduce a new concept of parenting that we call parental meta-emotion philosophy, which refers to an organized set of feelings and thoughts about one's own emotions and one's children's emotions. We use the term meta-emotion broadly to encompass both feelings and thoughts about emotion, rather than in the more narrow sense of one's feelings about feelings (e.g., feeling guilty about being angry). The notion we have in mind parallels metacognition, which refers to the executive functions of cognition (Allen & Armour, 1993; Bvinelli, 1993; Flavell, 1979; Fodor, 1992; Olson & Astington, 1993).

Because of concerns over self-report measurement, there have been recent calls to collect ratings of employees' CWB from their supervisors or coworkers (i.e., other-raters) as alternatives or supplements to self-ratings. However, little is still known about the degree to which other-ratings of CWB capture unique and valid incremental variance beyond self-report CWB. The present meta-analysis investigates a number of key issues regarding the incremental contribution of other-reports of CWB. First, self- and other-ratings of CWB were moderately to strongly correlated with each other. Second, with some notable exceptions, self- and other-report CWB exhibited very similar patterns and magnitudes of relationships with a set of common correlates. Third, self-raters reported engaging in more CWB than other-raters reported them engaging in, suggesting other-ratings capture a narrower subset of CWBs. Fourth, other-report CWB generally accounted for little incremental variance in the common correlates beyond self-report CWB. Although many have viewed self-reports of CWB with skepticism, the results of this meta-analysis support their use in most CWB research as a viable alternative to other-reports.","[{'authorId': '145045213', 'name': 'Christopher M.

To examine psychometric properties of the Self-Care Inventory-revised (SCI-R), a self-report measure of perceived adherence to diabetes self-care recommendations, among adults with diabetes.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We used three data sets of adult type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients to examine psychometric properties of the SCI-R. Principal component and factor analyses examined whether a general factor or common factors were present. Associations with measures of theoretically related concepts were examined to assess SCI-R concurrent and convergent validity. Internal reliability coefficients were calculated. Responsiveness was assessed using paired t tests, effect size, and Guyatt's statistic for type 1 patients who completed psychoeducation.


RESULTS
Principal component and factor analyses identified a general factor but no consistent common factors. Internal consistency of the SCI-R was alpha = 0.87. Correlation with a measure of frequency of diabetes self-care behaviors was r = 0.63, providing evidence for SCI-R concurrent validity. The SCI-R correlated with diabetes-related distress (r = -0.36), self-esteem (r = 0.25), self-efficacy (r = 0.47), depression (r = -0.22), anxiety (r = -0.24), and HbA(1c) (r = -0.37), supporting construct validity. Responsiveness analyses showed SCI-R scores improved with diabetes psychoeducation with a medium effect size of 0.62 and a Guyatt's statistic of 0.85.

Intense and frequent negative affect during this period has been hypothesized to explain the increased rates of affective disorders, suicide, and accidental death during this time of life. Yet some teens emerge from adolescence with minimal turmoil. We provide a neurobiological model of adolescence that proposes an imbalance in the development of subcortical limbic (e.g., amygdala) relative to prefrontal cortical regions as a potential mechanism for heightened emotionality during this period. Empirical support for this model is provided from recent behavioral and human imaging studies on the development of emotion regulation. We then provide examples of environmental factors that may exacerbate imbalances in amygdala-ventrofrontal function increasing risk for anxiety related behaviors. Finally we present data from human and mouse studies to illustrate how genetic factors may enhance or diminish this risk.

Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) show an impairment in the recognition and expression of emotions, as well as an increased sensitivity to being socially excluded, and rigid maladaptive schemas. The Cyberball paradigm is a virtual ball-toss game that can simulate social exclusion and inclusion. Our aim is to evaluate how cognitive schemas can influence the perception and the evaluation of the experiences of social inclusion/exclusion.


METHODS
Thirty-two AN patients and 34 healthy controls completed a psychological evaluation and were randomly assigned to exclusion or overinclusion paradigm of the Cyberball task.


RESULTS
Patients with AN showed a significantly higher level of maladaptive schemas as well as higher sensitivity to being ostracized by peers in comparison with healthy controls. Regression analyses identified specific significant relation between being ostracized and dependence/incompetence, negativity/pessimism, and self-sacrifice.


DISCUSSION
Our findings provide evidence that patients with AN may be ineffective in expressing their mood in exclusive and overinclusive social situations. Specific cognitive/temperamental schemas might play a role in the way people communicate their feelings, and they could be considered targets for psychotherapy interventions to improve social interpretation and emotional recognition/communication.","[{'authorId': '5598862', 'name': 'P.

To evaluate the predictive values of psychiatric symptoms for the occurrence of Internet addiction and to determine the sex differences in the predictive value of psychiatric symptoms for the occurrence of Internet addiction in adolescents.


DESIGN
Internet addiction, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, social phobia, and hostility were assessed by self-reported questionnaires. Participants were then invited to be assessed for Internet addiction 6, 12, and 24 months later (the second, third, and fourth assessments, respectively).


SETTING
Ten junior high schools in southern Taiwan.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 2293 (1179 boys and 1114 girls) adolescents participated in the initial investigation.


MAIN EXPOSURE
The course of time.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Internet addiction as assessed using the Chen Internet Addiction Scale.


RESULTS
Depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, social phobia, and hostility were found to predict the occurrence of Internet addiction in the 2-year follow-up, and hostility and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were the most significant predictors of Internet addiction in male and female adolescents, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, hostility, depression, and social phobia should be detected early on and intervention carried out to prevent Internet addiction in adolescents. Also, sex differences in psychiatric comorbidity should be taken into consideration when developing prevention and intervention strategies for Internet addiction.","[{'authorId': '145825240', 'name': 'C.

Previous studies have explored the relationship between alexithymia and emotional distress in this disease. Yet, the additional link with factors of pain appraisal is unknown. This study examined the moderating effect of alexithymia in the relationship between emotional distress and pain appraisal in 97 FM women. A control group of 100 healthy women also participated in the study. All participants completed several self-reports about pain experience, sleep quality, impairment, emotional distress, pain appraisal, and alexithymia. FM women showed significantly more difficulty in identifying and describing feelings, but less externally oriented thinking than healthy women. In the clinical group, difficulty in identifying feelings and difficulty in describing feelings significantly correlated with lower sleep quality, higher anxiety and depression, and increased pain catastrophizing and fear of pain. Difficulty in describing feelings significantly correlated with higher pain experience and vigilance to pain. Externally oriented thinking was not correlated with any of the clinical variables. Difficulty in identifying feelings moderated the relationship between anxiety and pain catastrophizing, and difficulty in describing feelings moderated the relationship between anxiety and fear of pain. Implications of the findings for the optimization of care of FM patients are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2157334307', 'name': 'M. P. Martínez'}, {'authorId': '150029893', 'name': 'A. I.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of emotional regulation training on depression, anxiety and stress, and professional quality of life for intensive and critical care nurses. In this experimental comparison trial, 60 intensive and critical care nurses were randomly assigned to treatment and wait-list control groups. The treatment group received six sessions of emotional regulation training, while the wait-list control group received no treatment. Outcome measures were: the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; and the Professional Quality of Life Scale in a pre-post design. The treatment group demonstrated greater improvements in burnout and compassion satisfaction compared with the wait-list control group. No significant reduction in compassion fatigue was found compared with controls. Some cognitive coping strategies improved in the treatment group compared with controls, with greater reductions in depression, anxiety, and stress. This study indicates the benefits of implementing emotional regulation training programs to improve psychological well-being and professional quality of life for intensive and critical care nurses.","[{'authorId': '113213603', 'name': 'Hamid Kharatzadeh'}, {'authorId': '145530078', 'name': 'M.

a9b94eb7fb11a24bb9e932f983c0c99c825fe7c5,"Background The Internet is used increasingly for both suicide research and prevention. To optimize online assessment of suicidal patients, there is a need for short, good-quality tools to assess elevated risk of future suicidal behavior. Computer adaptive testing (CAT) can be used to reduce response burden and improve accuracy, and make the available pencil-and-paper tools more appropriate for online administration. Objective The aim was to test whether an item response–based computer adaptive simulation can be used to reduce the length of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). Methods The data used for our simulation was obtained from a large multicenter trial from The Netherlands: the Professionals in Training to STOP suicide (PITSTOP suicide) study. We applied a principal components analysis (PCA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a graded response model (GRM), and simulated a CAT. Results The scores of 505 patients were analyzed. Psychometric analyses showed the questionnaire to be unidimensional with good internal consistency. The computer adaptive simulation showed that for the estimation of elevation of risk of future suicidal behavior 4 items (instead of the full 19) were sufficient, on average. Conclusions This study demonstrated that CAT can be applied successfully to reduce the length of the Dutch version of the BSS. We argue that the use of CAT can improve the accuracy and the response burden when assessing the risk of future suicidal behavior online. Because CAT can be daunting for clinicians and applied scientists, we offer a concrete example of our computer adaptive simulation of the Dutch version of the BSS at the end of the paper.","[{'authorId': '4453598', 'name': 'D.

a9bc913aea233223d740061a642cf0a476ac4ea9,"Background: Disorders of consciousness are challenging to diagnose, with inconsistent behavioral responses, motor and cognitive disabilities, leading to approximately 40% misdiagnoses. Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the complexity of the heart-brain two-way dynamic interactions. HRV entropy analysis quantifies the unpredictability and complexity of the heart rate beats intervals. We here investigate the complexity index (CI), a score of HRV complexity by aggregating the non-linear multi-scale entropies over a range of time scales, and its discriminative power in chronic patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS), and its relation to brain functional connectivity. Methods: We investigated the CI in short (CIs) and long (CIl) time scales in 14 UWS and 16 MCS sedated. CI for MCS and UWS groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney exact test. Spearman's correlation tests were conducted between the Coma Recovery Scale-revised (CRS-R) and both CI. Discriminative power of both CI was assessed with One-R machine learning model. Correlation between CI and brain connectivity (detected with functional magnetic resonance imagery using seed-based and hypothesis-free intrinsic connectivity) was investigated using a linear regression in a subgroup of 10 UWS and 11 MCS patients with sufficient image quality. Results: Higher CIs and CIl values were observed in MCS compared to UWS. Positive correlations were found between CRS-R and both CI. The One-R classifier selected CIl as the best discriminator between UWS and MCS with 90% accuracy, 7% false positive and 13% false negative rates after a 10-fold cross-validation test. Positive correlations were observed between both CI and the recovery of functional connectivity of brain areas belonging to the central autonomic networks (CAN). Conclusion: CI of MCS compared to UWS patients has high discriminative power and low false negative rate at one third of the estimated human assessors' misdiagnosis, providing an easy, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tool. CI reflects functional connectivity changes in the CAN, suggesting that CI can provide an indirect way to screen and monitor connectivity changes in this neural system. Future studies should assess the extent of CI's predictive power in a larger cohort of patients and prognostic power in acute patients.","[{'authorId': '1903176', 'name': 'F.

Es probable que la inferencia inmediata, al conocer estos datos, sea remitirse a la popularizada idea de que “la adolescencia es una edad muy difícil”. Al respecto, es necesario responder a esta idea indicando que, en cada uno de los periodos del ciclo vital, los seres humanos enfrentan retos significativos. No obstante, la adolescencia representa un periodo de grandes cambios y los adolescentes, “un grupo extraordinariamente diverso de personas” (5). En general, se ha convenido que la adolescencia ocurre en la segunda década de la vida, con inicio entre los 10 y los 13 años (representado por la pubertad), y que finaliza entre los 18 y los 25 años, momento que fluctúa de acuerdo con la diversidad cultural y las metas o tareas que se espera se hayan cumplido (5). Los cambios fisiológicos que tienen lugar en la adolescencia son ampliamente conocidos y suelen estar asociados con la maduración sexual. Sin embargo, es de resaltar el desarrollo psicológico, que tiene lugar en armoniosa articulación con el desarrollo físico y químico, y el ambiente en el que se encuentra la persona. A pesar de la inmadurez de su cerebro y las limitaciones que esto supone sobre el proceso de toma de decisiones, el adolescente se aventura en ellas a expensas de las consecuencias de una inmadura capacidad para controlar y planificar su comportamiento, producto de un proceso de desarrollo de la corteza prefrontal, que no ha alcanzado su culmen (6-7). Es de resaltar que la toma de decisiones es un proceso que se da sumamente despacio durante la adolescencia (8). Así que, ciertamente, este un periodo crítico del desarrollo en el que una persona cerebralmente inmadura transita entre la niñez y la adultez, en medio de numerosos retos que implican, entre otros, consolidar su personalidad, su identidad y su orientación sexual, desarrollarse moralmente, controlar sus impulsos, desarrollar y acogerse a ideologías, desarrollar el pensamiento abstracto, consolidar las relaciones con sus padres, hermanos y pares (9, 10).","[{'authorId': '90967564', 'name': 'Ximena Palacios'}]",19.0,,0.0,Adolescencia: ¿una etapa problemática del desarrollo humano?,2019.0

The conventional sample consisted of 1512 students from 11 Ukrainian universities, with a mean age of 20 years (M = 20.06, SD = 3.05) and 69% of whom were female. The cross-sectional online survey was disseminated through the most popular social media channels in Ukraine (i.e., Facebook, Viber, Telegram) and included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale to measure anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression. Data were collected from 14 May to 4 June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Ukraine. Among university students, 43% were engaged in PA ≥ 150 min weekly, 24% met the criteria of GAD, and 32% met the criteria of depression. More students were involved in PA before the COVID-19 outbreak than during the national lockdown. Students with anxiety and depression were almost two times less likely to engage in PA than their counterparts without mental health disorders. The inactive group had higher scores of anxiety and depression than the physically active group.

Given this situation, it is necessary to develop actions that permit us to regulate this harmful mental state and that are administered from within the school context. A descriptive and cross-sectional study is presented that pursues the objective of examining a structural equation model which brings together burnout and emotional regulation. The model assumes that students receive tutoring at school in order to tackle these types of problems. For this, the sample constituted a total of 569 students from the province of Granada (men = 52.3% (n = 298); women = 47.7% (n = 271)). Mean age was reported as 10.39 ± 0.95 years and the School Burnout Inventory (BMI) and the Emotional Regulation Scale were utilized as the principal instruments. As main findings it was observed that students who received one hour of weekly tutoring showed a positive relationship between expressive suppression as a strategy of emotional regulation, cynicism, and exhaustion as consequences of school burnout. In the same way, a direct association existed between burnout-related exhaustion and cognitive repair. Given that significant relationships could not be observed between these variables in students who do not receive tutoring, higher use of emotional regulation was confirmed amongst tutored students when faced with this negative mental state.","[{'authorId': '1400811678', 'name': 'Ramón Chacón-Cuberos'}, {'authorId': '1405053234', 'name': 'A.

Methods: To reach this aim, we performed an online longitudinal survey recruiting 1,330 participants at Time 1 (at the beginning of the lockdown) and 308 participants at Time 2 (few days before the end of the lockdown). All filled out a set of questionnaires: demographic data, University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale−18 items, and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale−21 items. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling in two steps and controlling for age. First, hypotheses were tested on cross-sectional data. Then, a cross-lagged panel analysis was performed on longitudinal data. Results: Models obtained a good fit and evidenced the predictive role of loneliness levels on the three outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress). Moreover, we found that emotion dysregulation levels partially mediated the longitudinal relationship between loneliness and both depression and stress but not between loneliness and anxiety levels.

Path analyses in Mplus were used to test mediation, for the whole sample as well as separately for participants scoring high versus low on depression, using multigroup analyses. Results Health threats and relational challenging stressful life events were associated with depressive symptoms, while loss was not. More frequent use of maladaptive strategies was related to more depressive symptoms. More frequent use of adaptive strategies was related to less depressive symptoms. Specific life events were associated with specific emotion regulation strategies. The relationship between challenging, stressful life events and depressive symptoms in the whole group was mediated by maladaptive strategies (self-blame, catastrophizing and rumination). No mediation effect was found for adaptive strategies. Conclusion The association between relational challenging, stressful life events and depressive symptoms was mediated by maladaptive, cognitive emotion regulation strategies.","[{'authorId': '6460358', 'name': 'Y.

aaceb99c31c55c37091440bdec74df9436858859,"Background Psychological distress increases across adolescence and has been associated with several important health outcomes with consequences that can extend into adulthood. One type of technological innovation that may serve as a unique intervention for youth experiencing psychological distress is the conversational agent, otherwise known as a chatbot. Further research is needed on the factors that may make mental health chatbots destined for adolescents more appealing and increase the likelihood that adolescents will use them. Objective The aim of this study was to assess adolescents’ emotional reactions and likelihood of responding to questions that could be posed by a mental health chatbot. Understanding adolescent preferences and factors that could increase adolescents’ likelihood of responding to chatbot questions could assist in future mental health chatbot design destined for youth. Methods We recruited 19 adolescents aged 14 to 17 years to participate in a study with a 2×2×3 within-subjects factorial design. Each participant was sequentially presented with 96 chatbot questions for a duration of 8 seconds per question. Following each presentation, participants were asked to indicate how likely they were to respond to the question, as well as their perceived affective reaction to the question. Demographic data were collected, and an informal debriefing was conducted with each participant. Results Participants were an average of 15.3 years old (SD 1.00) and mostly female (11/19, 58%). Logistic regressions showed that the presence of GIFs predicted perceived emotional valence (β=–.40, P<.001), such that questions without GIFs were associated with a negative perceived emotional valence. Question type predicted emotional valence, such that yes/no questions (β=–.23, P=.03) and open-ended questions (β=–.26, P=.01) were associated with a negative perceived emotional valence compared to multiple response choice questions. Question type also predicted the likelihood of response, such that yes/no questions were associated with a lower likelihood of response compared to multiple response choice questions (β=–.24, P=.03) and a higher likelihood of response compared to open-ended questions (β=.54, P<.001). Conclusions The findings of this study add to the rapidly growing field of teen-computer interaction and contribute to our understanding of adolescent user experience in their interactions with a mental health chatbot. The insights gained from this study may be of assistance to developers and designers of mental health chatbots.","[{'authorId': '2056503033', 'name': 'Audrey Mariamo'}, {'authorId': '6900882', 'name': 'C.

ab2a2c436fc0c43d069749154e32cbcccae7ee2a,"Over the past 30 years, conservation of resources (COR) theory has become one of the most widely cited theories in organizational psychology and organizational behavior. COR theory has been adopted across the many areas of the stress spectrum, from burnout to traumatic stress. Further attesting to the theory's centrality, COR theory is largely the basis for the more work-specific leading theory of organizational stress, namely the job demands-resources model. One of the major advantages of COR theory is its ability to make a wide range of specific hypotheses that are much broader than those offered by theories that focus on a single central resource, such as control, or that speak about resources in general. In this article, we will revisit the principles and corollaries of COR theory that inform those more specific hypotheses and will review research in organizational behavior that has relied on the theory.","[{'authorId': '3475315', 'name': 'S.

Although normally conceived as a property of communities, the reciprocal relationship between community involvement and trust in others is a demonstration of social capital in individual behavior and attitudes. Hypotheses: Variation in social capital can be explained by citizens' psychological involvement with their communities, cognitive abilities, economic resources, and general life satisfaction. This variation affects citizens' confidence in national institutions, beyond specific controls for measures of actual performance. Methods: We analyze the pooled General Social Surveys from 1972 to 1994 in a latent variables framework incorporating aggregate contextual data. Results: Civic engagement and interpersonal trust are in a tight reciprocal relationship, where the connection is stronger from participation to interpersonal trust, rather than the reverse.","[{'authorId': '145285845', 'name': 'John M.

Although emotion regulation and eating regulation problems have both been linked to obesity in previous studies, there is little research examining the link between the two, particularly among children. Methods: A total of 782 rural second graders (49% girls, 20% American Indian) were followed longitudinally through third grade. During both data collection points, children participated in face-to-face interviews at school using the Children's Emotion Management Scales and the revised Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Results: Correlational analyses revealed that children's emotion regulation was significantly related to both external and emotional eating within and across grades, with reactivity appearing to be more consistently related to eating regulation than was inhibition. Regression analyses showed that second to third grade increases in external and emotional eating were predicted by increases in reactivity to anger and reactivity to worry. Conclusions: Given the established link in previous research between poor behavioral regulation and obesity in children, findings from this study linking child emotional reactivity and emotional and external eating (both forms of behavior dysregulation) are important in informing prevention and treatment programs. Based on these findings, targeting child emotion regulation in addition to behavior regulation skills as part of prevention and intervention programs may improve program effectiveness.","[{'authorId': '4253981', 'name': 'Amanda W Harrist'}, {'authorId': '1398301817', 'name': 'L.

Method: Using longitudinal data collected on 321 Chinese primary care patients 65 years of age and older, the authors investigated the reciprocal relationship between fear of falling and depression and examined whether functional disability and social functioning mediated the link between fear of falling and depression. Participants were recruited from three primary care units in Hong Kong. Subjects were assessed in Cantonese by two trained assessors with Minimum Data Set-Home Care twice over a period of one year. Results: Findings revealed that fear of falling at baseline significantly predicted depression at 12 month follow-up assessment after age, gender, marital status, education and depression at baseline were adjusted, but depression at baseline did not predict fear of falling at 12 months after fear of falling at baseline was adjusted. Moreover, social functioning mediated the impact of fear of falling on depression.

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reduced B vitamins as monotherapy in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who were also positive for at least 1 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism associated with depression and further test the hypothesis that reduced (metabolized) B vitamins will lower homocysteine in a majority of clinically responding patients.


METHODS
330 adult patients with MDD (DSM-5) and positive for either MTHFR C677T or A1298C polymorphism were enrolled in a trial conducted between August 1, 2014, and April 3, 2015. 160 patients received placebo, while 170 received a capsule containing a combination of reduced B vitamins. Plasma homocysteine levels were measured at baseline and week 8. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to evaluate efficacy for MDD.


RESULTS
159 of 170 vitamin-treated patients and 123 of 160 placebo-treated patients were completers. Of the active treatment group, 131 (82.4%) showed a reduction in homocysteine (for a mean in this subgroup of 25%, P < .001), while 28 (17.6%) showed no significant change. Placebo patients demonstrated a small elevation in homocysteine. Active-treatment patients demonstrated, on average, a 12-point reduction on the MADRS by week 8, and 42% achieved full remission (P < .001). No side effect was significantly different between groups. No patients experienced mania.


CONCLUSIONS
A combination of reduced B vitamins and micronutrients, when used in the treatment of MDD in patients with MTHFR polymorphism, resulted in a separation from placebo by week 2, and 42% of the treatment arm achieved remission by week 8. Further, clinical improvement correlated with a significant reduction in homocysteine levels in a majority of responders. These results support the homocysteine theory of depression and the safety and therapeutic benefit of reduced B vitamins as monotherapy for MDD, particularly in patients with MTHFR polymorphism.

Given that evaluating this syndrome requires addressing the context in which they are to be used, the purpose of this work was to analyze the psychometric properties and structure of the Burnout Brief Questionnaire (CBB), and to propose a more suitable version for its application to health professionals, and more specifically nurses. The final study sample was made up of 1236 working nursing professionals. An exploratory factorial analysis was carried out and a new model was proposed through a confirmatory factorial analysis. Thus, validation of the CBB questionnaire for nursing health care personnel showed an adequate discrimination of the items and a high internal consistency of the scale. With respect to the factorial analysis, four factors were extracted from the revised model. Specifically, these new factors, called job dissatisfaction, social climate, personal impact, and motivational abandonment, showed an adequate index of adjustment. Thus, the Brief Burnout Questionnaire Revised for nursing staff has favorable psychometric properties, and this model can be applied to all health care professionals.","[{'authorId': '2070185118', 'name': 'M.

Binge eaters suffer from high standards and expectations, especially an acute sensitivity to the difficult (perceived) demands of others. When they fall short of these standards, they develop an aversive pattern of high self-awareness, characterized by unflattering views of self and concern over how they are perceived by others. These aversive self-perceptions are accompanied by emotional distress, which often includes anxiety and depression. To escape from this unpleasant state, binge eaters attempt the cognitive response of narrowing attention to the immediate stimulus environment and avoiding broadly meaningful thought. This narrowing of attention disengages normal inhibitions against eating and fosters an uncritical acceptance of irrational beliefs and thoughts. The escape model is capable of integrating much of the available evidence about binge eating.","[{'authorId': '2681278', 'name': 'T. Heatherton'}, {'authorId': '5142080', 'name': 'R.

Using the Dual Threshold Model, we assess the positive and negative consequences of anger expressions at work and focus on the conditions under which expressions of anger crossing the impropriety threshold are perceived as productive or counterproductive by observers or targets of that anger. To explore this phenomenon, we conducted a phenomenological study (n = 20) to probe the lived experiences of followers (as observers and targets) associated with anger expressions by military leaders. The nature of task (e.g. the display rules prescribed for combat situations) emerged as one condition under which the crossing of the impropriety threshold leads to positive outcomes of anger expressions. Our data reveal tensions between emotional display rules and emotional display norms in the military, thereby fostering paradoxical attitudes toward anger expression and its consequences among followers. Within this paradoxical space, anger expressions have both positive (asymmetrical) and negative (symmetrical) consequences.

Emotion regulation determines the offset of emotional responding and is thus distinct from emotional sensitivity, which determines the onset of emotional responding. Among the most viable categories for classifying emotion-regulation strategies are the targets and functions of emotion regulation. The emotion-generating systems that are targeted in emotion regulation include attention, knowledge, and bodily responses. The functions of emotion regulation include satisfying hedonic needs, supporting specific goal pursuits, and facilitating the global personality system. Emotion-regulation strategies are classified in terms of their targets and functions and relevant empirical work is reviewed. Throughout this review, emotion regulation emerges as one of the most far-ranging and influential processes at the interface of cognition and emotion.","[{'authorId': '3152131', 'name': 'S.

From this it is deduced that individuals who show good perception of heart activity tend to exhibit higher levels of a momentarily experienced emotion (in this case anxiety) and to score higher on the personality trait “Emotional Lability.” The aspect of cardiac awareness considered here is perception of heart beats. Subjects were instructed to count heart beats (only by concentrating on their body but not by taking their pulse) during a signalled time interval and the reported number of beats was then compared to the actual number of beats as extracted from the EKG. Additionally, skin conductance and respiration were recorded. During the experimental task (i.e., counting heart beats) increases in heart rate, respiration rate and number of spontaneous fluctuations in skin conductance were recorded. Groups of good and poor perceivers were formed on the basis of accuracy on the perception task. The two groups did not differ in heart rate; however, in State Anxiety and Emotional Lability, the group of good perceivers had significantly higher scores. The importance of visceroception for emotional experience is pointed out and the relevance for clinical psychology is discussed.","[{'authorId': '5947215', 'name': 'R.

These differences in emotional experience can be understood as the outcomes of emotion regulation, because emotions that fit the valued relationships within a culture tend to be most common and intense. We review evidence suggesting that emotion regulation underlying cultural differences in emotional experience often takes place at the point of emotion elicitation through the promotion of situations and appraisals that are consistent with culturally valued relationships. These regulatory processes depend on individual tendencies, but are also co-regulated within relationships—close others shape people's environment and help them appraise events in culturally valued ways—and are afforded by structural conditions—people's daily lives “limit” the opportunities for emotion, and afford certain appraisals.

We investigated whether current mood could alter the metacognitive experiences of these teenagers during a problem-solving task. Metacognitive experiences refer to the feelings and judgments that people develop when carrying out a task (such as feelings of familiarity, certainty, uncertainty, confidence or satisfaction, the amount of time and effort needed to solve the problem, and the correctness of the solution). Forty-five male teenagers with conduct disorders took part in this study (M = 16.95, SD = 1.46). The French translations of ""The Mood Questionnaire"" and the ""The Metacognitive Experiences Questionnaire"" developed by Efklides and Petkaki (2005) were used before and after the task. Analyses that problem-solving scores could be predicted only by one metacognitive experience. Furthermore, each retrospective metacognitive experience be predicted by negative and/or positive mood adjective. Therefore, it could be important for teachers to take account of the role of mood in the development of metacognitive experiences, in particular with adolescents with conduct disorders. francaisCette recherche examine les liens entre les humeurs et les experiences metacognitives chez les adolescents presentant des troubles de la conduite et du comportement. Les experiences metacognitives se focalisent sur des aspects specifiques des processus cognitifs. En effet, lorsqu'une personne est confrontee a une tâche cognitive, des sentiments et jugements metacognitifs apparaissent (Efklides, 2001). Ainsi, les experiences metacognitives se declinent en sentiments (de familiarite, de difficulte, de confiance en sa propre capacite de resolution, de satisfaction face aux resultats obtenus) et en jugements (interet et agreabilite de la tâche ; estimations du temps qui doit y etre consacre, du degre d'effort necessaire pour resoudre ce probleme et de l'exactitude de la solution trouvee).

Les participants ont rempli un questionnaire d'humeurs et un questionnaire d'experiences metacognitives (Efklides & Petkaki, 2005) avant et apres la resolution du probleme. Les resultats obtenus par analyses de regression montrent que seule l'estimation de la difficulte du probleme est liee a la performance reelle de resolution. De plus, les humeurs participent a l'elaboration des experiences metacognitives de facon differente avant et apres la resolution du probleme.

Recent research has found analogous security-oriented (i.e., prevention-focused) responses following experiences highlighting concerns with social loss but differing growth-oriented (i.e., promotion-focused ) responses, such as attempts at social engagement, following experiences highlighting concerns with social gain. The present studies thus investigated whether fostering a promotion focus among lonely individuals through subtle primes of acceptance could reduce their self-protective social avoidance. This hypothesis was supported across four studies in which the links between primed acceptance and promotion-focused motivations were first established, and the impact of such primes on lonely individuals’ social thoughts, intentions, and behaviors were then tested.

Despite much works in designing neural dialogue generation systems in recent years, few studies consider both emotion to be expressed and topic relevance in the generation process. To address this problem, we present a Topic-aware Emotional Response Generation (TERG) model, which can not only exactly generate desired emotional response but perform well in topic relevance. Specifically, TERG equips an encoder-decoder structure with an emotion aware module to control the emotional sentence generation and a topic aware module to enhance topic relevance. We evaluate our model on a large real-world dataset of conversations from social media. Experimental results show that our model obtains a significant improvement against several strong baseline methods on both automatic and human evaluation.","[{'authorId': '91214852', 'name': 'Peishu Huo'}, {'authorId': '40449526', 'name': 'Yan Yang'}, {'authorId': '145558445', 'name': 'Jie Zhou'}, {'authorId': '2423802', 'name': 'Chengcai Chen'}, {'authorId': '145836225', 'name': 'Liang He'}]",9.0,"{'name': '2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)', 'pages': '1-8'}",25.0,TERG: Topic-Aware Emotional Response Generation for Chatbot,2020.0

The COMT Val158Met genotype is involved with pain sensitivity, and early life stress is implicated in altered expression of methylation of the serotonin transporter. We examined: (1) whether methylation of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) promoter differs between very preterm children and full-term controls at school age, (2) relationships with child behavior problems, and (3) whether the extent of neonatal pain exposure interacts with the COMT Val158Met genotype to predict SLC6A4 methylation at 7 years in the very preterm children. We examined the associations between the COMT genotypes, neonatal pain exposure (adjusted for neonatal clinical confounders), SLC6A4 methylation and behavior problems. Very preterm children had significantly higher methylation at 7/10 CpG sites in the SLC6A4 promoter compared to full-term controls at 7 years. Neonatal pain (adjusted for clinical confounders) was significantly associated with total child behavior problems on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) questionnaire (adjusted for concurrent stressors and 5HTTLPR genotype) (p = 0.035). CBCL Total Problems was significantly associated with greater SLC6A4 methylation in very preterm children (p = 0.01). Neonatal pain (adjusted for clinical confounders) and COMT Met/Met genotype were associated with SLC6A4 promoter methylation in very preterm children at 7 years (p = 0.001).

We have used research designs that employ process-oriented measures combined with subjective interpretations to capture motivation and emotion regulation. Analysing on-line process data poses several challenges such as variation in the granularity of different data sources, problems that emerge due to the complexity of contextual and situational factors in ecologically-valid learning situations or, currently, challenges in the use of multiple data channels and their analyses. 
In this paper, we present three claims underlying our research, particularly the motivationand emotions and their regulation in learning. The claims are as follows: (1) motivation and emotion regulation is situation and context specific, (2) motivation and emotion regulation is influenced by multi-layered nature of motivationand(3) Motivation and emotion regulation is intertwined with other processes of learning and can be captured from their temporal manifestation. We present an example from our empirical study to discuss how these claims have led us to employ multiple process-oriented methods that include both subjective and objective data sources, including different combinations of situation-specific self-reports, video and physiological data.

To evaluate the association between quality-of-life (QOL) impairment as reported by patients and QOL impairment as judged by nurses or physicians, with and without consideration of spiritual well-being (SWB).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
A total of 163 patients with advanced cancer were enrolled onto a therapeutic trial, and cross-sectional data were derived from clinical and demographic questionnaires obtained at baseline, including assessment of patient QOL and SWB. Clinicians rated the QOL impairment of their patients as mild, moderate, or severe. Clinician-estimated QOL impairment and patient-derived QOL categories were compared. Correlation coefficients were estimated to associate QOL scores using different instruments. The analysis of variance method was used to compare Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scores on categorical variables.


RESULTS
There was no significant association between self-assessment scores and marital status, education level, performance status, or predicted life expectancy. However, a strong relationship between SWB and QOL was noted (P <.0001). Clinician-estimated QOL impairment matched the level of patient-derived QOL correctly in approximately 60% of cases, with only slight variation depending on the method of categorizing patient-derived QOL scores. The accuracy of clinician estimates was not associated with the level of SWB. Interestingly, a subset analysis of the inaccurate estimates revealed an association between lower SWB and clinician underestimation of QOL impairment (P =.0025).


CONCLUSION
Clinician estimates of QOL impairment were accurate in more than 60% of patients. SWB is strongly associated with QOL, but it is not associated with the overall accuracy of clinicians' judgments about QOL impairment.","[{'authorId': '17499652', 'name': 'M.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical effect and safety of a broad spectrum, 36 ingredient micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) in treating children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).


METHODS
This open-label, on-off-on-off (reversal design) study followed 14 participants (8-12 years of age) with ADHD, diagnosed using standardized instruments, for 6 months with no dropouts. Following baseline assessment, including hematology and biochemistry screening, participants began an 8 week treatment phase with micronutrients titrated up to maximum dose (15 capsules/day). Treatment was withdrawn for 4 weeks, reinstated for a further 8 weeks, and then withdrawn for 4 weeks. Primary outcomes included the Conners' Parent Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - Parent version (SDQ). Secondary outcomes were mood and global functioning.


RESULTS
Modified Brinley plots revealed a reduction in ADHD symptoms, improved mood, and improved overall functioning during intervention phases, and deterioration in ADHD symptoms, mood, and overall functioning during the withdrawal phases. Reliable change analyses, Cohen's d and percent superiority effect sizes, 95% confidence intervals and t tests confirmed clinically and statistically significant change between the intervention and withdrawal phases, with large effect sizes observed pre- to post-exposure of micronutrients (d = 1.2-2.2) on ADHD symptoms during intervention phases. Seventy-one percent of participants showed at least a 30% decrease in ADHD symptoms by the end of the second treatment phase, and 79% were identified as ""much improved"" or ""very much improved"" at the end of the second phase (5 months) based on the clinician-rated CGI when considering functioning generally. The SDQ showed that these benefits occurred across other areas of functioning including emotional symptoms, conduct problems, and prosocial behaviours. The children's self-reports confirmed the improvements. Excellent adherence to treatment occurred throughout, side effects were mild and transitory, and no safety issues were identified through blood analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates the clinical benefit, feasibility, and safety of broad-spectrum micronutrients in the treatment of childhood ADHD.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to explore motivations that drive consumers’ purchase intention in social commerce, and then examine whether social presence can work as a moderator in this process.


Design/methodology/approach
A research model was developed based on stimulus-organism-response model by integrating trust, argument quality, social presence and purchase intention. Using the data collected from 288 valid online questionnaires, the proposed model was empirically assessed by partial least square (PLS) SEM.


Findings
The results show that trust toward social commerce site and trust toward site members are determinants of purchase intention, and the later one can be triggered by the argument quality of consumer-generated contents (perceived informativeness and perceived persuasiveness). Besides, consumers’ social presence has a moderating effect on the relationship between trust toward site members and purchase intention.


Originality/value
This study indicates a new mechanism of trust based on the context of social commerce. The findings will contribute to social commerce literature by offering a well proven conceptual model that facilitates the understanding of consumers’ purchase decision-making processes.

These findings held even after negative self-concept items were eliminated from the depressive symptom inventories. Additional analyses revealed that self-esteem stability accounted for variance independent of the tendency to over generalize following failure or negative event attributional style.

However, there has been no empirical review of the literature on gender and facial, vocal, and behavioral expressions of different types of emotions in children. The present study constitutes a comprehensive meta-analytic review of gender differences and moderators of differences in emotion expression from infancy through adolescence. We analyzed 555 effect sizes from 166 studies with a total of 21,709 participants. Significant but very small gender differences were found overall, with girls showing more positive emotions (g = -.08) and internalizing emotions (e.g., sadness, anxiety, sympathy; g = -.10) than boys, and boys showing more externalizing emotions (e.g., anger; g = .09) than girls. Notably, gender differences were moderated by age, interpersonal context, and task valence, underscoring the importance of contextual factors in gender differences. Gender differences in positive emotions were more pronounced with increasing age, with girls showing more positive emotions than boys in middle childhood (g = -.20) and adolescence (g = -.28). Boys showed more externalizing emotions than girls at toddler/preschool age (g = .17) and middle childhood (g = .13) and fewer externalizing emotions than girls in adolescence (g = -.27). Gender differences were less pronounced with parents and were more pronounced with unfamiliar adults (for positive emotions) and with peers/when alone (for externalizing emotions). Our findings of gender differences in emotion expression in specific contexts have important implications for gender differences in children's healthy and maladaptive development.","[{'authorId': '6112674', 'name': 'T.

While this “conversational ideal” is easily achieved in face-to-face and computer-mediated communications (CMC), imbuing contingency in human-computer interaction (HCI) is a challenge. We propose two interface features—interaction history and synchronous chat—for increasing perceptions of contingency, and therefore user engagement. We test it with a five-condition, between-participants experiment (N = 110) on a movie search site. Data suggest that interaction history can indeed heighten perceptions of contingency and dialogue, but is perceived as less interactive than chatting. However, the chat function does not appreciably increase perceived contingency or user engagement, both of which are shown to mediate the effects of message interactivity on attitudes toward the site.

Previous research has reported affect regulation difficulties in substance use disorders and addiction has been considered an attachment disorder. However, scarce empirical research exists on the relationship of attachment in relation to affect regulation and interpersonal functioning in those with substance use problems. Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate potential associations between attachment, negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancies, fear of intimacy and self-differentiation in substance abusers. The revised adult attachment scale (RAAS), the NMR expectancies scale, the fear of intimacy scale and the differentiation of self inventory were administered to a sample of 100 substance use disorder inpatients. Attachment accounted for significant variance in NMR expectancies and was also a strong predictor of fear of intimacy. The predictive utility of attachment also extended to self-differentiation, suggesting that attachment was strongly related to overall self-differentiation score, Emotional reactivity, Emotional cut-off and I position. These findings support attachment theory suggesting that attachment is associated with and predicts affect regulation abilities and difficulties in interpersonal functioning in a sample of substance use disorder inpatients.

One's spirituality or religious beliefs and practices may have a profound impact on how the individual copes with the suffering that so often accompanies advanced disease. Several previous studies suggest that negative religious coping can significantly affect health outcomes.


OBJECTIVE
The primary aim of this study was to explore the relationship between spirituality, religious coping, and symptoms of distress among a group of inpatients referred to the palliative care consult service.


DESIGN
Pilot study.


SETTING
The study was conducted in a large academic medical center with a comprehensive Palliative Care and Home Hospice Program.


MEASUREMENT
(1) National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Management Assessment Tool; (2) Pargament Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE); (3) Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp); (4) Puchalski's FICA; and (5) Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF).


RESULTS
The 31 subjects surveyed experienced moderate distress (5.8 +/- 2.7), major physical and psychosocial symptom burden, along with reduced function and significant caregiving needs. The majority (87.2%) perceived themselves to be at least somewhat spiritual, with 77.4% admitting to being at least somewhat religious. Negative religious coping (i.e., statements regarding punishment or abandonment by God) was positively associated with distress, confusion, depression, and negatively associated with physical and emotional well-being, as well as quality of life.


CONCLUSIONS
Palliative care clinicians should be alert to symptoms of spiritual distress and intervene accordingly. Future research is needed to identify optimal techniques to address negative religious coping.","[{'authorId': '50792658', 'name': 'J. Hills'}, {'authorId': '3465188', 'name': 'J.

Thirty adolescents who were OW/OB (86.7% female; mean age = 14.6 years (SD = 1.2); Body Mass Index (BMI) = 34.0 kg/m2 (SD = 5.6); 33.3% White non-Hispanic) and their parent (66.7% biological mother) participated in a 4-month treatment and 3-month follow-up. The PEER program was well accepted. Initial efficacy showed significant decreases in emotional eating, and there were trends towards weight loss and a decrease in emotion dysregulation.

Another objective was to provide normative data. Data from the cross-sectional Västerbotten Environmental Health Study in Sweden were used. The 3406 participants in this study, 18 to 79 years old, constituted a random sample stratified for age and sex. Along with the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire, the participants responded to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Shirom Melamed Burnout Questionnaire for assessing construct validity. Factor analyses of the questions in the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire that relate to nocturnal sleep revealed the dimensions sleep quality, non-restorative sleep, and sleep apnea. A separate factor analysis on the questions regarding day time sleepiness revealed a sleepiness dimension. The sleep quality, non-restorative sleep, and sleepiness dimensions showed approximate normal distributions, whereas the distribution for sleep apnea was positively skewed. All dimensions showed good internal consistency. Satisfactory construct validity was found for all dimensions. Using the DSM-IV criteria of insomnia, relevant questions in the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire were combined into an index of nocturnal symptoms of insomnia as were questions of sleep apnea. Prevalences of insomnia and sleep apnea correspond well to those of other studies, indicating good criterion validity. The favorable psychometric properties of the dimensions and indexes from the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire suggest their use for assessing sleep quality, non-restorative sleep, sleep apnea, sleepiness and nocturnal symptoms of insomnia.","[{'authorId': '145148521', 'name': 'M.

However, all of these models use a relatively limited conceptualisation of the self. The author proposes a tripartite approach in which theories of the self are grouped into three broad categories: content, structure, and process. Content refers to knowledge and information about the self, structure to the way that information is organised, and process to the ways in which individuals attend to and regulate the self. Structure has been largely neglected to date, and the author outlines ways in which the structural organisation of self-knowledge could contribute to social anxiety. High social anxiety is associated with low clarity about the self and with more uncertainty about self-judgments. Structure interacts with content, and in the final part of the article potential interactions among imagery, self-concept, and self-structure are discussed.","[{'authorId': '3948102', 'name': 'Lusia L.

Research on susceptibility to alcohol use disorder within the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) population has begun to expand examination of putative moderators and mediators in order to develop effective treatments. Specific dysregulated emotions have been separately associated with ADHD and with alcohol use difficulties. The current study is the first to conjointly study these variables by testing anger-irritability as a mediator of ADHD risk for adolescent alcohol use.


METHODS
Frequency of binge drinking, drunkenness, and alcohol problems were examined for 142 children with ADHD followed into adolescence and compared to 100 demographically similar youth without ADHD. Parent-rated anger-irritability was tested as a mediator. Behavioral and cognitive coping skills, which are key clinical treatment targets, were studied as moderators of these associations.


RESULTS
Childhood ADHD was positively associated with anger-irritability and the drinking outcomes in adolescence. Anger-irritability mediated the association between ADHD and alcohol use problems, but not binge drinking or drunkenness. Behavioral and cognitive, but not avoidant, coping played a moderating role, but only of the association between childhood ADHD and anger-irritability.


CONCLUSIONS
Active coping strategies by adolescents with ADHD may reduce the vulnerability to alcohol problems through a reduction of negative emotions. Future research on additional mediators and treatments that target these skills is encouraged.","[{'authorId': '5430575', 'name': 'Seth C. Harty'}, {'authorId': '6446426', 'name': 'E.

Although the importance of positive feelings has been recognized through the years in the academic OB and popular literature, both management scholars and practitioners have arguably too often taken a negative perspective—trying to fix what is wrong with managers and employees and concentrating on weaknesses. Positive organizational behavior (POB) follows the lead of recently emerging positive psychology, which is driven by theory and research focusing on people's strengths and psychological capabilities. Instead of just retreading and putting a positive spin on traditional OB concepts, this unveiling of POB sets forth specific criteria for inclusion. Not only does positivity have to be associated with the concept, but it must also be relatively unique to the OB field, have valid measures, be adaptable to leader/management and human resource training and development, and, most important, capable of contributing t...","[{'authorId': '2841678', 'name': 'F.

The intervention during infancy, Playing and Learning Strategies (PALS I), showed strong changes in maternal affective-emotional and cognitively responsive behaviors and infants' development. However, it was hypothesized that a 2nd intervention dose in the toddler-preschool period was needed for optimal results. Families from the PALS I phase were rerandomized into either the PALS II, the toddler-preschool phase, or a Developmental Assessment Sessions condition, resulting in 4 groups. Facilitation of maternal warmth occurred best with the PALS I intervention, while cognitive responsive behaviors were best supported with the PALS II intervention. Behaviors that required responsiveness to the child's changing signals (contingent responsiveness, redirecting) required the intervention across both the early and later periods.","[{'authorId': '7198567', 'name': 'S.

The results suggest that service robots either support or substitute employees in service encounters. They also offer hospitality businesses a novel point of differentiation, but only if properly integrated as part of wider marketing efforts. Finally, the automation of tasks, processes, and, ultimately, jobs has serious socioeconomic implications both at the microlevel and macrolevel.

Self-compassion entails three main components: (a) self-kindness—being kind and understanding toward oneself in instances of pain or failure rather than being harshly self-critical, (b) common humanity—perceiving one's experiences as part of the larger human experience rather than seeing them as separating and isolating, and (c) mindfulness—holding painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness rather than over-identifying with them. Self-compassion is an emotionally positive self-attitude that should protect against the negative consequences of self-judgment, isolation, and rumination (such as depression). Because of its non-evaluative and interconnected nature, it should also counter the tendencies towards narcissism, self-centeredness, and downward social comparison that have been associated with attempts to maintain self-esteem.

With increasing age, there are substantial changes to sleep quantity and quality, including changes to slow-wave sleep, spindle density, and sleep continuity/fragmentation. A provocative question for the field of cognitive aging is whether such changes in sleep physiology affect cognition (e.g., memory consolidation). We review nearly a half century of research across seven diverse correlational and experimental domains that historically have had little crosstalk. Broadly speaking, sleep and cognitive functions are often related in advancing age, though the prevalence of null effects in healthy older adults (including correlations in the unexpected, negative direction) indicates that age may be an effect modifier of these associations. We interpret the literature as suggesting that maintaining good sleep quality, at least in young adulthood and middle age, promotes better cognitive functioning and serves to protect against age-related cognitive declines.","[{'authorId': '5775974', 'name': 'M.

The Emotional Eating theoretical model has proposed that the failure in emotional regulation could represent a risk factor for establishing maladaptive overeating behavior that represents an inadequate response to negative emotions and allows increasing body-weight. This systematic review investigates the relationship between overeating and both emotional regulation and emotional intelligence in childhood and adolescence, considering both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Moreover, another goal of the review is evaluating whether emotional regulation and emotional intelligence can cause overeating behaviors. The systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA-statement in the databases Medline, PsychArtcles, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences, and allows 484 records to be extracted. Twenty-six studies were selected according to inclusion (e.g., studies focused on children and adolescents without clinical conditions; groups of participants overweight or with obesity) and exclusion (e.g., studies that adopted qualitative assessment or cognitive-affective tasks to measure emotional variables; reviews, commentary, or brief reports) criteria detailed in the methods. Cross-sectional studies showed a negative association between emotional regulation and overeating behavior that was confirmed by longitudinal studies. These findings highlighted the role of maladaptive emotion regulation on overeating and being overweight. The relationship between these constructs in children and adolescents was consistent. The results indicated the complexity of this association, which would be influenced by many physiological, psychological, and social factors. These findings underline the need for further studies focused on emotion regulation in the development of overeating. They should analyze the mediation role of other variables (e.g., attachment style, peer pressure) and identify interventions to prevent and reduce worldwide overweight prevalence.","[{'authorId': '67123587', 'name': 'F.

Healthcare workers play an essential role and are one of the most exposed groups. Information about the psychosocial impact on healthcare workers is limited. Methods 3109 healthcare workers completed a national, internet-based, cross-sectional 45-item survey between 9 and 19 April 2020. The objective is to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spanish healthcare workers. A Psychological Stress and Adaptation at work Score (PSAS) was defined combining four modified versions of validated psychological assessment tests (A) Healthcare Stressful Test, (B) Coping Strategies Inventory, (C) Font-Roja Questionnaire and (D) Trait Meta-Mood Scale. Results The highest psychosocial impact was perceived in Respiratory Medicine, the mean (S.D.) PSAS was 48.3 (13.6) and Geriatrics 47.6 (16.4). Higher distress levels were found in the geographical areas with the highest incidence of COVID-19 (>245.5 cases per 100 000 people), PSAS 46.8 (15.2); p < 0.001.

b486c58cef09f9a2502daeb2fa1b66da43cf1709,"This opinion article deals with the role of hypnotizability in the efficacy of the suggestions of analgesia for the cognitive control of pain and of its physiological correlates. Hypnotizability is a multimensional trait including suggestibility (Raz, 2007) and other characteristics such as fantasy proneness, attitude to be deeply absorped in specific tasks/mental images (Green and Lynn, 2011; Dasse et al., 2015), strong functional equivalence between imagery and perception (Papalia et al., 2014; Santarcangelo, 2014; Ibanez-Marcelo et al., 2018). It predicts the proneness to accept suggestions (Green et al., 2005; Elkins et al., 2015) and is measured by scales so that the general population is classified as high (highs, about 15%), medium (mediums, about 70%) and low (lows, about 15%) susceptible to hypnosis (De Pascalis et al., 2000). In the ordinary state of consciousness and in the absence of specific suggestions, different levels of hypnotizability are associated with different cerebral (Landry et al., 2017), cerebellar (Bocci et al., 2017; Picerni et al., 2018), sensorimotor and cardiovascular characteristics (Santarcangelo and Scattina, 2016). The paper describes the interaction between explicit suggestions of analgesia and the expectation of pain relief (Huber et al., 2013; De Pascalis and Scacchia, 2016) on the basis of new findings regarding the hypnotisability-related polymorphism of opioid receptors μ1 (Presciuttini et al., 2018). In addition, the paper reports the observed joined influence of hypnotisability and cognitive-emotional traits (Madeo et al., 2015; Jensen et al., 2016) conceptualized as Behavioral Inhibition/Activation System (BIS/BAS) (Gray, 1990) and as Interoception/Interoceptive Awareness (Sebastiani et al., 2018; Varanini et al., 2018) on pain. Finally, the paper proposes that the observed morpho-functional peculiarities of the highs’ salience network—insula, cingulate and prefrontal cortex (Landry et al., 2017)—and cerebellum (Bocci et al., 2017; Picerni et al., 2018) may play a role in the complex role of hypnotizability in pain modulation. In this respect, it should be noted that, although hypnotisability is an approximately stable individual trait, socio-cognitive factors such as relational disposition and the manipulation of expectation can modulate the efficacy of suggestions (Kirsch, 2018). The possible biological substrates for some of these factors, for instance the oxytocn release during hypnotic interventions, are now emerging (Kasos et al., 2018).","[{'authorId': '5076410', 'name': 'E.

The limited literature further suggests improved outcomes accrue by integrating physiological techniques, such as yoga and meditation, directly into SEL curricula to reduce stress. Aims: This study investigated the association between outcomes of a yogic breath-based biopsychosocial SEL intervention across gender and ethnicity. Methods: Fifty-nine high school students were evaluated on 4 positive (self-esteem, identity formation, anger coping ability, planning, and concentration) and 3 negative SEL outcomes (impulsivity, distractibility, and endorsement of aggression). Using a repeated-measures design, group differences between gender and ethnicity were assessed. Results and Conclusions: Significant improvements on all 7 outcomes were found for the sample, suggesting that participants performed better after the intervention. There were neither significant differences between males and females on outcomes nor between different ethnic groups with the exception of African-Americans scoring lower on one of three emotion regulation outcomes. This study, one of the first to directly analyze SEL outcomes by sociodemographic variables, demonstrated the program's biopsychosocial approach was associated with beneficial SEL outcomes across genders and ethnicities. Future studies of biopsychosocial programs taking into account sociodemographics will allow SEL programs to be more effective across diverse populations.","[{'authorId': '32786855', 'name': 'Ronnie I.

To examine the ability to regulate emotions in children with binge eating.


METHOD
A community sample of 60 children ages 8-13 with at least one episode of loss of control (LOC) eating during the past 3 months and a matched control group without LOC (n = 60) underwent a clinical interview (Eating Disorder Examination adapted for Children) and completed self-report questionnaires assessing emotion regulation strategies, eating pathology, and depressive symptoms.


RESULTS
Children with LOC eating made a significantly higher use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies (p < .01), especially for the regulation of anxiety (p < .01). Maladaptive strategies were associated with greater depressiveness (p < .001). Use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies did not differ between children with and without LOC eating.


DISCUSSION
Results document an association between LOC eating and difficulties in regulating negative emotions in children. Interventions targeting LOC eating in children should include training for coping with negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '40451266', 'name': 'J. Czaja'}, {'authorId': '3435893', 'name': 'W.

The hypothesis that stress is related to active coping efforts among persisters, but not among nonpersisters, was strongly supported. However, the hypothesis that stress is related to higher grade point averages (GPAs) among persisters and lower GPAs among nonpersisters was not strongly supported. Stress had a negative effect on GPA among persisters, but there was some evidence of a positive indirect effect through active coping efforts. Finally, a logistic regression analysis found that active coping, thinking it was important to get to know other students, gender, enrollment in more credit hours, GPA, and not being employed lead to greater retention. Active coping was strongly related to retention, and men were more likely to persist. The study provides support for the idea that social support is an active form of coping and that behavioral measures of active coping may be beneficial in studying the relationship between stress and coping.","[{'authorId': '47792116', 'name': 'N.

To explore the concept of emotional regulation in nursing.


BACKGROUND
People are exposed to a variety of potentially emotion-provoking stimuli almost on a daily basis. The fact that these types of stimuli do not trigger full-blown emotions every time suggests that people are able to manage their own emotions through an internal process. The process is referred to as emotional regulation (ER). Nursing is a stressful and emotionally charged profession, yet the concept of ER is not well explored in the nursing literature.


DESIGN
Concept analysis.


DATA SOURCE
Electronic databases searched were CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar. Forty-one articles were used in the review of this concept, of which six articles were used to review ER in nursing. Most of the articles on ER were from the field of psychology.


REVIEW METHODS
Walker and Avant's eight-step to concept analysis. Data extracted from the articles were used in identifying the definitions, related concepts, uses of the concept of ER, and antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents.


RESULTS
Four defining attributes of ER were identified as self-awareness, control, emotional expression, and active thinking. Definitions, the uses of the concept of ER, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents are discussed. Model, related and contrary cases were developed.


CONCLUSION
The concept of ER has implications and significance to nursing as nurses are exposed to a variety of emotion-provoking situations when performing nursing tasks.","[{'authorId': '1403569325', 'name': 'Adrienne Fasbinder'}, {'authorId': '1403569299', 'name': 'Kimberly Shidler'}, {'authorId': '1398380815', 'name': 'Meriam Caboral-Stevens'}]",4.0,{'name': 'Nursing forum'},40.0,A concept analysis: Emotional regulation of nurses.,2020.0

Negative feedback is important in generating improvements in employee performance, but likely to generate adverse employee reactions. However, if managers do not address poor performance, good performers may become demoralized or exit the organization. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how managers communicate negative feedback and the factors that drive their choice of tactic. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use interview data from practicing line managers with experience in delivering negative feedback to learn whether their tactic choices are consistent with Implicit (“best practice”) or Contingency (“best fit”) theory. Findings – The authors identify five negative feedback tactics: evidence, emotive and communication tactics are foundation tactics while evidence + communication and evidence + emotive tactics are bundles of the foundation tactics.

Accordingly, our aim was to identify demographic and psychological correlates of overeating regulation in a sample of university students, to facilitate greater understanding of this self‐regulatory capacity. Variables of interest included emotion regulation, mindfulness, eating pathology, age, and gender. Method Self‐report measures were completed by 312 Australian university students (68% female; M age = 22 years). Results Exploratory factor analyses indicated three overeating regulation subscales: (1) general overeating regulation (general ability to resist overeating); (2) discomfort overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating when experiencing physical pain or negative emotions); and (3) leisure overeating dysregulation (inability to resist overeating in leisure contexts and/or in the presence of high calorie foods). Overeating regulation was not associated with age; though young men reported better general overeating regulation capacity than young women. Individuals reporting greater ability to regulate overeating (across all three subscales) reported better emotion regulation and mindfulness, and less eating pathology. Multiple regression analyses showed that the emotion regulation subscales of goal‐directedness, emotional awareness, and impulse control, and the mindfulness subscales of acting with awareness and non‐reactivity to inner experience were unique correlates of the overeating regulation subscales. Conclusions This study offers greater understanding about the different facets of overeating regulation, and highlights the relevance of emotion regulation and mindfulness in this adaptive eating practise.","[{'authorId': '51028408', 'name': 'Jessica L.

Previous research on craniosynostosis has focused primarily on the skeletal phenotype, but the intimate relationship between the developing central nervous system (CNS) and skull is well documented. We investigate the morphology of the CNS in patients with isolated craniosynostosis through an analysis of cortical and subcortical features using 3‐D magnetic resonance images (MRI). Results show that a distinct CNS phenotype can be defined for specific diagnostic categories. Many differences in CNS morphology observed in the patient samples may be anticipated based on skeletal morphology, but others are not reflected in the skull. We propose a developmental approach to determining the cause of premature suture fusion, which includes investigation of the craniofacial complex as a system, rather than study of isolated tissues.","[{'authorId': '4952216', 'name': 'Kristina Aldridge'}, {'authorId': '1831816', 'name': 'J.

The goals of such programs are partly for personal development but partly to increase academic performance. The current meta-analysis examines the degree to which student EI is associated with academic performance. We found an overall effect of ρ = .20 using robust variance estimation (N = 42,529, k = 1,246 from 158 citations). The association is significantly stronger for ability EI (ρ = .24, k = 50) compared with self-rated (ρ = .12, k = 33) or mixed EI (ρ = .19, k = 90). Ability, self-rated, and mixed EI explained an additional 1.7%, 0.7%, and 2.3% of the variance, respectively, after controlling for intelligence and big five personality. Understanding and management branches of ability EI explained an additional 3.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Relative importance analysis suggests that EI is the third most important predictor for all three streams, after intelligence and conscientiousness. Moderators of the effect differed across the three EI streams. Ability EI was a stronger predictor of performance in humanities than science. Self-rated EI was a stronger predictor of grades than standardized test scores. We propose that three mechanisms underlie the EI/academic performance link: (a) regulating academic emotions, (b) building social relationships at school, and (c) academic content overlap with EI. Different streams of EI may affect performance through different mechanisms. We note some limitations, including the lack of evidence for a causal direction.

Trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity. Trust makes consumers comfortable sharing personal information, making purchases, and acting on Web vendor advice--behaviors essential to widespread adoption of e-commerce. Therefore, trust is critical to both researchers and practitioners. Prior research on e-commerce trust has used diverse, incomplete, and inconsistent definitions of trust, making it difficult to compare results across studies. This paper contributes by proposing and validating measures for a multidisciplinary, multidimensional model of trust in e-commerce. The model includes four high-level constructs--disposition to trust, institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions--which are further delineated into 16 measurable, literature-grounded subconstructs. The psychometric properties of the measures are demonstrated through use of a hypothetical, legal advice Web site. The results show that trust is indeed a multidimensional concept. Proposed relationships among the trust constructs are tested (for internal nomological validity), as are relationships between the trust constructs and three other e-commerce constructs (for external nomological validity)--Web experience, personal innovativeness, and Web site quality.

We propose that problem-focused strategies (situation modification and cognitive change) are likely to reduce the intensity of negative customer emotions and increase the intensity of positive customer emotions, whereas emotion-focused strategies (attentional deployment and modulating the emotional response) will have the opposite impact. Further, we propose that customer negative emotions will affect the choice of strategies CSRs employ. Based on evaluator ratings of recorded customer service calls (N= 228), our findings confirmed the positive effects of problem-focused strategies and the negative effects of emotion-focused strategies on customer-expressed emotions. In addition, we found that initial customer emotions affected the strategy used by the CSR, whereby negative emotions expressed by the customer reduced the use of the most effective strategy and increased the use of the least effective strategy.","[{'authorId': '31562204', 'name': 'L.

However, much of the research in this area has been with European American families. This study examined parents’ self-reports about their emotion regulation patterns and coaching their children about emotions, across three racial and ethnic groups (African American, European American, and Multiracial), to determine how well these parental behaviors predicted their children’s self-reports of depressive and anxiety symptoms 18 to 24 months later (N = 99). For the African American families, a higher level of coaching about anger and sadness by mothers was linked with lower depressive symptoms in their children. A higher level of anger coaching by fathers within the Multiracial group was also associated with lower anxiety and depressive symptoms. This study supports the importance of cultural values, within racial and ethnic groups, in parenting approaches associated with children’s mental health outcomes.","[{'authorId': '4785256', 'name': 'B.

b6a6ac2b1253694f2c1919c89ebb12d432ec0634,"Despite broad consensus about the effects of parenting practices on child development, many questions about the construct parenting style remain unanswered. Particularly pressing issues are the variability in the effects of parenting style as a function of the child's cultural background, the processes through which parenting style influences the child's development, and the operationalization of parenting style. Drawing on historical review, the authors present a model that integrates two traditions in socialization research, the study of specific parenting practices and the study of global parent characteristics. They propose that parenting style is best conceptualized as a context that moderates the influence of specific parenting practices on the child. It is argued that only by maintaining the distinction between parenting style and parenting practice can researchers address questions concerning socialization processes. During the past 25 years, research based on Baumrind's conceptualization of parenting style has produced a remarkably consistent picture of the type of parenting conducive to the successful socialization of children into the dominant culture of the United States. Authoritativeness—a constellation of parent attributes that includes emotional support, high standards, appropriate autonomy granting, and clear, bidirectional communication—has been shown to help children and adolescents develop an instrumental competence characterized by the balancing of societal and individual needs and responsibilities. Among the indicators of instrumental competence are responsible independence, cooperation with adults and peers, psychosocial maturity, and academic success (for reviews, see Baumrind, 1989,199 la). This work on authoritative ness and its beneficial effects builds on half a century of research on parenting and parenting style. Yet, despite some impressive consistencies in the socialization literature, important questions remain unanswered. As researchers have expanded beyond samples of White, predominantly middle-class families, it has become increasingly clear that the influence of authoritativeness, as well as other styles of parenting, varies depending on the social milieu in which the family is embedded. For example, Baumrind (1972) reported that authoritarian parenting, which is associated with fearful, timid behavior and behavioral compliance among EuropeanAmerican children, is associated with assertiveness among African-American girls. Furthermore, recent studies in which the effects of authoritativeness have been compared across ethnic groups have consistently shown that authoritative parenting is most strongly associated with academic achievement among","[{'authorId': '46853038', 'name': 'Nancy Darling'}, {'authorId': '143629939', 'name': 'L.

We assessed affect intensity, emotion regulation, active coping, neuroticism as well as weekly reports of pain, positive affect, and negative affect. Results indicated that the joint effects of emotion regulation and emotional intensity predicted emotional responses to pain. The current study suggests that the emotional impact of pain is related to emotional intensity which can be tempered by the ability to regulate emotion.","[{'authorId': '48314578', 'name': 'N.

This implies that humans are genetically prepared to produce facial gestures that are automatically decoded by observers.

Attention is preferentially and automatically oriented toward facial threat. Neuropsychological data, as well as a rapidly expanding brain-imaging literature, implicate the amygdala as a central structure for responding to negative emotional faces, and particularly to fearful ones. However, the amygdala may not be specialized for processing emotional faces, but may instead respond to faces because they provide important information for the defense appraisal that is its primary responsibility.","[{'authorId': '144528070', 'name': 'A.

Patients and Methods: We investigated elderly German insurants and outpatients with chronic diseases with the SpREUK and AKU questionnaires. Results: Patients with chronic diseases relied on adaptive coping styles which refer to both external help (Trust in Medical Help, Search for Alternative Help, Trust in God’s Help) and internal powers/ virtues (Conscious and Healthy Living, Perspectives and Positive Attitudes). Reappraisal (Illness as Chance) was strongly connected with Trust in God’s Help, which was of relevance particularly for female cancer patients. Compared to patients with other chronic diseases, cancer patients were significantly more in Search for Meaningful Support, had Trust in Higher Source and a Positive Interpretation of Disease. Women with breast cancer had significantly higher interest in Search for Meaningful Support and Positive Interpretation than patients with prostate cancer. The SpR attitudes and convictions were significantly influenced by gender, SpR self-categorization, and educational level. Conclusion: Particularly women with breast cancer refer to SpR issues and existential practices in order to better cope with their illness.

Au total, 36 documents ont été retenus, dont trois revues de question. Dans la grande majorité des cas, en concordance avec les revues de littérature existantes sur les interventions de psychologie positive, des effets sont observés sur l’augmentation du bien-être et sur la réduction des symptômes anxio-dépressifs, suite à la réalisation des interventions. Tandis que l’ampleur des effets reste modeste, certains paramètres ou conditions susceptibles d’influencer l’efficacité des interventions sont rapportés, tels que les caractéristiques des exercices, des participants ainsi que leur adéquation.

While the effect sizes are modest, parameters or conditions that may influence the effectiveness of the interventions are reported, such as the characteristics of the exercises, the participants and their adequacy. In conclusion, while the favourable impact of these interventions is generally low or moderate, their usefulness remains important considering their large-scale development and low cost.","[{'authorId': '8176885', 'name': 'A.

Emotion-specific response biases differed by age: Older adults were disproportionately more likely to incorrectly label lexical stimuli as happiness, sadness, and surprise and to incorrectly label facial stimuli as disgust and fear. After these biases were controlled, findings suggested that older adults were less accurate at identifying emotions than were young adults, but the pattern differed across emotions and task types. The lexical task showed stronger age differences than the facial task, and for lexical stimuli, age groups differed in accuracy for all emotional states except fear.

Unfortunately, this research has lacked theoretical guidance and has treated student motivation as a construct that varies only in quantity, ignoring existing theory that suggests student motivation is best understood as a construct that differs in quality (i.e., intrinsic motivation). To create two new measures that incorporate theoretical explanations of student motivation, three studies (N = 1,067) were undertaken using self-determination theory (SDT) to operationalize students’ intrinsic motivation as a product of basic psychological need satisfaction. In the first two studies, the Student Psychological Needs Scale and the Intrinsic Motivation to Learn Scale were developed and validated. In the third study, parallel mediation analyses supported SDT’s prediction that the fulfillment of students’ psychological needs (i.e., autonomy, competence, relatedness) would mediate the relationship between personalized education practices and intrinsic motivation to learn.","[{'authorId': '119076817', 'name': 'Zachary W.

However, directly applying conventional topic models (e.g. LDA and PLSA) on such short texts may not work well. The fundamental reason lies in that conventional topic models implicitly capture the document-level word co-occurrence patterns to reveal topics, and thus suffer from the severe data sparsity in short documents. In this paper, we propose a novel way for modeling topics in short texts, referred as biterm topic model (BTM). Specifically, in BTM we learn the topics by directly modeling the generation of word co-occurrence patterns (i.e. biterms) in the whole corpus. The major advantages of BTM are that 1) BTM explicitly models the word co-occurrence patterns to enhance the topic learning; and 2) BTM uses the aggregated patterns in the whole corpus for learning topics to solve the problem of sparse word co-occurrence patterns at document-level. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world short text collections. The results demonstrate that our approach can discover more prominent and coherent topics, and significantly outperform baseline methods on several evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we find that BTM can outperform LDA even on normal texts, showing the potential generality and wider usage of the new topic model.","[{'authorId': '2117851536', 'name': 'Xiaohui Yan'}, {'authorId': '1777025', 'name': 'J.

Understanding the psychological effects on children and young people, in the context of known risk factors is crucial to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This study set out to explore how mental health symptoms in children and adolescents changed over a month of full lockdown in the United Kingdom in response to the pandemic. Methods UK‐based parents and carers (n = 2673) of school‐aged children and young people aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their child's mental health at two time points between March and May 2020, during early lockdown. The survey examined changes in emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention. Results The findings highlighted particular deteriorations in mental health symptoms among preadolescent children, which translated to a 10% increase in those meeting possible/probable caseness criteria for emotional symptoms, a 20% increase in hyperactivity/inattention, and a 35% increase in conduct problems. In contrast, changes among adolescents were smaller (4% and 8% increase for hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems, respectively) with a small reduction in emotional symptoms (reflecting a 3% reduction in caseness). Overall, there were few differences in change in symptoms or caseness over time according to demographic characteristics, but children and young people in low income households and those with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders exhibited elevated symptoms (and caseness) at both time points. Conclusions The findings highlight important areas of concern in terms of the potential impact of the first national lockdown on children and young people's adjustment. Developing an understanding of who has been most severely affected by the pandemic, and in what ways, is crucial in order to target effective support where it is most needed.","[{'authorId': '40277093', 'name': 'Polly Waite'}, {'authorId': '50708689', 'name': 'S.

Resultados: observou-se que o ECRE adaptativo (ECRE-AD) esteve positivamente associado aos dois tipos de bem-estar, enquanto o ECRE nao adaptativo (ECRE-NA) o fez na direcao oposta. Conclusoes: Este estudo mostra a contribuicao explicativa do uso diferencial do ECRE com os niveis de bem-estar dos estudantes universitarios. Os resultados poderiam ser uma contribuicao para o desenho de programas de promocao e prevencao da saude nessa populacao, uma vez que sentimentos de bem-estar influenciam as formas de enfrentamento das demandas academicas. EnglishIn recent years it has been proposed that cognitive strategies of emotional regulation (CSER) would have predictive capacity on different indicators of well-being, since some of them would be effective to directly increase the experience of positive emotions and lessen the negative ones. Objective: This investigation aimed to analyze the explanatory contribution of using CSER to influence the levels of subjective well-being (SWB) and psychological well-being (PWB) in university students, because this population is characterized by its particular vulnerability due to the demands of academic life. Method: Eighty-four (84) university students of the psychology program from the National University of Mar del Plata were evaluated, whose average age was 23 years old. Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the data. Results: Adaptive CSER (CSER- AD) were found to be positively associated with both types of well-being, while non-adaptive CSER (CSER-NA) did so in the opposite direction. Conclusions: This study shows the explanatory contribution of the differential use of CSER in university students’ well-being levels. The results could contribute to design health promotion and prevention programs in this population, given that feelings of well-being influence the coping skills for facing the academic demands.","[{'authorId': '120148378', 'name': 'C.

This state of emergency means that the population must comply with strict rules such as lockdown (confinement to their homes except for essential trips) and social distancing. The aim of this study was to examine the psychological state of the general population in a sample recruited in Northern Spain. Sociodemographic and psychological data were gathered, assessing variables such as stress, anxiety, and depression. A questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the lockdown and three weeks later. The sample was recruited using an online questionnaire by means of a non-probabilistic snowball sampling methodology. A total of 1,933 people participated in this study. The results reveal that more than a quarter of the participants have reported symptoms of depression (27.5%), anxiety (26.9%) and stress (26.5%) and as the time spent in lockdown has progressed, psychological symptoms have risen. In relation to gender, data indicate that men have higher levels of depression than women, and similar levels of anxiety and stress. Greater symptomatology has also been found among the younger population and in people with chronic diseases. We discuss the need to continue carrying out these types of studies to prevent and treat psychological problems that could emerge amidst this pandemic.","[{'authorId': '1485991190', 'name': 'Naiara Ozamiz-Etxebarria'}, {'authorId': '115237513', 'name': 'Nahia Idoiaga Mondragón'}, {'authorId': '1752523856', 'name': 'Maria Dosil Santamaria'}, {'authorId': '1752554395', 'name': 'Maitane Picaza Gorrotxategi'}]",190.0,,76.0,Psychological Symptoms During the Two Stages of Lockdown in Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Investigation in a Sample of Citizens in Northern Spain,2020.0

Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NSC) may manifest with complex behavioral, attentional, and emotional sequelae. We characterized higher-level brain connectivity in adolescent NSC patients in response to emotional frustration.


METHODS
Surgically corrected patients age >9 with NSC were age/gender/handedness matched to controls. Patients participated in a GoNoGo task, structured as 'win/lose/recovery' paradigms; 'Win' allowed point increases, 'lose' led to net negative points, and 'recovery' allowed re-accumulation. BioImage Suite was used to analyze whole-brain intrinsic connectivity between tasks with cluster-corrected group-level T-maps. P<0.05 was significant.


RESULTS
Seven unilateral-coronal (ULC; average age 12.2 years), six metopic (average age 11.5 years), and respective matched controls were included. ULC had worse emotional regulation scores on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function survey(p=0.065) and performed poorly on the GoNoGo task(p<0.001). Metopics had four regions of interest (ROI) with majority decreased activity compared to controls, and few differences between tasks. ULC had eleven ROIs, majority decreased during 'win' and 'lose', but all increased during 'recovery'. Metopic patients had decreased blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal in the posterior cingulate(p=0.017) and middle temporal gyrus(MTG;p=0.042). ULC had decreased signal in the posterior cingulate(p=0.023), MTG(p=0.027), and thalamus(p=0.033), but increased signal in the cuneus(p=0.009) and cerebellum(p=0.009). R-ULC, but not metopic/controls, had increased right brain activity in the caudate(p=0.030), thalamus(p=0.011), temporal lobe(p=0.012), and cerebellum(p=0.029).


CONCLUSIONS
ULC patients may have emotional dyregulation in response to frustration while metopic patients may have attenuated emotional reactions. Evidence of R-ULC brain laterality suggest that the area of suture fusion may contribute to the mechanism of dysfunction.","[{'authorId': '9898026', 'name': 'R.

Due to its relationship with psychosocial adjustment, a significant number of instruments have been developed to assess emotion regulation in a reliable and valid manner. Among these, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross and John, 2003) is one of the most widely used, having shown good psychometric properties with adult samples from different cultures. Studies of validation in children and adolescents are, however, scarce and have only been developed for the Australian and Portuguese populations. The aim of this study was to validate the Spanish version of the ERQ for use in adolescents and determine possible differences according to the gender and age of young people. The sample consisted of 2060 adolescents (52.1% boys). Exploratory and Confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA), multi-group analysis and Two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were performed and the percentiles calculated. The results of the AFE and CFA corroborated the existence of two factors related to the emotion regulation strategies of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, showing acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Both factors also showed good criterion validity with personality traits, self-esteem, and social anxiety. Differences in cognitive reappraisal were found with regard to age, with younger students exhibiting the greatest mastery of this strategy. Gender differences were observed regarding the expressive suppression strategy, with boys being more likely to use this strategy than girls. A gender-age interaction effect was also observed, revealing that the use of the expressive suppression strategy did not vary by age in girls, and was more widely used by boys aged 12–14 years than those aged 15–16 years. However, we found evidence of measurement invariance across sex and age groups. The results suggest that the ERQ is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used to evaluate emotion regulation strategies in adolescents.","[{'authorId': '1405022955', 'name': 'Olga Gómez-Ortiz'}, {'authorId': '6551586', 'name': 'E.

Job demands include quantitative role overload and surface acting to represent the quantitative and qualitative aspects of job demands. Cynicism is introduced as a state where one’s energy resource is lost. The results of this study show that surface acting has a negative relationship with JAW, but quantitative role overload has no relationship with JAW. High levels of quantitative role overload exacerbate the negative relationship between surface acting and JAW. Cynicism also exacerbates the negative relationship between surface acting and JAW but does not have any moderating effect in the relationship between quantitative role overload and JAW. These results are consistent with the relationships predicted by resource loss spiral and resource loss cycle. The resource loss spiral means that resource loss, caused by handling with a quantitative role overload, lessens the employee’s ability to cope with surface acting. The resource loss cycle represents a vicious circle that amplifies the resource loss caused by surface acting. Surface acting reduces the level of one’s resources. Furthermore, surface acting reduces JAW and resources more strongly when an individual has low levels of previous energy resources than it reduces JAW and resources when he or she has high levels of previous energy resources.","[{'authorId': '119226606', 'name': 'Seongwook Ha'}]",10.0,,38.0,Surface Acting and Job-Related Affective Wellbeing: Preventing Resource Loss Spiral and Resource Loss Cycle for Sustainable Workplaces,2018.0
b8b8d008cb5e6f87c76be46acc9c331d6d49e569,"BACKGROUND
A better understanding of the nature and etiology of conduct disorder (CD) can inform nosology and vice versa. We posit that any prevalent form of psychopathology, including CD, can be best understood if it is studied in the context of other correlated forms of child and adolescent psychopathology using formal models to guide inquiry.


METHODS
Review of both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of the place of CD in the phenotypic and causal structure of prevalent psychopathology, with an emphasis on similarities and differences between CD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Papers were located using Web of Science by topic searches with no restriction on year of publication.


RESULTS
Although some important nosologic questions remain unanswered, the dimensional phenotype of CD is well defined. CD differs from other disorders in its correlates, associated impairment, and course. Nonetheless, it is robustly correlated with many other prevalent dimensions of psychopathology both concurrently and predictively, including both other 'externalizing' disorders and some 'internalizing' disorders. Based on emerging evidence, we hypothesize that these concurrent and predictive correlations result primarily from widespread genetic pleiotropy, with some genetic factors nonspecifically influencing risk for multiple correlated dimensions of psychopathology. In contrast, environmental influences mostly act to differentiate dimensions of psychopathology from one another both concurrently and over time. CD and ODD share half of their genetic influences, but their genetic etiologies are distinct in other ways. Unlike most other dimensions of psychopathology, half of the genetic influences on CD appear to be unique to CD. In contrast, ODD broadly shares nearly all of its genetic influences with other disorders and has little unique genetic variance.


CONCLUSIONS
Conduct disorder is a relatively distinct syndrome at both phenotypic and etiologic levels, but much is revealed by studying CD in the context of its causal and phenotypic associations with other disorders over time. Advancing and refining formal causal models that specify the common and unique causes and biological mechanisms underlying each correlated dimension of psychopathology should facilitate research on the fundamental nature and nosology of CD.","[{'authorId': '3180373', 'name': 'B.

Its relationship to treatment adherence, however, has not been systematically reviewed. We used meta-analysis to examine the relationship between depression and treatment nonadherence in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases for all studies published by June 2007 and reviewed references of published articles. Meta-analytic procedures were used to estimate the effect size r in a random effects model. Significance values, weighted effect sizes, 95% CIs, and tests of homogeneity of variance were calculated. RESULTS—Results from 47 independent samples showed that depression was significantly associated with nonadherence to the diabetes treatment regimen (z = 9.97, P < 0.0001). The weighted effect size was near the medium range (r = 0.21, 95% CI 0.17–0.25). Moderator analyses showed that the effect was significantly larger in studies that measured self-care as a continuous versus categorical variable (P = 0.001). Effect sizes were largest for missed medical appointments and composite measures of self-care (r values = 0.31, 0.29). Moderation analyses suggest that effects for most other types of self-care are also near the medium range, especially in studies with stronger methodologies. CONCLUSIONS—These findings demonstrate a significant association between depression and treatment nonadherence in patients with diabetes. Studies that used stronger methodologies had larger effects. Treatment nonadherence may represent an important pathway between depression and worse diabetes clinical outcomes.","[{'authorId': '30662256', 'name': 'Jeffrey S.

This study examined the factor structure, composite reliability, convergent validity, and gender invariance of the PSS-10 among 524 UK university students. Four distinct factor models (one-factor, correlated two-factor, correlated three-factor, and bifactor) were examined using confirmatory factor analysis. The totality of results supported a bifactor solution. Multi-group analysis established configural, metric, and scalar invariance of this model across gender. This study supports the use of total PSS-10 scores with UK university students and suggests the scale is not significantly affected by gender bias.","[{'authorId': '3647959', 'name': 'A.

Although it has been hypothesized that the diabetes-depression relation is bidirectional, few studies have addressed this hypothesis in a prospective setting.


METHODS
A total of 65 381 women aged 50 to 75 years in 1996 were observed until 2006. Clinical depression was defined as having diagnosed depression or using antidepressants, and depressed mood was defined as having clinical depression or severe depressive symptoms, ie, a 5-item Mental Health Index (MHI-5) score of 52 or less. Self-reported type 2 diabetes mellitus was confirmed by means of a supplementary questionnaire validated by medical record review.


RESULTS
During 10 years of follow-up (531 097 person-years), 2844 incident cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus were documented. Compared with referents (MHI-5 score of 86-100) who had the best depressive symptom scores, participants with increased severity of symptoms (MHI-5 scores of 76-85 or 53-75, or depressed mood) showed a monotonic elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes (P for trend = .002 in the multivariable-adjusted model). The relative risk for individuals with depressed mood was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.30) after adjustment for various covariates, and participants using antidepressants were at a particularly higher relative risk (1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.41). In a parallel analysis, 7415 cases of incident clinical depression were documented (474 722 person-years). Compared with nondiabetic subjects, those with diabetes had a relative risk (95% CI) of developing clinical depression after controlling for all covariates of 1.29 (1.18-1.40), and it was 1.25 (1.09-1.42), 1.24 (1.09-1.41), and 1.53 (1.26-1.85) in diabetic subjects without medications, with oral hypoglycemic agents, and with insulin therapy, respectively. These associations remained significant after adjustment for diabetes-related comorbidities.


CONCLUSION
Our results provide compelling evidence that the diabetes-depression association is bidirectional.","[{'authorId': '145651229', 'name': 'A. Pan'}, {'authorId': '145775697', 'name': 'M.

Along with sense of job satisfaction and teaching efficacy, two types of stress (workload and student behavior stress) were examined. The sample included 664 elementary and secondary school teachers from British Columbia and Ontario, Canada. Participants completed an online questionnaire about the teacher outcomes, perceived school climate, and beliefs about socia-emotional learning (SEL). Structural equation modeling was used to examine an explanatory model of the variables. Of the 2 SEL beliefs examined, teachers' comfort in implementing SEL had the most powerful impact. Of the 4 school climate factors examined, teachers' perceptions of students' motivation and behavior had the most powerful impact. Both of these variables significantly predicted sense of stress, teaching efficacy, and job satisfaction among the participants. Among the outcome variables, perceived stress related to students' behavior was negatively associated with sense of teaching efficacy. In addition, perceived stress related to workload and sense of teaching efficacy were directly related to sense of job satisfaction.

An interesting instrument in this respect is the FEEL-KJ because it measures 7 adaptive and 5 maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in response to three different emotions. However, the FEEL-KJ has not yet been validated extensively. Therefore, the current study aims to test the internal structure and validity of the FEEL-KJ in a large sample of Dutch-speaking Belgian children and adolescents (N = 1102, 8–18 years old). The investigation of the internal structure confirms earlier reports of a two-factor structure with Adaptive and Maladaptive Emotion Regulation as overarching categories. However, it also suggests that the two-factor model is more complex than what was previously assumed. The evaluation of the FEEL-KJ validity furthermore provides evidence for its construct and external validity. In sum, the current study confirms that the FEEL-KJ is a valuable and reliable measure of emotion regulation strategies in children and adolescents.","[{'authorId': '4288646', 'name': 'Emiel Cracco'}, {'authorId': '5583738', 'name': 'Kim van Durme'}, {'authorId': '3768756', 'name': 'C.

In the current study we aimed to examine effects of frustration on brain activity while performing a well-learned task in participants with low and high tolerance for arousal. Prior to the functional magnetic resonance imaging session, the subjects underwent 2 weeks of Braille reading training. Frustration induction was obtained by using a novel highly difficult tactile task based on discrimination of Braille-like raised dots patterns and negative feedback. Effectiveness of this procedure has been confirmed in a pilot study using galvanic skin response and questionnaires. Brain activation pattern during tactile discrimination task before and after frustration were compared directly. Results revealed changes in brain activity in structures mostly reported in acute stress studies: striatum, cingulate cortex, insula, middle frontal gyrus and precuneus and in structures engaged in tactile Braille discrimination: SI and SII. Temperament type affected activation pattern. Subjects with low tolerance for arousal showed higher activation in the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule than high reactivity group. Even though performance in the discrimination trials following frustration was unaltered, we observed increased activity of primary and secondary somatosensory cortex processing the tactile information. We interpret this effect as an indicator of additional involvement required to counteract the effects of frustration.","[{'authorId': '5542266', 'name': 'Maria Bierzyńska'}, {'authorId': '40401798', 'name': 'M.

The model presented proposes that specific voluntary behaviors (e.g., breath, vocalizations, and posture), which characterize ancient rituals and form the core of contemplative practices, can trigger a physiological state mediated by vagal pathways that fosters health and optimizes subjective experiences. The model emphasizes that, in order for the positive benefits of contemplative practices to be experienced, the rituals associated with contemplative practices (e.g., chants, prayers, meditation, and dance) must be performed in a context defined by physical features that are calming and soothing and promote feelings of safety.","[{'authorId': '4226466', 'name': 'S.

A chatbot is a software system that allows you to simulate real conversations between devices and users by means of a conversational interface (CI). After introducing the chatbot concept, focusing on its advantages and issues, we will present two domains of use in which chatbot interfaces can be effective: healthcare and smart home. For carrying out simple tasks such as finding information or triggering operations, users need an easy-to-use and to an easy-to-learn system to communicate with. To face this, conversational interfaces represent the latest trend in the field of digital design. For studying the communicability aspects of a CI, we carried out a user test to compare traditional and chatbot interfaces. This paper aims at evaluating the benefits at the communicability level of a chatbot in comparison to traditional GUI for incrementing the effectiveness and efficacy of communication between users and the system specifically for users with poor attitude in using technologies. In details, we evaluated the communicability of two prototypes that can be used to solve simple tasks in order to favour user inclusion, including everyone with very little exposure to technologies.","[{'authorId': '1698025', 'name': 'S.

Stratified proportionate probability sample method was used to select the 265 SMEs. The study applied a structural equation model (SEM) to analyze the proposed research hypotheses by using PLS-SEM. This research examines the direct and indirect effects of strategic planning on the performance of SMEs using the SEM test. The results indicate the positive effect of managerial skills on SMEs’ performance and also suggested that strategic planning mediates the relationship between managerial skills and SMEs’ performance. In addition, the role of managerial skills on the usage of the company’s resources is highly influential through strategic planning. Strategic planning has been found to impact significantly and positively on the relationship between managerial skills and performance of SMEs in Punjab, Pakistan. The findings suggested that, in devising appropriate strategies for SMEs, the effect of managerial skills on the utilization of the firm’s resources can be more effective to the firm’s performance. In short, the utilization of a firm’s resources through a proper planning is more essential for the sustainability of SMEs.","[{'authorId': '2074278756', 'name': 'Israr Ahmad'}, {'authorId': '95834188', 'name': 'S.

To test our hypotheses, we developed a new 13-item measure of perceived fear in organisations and tested it in 20 sites across two organisations (N ≡ 209). Culture variables measured were innovative leadership culture, and communication culture.

ba0a3443779a40275eb207e71b04e357e86dc9d1,"Burnout syndrome is a psychological condition experienced in the workplace that is characterized by exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment (1). Burnout syndrome can manifest as physical and emotional health problems. Work-related consequences can include clinician dissatisfaction, decreased quality of care delivered to patients, medical errors, unjustified absenteeism, and intention to leave the organization. Health care organizations and leaders within the critical care community are increasingly concerned about the development of burnout syndrome among intensive care unit (ICU) health care professionals (2, 3). These concerns are fueled by growing awareness of the major adverse consequences burnout can have on individual clinicians, health care organizations, and patients. An official statement addressing burnout syndrome among ICU health care professionals was prepared jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN), and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and was published simultaneously in journals of the participating societies, including the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (4) The statement discusses the prevalence, contributing factors, diagnosis, consequences, prevention, and treatment of burnout syndrome in ICU physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals. This editorial expands on the research needs identified by the multisociety writing panel. Four priorities are highlighted for future research: the diagnosis of burnout syndrome in critical care health care professionals, the general effect of burnout syndrome, preventative measures and treatments, and the dissemination and implementation of effective interventions. Research on burnout syndrome requires the development and validation of appropriate tools for identifying and measuring the severity of the syndrome. The Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) is the most commonly used instrument for the measurement of burnout syndrome (1, 5, 6). The original MBI-HSS is based on a three-factor conceptualization of burnout, which includes the constructs of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Self-assessment instruments of this type are expected to measure the same constructs over a variety of subject cohorts and across repeated applications to the same subjects over time. If those expectations hold true in practice, the analyses of the scores are acceptable and yield meaningful results. However, there have been inconsistent findings based on the three-factor model for the MBI-HSS related to measurement invariance (7–9). Dramatic, unexplained variations in prevalence have been reported. There is also a question of whether the three-factor conceptualization of burnout embedded in the MBI-HSS appropriately defines burnout in the critical care health care professional. Future research should focus on developing briefer screening tests for burnout syndrome, examining the validity of diagnostic tests in the ICU health care professionals specifically, the validity of diagnostic instruments over time, and the responsiveness of the instrument to detect meaningful improvement in symptoms. Other than self-assessment instruments, there are no binding diagnostic criteria for burnout that enable differentiation between adverse consequences of the work environment and primary psychiatric disorders. To enable this differentiation, health care organizations may also benefit from developing a brief screening questionnaire to implement during the hiring of critical care health care professionals. Using existing instruments, estimates of the prevalence of burnout among critical care nurses and physicians have ranged from 25% to 80%, and the average severity has ranged from mild to severe (3, 10, 11) The temporal relationship between burnout and the ICU environment is poorly understood because all these studies have been cross-sectional in design. Therefore, prospective cohort studies are needed to more accurately define the prevalence of burnout and determine how quickly burnout develops. Assessing baseline burnout levels before commencing work in the ICU and repeated measures over time will help address the question of temporality. Other questions need to be addressed to fully understand the effect of burnout on critical care health care professionals and","[{'authorId': '5026369', 'name': 'M.

Compared with individuals in the no-talk condition, those in the talk alone and validate conditions had a lower level of intrusive thoughts in the 2-day interim, and they had lower perceived stress when reexposed to the stressor.

The goal of the present investigation was to provide a meta-analytic review of the research on affect and parenting in nonclinical samples. Design. The authors conducted analyses on the overall mean effect size for 63 studies (k = 18,211). Affect was coded as either positive or negative, and parenting behavior was coded as either supportive-positive or harsh-negative. Moderators included definition of affect, time frame of measurement, reporter, child age, and parent gender. Results. The authors' analyses support the association between parental affect and parenting behavior, and this relation was consistent across types of affect and parenting, as well as gender of parent. Significant methodological moderators of these relations include time frame match and reporter match. Child age moderated the relation between negative affect and supportive-positive parenting, but not harsh-negative parenting. Last, both negative and positive affect showed specificity in their association with parenting behavior. Conclusion. Parental affect appears to be a reliable correlate of parenting behaviors in the general population. In addition, consistent with theory (T. Dix, 1991), negative affect was more strongly related to hostile parenting, and positive affect was more strongly related to supportive parenting. Methodological factors, such as time frame of measurement and reporter, as well as demographic variables, should be carefully considered in the design and interpretation of future studies of parental affect and parenting behaviors.","[{'authorId': '6980111', 'name': 'S.

bad09cb7f5a25c755bba851f8dc27e0308e8236f,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by chronically persistent worry and therefore requires effective long-term treatment. This article reviews the benefits and risks associated with various pharmacologic and psychological therapies to assess their ability to achieve the elimination of GAD symptomatology and restoration of normal function. Psychotherapeutic approaches such as applied relaxation, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have all been shown to be effective when used as monotherapies and may be beneficial when used adjunctively. Current effective pharmacotherapies for patients with GAD include anxiolytic benzodiazepines, buspirone, and antidepressants including venlafaxine and paroxetine. Benzodiazepines have long been used to treat anxiety and are particularly appropriate in short-term treatment situations; however, their adverse side-effect profile and their inability to treat depression commonly comorbid with GAD renders them less than ideal in many situations. Buspirone has demonstrated anxiolytic benefits but, like benzodiazepines, shows negligible antidepressant action. Antidepressants like paroxetine and venlafaxine are not only effective antidepressants but also effective anxiolytics, thus implying their special ability to treat GAD and concurrent depression, even over the long-term.","[{'authorId': '145194146', 'name': 'J.

This review takes an evolutionary perspective and characterizes emotion in terms of response tendencies. Emotion regulation is defined and distinguished from coping, mood regulation, defense, and affect regulation. In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground. According to a process model of emotion regulation, emotion may be regulated at five points in the emotion generative process: (a) selection of the situation, (b) modification of the situation, (c) deployment of attention, (d) change of cognitions, and (e) modulation of responses. The field of emotion regulation promises new insights into age-old questions about how people manage their emotions.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Travel, tourism and hospitality, in particular, has been massively impacted by the lockdowns used to maintain social distance to manage the disease. Robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interactions have gained an increased presence to help manage the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals, airports, transportation systems, recreation and scenic areas, hotels, restaurants, and communities in general. Humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and other intelligent robots are used in many different ways to reduce human contact and the potential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including delivering materials, disinfecting and sterilizing public spaces, detecting or measuring body temperature, providing safety or security, and comforting and entertaining patients. While controversial in the past due to concerns over job losses and data privacy, the adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence in travel and tourism will likely continue after the COVID-19 pandemic becomes less serious. Tourism scholars should seize this opportunity to develop robotic applications that enhance tourist experiences, the protection of natural and cultural resources, citizen participation in tourism development decision making, and the emergence of new ‘high-touch’ employment opportunities for travel, tourism and hospitality workers.","[{'authorId': '10376049', 'name': 'Zhanjing Zeng'}, {'authorId': '2143057148', 'name': 'Po-Ju Chen'}, {'authorId': '1911379', 'name': 'A.

Obsessive passion, characterized by a rigid and defensive mode of functioning, predicted greater performance in domains both related and unrelated to the passionate activity in response to exposure to failure information. Conversely, harmonious passion, characterized by a flexible, nondefensive mode of functioning, was found to be unaffected by success or failure information. These performance effects were deeply ingrained, did not require conscious thought, and were automatically activated after unconscious exposure to failure-related words. In addition, the present research evinced that following failure information, obsessive passion predicted increases of performance through its effect on fear of failure.

A stratified sample of 512 first-year university students was used. The results showed that pace and amount of work, and cognitive demands had a significant and negative correlation with engagement. However, only cognitive demands was found to be a significant predictor of engagement in the second and third step of the regression analysis and became insignificant in the fourth and final step of the analysis when personality characteristics were added. All the resources had significant and positive correlations with engagement, but only support from lecturers and opportunities for growth and development were found significant predictors of engagement. In the fourth and final step of the regression analysis, the only significant resource was opportunities for growth and development.

In order to build a human-computer interface that is sensitive to the user's expressed emotion, we investigated spectral, prosodic, and verbal cues in the user's utterance. Based on these cues, we showed that the classification system achieved accuracies comparable to human performance.

Lockdown rules imposed to counteract the rapid growth of COVID-19, mainly social restrictions, have represented a risk factor for developing depressive and anxious symptoms. The research aims are to explore the effect of coping strategies and perceived social support on depressive and anxious symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-six healthy people (46 males, mean age = 39.3; SD = 16.6) completed through on-line platform: Socio-demographic questionnaire, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), 3 weeks after the imposition of lockdown restrictions. SCL-90-R Depression scores showed significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (r = 0.85; p = 0.001) and Avoidant (r = 0.34; p = 0.018), a significant negative correlation with MSPSS Family support (r = −0.43; p = 0.003). SCL-90-R Anxiety scores showed a significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (r = 0.72; p = 0.001) and Avoidant (r = 0.35; p = 0.016). No significant correlations between both CISS Emotion and Avoidant scales with social support emerged. Two Multiple Linear Regression analysis were performed using, respectively, SCL-90-R Depression and Anxiety scores as dependent variables, and the CISS and MSPSS scales, age, and gender as predictors. The first regression model (R2 = 0.78; adjusted R2 = 0.75) revealed CISS Emotion (β = 0.83; p = 0.001) and MSPSS Family support (β = −0.24; p = 0.004) had a predictive effect on SCL-90-R Depression scores. The second regression model (R2 = 0.52; adjusted R2 = 0.472) revealed that only CISS Emotion (β = 0.71; p = 0.001) predicted the SCL-90-R Anxiety scores. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, coping focus on emotions seemed to increase anxious and depressive symptoms, probably due to the uncontrollable nature of the stressful event and the high emotional response. Family support which reduces the sense of loneliness had an exclusive role in mitigating depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of promoting psychological strategies to improve emotional regulation skills, reducing isolation from family, to prevent mood symptomatology in healthy citizens during large-scale health crises.","[{'authorId': '30846533', 'name': 'R.

However, in humans it is unclear how SI and SII contribute to the encoding of nociceptive stimulus intensity. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) we recorded responses in SI and SII in eight healthy humans to four different intensities of selectively nociceptive laser stimuli delivered to the dorsum of the right hand. Subjects' pain ratings correlated highly with the applied stimulus intensity. Activation of contralateral SI and bilateral SII showed a significant positive correlation with stimulus intensity. However, the type of dependence on stimulus intensity was different for SI and SII. The relation between SI activity and stimulus intensity resembled an exponential function and matched closely the subjects' pain ratings. In contrast, SII activity showed an S-shaped function with a sharp increase in amplitude only at a stimulus intensity well above pain threshold. The activation pattern of SI suggests participation of SI in the discriminative perception of pain intensity. In contrast, the all-or-none-like activation pattern of SII points against a significant contribution of SII to the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain perception. Instead, SII may subserve recognition of the noxious nature and attention toward painful stimuli.","[{'authorId': '3234752', 'name': 'L. Timmermann'}, {'authorId': '1993262', 'name': 'M.

This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regressions were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people (P<0.001). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 (≥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness.

Drawing on three primary bodies of literature, the theory of reasoned action, the extended valence framework, and expectation-confirmation theory, this study synthesizes a model of consumer trust and satisfaction in the context of e-commerce. The model considers not only how consumers formulate their prepurchase decisions, but also how they form their long-term relationships with the same website vendor by comparing their prepurchase expectations to their actual purchase outcome. The results indicate that trust directly and indirectly affects a consumer's purchase decision in combination with perceived risk and perceived benefit, and also that trust has a longer term impact on consumer e-loyalty through satisfaction. Thus, this study extends our understanding of consumer Internet transaction behavior as a three-fold (prepurchase, purchase, and postpurchase) process, and it recognizes the crucial, multiple roles that trust plays in this process.

It is a personality trait of hopefulness, rather than having hope for the prisoners restructuring their future. Self-efficacy refers to the belief that individuals have regarding their ability to perform necessary tasks to achieve goals.

Somatic stimuli were applied to the lips, face, hand, trunk, and foot of 18 human subjects. Activity patterns were transposed onto three‐dimensional magnetic resonance images of the brain so that the location of activity associated with the different stimuli could be related to specific regions of the cortex. There were several consistent findings. First, there were three regions of activity in the lateral sulcus associated with stimulation of the contralateral body. The most consistent locus of activation was on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus, continuing onto the operculum. The other two areas, one rostral and one caudal to this large central area, were smaller and were activated less consistently. Second, when activity patterns in the large central area resulting from stimulation of all body parts were considered, this region appeared to contain two fields that corresponded in location and somatotopic organization to the second somatosensory area (SII) and the parietal ventral area (PV). Finally, patterns of activation within SII and PV were somewhat variable across subjects. Repeated within‐subject stimulus presentation indicated that differences across subjects were not due to inconsistent stimulus presentation.

The effects of emotional disclosure were equivalent whether participants thought they were disclosing to a chatbot or to a person. This study advances current understanding of disclosure and whether its impact is altered by technology, providing support for media equivalency as a primary mechanism for the consequences of disclosing to a chatbot.","[{'authorId': '2049047331', 'name': 'A.

The present study examined 39 heterosexual couples' joint weight status (both partners are healthy-weight, both overweight, 1 healthy-weight, and 1 overweight) as a predictor of 2 interpersonal emotional patterns during a discussion of their shared lifestyle choices. The first pattern, coregulation, is one in which partners' coupled emotions show a dampening pattern over time and ultimately return to homeostatic levels. The second, codysregulation, is one in which partners' coupled emotions are amplified away from homeostatic balance. We demonstrate how a coupled linear oscillator (CLO) model (Butner, Amazeen, & Mulvey, 2005) can be used to distinguish coregulation from codysregulation. As predicted, healthy-weight couples and mixed-weight couples in which the man was heavier than the woman displayed coregulation, but overweight couples and mixed-weight couples in which the woman was heavier showed codysregulation. These results suggest that heterosexual couples in which the woman is overweight may face formidable coregulatory challenges that could undermine both partners' well-being. The results also demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between various interpersonal emotional dynamics for understanding connections between interpersonal emotions and health.","[{'authorId': '2012368', 'name': 'R.

The goal of this study was to determine the mediating neuroanatomy of simple phobic symptoms.


METHODS
Positron emission tomography and oxygen 15 were used to measure normalized regional cerebral blood flow in seven subjects with simple phobia during control and provoked states. Stereotactic transformation and statistical parametric mapping techniques were employed to determine the locations of significant activation.


RESULTS
Statistical parametric maps demonstrated significant increases in normalized regional blood flow for the symptomatic state compared with the control state in the anterior cingulate cortex, the insular cortex, the anterior temporal cortex, the somatosensory cortex, the posterior medial orbitofrontal cortex, and the thalamus.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that anxiety associated with the simple phobic symptomatic state is mediated by paralimbic structures. Moreover, activation of somatosensory cortex may reflect tactile imagery as one component of the phobic symptomatic condition.","[{'authorId': '2213047', 'name': 'S.

In this study, participants (N = 255) evaluated a series of avatars in a static context in terms of their androgyny, anthropomorphism, credibility, homophily, attraction, and the likelihood they would choose them during an interaction. The responses to the images were consistent with what would be predicted by uncertainty reduction theory. The results show that the masculinity or femininity (lack of androgyny) of an avatar, as well as anthropomorphism, significantly influence perceptions of avatars. Further, more anthropomorphic avatars were perceived to be more attractive and credible, and people were more likely to choose to be represented by them. Participants reported masculine avatars as less attractive than feminine avatars, and most people reported a preference for human avatars that matched their gender. Practical and theoretical implications of these results for users, designers, and researchers of avatars are discussed.","[{'authorId': '40372043', 'name': 'Kristine L.

Burnout is an increasing problem among the medical fraternity, especially resident doctors. We assessed the relationship between burnout, emotional intelligence and perceived stress in an attempt to explore a probable solution.


METHODS
Residents in the departments of medicine (n=29) and surgery (n=27) were assessed with a specially designed proforma consisting of participant's profile sheet, Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Correlation and mediational analysis were used to analyse the data.


RESULTS
The findings showed a positive correlation of burnout with perceived stress and a negative correlation with trait emotional intelligence (EI). Perceived stress also showed a negative correlation with trait EI. Mediation analysis showed that perceived stress mediates the effect of trait EI on burnout.


CONCLUSION
Enhancing EI through training may be an important intervention for targeting burnout.","[{'authorId': '47520620', 'name': 'M. K. Swami'}, {'authorId': '40144553', 'name': 'D. M.

In 2008, Weeks, Heimberg, and Rodebaugh proposed Fear of Positive Evaluation (FPE) as a second cognitive component in social anxiety. The article presents an overview of FPE, its psycho‐evolutionary theoretical foundation and assessment by the Fear of Positive Evaluation Scale as well as relevant psychometric research on demographic characteristics. The relationship of FPE with a wide range of established dimensions from clinical, personality, and social psychology (i.e., self‐esteem, perfectionism, or quality of life) will be reviewed. The role of FPE for psychological comorbidities such as other anxiety disorders, depression, eating, and substance use disorders as well as for treatment of social anxiety will be discussed. Future research might address questions of causality of FPE relative to related constructs, further data on psychometric properties, as well as on its independence from FNE in longitudinal studies. In sum, FPE seems to be a valid and reliable construct that explains cognitions, emotions, and behavior related to social anxiety at subclinical and clinical levels and therefore enriches the psychometric repertoire in the fields of social psychology, personality, and clinical psychology.","[{'authorId': '3411336', 'name': 'J.

The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.

bee8ff97d0bdcf6a59b6bebe6e93803fda3193df,"Abstract Chronic stress is a risk factor for incident cardiovascular (CV) disease. Emotion regulation is the ability to modulate one’s state or behavior in response to a given situation or stressor, and may mitigate the effect of chronic stress on CV disease risk. Data from a cohort of 754 community-dwelling young to middle-aged adults who were assessed between 2007 and 2012 on stress, emotion regulation, and CV risk measures were used to test the hypothesis that emotion regulation mitigates the effect of chronic stress on CV risk. Emotion regulation was measured using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). We created a composite stress score using data from the Cumulative Adversity Interview and the Perceived Stress Scale. Our outcomes included blood pressure, body mass index, and insulin resistance separately and combined into a composite CV risk score. Covariates included age, sex, race, years of education, and smoking status. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate associations between stress measures and CV risk among participants and the impact of emotion regulation (DERS scores) on this association. We found that composite stress interacted significantly with the DERS score to affect CV risk (p = .007). A median split of the DERS scores indicated that CV risk was associated with the composite stress score in the fully adjusted model (ß = 0.206; p = .005) among participants with low emotion regulation, but not among those with high emotion regulation (ß = 0.048; p = .59). Chronic stress was associated with CV risk only among participants with poor emotion regulation. Emotion regulation is a teachable skill, and may play a role in preventing CV disease. Lay summary Emotion regulation is the ability to modify one’s reaction to a negative or stressful event, and is a teachable skill. Effective emotion regulation dampens the negative effect of chronic stress on the body, which may reduce risk for cardiovascular disease.","[{'authorId': '47644282', 'name': 'B.

bf16d6503b6bd4af0705562eec83ef01009bc11e,"Introduction Hormonal fluctuations associated with female reproductive life events may precipitate or worsen affective episodes in women with bipolar disorder (BD). Previous studies have shown that women with BD report higher rates of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) than controls. Further, bipolar women who report premenstrual worsening of mood display a worse course of their bipolar illness. Despite this, the neural correlates of comorbid BD and PMDD have not been investigated. Methodology Eighty-five [CTRL, n = 25; PMDD, n = 20; BD, n = 21; BD with comorbid PMDD (BDPMDD), n = 19], regularly cycling women, not on hormonal contraception, underwent two MRI scans: during their mid-follicular and late luteal menstrual phases. We investigated resting-state functional connectivity (Rs-FC), cortical thickness, and subcortical volumes of brain regions associated with the pathophysiology of BD and PMDD between groups, in the mid-follicular and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. All BD subjects were euthymic for at least 2 months prior to study entry. Results Women in the BDPMDD group displayed greater disruption in biological rhythms and more subthreshold depressive and anxious symptoms through the menstrual cycle compared to other groups. Rs-FC was increased between the L-hippocampus and R-frontal cortex and decreased between the R-hippocampus and R-premotor cortex in BDPMDD vs. BD (FDR-corrected, p < 0.05). Cortical thickness analysis revealed decreased cortical thickness of the L-pericalcarine, L-superior parietal, R-middle temporal, R-rostral middle frontal, and L-superior frontal, as well as increased cortical thickness of the L-superior temporal gyri in BDPMDD compared to BD. We also found increased left-caudate volume in BDPMDD vs. BD (pCORR < 0.05). Conclusion Women with BD and comorbid PMDD display a distinct clinical and neurobiological phenotype of BD, which suggests differential sensitivity to endogenous hormones.","[{'authorId': '38792205', 'name': 'S.

bf22be73ee575d6f4bba9cb76d5747399a740e8b,"Background: Emotional Intelligence (EI) has become a key factor in educational environments, which facilitates and contributes to the mental well-being of teachers, and therefore, favours the teaching and learning process. However, education professionals are under constant stress. This stress is caused by a large number of social interactions, the new skills to be acquired, and the workload, developing in many situations the Burnout Syndrome (BS). Methods and Results: The study presents a systematic review, paying special attention to the scientific literature that combines IE and BS in the work performance of teachers as fundamental factors in the work carried out by educators at different educational stages, as well as the influence they have on the quality of the teaching-learning process. The Web of Science (WOS) has been used as a database, obtaining a total of 36 scientific articles intimately related to the topic of the work, published between 2005 and 2017. Many studies show that teachers are increasingly experiencing high feelings of stress, which affect the quality of education, as well as the relevance of developing emotional intelligence, which helps prevent these negative feelings from appearing. Conclusions: EI is a capacity that should be developed in teachers, since it gives the individual the ability to regulate his emotions, making him stronger in terms of decision-making in daily situations in the teaching environments, as well as being a key factor for the success of education. Through the positive reinforcement of EI, levels of stress and anxiety that worry society so much are reduced, since this avoids the feeling of frustration before their professional realisation, which leads to improved teaching practice, health and mental well-being of teachers.","[{'authorId': '2131084156', 'name': 'Pilar Puertas Molero'}, {'authorId': '116337449', 'name': 'F.

Dialogue systems and conversational agents can bring a lot into healthcare to reduce cost, increase efficiency and provide continuing care, albeit its infancy and complexity about building natural dialogues. However, the design guidelines to design dialogues for conversational agents are usually based on common knowledge, and less frequently on empirical evidence. For example, the use of emojis in conversational agent dialogues is still a debated issue, and the added value of adding such graphical elements is mainly anecdotal. In this work, we present an empirical study comparing users feedback when interacting with chatbot applications that use different dialogue styles, i.e., plain text or text with emoji, when asking different health related questions. The analysis found that when participants had to score an interaction with a chatbot that asks personal questions on their mental wellbeing, they rated the interaction with higher scores with respect to enjoyment, attitude and confidence. Differently, participants rated with lower scores a chatbot that uses emojis when asking information on their physical wellbeing compared to a dialogue with plain text. We believe this work can contribute to the research on integrating conversational agents in the health and wellbeing context and can serve as a guidance in the design and development of interfaces for text-based dialogue systems.","[{'authorId': '143739493', 'name': 'Ahmed Fadhil'}, {'authorId': '34657063', 'name': 'G.

One answer, which has been highlighted in emotion-regulation research, is that individuals are motivated by short-term hedonic goals (e.g., the motivation to feel pleasure). Another answer, however, is that individuals are motivated by instrumental goals (e.g., the motivation to perform certain behaviors). We suggest that both answers have merit. To demonstrate the role instrumental goals may play in emotion regulation, we pitted short-term hedonic motives and instrumental motives against each other, by testing whether individuals were motivated to experience a potentially useful, albeit unpleasant, emotion. We found that (a) individuals preferred activities that would increase their level of anger (but not their level of excitement) when they were anticipating confrontational, but not nonconfrontational, tasks and that (b) anger improved performance in a confrontational, but not a non-confrontational, task. These findings support a functional view of emotion regulation, and demonstrate that in certain contexts, individuals may choose to experience emotions that are instrumental, despite short-term hedonic costs.","[{'authorId': '2636360', 'name': 'Maya Tamir'}, {'authorId': '143998545', 'name': 'C.

bf902f5922c3ef1050c62a3be716ac675296df5f,"Emotion regulation is essential for adaptive behavior and mental health. Strategies applied to alter emotions are known to differ in their impact on psychological and physiological aspects of the emotional response. However, emotion regulation outcome has primarily been assessed via self-report, and studies comparing regulation strategies with regard to their peripheral physiological mechanisms are limited in number. In the present study, we therefore aimed to investigate the effects of different emotion regulation strategies on pupil dilation, skin conductance responses, and subjective emotional responses. Thirty healthy females were presented with negative and neutral pictures and asked to maintain or up- and downregulate their upcoming emotional responses through reappraisal or distraction. Pupil dilation and skin conductance responses were significantly enhanced when viewing negative relative to neutral pictures. For the pupil, this emotional arousal effect manifested specifically late during the pupillary response. In accordance with subjective ratings, increasing negative emotions through reappraisal led to the most prominent pupil size enlargements, whereas no consistent effect for downregulation was found. In contrast, early peak dilations were enhanced in all emotion regulation conditions independent of strategy. Skin conductance responses were not further modulated by emotion regulation. These results indicate that pupil diameter is modulated by emotional arousal, but is initially related to the extent of mental effort required to regulate automatic emotional responses. Our data thus provide first evidence that the pupillary response might comprise two distinct temporal components reflecting cognitive emotion regulation effort on the one hand and emotion regulation success on the other hand.","[{'authorId': '3410911', 'name': 'Valerie L.

Toward that end, the first section of the paper outlines a model of the processes and neural systems involved in emotion generation and regulation. The second section surveys recent research supporting and elaborating the model, focusing primarily on studies of the most commonly investigated strategy, which is known as reappraisal. At its core, the model specifies how prefrontal and cingulate control systems modulate activity in perceptual, semantic, and affect systems as a function of one's regulatory goals, tactics, and the nature of the stimuli and emotions being regulated. This section also shows how the model can be generalized to understand the brain mechanisms underlying other emotion regulation strategies as well as a range of other allied phenomena. The third and last section considers directions for future research, including how basic models of emotion regulation can be translated to understand changes in emotion across the life span and in clinical disorders.","[{'authorId': '2669604', 'name': 'K.

This is likely due to the effect of coaching on adherence. We evaluated the efficacy of a manualized telephone coaching intervention (TeleCoach) aimed at improving adherence to a web-based intervention (moodManager), as well as the relationship between adherence and depressive symptom outcomes. Methods 101 patients with MDD, recruited from primary care, were randomized to 12 weeks moodManager+TeleCoach, 12 weeks of self-directed moodManager, or 6 weeks of a waitlist control (WLC). Depressive symptom severity was measured using the PHQ-9. Results TeleCoach+moodManager, compared to self-directed moodManager, resulted in significantly greater numbers of login days (p = 0.01), greater time until last use (p = 0.007), greater use of lessons (p = 0.03), greater variety of interactive tools used (p = 0.02), but total instances of tool use did not reach statistical significance. (p = 0.07). TeleCoach+moodManager produced significantly lower PHQ-9 scores relative to WLC at week 6 (p = 0.04), but there were no other significant differences in PHQ-9 scores at weeks 6 or 12 (ps>0.20) across treatment arms. Baseline PHQ-9 scores were no significantly related to adherence to moodManager. Conclusions TeleCoach produced significantly greater adherence to moodManager, relative to self-directed moodManager. TeleCoached moodManager produced greater reductions in depressive symptoms relative to WLC, however, there were no statistically significant differences relative to self-directed moodManager. While greater use was associated with better outcomes, most users in both TeleCoach and self-directed moodManager had dropped out of treatment by week 12. Even with telephone coaching, adherence to web-based interventions for depression remains a challenge. Methods of improving coaching models are discussed.

Emotional regulation contributes to these mood symptoms. This study evaluated emotional regulation in subjects with IGD and examined relationships between emotional regulation, depression, anxiety, and hostility in young adults with IGD. We recruited 87 people with IGD and a control group of 87 people without a history of IGD. All participants underwent a diagnostic interview based on the IGD criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and they completed a questionnaire on emotional regulation, depression, anxiety, and hostility. We found that subjects with IGD were less likely to practice cognitive reappraisal and were more likely to suppress their emotions. Linear regression revealed the higher cognitive reappraisal and lower expressive suppression associated with depression, anxiety, and hostility among subjects with IGD. The emotional regulation strategies that characterize those with IGD could be contributing factors to the depression and hostility tendencies of these people. When treating patients with IGD, in addition to providing appropriate interventions to relieve depression and hostility, practitioners should effectively assess emotional regulation strategies and provide emotional regulation therapy to prevent a vicious cycle of negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '2122321', 'name': 'J.

The current study used structural MRI-based multivariate pattern classification to (i) identify and cross-validate a differential diagnostic signature separating patients with first-episode and recurrent stages of schizophrenia (n = 158) from patients with major depression (n = 104); and (ii) quantify the impact of major clinical variables, including disease stage, age of disease onset and accelerated brain ageing on the signature's classification performance. This diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging signature was then evaluated in an independent patient cohort from two different centres to test its generalizability to individuals with bipolar disorder (n = 35), first-episode psychosis (n = 23) and clinically defined at-risk mental states for psychosis (n = 89). Neuroanatomical diagnosis was correct in 80% and 72% of patients with major depression and schizophrenia, respectively, and involved a pattern of prefronto-temporo-limbic volume reductions and premotor, somatosensory and subcortical increments in schizophrenia versus major depression. Diagnostic performance was not influenced by the presence of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms in major depression, but earlier disease onset and accelerated brain ageing promoted misclassification in major depression due to an increased neuroanatomical schizophrenia likeness of these patients. Furthermore, disease stage significantly moderated neuroanatomical diagnosis as recurrently-ill patients had higher misclassification rates (major depression: 23%; schizophrenia: 29%) than first-episode patients (major depression: 15%; schizophrenia: 12%). Finally, the trained biomarker assigned 74% of the bipolar patients to the major depression group, while 83% of the first-episode psychosis patients and 77% and 61% of the individuals with an ultra-high risk and low-risk state, respectively, were labelled with schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that neuroanatomical information may provide generalizable diagnostic tools distinguishing schizophrenia from mood disorders early in the course of psychosis. Disease course-related variables such as age of disease onset and disease stage as well alterations of structural brain maturation may strongly impact on the neuroanatomical separability of major depression and schizophrenia.","[{'authorId': '3214043', 'name': 'N.

Meta-analytical summaries reveal that deep acting (summoning up the appropriate feelings one wants to display) generally has positive outcomes. Unlike surface acting (faking emotions), deep acting does not harm employee well-being, and deep acting is positively related with job satisfaction, organizational commitment, job performance, and customer satisfaction. Emerging research also suggests that a third form of emotional labor, natural and genuine emotional labor, is a frequently used emotional labor strategy that has positive effects for both employees and customers. We examine how identity processes shape how employees experience emotional labor, and we maintain that when employees identify with their roles, emotional labor augments and affirms their identity. Person-job fit is an important moderator that influences whether emotional labor enhances or hinders employee well-being. Emotional labor may also have positive outcomes when organizations grant more autonomy and adopt positive display rules that call for the expression of positive emotions.

Twelve meta-analyses, which included between 4 to 22 effect sizes (N from 345 to 3609), were conducted to summarize associations of parent emotion regulation with positive or negative parenting behaviors and child outcomes of emotion regulation, difficulties in emotion regulation, internalizing symptoms, or externalizing behavior.

Summary effect sizes ranged from |.03| to |.42| for relations of parent emotion regulation difficulties with parenting behaviors and children’s adjustment. In general, parents with better emotion regulation skill or fewer difficulties are higher in positive parenting behaviors and have children with better emotion regulation and fewer internalizing symptoms. Evidence was less clear-cut for child externalizing behaviors.

Emotion regulation was negatively associated with emotional eating (β = −0.30, p < 0.001) and positively associated with dietary restraint (β = 0.15, p < 0.05) at age 16, but was not associated with age 19 adiposity (β = −0.01, p = ns). Emotional eating was positively associated with adiposity (β = 0.24, p < 0.01). Indirect effects suggested that emotional eating, but not dietary restraint, at age 16 serves as a mechanism that helps explain the associations between emotion regulation and adiposity four years later. Results from this study suggest that both emotion regulation and emotional eating represent promising targets for that should be included in future interventions aimed at preventing adolescent obesity.","[{'authorId': '3562685', 'name': 'L.

Unrecognized events are considered for disclosure based on the event to keep the financial statements from being misleading. To that end, some major companies like Walmart, that filed their 10-Ks after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic and after several large states across the United States issued government mandated shelter in place orders, chose not to include any subsequent event disclosures related to COVID-19.

However, the neural mechanisms involved in regulating aggressive responses to social exclusion are still largely unknown. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates the excitability of a target region. Building on studies suggesting that activity in the right ventrolateral pre-frontal cortex (rVLPFC) might aid the regulation or inhibition of social exclusion-related distress, we hypothesized that non-invasive brain polarization through tDCS over the rVLPFC would reduce behavioral aggression following social exclusion. Participants were socially excluded or included while they received tDCS or sham stimulation to the rVLPFC. Next, they received an opportunity to aggress. Excluded participants demonstrated cognitive awareness of their inclusionary status, yet tDCS (but not sham stimulation) reduced their behavioral aggression. Excluded participants who received tDCS stimulation were no more aggressive than included participants. tDCS stimulation did not influence socially included participants' aggression. Our findings provide the first causal test for the role of rVLPFC in modulating aggressive responses to social exclusion. Our findings suggest that modulating activity in a brain area (i.e. the rVLPFC) implicated in self-control and emotion regulation can break the link between social exclusion and aggression.","[{'authorId': '37814606', 'name': 'P.

This study takes a trust-centered, cognitive and emotional balanced perspective to study RA adoption. Grounded on the theory of reasoned action, the IT adoption literature, and the trust literature, this study theoretically articulates and empirically examines the effects of perceived personalization and familiarity on cognitive trust and emotional trust in an RA, and the impact of cognitive trust and emotional trust on the intention to adopt the RA either as a decision aid or as a delegated agent. 
 
An experiment was conducted using two commercial RAs. PLS analysis results provide empirical support for the proposed theoretical perspective. Perceived personalization significantly increases customers' intention to adopt by increasing cognitive trust and emotional trust. Emotional trust plays an important role beyond cognitive trust in determining customers' intention to adopt. Emotional trust fully mediates the impact of cognitive trust on the intention to adopt the RA as a delegated agent, while it only partially mediates the impact of cognitive trust on the intention to adopt the RA as a decision aid. Familiarity increases the intention to adopt through cognitive trust and emotional trust.","[{'authorId': '2988045', 'name': 'Sherrie Y. X. Komiak'}, {'authorId': '1732947', 'name': 'I.

To determine whether relative cortical thickness measurements of the precentral and postcentral gyri can be used to differentiate the central sulcus from adjacent cortical sulci.


METHODS
Turbo inversion-recovery MR imaging of the entire brain was done with scans parallel to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line. Cortical thickness was measured in each hemisphere with a jeweler's eyepiece with 0.1-mm gradations. Three measurements were obtained perpendicular to the central, precentral, and superior frontal sulci, as determined by means of established anatomic methods. The ratios of cortical thickness on both sides of the central, precentral, and superior frontal sulci were calculated and compared.


RESULTS
The mean ratio of precentral/postcentral gyri was 1.64 for the right hemisphere and 1.53 for the left hemisphere. The mean cortical thickness ratios were as follows: 1.01 for the right hemisphere and 3.01 for the left hemisphere across the precentral sulcus, and 1.03 for the right hemisphere and 0.99 for the left hemisphere across the superior frontal sulcus.


CONCLUSION
Cortical thickness measurements across the central sulcus provide a method for locating the primary motor (precentral gyri) and primary somatosensory (postcentral gyri) cortices. The higher mean cortical thickness ratio across the central sulcus corresponds with known cytoarchitectonic relationships.","[{'authorId': '2107428676', 'name': 'J. R.

These robots often will work side by side with people, collaborating with employees on tasks. Some roboticists have argued that, in these cases, people will collaborate more naturally and easily with humanoid robots as compared with machine-like robots. It is also speculated that people will rely on and share responsibility more readily with robots that are in a position of authority. This study sought to clarify the effects of robot appearance and relative status on human-robot collaboration by investigating the extent to which people relied on and ceded responsibility to a robot coworker. In this study, a 3 � 3 experiment was conducted with human likeness (human, human-like robot, and machine-like robot) and status (subordinate, peer, and supervisor) as dimensions. As far as we know, this study is one of the first experiments examining how people respond to robotic coworkers. As such, this study attempts to design a robust and transferable sorting and assembly task that capitalizes on the types of tasks robots are expected to do and is embedded in a realistic scenario in which the participant and confederate are interdependent. The results show that participants retained more responsibility for the successful completion of the task when working with a machine-like as compared with a humanoid robot, especially when the machine-like robot was subordinate. These findings suggest that humanoid robots may be appropriate for settings in which people have to delegate responsibility to these robots or when the task is too demanding for people to do, and when complacency is not a major concern. Machine-like robots, however, may be more appropriate when robots are expected to be unreliable, are less well-equipped for the task than people are, or in other situations in which personal responsibility should be emphasized.","[{'authorId': '32884962', 'name': 'Pamela J.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of a specialized inpatient treatment characterized by both an intensive and comprehensive standardized multidisciplinary programme based on cognitive–behavioural therapy and a flexible and personalized component implemented by third‐wave interventions. A cohort of 67 female ED patients (anorexia nervosa = 28, bulimia nervosa = 28 and binge eating disorder = 11) underwent an evaluation of emotional regulation difficulties, alexithymia and dissociative symptomatology at admission to a specialized ED ward. The psychological modifications were subsequently re‐evaluated upon discharge, after an inpatients treatment of 60 days, examining specific changes in the specific psychopathology. A significant improvement after specialized ED treatment was shown in alexithymia, emotional regulation difficulties and dissociation symptoms, with higher effect sizes in patients with higher alexithymia scores. As regards the specific effect of the psychological improvement, changes into alexithymia scores have shown specific correlations with ED psychopathology (p < 0.010) and with difficulties in emotional regulation (p < 0.010) in patients with higher alexithymia levels at admission. Emotional regulation and dissociation should therefore be evaluated in ED patients and may be improved with specific therapeutic approaches, while alexithymia remains a clinical trait, even with a significant reduction.","[{'authorId': '5598862', 'name': 'P.

To establish a national body mass index (BMI) reference norm for the purpose of screening and more active prevention and cure on overweight and obesity in Chinese children and adolescents.


METHODS
The 2000 Chinese National Survey on Students Constitution and Health was used as reference population. In total there were more than 244.2 thousands of primary and secondary Han nationality students aged 7 through 18 years old included in this study. The BMI distribution of various Chinese children and adolescent groups were compared with the NCHS international norm, the percentage values and with advanced ages, were calculated. In the beginning, three temporary norms were set up, using the different combination of P(85), P(90) and P(95) BMI percentages. Based on the intersect testing and varifying of physiological, lipidemia biochemical and body composition measures, the best norm was then selected. B-spline smoothing method was used to correct the curves, both for males and females, composed by cut-off points at different ages.


RESULTS
Using samples from the costal developed metropolis, the BMI curves successfully overcame the shortcomings of low and depressive phenomenon of the total population, in particular after the mid-adolescent period. The temporary Norm II, composed by cut-off points of P(85) for overweight and P(95) for obesity, was found to be the best among the three temporary norms, both shown by its sensitivity and specificity. 24 and 28 were used as cut-off points for overweight and obesity in this norm, both for males and females aged 18 years. These two cut-off points were consistent with those shown in the Body Mass Index Reference Norm for Screening Overweight and Obesity in Chinese Adults. Three samples from Beijing, Henan and Sichuan, used as representatives of upper, middle and relative low levels of physical growth of children and adolescents in China, were used for extra tests. The screening results showed that among the male and female subjects aged 7 through 18 years, the prevalence rates were 17.00% and 9.46% for overweight, 9.99% and 6.47% for obesity in Beijing while 10.86% and 6.64% for overweight, 4.27% and 3.07% for obesity in Henan, and 6.95% and 4.23% for overweight and 2.84% and 2.09% for obesity in Sichuan, respectively. Data clearly showed that the results were in accordance with the actural situation seen in the Chinese students in 2000.


CONCLUSION
The newly established reference norm seemed to be good for prospective studies as it considered the facts regarding the rapid and strong tendency of secular growth changes seen in the Chinese children and adolescents. It also decreased the difference of growth levels between the Chinese children and adolescents and those of the international norms. This norm was particularly developed for the Chinese which was also in consistent with the Eastern Asia ethnic characteristics so could be promoted in China.","[{'authorId': '145100313', 'name': 'C.

The authors examine the current literature using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Three key findings emerge. First, emotion dysregulation is prevalent in ADHD throughout the lifespan and is a major contributor to impairment. Second, emotion dysregulation in ADHD may arise from deficits in orienting toward, recognizing, and/or allocating attention to emotional stimuli; these deficits implicate dysfunction within a striato-amygdalo-medial prefrontal cortical network. Third, while current treatments for ADHD often also ameliorate emotion dysregulation, a focus on this combination of symptoms reframes clinical questions and could stimulate novel therapeutic approaches. The authors then consider three models to explain the overlap between emotion dysregulation and ADHD: emotion dysregulation and ADHD are correlated but distinct dimensions; emotion dysregulation is a core diagnostic feature of ADHD; and the combination constitutes a nosological entity distinct from both ADHD and emotion dysregulation alone. The differing predictions from each model can guide research on the much-neglected population of patients with ADHD and emotion dysregulation.","[{'authorId': '116008153', 'name': 'P.

Whereas deep acting refers to deliberate attempts to modify felt emotions and involves conscious effort, automatic regulation refers to automated emotion regulatory processes that result in the natural experience of desired emotions and do not involve deliberate control and effort. Multilevel analyses revealed that both types of emotion regulation were positively associated with customer tips. The second study was an experimental field study using a sample of German hairdressers (N = 41).

Chatbots are a recent technology that hotels, travel agencies, and airline companies are adopting. Despite this industry-wide implementation, there is no evidence about the factors that explain why consumers are willing to interact with chatbots. This work proposes a model to explain chatbot usage intention. The model and its hypotheses were tested by structural equations with the PLS technique. The study was conducted on a sample of 476 individuals who had travelled on vacation in the previous 12 months. The study reveals that the intentions behind using chatbots are directly influenced by the following factors: the chatbots’ expected performance, the habit of using chatbots, the hedonic component in using them, the predisposition to using self-service technologies, the social influences, and the fact that the chatbot behaves like a human. The inconvenience and problems related to communicating with the chatbot were found to have a negative influence. Lastly, the possibility that chatbots could replace jobs had a surprisingly positive influence, and not a negative one.","[{'authorId': '1411437898', 'name': 'Santiago Melián-González'}, {'authorId': '1403975034', 'name': 'Desiderio Gutiérrez-Taño'}, {'authorId': '1403975014', 'name': 'J.

In China, patients with COVID-19 were immediately isolated in designated existing hospitals, and new hospitals were rapidly built to manage the increasing numbers of cases in the most affected areas. Home quarantine for contacts was initiated and large gatherings were canceled. Additionally, community containment for approximately 40 million to 60 million residents was instituted. A significant positive association between the incidence of COVID-19 cases and mortality was apparent in the Chinese response.3 That is, the rapid escalation in the number of infections in China had resulted in insufficient health care resources, followed by an increase in mortality. The association of mortality with health care resources should provide guidance for resource-limited regions on how and when to prepare for possible local outbreaks.3 In addition, lessons learned from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) outbreak geared toward strengthening of public health systems will be helpful.","[{'authorId': '32943047', 'name': 'J.

Structural equation model tests have shown some support for such common factor explanations. These results, however, may not be as conclusive as previously claimed. A further analysis of 4 cross-sectional data sets described in Salthouse, Hambrick, and McGuthry (1998) and Salthouse and Czaja (2000) found that although the best fitting model included a common factor in 3 of the data sets, additional direct age paths were significant, indicating the presence of specific age effects. For the remaining data set, a factor-specific model fit at least as well as the best fitting common factor model. Three simulated data sets with known structure were then tested with a sequence of structural equation models. Common factor models could not always be falsified--even when they were false. In contrast, factor-specific models were more easily falsified when the true model included a unitary common factor. These results suggest that it is premature to conclude that all age-related cognitive declines are due to a single mechanism. Common factor models may be particularly difficult to falsify with current analytic procedures.","[{'authorId': '32744634', 'name': 'P. Allen'}, {'authorId': '4415300', 'name': 'R.

Low income mothers were more likely than middle income mothers to control nonhostile emotions in response to child anger.

Thus, context plays a central role in emotion regulation. This is particularly relevant to the work on emotion regulation in psychopathology, because psychological disorders are characterized by rigid responses to the environment. However, this recognition of the importance of context has appeared primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work lagging behind. In this review, the author proposes an approach to systematically evaluate the contextual factors shaping emotion regulation. Such an approach consists of specifying the components that characterize emotion regulation and then systematically evaluating deviations within each of these components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines for how to combine such dimensions and components in order to capture substantial and meaningful contextual influences are presented. This approach is offered to inspire theoretical and empirical work that it is hoped will result in the development of a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the relationship between context and emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '5081251', 'name': 'A.

Of those who had fallen within the year prior to the interview, 65% reported injury, 44% sought medical attention, and 15% required hospitalization as a consequence of their fall(s). Fear of falling ranked first when compared to other common fears (i.e., fear of robbery, financial fears).

In a previous study, we reported changes in the use of two different emotion regulation strategies at an annual alternative cultural event, Burning Man (McRae et al., 2011). In this sociocultural context, as compared to typically at home, participants reported less use of expressive suppression (a strategy generally associated with maladaptive outcomes), and greater use of cognitive reappraisal (a strategy generally associated with adaptive outcomes). What remained unclear was whether these changes in self-reported emotion regulation strategy use were characterized by changes in the regulation of positive emotion, negative emotion, or both. We addressed this issue in the current study by asking Burning Man participants separate questions about positive and negative emotion. Using multiple datasets, we replicated our previous findings, and found that the decreased use of suppression is primarily driven by reports of decreased suppression of positive emotion at Burning Man. By contrast, the increased use of reappraisal is not characterized by differential reappraisal of positive and negative emotion at Burning Man. Moreover, we observed novel individual differences in the magnitude of these effects. The contextual changes in self-reported suppression that we observe are strongest for men and younger participants. For those who had previously attended Burning Man, we observed lower levels of self-reported suppression in both sociocultural contexts: Burning Man and typically at home. These findings have implications for understanding the ways in which certain sociocultural contexts may decrease suppression, and possibly minimize its associated maladaptive effects.","[{'authorId': '1390578429', 'name': 'S.

However, the mechanism between these associations has received little attention and it is still unclear. This study has examined 716 Chinese adolescents, 341 were males (47.6%), aged 13 to 18(Mean = 14.58, SD = 1.50), using a cross-sectional survey involving Young's Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction, the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the seven-item Generalized Anxiety (GAD-7) scale, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Correlation analysis, multiple-group analysis and structural equation modeling were carried out in SPSS Statistics version 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and AMOS version 21. Cognitive reappraisal had a significantly negative direct effect on Internet addiction (β = −0.118, p < 0.05). Furthermore, negative emotions mediated the relationships between expression suppression and Internet addiction [β = 0.149, 95% CI = (0.099, 0.212)] and the relationship between cognitive reappraisal and Internet addiction [β = −0.101, 95% CI = (−0.147, −0.065)]. The differences in the structure path coefficients for different development stages demonstrated that recognitive reappraisal showed more protective roles for negative emotion (p < 0.01), and negative emotion also predict Internet addiction more effectively in high school students (p < 0.001). However, cognitive reappraisal directly predicted negative Internet addiction in junior high school students. Therefore, the intervention on adolescents for internet addiction should not only focus on emotional regulation and negative emotion, but also development stages of adolescents.","[{'authorId': '151092734', 'name': 'Lijuan Liang'}, {'authorId': '152942298', 'name': 'Mingrui Zhu'}, {'authorId': '50731588', 'name': 'Jiali Dai'}, {'authorId': '2145627531', 'name': 'Min Li'}, {'authorId': '143797927', 'name': 'Ya Zheng'}]",15.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry', 'volume': '12'}",77.0,The Mediating Roles of Emotional Regulation on Negative Emotion and Internet Addiction Among Chinese Adolescents From a Development Perspective,2021.0

In this context, service providers face the challenge of measuring chatbot service encounter satisfaction (CSES), as most approaches are limited to post-interaction surveys that are rarely answered and often biased. As a result, service providers cannot react quickly to service failures and dissatisfied customers. To address this challenge, we investigate the application of automated sentiment analysis methods as a proxy to measure CSES. Therefore, we first compare different sentiment analysis methods. Second, we investigate the relationship between objectively computed sentiment scores of dialogs and subjectively measured CSES values. Third, we evaluate whether this relationship also exists for utterance sequences throughout the dialog.

Research instruments included Maslach Burnout Inventory, Rathus Assertiveness Schedule, and a socio-demographic questionnaire. There were differences in all burnout dimensions in relation to types of students’ special needs. Higher levels of burnout symptoms were observed in teachers working with children with motor skill disorders. The assertiveness scores had a significant negative correlation with emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation, and a positive correlation with a lack of accomplishment.

However, there are wide differences in how this concept is defined, characterized, and implemented in the literature. In this article we present a high-level framework for classifying approaches to personalization that delineates fundamental assumptions about personalization in the literature and relates them to strategies for developing personalization systems. The framework consists of 2 parts: (a) a set of perspectives on personalization that guide the design of personalization systems at a general level and (b) a scheme for classifying how personalization can be implemented. The personalization perspectives represent 4 distinct schools of thought on the nature of personalization distilled from the literature of several fields. These perspectives are ideal types and we discuss them in terms of the motivation they supply for personalization, the goals and means of personalization, and the ways in which they conceptualize and model users. The implementation classification scheme is constructed on 3 dimensions of implementation choices. These 3 dimensions pertain to what to personalize (content, interface, functionality, channel), to whom to personalize (individuals or categories of individuals) as well as who does the personalization (implicit or explicit personalization). The personalization perspectives represent particular concepts of personalization that guide general design choices; these choices are implemented via the options described in the implementation classification scheme. The framework contributes to the development of a common theoretical basis for the study of personalization. We discuss implications of the framework for design of personalization systems and future research directions.","[{'authorId': '46928579', 'name': 'Haiyan Fan'}, {'authorId': '2598028', 'name': 'M.

Two emotion regulation strategies, reappraisal (regulation of cognition) and suppression (regulation of the behavior) were considered. Data were analyzed by using structural equation modeling, and conventional statistical analysis. Findings show that emotion regulation is associated with decreased stress and increased job satisfaction, and stressors in life do not need to be workrelated to decrease job satisfaction. Managerial style, job control, and job insecurity also highly influence job satisfaction. Emotion regulation increases in older age, and emotion regulation is associated with job satisfaction only in older, but not in younger adults.","[{'authorId': '115179007', 'name': 'M.

RESULTS Significant quadratic effects occurred between the DDS17 and each diabetes variable, with increases in distress associated with poorer outcomes: study 1 HbA1c (P < 0.02), self-efficacy (P < 0.001), diet (P < 0.001), physical activity (P < 0.04); study 2 HbA1c (P < 0.03), self-efficacy (P < 0.004), diet (P < 0.04), physical activity (P = NS). Substantive curvilinear associations with all four variables in both studies began at unexpectedly low levels of DDS17: the slope increased linearly between scores 1 and 2, was more muted between 2 and 3, and reached a maximum between 3 and 4. This suggested three patient subgroups: little or no distress, <2.0; moderate distress, 2.0–2.9; high distress, ≥3.0. Parallel findings occurred for the DDS2. CONCLUSIONS In two samples of type 2 diabetic patients we found a consistent pattern of curvilinear relationships between the DDS and HbA1c, diabetes self-efficacy, diet, and physical activity. The shape of these relationships suggests cut points for three patient groups: little or no, moderate, and high distress.","[{'authorId': '144067783', 'name': 'L.

We conducted a 17-day field study of a prototype of a personal AI agent that helps employees find work-related information. Using log data, surveys, and interviews, we found individual differences in the preference for humanized social interactions (social-agent orientation), which led to different user needs and requirements for agent design. We also explored the effect of agent proactive interactions and found that they carried the risk of interruption, especially for users who were generally averse to interruptions at work. Further, we found that user differences in social-agent orientation and aversion to agent proactive interactions can be inferred from behavioral signals.

The authors appropriately argued that, although most researchers' theoretical interest rests with the latent structure, they still rely on indices of global model fit that simultaneously assess both the measurement and structural portions of the model. As such, Lance et al. proposed indices intended to assess the structural portion of the model in isolation of the measurement model. Unfortunately, although these strategies separate the assessment of the structure from the fit of the measurement model, they do not isolate the structure's assessment from the quality of the measurement model. That is, even with a perfectly fitting measurement model, poorer quality (i.e., less reliable) measurements will yield a more favorable verdict regarding structural fit, whereas better quality (i.e., more reliable) measurements will yield a less favorable structural assessment. This phenomenon, referred to by Hancock and Mueller (2011) as the reliability paradox, affects not only traditional global fit indices but also those structural indices proposed by Lance et al. as well. Fortunately, as this comment will clarify, indices proposed by Hancock and Mueller help to mitigate this problem and allow the structural portion of the model to be assessed independently of both the fit of the measurement model as well as the quality of indicator variables contained therein.

c64e6eef62cce80276b864518ff2970f70b2bc97,"Abstract For many decades, the stress process was described primarily in terms of negative emotions. However, robust evidence that positive emotions co-occurred with negative emotions during intensely stressful situations suggested the need to consider the possible roles of positive emotions in the stress process. About 10 years ago, these possibilities were incorporated into a revision of stress and coping theory (Folkman, 1997). This article summarizes the research reported during the intervening 10 years that pertains to the revised model. Evidence has accumulated regarding the co-occurrence of positive and negative emotions during stressful periods; the restorative function of positive emotions with respect to physiological, psychological, and social coping resources; and the kinds of coping processes that generate positive emotions including benefit finding and reminding, adaptive goal processes, reordering priorities, and infusing ordinary events with positive meaning. Overall, the evidence supports the propositions set forth in the revised model. Contrary to earlier tendencies to dismiss positive emotions, the evidence indicates they have important functions in the stress process and are related to coping processes that are distinct from those that regulate distress. Including positive emotions in future studies will help address an imbalance between research and clinical practice due to decades of nearly exclusive concern with the negative emotions.","[{'authorId': '7275762', 'name': 'S.

By means of (i) electrical stimulation, (ii) pharmacological challenges, and (iii) brain lesions of vertebrate brains (mostly mammalian), Panksepp carved out seven primary emotional systems called SEEKING, CARE, PLAY, and LUST on the positive side, whereas FEAR, SADNESS, and ANGER belong to the negative affects. Abundant research into human clinical applications has supported the hypothesis that imbalances in these ancient primary emotional systems are strongly linked to psychiatric disorders such as depression. The present paper gives a concise overview of Panksepp's main ideas. It gives an historical overview of the development of Panksepp's AN thinking. It touches not only areas of neuroscience, but also shows how AN has been applied to other research fields such as personality psychology.

The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on people’s mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations. We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends. The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak.

The authors sought to achieve an improved understanding of the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder independent of its association with conduct disorder.


METHOD
Family interactions, social functioning, and psychiatric comorbidity were compared in clinically referred male and female subjects with oppositional defiant disorder alone (N=643) or with comorbid conduct disorder (N=262) and a psychiatric comparison group with neither oppositional defiant disorder nor conduct disorder (N=695).


RESULTS
Oppositional defiant disorder youth with or without conduct disorder were found to have significantly higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders and significantly greater family and social dysfunction relative to psychiatric comparison subjects. Differences between subjects with oppositional defiant disorder alone and those with comorbid conduct disorder were seen primarily in rates of mood disorders and social impairment. Oppositional defiant disorder was a significant correlate of adverse family and social outcomes when comorbid disorders (including conduct disorder) were controlled.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support the validity of the oppositional defiant disorder diagnosis as a meaningful clinical entity independent of conduct disorder and highlight the extremely detrimental effects of oppositional defiant disorder on multiple domains of functioning in children and adolescents.","[{'authorId': '47624965', 'name': 'R.

c7c0fa40eedfd772aefeea5d4cdfca95faff5f4e,"The Model of Neurovisceral Integration suggests that vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) represents a psychophysiological index of inhibitory control and thus, is associated with emotion regulation capacity. Over the past decade, growing empirical evidence supports this notion, showing that those with higher resting vmHRV can regulate negative emotions more adequately. However, to our knowledge, no study has previously examined how resting vmHRV may relate to everyday perceived difficulties in emotion regulation. The present study attempts to examine such relationship in 183 undergraduate students (98 female, 60 minority, mean Age = 19.34). Resting vmHRV was collected during a 5-min resting baseline period, and everyday difficulties in emotion regulation were assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Controlling for potential covariates (including both trait anxiety and rumination), results revealed a negative relationship between resting vmHRV and DERS such that lower resting vmHRV was associated with greater difficulties in emotional regulation, especially a lack of emotional clarity and impulse control, as indicated by the respective subscales of the DERS. These findings provide further evidence for the Neurovisceral Integration Model, suggesting that emotion regulation and autonomic regulation share neural networks within the brain. Moreover, the present study extends prior research by highlighting two distinct facets of emotion regulation (impulse control and emotional clarity) that should be of particular interest when investigating the link between emotion regulation, resting vmHRV, and related health outcomes including morbidity and mortality.","[{'authorId': '2047536202', 'name': 'DeWayne P.

Hierarchical linear modeling demonstrated that participants exposed to invalidating responses experienced significantly higher levels of negative affect, heart rate, and skin conductance over time when compared to participants exposed to validating responses. Results are discussed as support for models incorporating social factors as key determinants of individual emotional reactivity and regulation.","[{'authorId': '5396972', 'name': 'Chad E.

c7d0dc4a94b027b0242cd7cf82c9779dc0dd8b33,"In this article, the authors explore the breadth and depth of published research linking dietary vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) to mood. Since the 1920s, there have been many studies on individual vitamins (especially B vitamins and Vitamins C, D, and E), minerals (calcium, chromium, iron, magnesium, zinc, and selenium), and vitamin-like compounds (choline). Recent investigations with multi-ingredient formulas are especially promising. However, without a reasonable conceptual framework for understanding mechanisms by which micronutrients might influence mood, the published literature is too readily dismissed. Consequently, 4 explanatory models are presented, suggesting that mood symptoms may be expressions of inborn errors of metabolism, manifestations of deficient methylation reactions, alterations of gene expression by nutrient deficiency, and/or long-latency deficiency diseases. These models provide possible explanations for why micronutrient supplementation could ameliorate some mental symptoms.","[{'authorId': '34911088', 'name': 'B.

We found that teachers were more inclined to stay in their schools when they experienced stronger school administrative and collegial support, had more access to instructional materials, and were more experienced. Teachers indicated weaker intent to stay when they experienced more problems with students, spent more time working, were less experienced, and served in higher-poverty schools.

Purpose
The service sector is at an inflection point with regard to productivity gains and service industrialization similar to the industrial revolution in manufacturing that started in the eighteenth century. Robotics in combination with rapidly improving technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), mobile, cloud, big data and biometrics will bring opportunities for a wide range of innovations that have the potential to dramatically change service industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential role service robots will play in the future and to advance a research agenda for service researchers.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper uses a conceptual approach that is rooted in the service, robotics and AI literature.


Findings
The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a definition of service robots, describes their key attributes, contrasts their features and capabilities with those of frontline employees, and provides an understanding for which types of service tasks robots will dominate and where humans will dominate. Second, this paper examines consumer perceptions, beliefs and behaviors as related to service robots, and advances the service robot acceptance model. Third, it provides an overview of the ethical questions surrounding robot-delivered services at the individual, market and societal level.


Practical implications
This paper helps service organizations and their management, service robot innovators, programmers and developers, and policymakers better understand the implications of a ubiquitous deployment of service robots.


Originality/value
This is the first conceptual paper that systematically examines key dimensions of robot-delivered frontline service and explores how these will differ in the future.

According to Theory of Consumption Values, this paper proposed an analytical framework to investigate the determinants behind users’ satisfaction and continuance intention toward mental health chatbots. Methods The empirical study was conducted through an online survey, facilitated by the use of questionnaire posted on the WeChat platform. Seven-point Likert scale and closed-ended questions were employed. Totally 371 valid samples were collected. The research data was tested via the partial least squares structural equation modeling. Gender, age, and income were included as control variables. Results Analysis of samples collected from 371 Chinese users suggested that personalization (functional value), enjoyment (emotional value), learning (epistemic value), and the condition of the COVID-19 pandemic (conditional value) have positive influences on user satisfaction and continuance intention, but such effects were weak. The findings also revealed that user satisfaction has weakly positive impact on continuance intention. However, voice interaction (functional value) was an insignificant predictor of user satisfaction and continuance intention. Discussion This study developed a critical perspective on the role of Theory of Consumption Values in the context of mental health chatbot usage, while Theory of Consumption Value has been increasingly employed to explain the use of AI-based public services. Thus, this research devotes to the enhancement of theoretical frameworks regarding the usage of mental health chatbots.","[{'authorId': '153514177', 'name': 'Yonghan Zhu'}, {'authorId': '2159309266', 'name': 'Rui Wang'}, {'authorId': '2159117092', 'name': 'Chengyan Pu'}]",26.0,"{'name': 'Digital Health', 'volume': '8'}",78.0,"“I am chatbot, your virtual mental health adviser.” What drives citizens’ satisfaction and continuance intention toward mental health chatbots during the COVID-19 pandemic?

While most of the latter focus on work relations, notably patterns of control and surveillance, this paper explores the role of recruitment, selection and training in the shaping call centre labour. The paper uses data from a case study of a call centre (Telebank) to argue that the increased significance of social competencies within interactive service work gives these procedures greater salience and that they are used by management to address the indeterminacy of labour, in part, outside the labour process. Primary data from management and customer service representatives is used to examine and contrast their respective perceptions of recruitment, selection and training. The paper shows the contested and contradictory tendencies associated with how a particular company identifies and then uses social competencies. Tensions in the labour process between the mobilization of employee attributes and the deliberate moulding and standardization of such competencies is merely part of wider and unresolved tensions concerning the contested nature of emotional labour and the demands of quantity and quality in the management of call centre work.","[{'authorId': '71241249', 'name': 'G.

It has made life easier and provided innumerous benefits; however, excessive use has brought about the potential for addiction, leading to severe impairments in social, academic, financial, psychological, and work domains. Individuals addicted to the Internet usually have comorbid psychiatric disorders. Panic disorder (PD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are prevalent mental disorders, involving a great deal of damage in the patient’s life. Objective This open trial study describes a treatment protocol among 39 patients with anxiety disorders and Internet addiction (IA) involving pharmacotherapy and modified cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods Of the 39 patients, 25 were diagnosed with PD and 14 with GAD, in addition to Internet addiction. At screening, patients responded to the MINI 5.0, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impressions Scale, and the Young Internet Addiction Scale. At that time, IA was observed taking into consideration the IAT scale (cutoff score above 50), while anxiety disorders were diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Patients were forwarded for pharmacotherapy and a modified CBT protocol. Psychotherapy was conducted individually, once a week, over a period of 10 weeks, and results suggest that the treatment was effective for anxiety and Internet addiction. Results Before treatment, anxiety levels suggested severe anxiety, with an average score of 34.26 (SD 6.13); however, after treatment the mean score was 15.03 (SD 3.88) (P<.001). A significant improvement in mean Internet addiction scores was observed, from 67.67 (SD 7.69) before treatment, showing problematic internet use, to 37.56 (SD 9.32) after treatment (P<.001), indicating medium Internet use. With respect to the relationship between IA and anxiety, the correlation between scores was .724. Conclusions This study is the first research into IA treatment of a Brazilian population. The improvement was remarkable due to the complete engagement of patients in therapy, which contributed to the success of the treatment from a behavioral perspective, and gave patients the confidence to continue to manage Internet use in their lives.","[{'authorId': '38302693', 'name': 'V.

c8e377a81ad22cbb4d7d7229e64f71730554d3d9,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed for experimental and therapeutic modulation of regional brain function. Specifically, anodal tDCS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) together with cathodal tDCS of the supraorbital region have been associated with improvement of cognition and mood, and have been suggested for the treatment of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although modeled mathematically, the distribution, direction, and extent of tDCS-mediated effects on brain physiology are not well understood. The current study investigates whether tDCS of the human prefrontal cortex modulates resting-state network (RSN) connectivity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thirteen healthy subjects underwent real and sham tDCS in random order on separate days. tDCS was applied for 20 min at 2 mA with the anode positioned over the left DLPFC and the cathode over the right supraorbital region. Patterns of resting-state brain connectivity were assessed before and after tDCS with 3 T fMRI, and changes were analyzed for relevant networks related to the stimulation–electrode localizations. At baseline, four RSNs were detected, corresponding to the default mode network (DMN), the left and right frontal-parietal networks (FPNs) and the self-referential network. After real tDCS and compared with sham tDCS, significant changes of regional brain connectivity were found for the DMN and the FPNs both close to the primary stimulation site and in connected brain regions. These findings show that prefrontal tDCS modulates resting-state functional connectivity in distinct functional networks of the human brain.","[{'authorId': '2165558', 'name': 'D.

The ability to regulate emotional responses to social exclusion is therefore essential for our well-being. As individual differences in detecting bodily signals (interoceptive sensitivity, IS) have been associated with the ability of emotion regulation, we aimed at exploring whether IS fosters coping with social exclusion and flexibility in emotion regulation. The first study investigated subjective feelings and behavioral affiliation tendencies in response to ostracism using a cyberball paradigm. Sixty-nine participants were assessed who differed with respect to IS. The second study examined habitual emotion regulation processes focusing on suppression and reappraisal as well as IS in 116 participants. Main results were that the effect of ostracism on distress and behavioral affiliation tendencies were qualified by IS—being ostracized had less impact on participants with stronger IS. Furthermore, Study 2 revealed that IS was associated with habitually stronger emotion regulation strategies. We conclude that having access to bodily signals helps (IS) reducing aversive states provoked by social exclusion, probably due to the fact that IS is associated with emotion regulation strategies.","[{'authorId': '144796987', 'name': 'O.

Stress and stress-related illnesses are increasing among medical specialists. This threatens the quality of patient care. In this study we investigated (a) levels of job stress and job satisfaction among medical specialists, (b) factors contributing to stress and satisfaction and (c) the effect of stress and satisfaction on burnout.


METHODS
A questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 2400 Dutch medical specialists. Measures included job stress, job satisfaction, burnout, personal characteristics, job characteristics and perceived working conditions.


RESULTS
The final response rate was 63%. Of the respondents, 55% acknowledged high levels of stress, and 81% reported high job satisfaction. Personal and job characteristics explained 2%-6% of the variance in job stress and satisfaction. Perceived working conditions were more important, explaining 24% of the variance in job stress and 34% of the variance in job satisfaction. Among perceived working conditions, the interference of work on home life (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.76) and not being able to live up to one's professional standards (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.37-1.80) were most related to stress. Feeling poorly managed and resourced (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.76-2.43) diminished job satisfaction. Burnout was explained by both high stress and low satisfaction (41% of variance explained) rather than by stress alone.


INTERPRETATION
Our study showed a protective effect of job satisfaction against the negative consequences of work stress as well as the importance of organizational rather than personal factors in managing both stress and satisfaction.","[{'authorId': '31747935', 'name': 'M.

Our solution is inspired by the recently proposed Transformer in machine translation (Vaswani et al., 2017) and we extend the attention mechanism in two ways. First, we construct representations of text segments at different granularities solely with stacked self-attention. Second, we try to extract the truly matched segment pairs with attention across the context and response. We jointly introduce those two kinds of attention in one uniform neural network.

After a careful investigation of real-life conversation data, we found that there are at least two ways to express emotions with language. One is to describe emotional states by explicitly using strong emotional words; another is to increase the intensity of the emotional experiences by implicitly combining neutral words in distinct ways. We propose an emotional dialogue system (EmoDS) that can generate the meaningful responses with a coherent structure for a post, and meanwhile express the desired emotion explicitly or implicitly within a unified framework.

Many youth with neurodevelopmental disorders experience mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, or anger and these are often associated with impairments of cognition and emotion regulation. The mechanisms that may be linking cognitive difficulties, emotion regulation, and mental health are not known.


AIMS
The current study examined whether adaptive and maladaptive (dysregulated) emotion regulation mediated the link between different cognitive control processes (working memory, inhibition, and shifting) and internalizing/externalizing symptoms in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.


METHODS
Participants included 48 children (8-13 years of age) with one or more diagnoses of autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, and learning disability, who were enrolled in a larger study of cognitive behaviour therapy targeting emotion regulation. Multiple mediation analyses were implemented using the PROCESS macro. The mediation effects of adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation were examined on the relationships between (1) working memory and internalizing/externalizing symptoms, (2) inhibition and internalizing/externalizing symptoms, and (3) shifting and internalizing/externalizing symptoms. All data was collected prior to intervention, at baseline.


RESULTS
Shifting, inhibitory control, and working memory predicted increased emotion dysregulation, which functioned as a full mediator to both internalizing and externalizing problems in children with NDD.


CONCLUSION
In the presence of emotionally triggering situations, children with greater cognitive challenges experience greater maladaptive emotion regulation, which results in both internalizing and externalizing problems. For youth with neurodevelopmental disorders, therapeutic plans that include strengthening of working memory, inhibition, and shifting abilities in addition to emotion regulation skills training may be helpful in alleviating externalizing and internalizing behaviour.","[{'authorId': '1404010210', 'name': 'Diana Tajik-Parvinchi'}, {'authorId': '67201115', 'name': 'Linda Farmus'}, {'authorId': '1705316048', 'name': 'Paula Tablon Modica'}, {'authorId': '6043683', 'name': 'R.

Objective The goal of this systematic review was to understand the ways in which personalization has been used with conversational agents in health care and characterize the methods of its implementation. Methods We searched on PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital Library using a predefined search strategy. The studies were included if they: (1) were primary research studies that focused on consumers, caregivers, or health care professionals; (2) involved a conversational agent with an unconstrained natural language interface; (3) tested the system with human subjects; and (4) implemented personalization features. Results The search found 1958 publications. After abstract and full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the review. Common examples of personalized content included feedback, daily health reports, alerts, warnings, and recommendations. The personalization features were implemented without a theoretical framework of customization and with limited evaluation of its impact. While conversational agents with personalization features were reported to improve user satisfaction, user engagement and dialogue quality, the role of personalization in improving health outcomes was not assessed directly. Conclusions Most of the studies in our review implemented the personalization features without theoretical or evidence-based support for them and did not leverage the recent developments in other domains of personalization. Future research could incorporate personalization as a distinct design factor with a more careful consideration of its impact on health outcomes and its implications on patient safety, privacy, and decision-making.","[{'authorId': '51374066', 'name': 'A.

Parents' adaptation requires the ability to regulate their own behavior in reaction to their perception and interpretation of the child's behavior. These self-regulation processes are often intertwined with intense emotions that need to be regulated. Parenting attitudes and behaviors cannot be fully understood without considering the parents' emotional dysregulation and their emotional regulation strategies. However, only few studies focus the effects of parents' emotional regulation strategies on the parenting behavior. Experiential avoidance and overprotection are discussed as extreme cases of parental emotional regulation strategies that may have particularly detrimental effects in childrearing. The authors propose that, although the main parenting interventions already use a self-regulation approach, specific training in adaptive emotional regulation strategies should be included in these programs.","[{'authorId': '145932323', 'name': 'Luísa Barros'}, {'authorId': '120591875', 'name': 'A.

ca2150601b09629bf898992877933e3e491f5832,"Dispositional mindfulness is associated with lower levels of perceived stress, with increased emotional regulation and cognitive control proposed as mechanisms underlying these stress-buffering effects of mindfulness. Within aging, these controlled processes represent paradoxically divergent trajectories such that older adults exhibit reduced cognitive control capacities, while emotional regulation abilities are well maintained, and at times enhanced. Our study seeks to examine the role of emotional regulation and cognitive control as possible mediators of the association between mindfulness and perceived stress. In addition, we examined age-related differences in the observed associations among mindfulness, stress, and controlled regulatory behavior. Fifty older adults and fifty young adults were recruited for the study and completed self-report measures assessing mindfulness disposition, perceived stress, and emotional regulation. In addition, computerized measures of cognitive control assessing working memory, inhibitory control, and set-shifting were also administered. We hypothesized a negative correlation between mindfulness disposition and perceived stress such that participants reporting higher levels of dispositional mindfulness would report lower stress. In addition, we hypothesized increased difficulties in emotion regulation and lower cognitive control to mediate this relationship. Corroborating previous literature, results revealed that mindfulness disposition and perceived stress were negatively correlated in both groups. However, emotion regulation, but not cognitive control, was found to mediate the relationship between mindfulness and perceived stress in both groups. Age group was not found to moderate the observed effects. Our findings reveal the role of enhanced emotional regulation abilities as a potential factor associated with the stress-reducing capacity of dispositional mindfulness.","[{'authorId': '2465943', 'name': 'R.

In particular, we tested a 2-component model of teachers' need for relatedness, with representation of the need for relatedness with students and the need for relatedness with colleagues. One thousand and forty-nine teachers participated in 3 studies.

In Study 2 (n = 455), we tested a full SDT model, hypothesizing that perceptions of autonomy support lead to satisfaction of teachers' needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness with colleagues and students, which in turn lead to teachers' engagement and expression of emotions (anxiety, anger, and enjoyment). In Study 3 (n = 185), we used scenarios to test participants' beliefs about 2 hypothesized teachers, 1 with high student and low peer relatedness and the other with low student and high peer relatedness. Results from the 3 studies consistently emphasize the finding that for teachers, satisfaction of the need for relatedness with students leads to higher levels of engagement and positive emotions, and lower levels of negative emotions, than does satisfaction of the need for relatedness with peers.","[{'authorId': '36206919', 'name': 'R.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","[{'authorId': '121900404', 'name': 'Cuiyan Wang'}, {'authorId': '1560463964', 'name': 'R.

However, the unique and shared neuroanatomical characteristics of depression and anxiety disorders have not been fully identified. The aim of this study was to identify gray matter abnormalities and their clinical correlates in depressive patients with and without anxiety disorders.We applied voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest analyses of gray matter volume (GMV) in normal controls (NC group, n = 28), depressive patients without anxiety disorder (DP group, n = 18), and depressive patients with anxiety disorder (DPA group, n = 20). The correlations between regional GMV and clinical data were analyzed.The DP group showed decreased GMV in the left insula (INS) and left triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus when compared to the NC group. The DPA group showed greater GMV in the midbrain, medial prefrontal cortex, and primary motor/somatosensory cortex when compared to the NC group. Moreover, the DPA group showed greater GMV than the DP group in the frontal, INS, and temporal lobes. Most gray matter anomalies were significantly correlated with depression severity or anxiety symptoms. These correlations were categorized into 4 trend models, of which 3 trend models (ie, Models I, II, and IV) revealed the direction of the correlation between regional GMV and depression severity to be the opposite of that between regional GMV and anxiety symptoms. Importantly, the left INS showed a trend Model I, which might be critically important for distinguishing depressive patients with and without anxiety disorder.Our findings of gray matter abnormalities, their correlations with clinical data, and the trend models showing opposite direction may reflect disorder-specific symptom characteristics and help explain the neurobiological differences between depression and anxiety disorder.","[{'authorId': '1406140379', 'name': 'Haochen Qi'}, {'authorId': '152781697', 'name': 'Y.

Recently, there has been an increasing research focus in this field on the earliest years of life, however, relatively few studies have addressed the role of fathers, despite this appearing to be particularly pertinent to child behavioural development. This study aimed to examine whether father–infant interactions at age 3 months independently predicted child behavioural problems at 1 year of age. Method A sample of 192 families was recruited from two maternity units in the United Kingdom. Father–infant interactions were assessed in the family home and coded using the Global Rating Scales. Child behaviour problems were assessed by maternal report. Hierarchical and logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between father–infant interaction and the development of behavioural problems. Results Disengaged and remote interactions between fathers and their infants were found to predict externalising behavioural problems at the age of 1 year. The children of the most disengaged fathers had an increased risk of developing early externalising behavioural problems [disengaged (nonintrusive) interactions – adjusted Odds Ratio 5.33 (95% Confidence Interval; 1.39, 20.40): remote interactions adj. OR 3.32 (0.92, 12.05)] Conclusions Disengaged interactions of fathers with their infants, as early as the third month of life, predict early behavioural problems in children. These interactions may be critical factors to address, from a very early age in the child’s life, and offer a potential opportunity for preventive intervention.","[{'authorId': '50312636', 'name': 'P.

However, the automation of financial advisory processes to fully-digitalized services often goes hand in hand with a loss of human contact and lack of trust. Especially in an investment context, customers demand a human involved to ensure the trustworthiness of digitalized financial services. In this paper, we report the findings of a lab experiment (N=183) investigating how different levels of anthropomorphic design of a robo-advisor chatbot might compensate for the lack of human involvement and positively affect users’ trusting beliefs and likeliness to follow its recommendations. We found that the anthropomorphic design influences users’ perceived social presence of the chatbot. While trusting beliefs in the chatbot enhance users’ likeliness to follow the recommendation by the chatbot, we do not find evidence for a direct effect of social presence on likeliness to follow its recommendation. However, social presence has a positive indirect effect on likeliness to follow the recommendation via trusting beliefs. Our research contributes to the body of knowledge on the design of robo-advisors and provides more insight into the factors that influence users’ investment decisions when interacting with a robo-advisor chatbot.","[{'authorId': '3339327', 'name': 'Stefan Morana'}, {'authorId': '7807550', 'name': 'Ulrich Gnewuch'}, {'authorId': '3377195', 'name': 'D.

cbaac1f5f0a60ec82f74de189f42c47344d8812c,"Background Many potential benefits for the uses of chatbots within the context of health care have been theorized, such as improved patient education and treatment compliance. However, little is known about the perspectives of practicing medical physicians on the use of chatbots in health care, even though these individuals are the traditional benchmark of proper patient care. Objective This study aimed to investigate the perceptions of physicians regarding the use of health care chatbots, including their benefits, challenges, and risks to patients. Methods A total of 100 practicing physicians across the United States completed a Web-based, self-report survey to examine their opinions of chatbot technology in health care. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used to examine the characteristics of participants. Results A wide variety of positive and negative perspectives were reported on the use of health care chatbots, including the importance to patients for managing their own health and the benefits on physical, psychological, and behavioral health outcomes. More consistent agreement occurred with regard to administrative benefits associated with chatbots; many physicians believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments (78%, 78/100), locating health clinics (76%, 76/100), or providing medication information (71%, 71/100). Conversely, many physicians believed that chatbots cannot effectively care for all of the patients’ needs (76%, 76/100), cannot display human emotion (72%, 72/100), and cannot provide detailed diagnosis and treatment because of not knowing all of the personal factors associated with the patient (71%, 71/100). Many physicians also stated that health care chatbots could be a risk to patients if they self-diagnose too often (714%, 74/100) and do not accurately understand the diagnoses (74%, 74/100). Conclusions Physicians believed in both costs and benefits associated with chatbots, depending on the logistics and specific roles of the technology. Chatbots may have a beneficial role to play in health care to support, motivate, and coach patients as well as for streamlining organizational tasks; in essence, chatbots could become a surrogate for nonmedical caregivers. However, concerns remain on the inability of chatbots to comprehend the emotional state of humans as well as in areas where expert medical knowledge and intelligence is required.","[{'authorId': '5458608', 'name': 'A.

It focuses on analyzing the metacognition process of students with high mathematics anxiety based on Polya’s problem solving phases. This study uses qualitative research with case study strategy. The subjects consist of 8 students of 7 th grade selected through purposive sampling. Data in the form of Mathematics Anxiety Scale (MAS) result and recorded interview while solving mathematics problems were analyzed qualitatively using Miles and Huberman steps. Before selecting the subjects, the researcher gave the Mathematics Anxiety Scale (MAS) to obtain students with high anxiety. Then, subjects were interviewed while solving the problem to investigate their metacognition process. The results show that: (1) The metacognition processes of students with high anxiety in understanding the problem involve planning, monitoring, and evaluating to explore and understand information of the given problem. (2) The metacognition processes of students with high anxiety in devising a plan involve planning and monitoring to identify the possible strategy for solving the problem. (3) The metacognition processes of students with high anxiety in carrying out the plan involve planning to use the strategy and procedures to find the solution. (4) In the final steps namely looking back, there is no metacognition process of students with high anxiety identified. Thus, it can be said that the high of mathematics anxiety can cause the lack of students’ metacognition process while solving the mathematics problem.

Multiple-suture synostosis has consistently been associated with brain compression and increased intracranial pressure, and frequently decreased cognitive development. Single-suture craniosynostosis, however, has been thought by some to be an aesthetic problem with infrequent consequences on brain function and development. Some studies have disputed this concept and have argued a correlation between single-suture craniosynostosis and abnormalities in development. The purpose of this study was to determine, using an objective radiographic tool, positron emission tomography scans, if patients with single-suture craniosynostosis had any abnormalities in cerebral glucose metabolism that would indicate changes in local brain function. A total of 10 children with single-suture craniosynostosis, eight males and two females, ranging in age from 0.1 to 3.2 years, were enrolled in this prospective study approved by the Internal Review Board. Six of the children had sagittal synostosis, three had metopic synostosis, and one had coronal craniosynostosis. Each of the patients had preoperative positron emission tomography scans performed 1 to 5 weeks before cranial reconstructive surgery and postoperative scans at 6 to 12 weeks after surgery. Surgical treatment consisted of cranial vault remodeling in eight of the children and strip craniectomy with cranial expansion in two of the children. After surgery, the two scans were compared qualitatively and quantitatively by a single radiologist. The results demonstrated variable regional increases and decreases in local post-operative cerebral glucose metabolism. However, in the posterior occipital region, the area of visual development and visual spatial coordination, there was a consistent postoperative increase in all 10 patients. Maximum glucose metabolic rate was increased up to 30.2% with a mean of 9.9%, and average glucose metabolic rates demonstrated a maximum increase of up to 18.8%. The results of this study indicate cerebral glucose metabolism consistently increases in the posterior occipital cortex after surgical release of single-suture craniosynostosis.

Few studies have investigated the role of socioeconomic factors in the spread of COVID-19. Methods: The number of COVID-19 cases in the 39 well-developed cities of China was aggregated by searching the publicly available sources. Socioeconomic indicators (e.g., population, population density, gross domestic product, rural-to-urban migrants, urbanization rate, per-person disposable income, and level of health care) in these cities were also aggregated from the Bureau of Statistics. The data referring to travelers from Wuhan were collected from the Baidu Migration database. A multiple stepwise linear regression model was performed to identify the independent risk factors of the number of cases. Results: As of Mar 19, 2020, a total of 5,939 cases were reported in the 39 well-developed cities with almost half of total cases in China outside of Hubei. The number of cases ranged 20–576, and the median number of cases was 93 (IQR 54–180) in these cities. Nine socioeconomic variables including the number of travelers from Wuhan, population, native population, gross domestic product, Per-person GDP, the number of hospitals, the number of rural-to-urban migrants, traffic capacity, and person-disposable income were recognized as potential contributors of the number of cases. Results of multiple linear regression showed a statistically significant association between the number of cases and the number of travelers from Wuhan (t = 6.746, P = 0.000) and the number of rural-to-urban migrants (t = 3.776, P = 0.001) in these cities. However, other seven potential contributors were not associated with the number of cases. Moreover, a well-fitted multiple regression model was built in this study, and a regression equation was as follows: Y = 0.007Xt + 0.200Xm (adjusted R2 = 0.833). Conclusions: Travelers from Wuhan and rural-to-urban migrants were independently associated with the COVID-19 outbreak in the 39 well-developed cities of China.

The current study took advantage of naturally occurring differences in parental preferences for treatment approaches. The micronutrient group asked for treatment without pharmaceuticals (n = 44, aged 2-28 years at entry [M = 8.39 +/- 5.58]). Their records were matched with those of 44 similar children whose families requested conventional treatment (medication group). Both groups improved on both the Childhood Autism Rating Scale and the Childhood Psychiatric Rating Scale (all p values <0.0001). Both groups also exhibited significant decreases in total Aberrant Behavior Checklist scores, but the micronutrient group's improvement was significantly greater (p < 0.0001). SIB Intensity was lower in the micronutrient group at the end of the study (p = 0.005), and improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions scale was greater for the micronutrient group (p = 0.0029). It is difficult to determine whether the observed changes were exerted through improvement in mood disorder or through an independent effect on autistic disorder. There were some advantages to treatment with micronutrients-lower activity level, less social withdrawal, less anger, better spontaneity with the examiner, less irritability, lower intensity SIB, markedly fewer adverse events, and less weight gain.

However, existing studies on the role of trust in electronic commerce are mainly based on ad hoc scales to measure trustworthiness, merely rely on self-reported consequences of trust such as intention to buy, and focus on low-risk products. 
 
 
 
 
In a web-based study, 634 participants interacted with a provider of medical goods, that is a simulated online pharmacy. The study develops and employs a psychometrically sound scale for assessing perceived trustworthiness of online shops. Moreover, it examines the impact of trustworthiness on both consumers' intended and actual behaviour towards online shops. 
 
 
 
 
Results show that trustworthiness promotes both intention to buy and actual financial risk taking. Perceived risk was not found to moderate the relationship between trustworthiness and intention to buy. Instead, trustworthiness partially mediated the influence of perceived risk on intention to buy. The results from the scale development challenge multidimensional conceptualizations of trust; comparing this finding with other studies suggests that the duration of the relationship might moderate the dimensionality of trust.

We highlight similarities between metacognitive and executive control functions, and ask how these processes might be implemented in the human brain. A review of brain imaging studies reveals a circuitry of attentional networks involved in these control processes, with its source located in midfrontal areas. These areas are active during conflict resolution, error correction, and emotional regulation. A developmental approach to the organization of the anatomy involved in executive control provides an added perspective on how these mechanisms are influenced by maturation and learning, and how they relate to metacognitive activity.","[{'authorId': '1401010479', 'name': 'D.

Integrating conservation of resources (Hobfoll, 2002) and ego depletion (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000) theories, we propose that this creates a resource loss spiral that can be slowed by the presence of a ""climate of authenticity"" among one's coworkers. We describe this climate and how it differs from other work climates. We then propose that a work unit with a climate of authenticity should provide a self-regulatory break from emotional labor with patients, thus replenishing resources and buffering against strain from emotional labor. We tested this multilevel prediction by surveying 359 health care providers nested within 48 work units at a large, metropolitan hospital. We find that medical workers experiencing more mistreatment by patients are more likely to be managing emotions with patients, and this response further contributes to the employees' job-related burnout. As predicted, managing emotions with patients was unrelated to burnout for workers in a unit with a climate of authenticity.","[{'authorId': '5248218', 'name': 'Alicia A.

Method: One-hundred fifteen patients with FMS participated in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV to assess current mental disorders. In addition, patients completed standardized questionnaires regarding pain, pain impact, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder-like symptoms, and sexual and physical abuse. Results: Patients were grouped into one of three psychosocial subgroups based on responses to the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI)–Dysfunctional (DYS), Interpersonally Distressed (ID), and Adaptive Copers (AC). Axis I diagnoses were present in 74.8% of the participants overall with the DYS subgroup mainly reporting anxiety and the ID group mood disorders. The AC group showed little comorbidity. Axis II diagnoses were present in only 8.7% of the FMS sample. Conclusion: These results suggest that FMS is not a homogeneous diagnosis, but shows varying proportions of comorbid anxiety and depression dependent on psychosocial characteristics of the patients. The results demonstrate the importance of not treating patients with FMS as a homogeneous group. Assessment should not only examine the presence of widespread pain and the number of tender points, but also the presence of affective distress. Treatment should focus both on physical and emotional dysfunction.

cd9c6373bc1f389fc5d94cca76f411809f5c6ebb,"Background The impact of chronic stressors like the COVID‐19 pandemic is likely to be magnified in adolescents with pre‐existing mental health risk, such as attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study examined changes in and predictors of adolescent mental health from before to during the COVID‐19 pandemic in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States. Methods Participants include 238 adolescents (132 males; ages 15–17; 118 with ADHD). Parents and adolescents provided ratings of mental health symptoms shortly before the COVID‐19 pandemic and in spring and summer 2020. Results Adolescents on average experienced an increase in depression, anxiety, sluggish cognitive tempo, inattentive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms from pre‐COVID‐19 to spring 2020; however, with the exception of inattention, these symptoms decreased from spring to summer 2020. Adolescents with ADHD were more likely than adolescents without ADHD to experience an increase in inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms. Adolescents with poorer pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation abilities were at‐risk for experiencing increases in all mental health symptoms relative to adolescents with better pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation abilities. Interactive risk based on ADHD status and pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation abilities was found for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, such that adolescents with ADHD and poor pre‐COVID‐19 emotion regulation displayed the highest symptomatology across timepoints. Lower family income related to increases in inattention but higher family income related to increases in oppositional/defiant symptoms. Conclusions The early observed increases in adolescent mental health symptoms during the COVID‐19 pandemic do not on average appear to be sustained following the lift of stay‐at‐home orders, though studies evaluating mental health across longer periods of time are needed. Emotion dysregulation and ADHD increase risk for sustained negative mental health functioning and highlight the need for interventions for these populations during chronic stressors. Results and clinical implications should be considered within the context of our predominately White, middle class sample.","[{'authorId': '2517546', 'name': 'R.

Current psychotropic medications for childhood bipolar spectrum disorders (BPSD) are associated with significant adverse events. As nutrients play an important role in physical and mental health, they may be useful in treating mood disorders with few side-effects. This open-label study explored the feasibility of testing therapeutic effects of a multinutrient supplement, EMPowerplus™ (EMP+), for pediatric BPSD.


DESIGN
EMP+ was started at one capsule t.i.d. and escalated to a goal of four capsules t.i.d., which eight children attained. Four (4) of these increased to the maximum dose, five capsules t.i.d. Mood symptoms were assessed seven times over 8 weeks.


SUBJECTS
Ten (10) children, age 6-12 with BPSD, were enrolled in 6.5 months. Seven (7) participants completed the full trial. Three (3) dropped out due to palatability and/or adherence issues.


RESULTS
Mean medication adherence was 91%. With one-tailed nonparametric Fisher's randomization tests, intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated a 37% decrease in depression scores (p<0.06) and a 45% decrease in mania scores (p<0.01) from the start of treatment through final visit, suggesting improvement and possible treatment response. Study completers demonstrated significant decreasing trends in both depression and mania scores from baseline to final visit (p<0.05). Side-effects were minor and transient, mostly temporary gastric discomfort.


CONCLUSIONS
Future randomized, placebo-controlled trials of EMP+ are warranted and feasible.","[{'authorId': '31873330', 'name': 'Elisabeth A. Frazier'}, {'authorId': '51914025', 'name': 'M.

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.","[{'authorId': '1701686', 'name': 'Ilya Sutskever'}, {'authorId': '1689108', 'name': 'Oriol Vinyals'}, {'authorId': '2827616', 'name': 'Quoc V.

Eighty-two mothers of toddlers completed questionnaires that measured these constructs. Emotion regulation strategies were more consistently associated with overreactive than with lax discipline. More suppression in discipline encounters was associated with less overreactivity, an association partially mediated by expressed negative emotion. Reappraisal, both globally and in the context of discipline encounters, was inversely associated with overreactive discipline. The association of global reappraisal and overreactivity was mediated in parallel by experienced and expressed negative emotion. Surprisingly, global reappraisal, relative to reappraisal in discipline encounters, appears to have more consistent implications for mothers' emotion and parenting practices in discipline encounters. A reconceptualization of the nature of reappraisal in discipline encounters is suggested.

However, these studies were not specifically concerned with the components of working memory and had not focused in detail on working memory functions. For this reason, the current study investigated the relationship between clinical insight and working memory components in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.  METHOD: The patient group was evaluated by using the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms, and the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder to measure clinical insight. Moreover, all participants underwent a ""Situation Awareness"" test in order to measure working memory functions. Based on published data, the first stage of this test was accepted to measure the ""visual spatial sketchpad"" component of working memory, and the second stage was accepted to measure the ""episodic buffer"" (bound information storage) component. The functions of these components were measured separately as top-down and bottom-up cognitive processes.  RESULTS: The episodic buffer function (managed by the bottom-up cognitive process) was related with clinical insight. This relationship also continued after correcting for the effect of positive symptoms on insight. The patients performed worse than the controls in terms of visual spatial sketchpad function, which was managed by both topdown and bottom-up cognitive processes. The patients performed worse than the controls in terms of both top-down and bottom-up cognitive processes and visual spatial sketchpad function. Furthermore, the patients were also worse than the controls in terms of episodic buffer function (managed by top-down cognitive processes).  CONCLUSION: Clinical insight may be associated with binding function (associated with episodic buffer function) managed by bottom-up cognitive processes in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Further studies are necessary to confirm this novel finding.","[{'authorId': '4466743', 'name': 'Selim Tümkaya'}, {'authorId': '1486170456', 'name': 'Ezgi Hancı Yenigün'}, {'authorId': '84526238', 'name': 'Osman Zülkif Topak'}, {'authorId': '8579204', 'name': 'İbrahim Şendur'}, {'authorId': '134525178', 'name': 'Neşe Öztürk Atkaya'}, {'authorId': '5992902', 'name': 'O.

Findings also indicate a positive relationship with PA and anger expression — a connection rarely considered or examined in anger research.

While a variety of factors have been linked to suicidal ideation, only few studies have examined role of stress and optimism among adolescents population. This study aimed to determine the relationships between stress and optimism and suicidal ideation among adolescent students. Participants for this study were 200 adolescent students from Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India. Appropriate questionnaires were used for measuring optimism, stress, and suicidal ideation among students. Apart from descriptive statistics for analyzing data, a four-step hierarchical linear regression analysis was used in order to examine main and moderator effects predicting suicidal ideation. Significant moderating effects were also probed and plotted through simple slopes at plus-and-minus one standard deviation of the stress on the association between stress and suicidal ideation within each level of moderator variable i.e. high and low levels. The results of the Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that there was significant positive relationship between stress and suicidal ideation. A significant negative correlation between optimism and suicidal ideation was also found. In addition, boys were more pessimistic and had more suicidal ideation compared to girls. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that stress and optimism predicted suicidal ideation for total sample and for both boys and girls. Moreover, the Stress X Optimism interaction was found to further augment the prediction of suicidal ideation, even after controlling for demographic variables and the main effects of optimism and stress. Consistent with the proposed interaction model, a plot of the significant interactions indicated that the link between stress and suicidal ideation was significantly more exacerbated for pessimistic as compared to optimistic adolescents. Findings from this study would help the healthcare professionals, counsellors, teachers, and parents in understanding how high stress which is peculiar to the stage of adolescence particularly students may have serious consequences in the form of suicidal ideas and that optimistic thinking may be helpful in coping with the stresses of this stage so as to avoid its harmful effects.","[{'authorId': '152517902', 'name': 'Journals Iosr'}, {'authorId': '1460287823', 'name': 'Hameeda Shaheen Dr.'}, {'authorId': '49859054', 'name': 'M.

The current study examined the associations between physical and emotional neglect occurring in childhood and 2 types of disordered eating symptoms (binge eating and drive for muscularity) among college men and women. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the relations between childhood physical and emotional neglect and eating disorder symptoms would be mediated by alexithymia. Participants (N = 1344) completed self-report measures through an online system. Four moderated mediation models were tested to examine our proposed mediation model in the context of potential gender differences. Consistent with prediction, our analyses revealed significant associations between childhood physical and emotional neglect and 2 types of disordered eating symptoms, and alexithymia mediated these relationships. Contrary to our hypothesis, gender moderated the relationship between alexithymia and binge eating, but not drive for muscularity. Childhood neglect, both physical and emotional, was associated with higher levels of binge eating in women, but not men. These findings suggest that the experience of neglect in early childhood may be related to certain types of eating disorder symptoms through its impact on the ability to identify, experience, and express one’s own emotions.","[{'authorId': '6859179', 'name': 'Allison M.

A principal components analysis of a 20-item sources of teacher stress inventory had suggested four distinct dimensions which were labelled: Pupil Misbehaviour, Time/Resource Difficulties, Professional Recognition Needs, and Poor Relationships, respectively. To check on the validity of the Borg et al. factor solution, the group of 710 teachers was randomly split into two separate samples. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out on the data from Sample 1 (N = 335), while Sample 2 (N = 375) provided the cross-validational data for a LISREL confirmatory factor analysis. Results supported the proposed dimensionality of the sources of teacher stress (measurement model), along with evidence of an additional teacher stress factor (Workload). Consequently, structural modelling of the 'causal relationships' between the various latent variables and self-reported stress was undertaken on the combined samples (N = 710).

d1bde81d5bad2f06e0f2033ee45c50ff373a625a,"The development of children's emotion-related self-regulation appears to be related to, and likely involved in, many aspects of children's development. In this review, the distinction between effortful self-regulatory processes and those that are somewhat less voluntary is discussed, and literature on the former capacities is reviewed. Emotion-related self-regulation develops rapidly in the early years of life and improves more slowly into adulthood. Individual differences in children's self-regulation are fairly stable after the first year or two of life. Such individual differences are inversely related to at least some types of externalizing problems. Findings for internalizing problems are less consistent and robust, although emotion-related self-regulation appears to be inversely related to internalizing problems after the early years. Self-regulatory capacities have been related to both genetic and environmental factors and their interaction. Some interventions designed to foster self-regulation and, hence, reduce maladjustment, have proved to be at least partially effective.","[{'authorId': '15102546', 'name': 'N.

Method MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles examining depression and diabetes complications in type 1 and type 2 diabetes samples published between 1975 and 1999. Meta-analytic procedures were used. Studies were reviewed for diabetes type, sample size, statistical tests, and measures of diabetes complications and depression. Significance values, weighted effect sizes r, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and tests of homogeneity of variance were calculated for the overall sample (k = 27) and for subsets of interest. Results A total of 27 studies (total combined N = 5374) met the inclusion criteria. A significant association was found between depression and complications of diabetes (p < .00001, z = 5.94). A moderate and significant weighted effect size (r = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.22–0.28) was calculated for all studies reporting sufficient data (k = 22). Depression was significantly associated with a variety of diabetes complications (diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, macrovascular complications, and sexual dysfunction). Effect sizes were in the small to moderate range (r = 0.17 to 0.32). Conclusions These findings demonstrate a significant and consistent association of diabetes complications and depressive symptoms. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to identify the pathways that mediate this association.","[{'authorId': '2435460', 'name': 'M. de Groot'}, {'authorId': '2111774889', 'name': 'Ryan Anderson'}, {'authorId': '82184803', 'name': 'K.

However, only a few researchers have compared mindful modes of exercise with aerobic exercise to examine the effect of 1 single session of exercise on mood. In the present study, the authors assessed state anxiety, depressive mood, and subjective well-being prior to and following 1 class of 1 of 4 exercise modes: yoga, Feldenkrais (awareness through movement), aerobic dance, and swimming; a computer class served as a control. Participants were 147 female general curriculum and physical education teachers (mean age = 40.15, SD = 0.2) voluntarily enrolled in a 1 -year enrichment program at a physical education college. Analyses of variance for repeated measures revealed mood improvement following Feldenkrais, swimming, and yoga but not following aerobic dance and computer lessons. Mindful low-exertion activities as well as aerobic activities enhanced mood in 1 single session of exercise. The authors suggest that more studies assessing the mood-enhancing benefits of mindful activities such as Feldenkrais and yoga are needed.","[{'authorId': '4090107', 'name': 'Y.

Following this more introductory section, we argue why individual differences in primary emotional systems may represent the phylogenetically oldest parts of human personality. Our argumentation leads to the need to increasingly consider individual differences in the raw affects/emotions of people to understand human personality in a bottom–up fashion, which can be coordinated with top–down perspectives. In support of this idea, we also review existing evidence linking individual differences in primal emotions as assessed with the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales and the widely accepted Big Five Model of Personality. In this context, we provide additional evidence on the link between primal emotions and personality in German and Chinese sample populations. In short, this article addresses evolutionary perspectives in the evaluation of human personality, highlighting some of the ancestral emotional urges that probably still control variations in the construction of human personality structures. Moreover, we address how individual differences in primary emotional systems can illuminate linkages to major human psychopathologies and the potential advantages and disadvantages of carrying a certain personality trait within certain cultural/environmental niches.","[{'authorId': '2720403', 'name': 'C.

This study examined the hypothesis that parental playfulness promotes children’s emotional skills and thus should be related to improved emotion regulation and lower anxiety. A sample of 137 parents of children aged 2–8 self-reported on their parental playfulness levels, their own emotion regulation ability, levels of parent–child closeness and conflicts, and their children’s emotion regulation and anxiety levels. Parental playfulness was associated with improved emotion regulation in their children. This association was mediated by the parent’s emotional awareness and the level of parent–child closeness. These findings underscore the importance of parental playfulness for the children's emotional skills and the parent–child relationship.","[{'authorId': '6640464', 'name': 'M.

En concreto se pretende estudiar la complementariedad entre dos medidas de autoeficacia: una generalizada y otra especifica para el ambito laboral. La hipotesis de partida es que la autoeficacia especifica modulara mas relaciones del estres laboral y sus consecuencias que la autoeficacia generalizada. A partir de los datos obtenidos de 140 trabajadores que utilizan nuevas tecnologias en sus puestos, se constata que, en general, la autoeficacia modula las relaciones entre los estresores y sus consecuencias, en el sentido de que bajos niveles de autoeficacia estan asociados a mayores niveles de estres experimentado. Los resultados de los analisis de regresion multiple jerarquica senalan que, aunque encontramos mas efectos de interaccion en el caso de la autoeficacia profesional, ambos tipos de autoeficacia son complementarias en cuanto a su rol modulador en los procesos de estres, dependiendo su modulacion del tipo de estresor y de la consecuencia de estres especifica considerada. En concreto encontramos que los trabajadores bajos en autoeficacia generalizada manifiestan mayor agotamiento emocional cuando la autonomia laboral es mayor; mientras que los trabajadores bajos en autoeficacia profesional manifiestan mayores niveles de cinismo cuando la rutina y el conflicto de rol son altos, y menores niveles de compromiso organizacional cuando tienen niveles elevados de conflicto de rol. Para los trabajadores altos en niveles de autoeficacia, tanto generalizada como especifica, valores altos de los estresores no estan asociado con consecuencias negativas del estres.

While departing from a critique on the assumptions of the human resource‐based view of the firm, we develop an alternative approach which has been derived from the core elements of the relational theory of emotions. These elements, which pertain to the complexity of human beings, emphasize the processes and relational characteristics of emotions and the hegemonic power base of emotions. We argue that it is necessary to sensitize HRM to the emotional subroutines entwined in organizational change, and that an empathic and respectful approach towards people's authenticity should be cultivated.","[{'authorId': '3026745', 'name': 'H.

d2dd5ffd7124d1964b62d27eb200a0e8c3123139,"Bedtime is frequently delayed by many factors in life, and a homeostatic response to the delay may compensate partly for increased time awake and shortened sleep. Because sleep becomes shorter with age and women complain of disturbed sleep more often than men, age and sex differences in the homeostatic response to a delayed bedtime may modify the homeostatic response. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of late‐night short‐sleep (3 h with awakening at about 07:00 hours) on in‐home recorded sleep in men and women in two age groups (20–30 and 65–75 years). Results (N = 59) showed that late‐night short‐sleep was associated with an increase in percentage of N3 sleep and a decrease in percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, as well as decreases in several measures of sleep discontinuity and rapid eye movement density. Men showed a smaller decrease in percentage of rapid eye movement sleep than women in response to late‐night short‐sleep, as did older individuals of both sexes compared with younger. Older men showed a weaker percentage of N3 sleep in response to late‐night short‐sleep than younger men. In general, men showed a greater percentage of rapid eye movement sleep and a lower percentage of N3 sleep than women, and older individuals showed a lower percentage of N3 sleep than younger. In particular, older men showed very low levels of percentage of N3 sleep. We conclude that older males show less of a homeostatic response to late‐night short‐sleep. This may be an indication of impaired capacity for recovery in older men. Future studies should investigate if this pattern can be linked to gender‐associated differences in morbidity and mortality.","[{'authorId': '1850618', 'name': 'T.

We review randomized controlled psychotherapy trials to find those that are empirically supported with respect to acute symptom reduction and the prevention of subsequent relapse and recurrence. Methods: We searched the PsycINFO and PubMed databases and the reference sections of chapters and journal articles to identify appropriate articles. Results: One hundred twenty‐five studies were found evaluating treatment efficacy for the various mood disorders. With respect to the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and behavior therapy (BT) are efficacious and specific and brief dynamic therapy (BDT) and emotion‐focused therapy (EFT) are possibly efficacious. CBT is efficacious and specific, mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT) efficacious, and BDT and EFT possibly efficacious in the prevention of relapse/recurrence following treatment termination and IPT and CBT are each possibly efficacious in the prevention of relapse/recurrence if continued or maintained. IPT is possibly efficacious in the treatment of dysthymic disorder. With respect to bipolar disorder (BD), CBT and family‐focused therapy (FFT) are efficacious and interpersonal social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) possibly efficacious as adjuncts to medication in the treatment of depression. Psychoeducation (PE) is efficacious in the prevention of mania/hypomania (and possibly depression) and FFT is efficacious and IPSRT and CBT possibly efficacious in preventing bipolar episodes.

Psychological well-being, an essential factor in preventing academic failure, has been threatened in this serious situation of unprecedented and stressful isolation. The aim of this study is to analyze the students’ cognitive-emotional regulation as well as their beliefs and perceptions about the pandemic and this lockdown situation. With this extensive study we are carrying out, want to describe the extent to which the lockdown situation is a risk factor, and, in the future, make proposals for preventive and palliative actions, if necessary, to minimize this potential risk. Method We applied the CERQ Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire by means of an online application together with a questionnaire, CC/covid-19, of objective description and subjective perception of the lockdown situation of the students, their conditions to study, general opinions about the pandemic and specific opinions about the real possibilities of implementing online education in the middle of the academic year at the university. 1910 valid responses from more than 80 universities in 13 different Spanish-speaking countries were obtained and submitted to descriptive analysis and modeling using structural equations. Results Most of them consider that the lockdown decision is correct, that health systems are not prepared to deal with the pandemic, and that although the universities have adequate means, the teaching staff is not competent to implement online teaching methodologies. They have a good perception of the conditions of isolation, however, the time devoted to studying has not increased. One of the results of our study is the students’ self-evaluation about their digital competence and their capacity to perform in online interactive communication. This is key to rejecting a feeling of loneliness or social isolation, even if there is momentary physical separation with friends and classmates which is consistent with the results of emotional well-being the surveyed students present. The cognitive strategies used by the students surveyed have allowed them coping with events arising from the pandemic, mandatory isolation and university closure, certainly adaptive and functional, while maintaining a positive perception of their new living and learning situation.","[{'authorId': '2101997362', 'name': 'Manuel Fernández Cruz'}, {'authorId': '14849253', 'name': 'José Álvarez Rodríguez'}, {'authorId': '2000722083', 'name': 'Inmaculada Ávalos Ruiz'}, {'authorId': '1582343006', 'name': 'Mercedes Cuevas López'}, {'authorId': '2000701604', 'name': 'Claudia de Barros Camargo'}, {'authorId': '2000711991', 'name': 'Francisco Díaz Rosas'}, {'authorId': '2000701606', 'name': 'Esther González Castellón'}, {'authorId': '83568246', 'name': 'Daniel González González'}, {'authorId': '2000717493', 'name': 'Antonio Hernández Fernández'}, {'authorId': '2000828964', 'name': 'Pilar Ibáñez Cubillas'}, {'authorId': '2000800209', 'name': 'Emilio Jesús Lizarte Simón'}]",35.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '11'}",42.0,Evaluation of the Emotional and Cognitive Regulation of Young People in a Lockdown Situation Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020.0

We propose a typology of HRM research based on two dimensions: level of analysis (individual/group or organization) and number of practices (single or multiple). We use this framework to review the recent research in each of the four subareas. We argue that while significant progress has been made within each area, the potential for greater gains exists by looking across each area. Toward this end we suggest some future research directions based on a more integrative view of HRM. We believe that both areas can contribute significantly to each other resulting in a more profound impact on the field of HRM than each can contribute independently.","[{'authorId': '50145621', 'name': 'P.

Information about the psychiatric histories of adults with anxiety disorders was examined to further inform nosology and etiological/ preventive efforts.


METHOD
The authors used data from a prospective longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort (N=1,037) from ages 11 to 32 years, making psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM criteria. For adults with anxiety disorders at 32 years, follow-back analyses ascertained first diagnosis of anxiety and other juvenile disorders.


RESULTS
Of adults with each type of anxiety disorder, approximately half had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (one-third with an anxiety disorder) by age 15. The juvenile histories of psychiatric problems for adults with different types of anxiety disorders were largely nonspecific, partially reflecting comorbidity at 32 years. Histories of anxiety and depression were most common. There was also specificity. For example, adults with panic disorder did not have histories of juvenile disorders, whereas those with other anxiety disorders did. Adults with posttraumatic stress disorder had histories of conduct disorder, whereas those with other anxiety disorders did not. Adults with specific phobia had histories of juvenile phobias but not other anxiety disorders.


CONCLUSIONS
Strong comorbidity between different anxiety disorders and lack of specificity in developmental histories of adults with anxiety disorders supports a hierarchical approach to classification, with a broad class of anxiety disorders having individual disorders within it. The early first diagnosis of psychiatric difficulties in individuals with anxiety disorders suggests the need to target research examining the etiology of anxiety disorders and prevention early in life.","[{'authorId': '3586653', 'name': 'A.

d4fb033c9bee48cdae9c5cca2025d615c09acc19,"OBJECTIVE
Binge-eating disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and is associated with eating disorder and general psychopathology and overweight/obesity. Deficits in cognitive and emotional functioning for eating disorders or obesity have been reported. However, a systematic review on cognitive and emotional functioning for individuals with BED is lacking.


METHOD
A systematic literature search was conducted across three databases (Medline, PubMed, and PsycINFO). Overall, n = 57 studies were included in the present review.


RESULTS
Regarding cognitive functioning (CoF), individuals with BED consistently demonstrated higher information processing biases compared to obese and normal-weight controls in the context of disorder-related stimuli (i.e., food and body cues), whereas CoF in the context of neutral stimuli appeared to be less affected. Thus, results suggest disorder-related rather than general difficulties in CoF in BED. With respect to emotional functioning (EmF), individuals with BED reported difficulties similar to individuals with other eating disorders, with a tendency to show less severe difficulties in some domains. In addition, individuals with BED reported greater emotional deficits when compared to obese and normal-weight controls. Findings suggest general difficulties in EmF in BED. Thus far, however, investigations of EmF in disorder-relevant situations are lacking.


DISCUSSION
Overall, the cross-sectional findings indicate BED to be associated with difficulties in CoF and EmF. Future research should determine the nature of these difficulties, in regards to general and disorder-related stimuli, and consider interactions of both domains to foster the development and improvement of appropriate interventions in BED.","[{'authorId': '26864312', 'name': 'Rebekka Kittel'}, {'authorId': '5014799', 'name': 'A.

d55b1a513a4ffdd7c506eadc570fab3770c3b28b,"Background Depression and anxiety are common mental health difficulties experienced by university students and can impair academic and social functioning. Students are limited in seeking help from professionals. As university students are highly connected to digital technologies, Web-based and computer-delivered interventions could be used to improve students’ mental health. The effectiveness of these intervention types requires investigation to identify whether these are viable prevention strategies for university students. Objective The intent of the study was to systematically review and analyze trials of Web-based and computer-delivered interventions to improve depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress in university students. Methods Several databases were searched using keywords relating to higher education students, mental health, and eHealth interventions. The eligibility criteria for studies included in the review were: (1) the study aimed to improve symptoms relating to depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and stress, (2) the study involved computer-delivered or Web-based interventions accessed via computer, laptop, or tablet, (3) the study was a randomized controlled trial, and (4) the study was trialed on higher education students. Trials were reviewed and outcome data analyzed through random effects meta-analyses for each outcome and each type of trial arm comparison. Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess study quality. Results A total of 17 trials were identified, in which seven were the same three interventions on separate samples; 14 reported sufficient information for meta-analysis. The majority (n=13) were website-delivered and nine interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A total of 1795 participants were randomized and 1480 analyzed. Risk of bias was considered moderate, as many publications did not sufficiently report their methods and seven explicitly conducted completers’ analyses. In comparison to the inactive control, sensitivity meta-analyses supported intervention in improving anxiety (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.56; 95% CI −0.77 to −0.35, P<.001), depression (pooled SMD −0.43; 95% CI −0.63 to −0.22, P<.001), and stress (pooled SMD −0.73; 95% CI −1.27 to −0.19, P=.008). In comparison to active controls, sensitivity analyses did not support either condition for anxiety (pooled SMD −0.18; 95% CI −0.98 to 0.62, P=.66) or depression (pooled SMD −0.28; 95% CI −0.75 to −0.20, P=.25). In contrast to a comparison intervention, neither condition was supported in sensitivity analyses for anxiety (pooled SMD −0.10; 95% CI −0.39 to 0.18, P=.48) or depression (pooled SMD −0.33; 95% CI −0.43 to 1.09, P=.40). Conclusions The findings suggest Web-based and computer-delivered interventions can be effective in improving students’ depression, anxiety, and stress outcomes when compared to inactive controls, but some caution is needed when compared to other trial arms and methodological issues were noticeable. Interventions need to be trialed on more heterogeneous student samples and would benefit from user evaluation. Future trials should address methodological considerations to improve reporting of trial quality and address post-intervention skewed data.","[{'authorId': '143834070', 'name': 'E. B.

This cross-sectional study investigated the interrelationship between playfulness in young adults, perceived stress, and styles of coping with 898 students from three universities. Findings revealed that playful individuals reported lower levels of perceived stress than their less playful counterparts, and more frequently utilized adaptive, stressor-focused coping strategies and were less likely to employ negative, avoidant, and escape-oriented strategies. The results suggested that playfulness serves a strong adaptive function with university students, providing them with specific cognitive resources from which they can manifest effective coping behaviors in the face of stressful situations.

In Turkey, eating disorders have been increasing in prevalence among adolescents. Family relations and parenting have been studied as sociocultural influences that shape individuals’ eating behaviors and relationships with food. Eating behaviors have psychosocial outcomes for adolescents’ development and are affected by parental warmth and care. This study investigated the relationship between fathers’ parental attitudes and young individuals’ emotion regulation skills and eating behaviors. It focused on fathers’ parental attitudes in Turkey, where a collectivistic and patriarchal culture typically has father figures playing an important role in family as well as in society. The Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26), Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire—Child Form (PARQ-C) were used to collect data from 401 Turkish adolescents. Correlation analyses showed positive correlations between 2 combinations of variables: adolescents’ eating behaviors and emotion regulation skills, and fathers’ parenting and adolescents’ eating behaviors. Multiple regression analysis showed that father’s parenting was predictive of adolescents’ eating behaviors and emotion regulation skills. Based on the results, this research may promote positive social change by identifying the importance of fathers’ parenting attitudes on adolescent health and by raising awareness of eating disorders in Turkey. The study will guide researchers and counselors in designing eating disorders prevention programs and identify tools for involving fathers in developing healthy parenting attitudes and awareness of eating disorders.

The World Health Organization highlighted how the lockdown had negative consequences on psychological well-being, especially for children. The present study aimed to investigate parental correlates of children’s emotion regulation during the COVID-19 lockdown. Within the Social Cognitive Theory framework, a path model in which parenting self-efficacy and parental regulatory emotional self-efficacy mediated the relationship between parents’ psychological distress and both children’s emotional regulation, and children’s lability/negativity, was investigated. A total of 277 parents of children aged from 6 to 13 years completed an online survey that assessed their psychological distress, regulatory emotional self-efficacy, and parenting self-efficacy. Parents reported also children’s emotional regulation and lability/negativity. A structural equation model (SEM) using MPLUS 8.3 was tested. Results showed that the hypothesized model exhibited excellent fit, chi-square (83) = 140.40, p < 0.01, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96, SRMR = 0.04. The influences of parents’ psychological distress and parents’ regulatory emotional self-efficacy on children’s emotional regulation and lability/negativity were mediated by parenting self-efficacy. The mediation model was invariant across children’s biological sex and age, and geographical residence area (high risk vs. low risk for COVID-19). Results suggested how parents’ beliefs to be competent in managing parental tasks might be a protective factor for their children’s emotional well-being. Implications for intervention programs are discussed.","[{'authorId': '47213442', 'name': 'Mara Morelli'}, {'authorId': '11876815', 'name': 'E. Cattelino'}, {'authorId': '3157079', 'name': 'R.

The results show that consumption values except epistemic value have positive effects on consumer satisfaction and brand commitment. In particular, this article uncovers the moderating effect of age in social values and consumer satisfaction. Specifically, social values affect consumer satisfaction when consumers are under 39 years old. This paper also found that functional value and social value have the strongest effect on consumer satisfaction and brand commitment, respectively, compared with other values. Contravening consumption value theory, our data suggests that epistemic value impedes brand commitment.","[{'authorId': '2061175203', 'name': 'Hiroyasu Furukawa'}, {'authorId': '2065743965', 'name': 'Koki Matsumura'}, {'authorId': '2057596771', 'name': 'Susumu Harada'}]",11.0,,72.0,"EFFECT OF CONSUMPTION VALUES ON CONSUMER SATISFACTION AND BRAND COMMITMENT: INVESTIGATING FUNCTIONAL, EMOTIONAL, SOCIAL, AND EPISTEMIC VALUES IN THE RUNNING SHOES MARKET",2019.0

The study used a qualitative case study. Two infant caregivers in a university-based child care centre participated in this study. For the three-month research period, observations, interviews, ongoing conversations, email exchanges and field notes were used as data sources. The findings revealed that the infant caregivers' playfulness appeared in a wide range of verbal and non-verbal behaviours, gestures and expressions. Also, the caregivers' playfulness helped to alleviate infants' emotional distress and made smooth transitions to new experiences. The study suggests playfulness is a constructive way for infants to build up the relationship between infants and teachers.","[{'authorId': '7387540', 'name': 'Jeesun Jung'}]",19.0,,35.0,Caregivers' playfulness and infants' emotional stress during transitional time,2011.0

Consequences of inactivity, including a higher mortality rate and poorer general health and fitness, have been reported. This systematic review aimed to provide practical recommendations for maintaining active lifestyles during pandemics. In May 2020, two electronic databases (PubMed; Web of Science) were used to search for relevant studies. A total of 1206 records were screened by two researchers. Thirty-one relevant studies were included in this systematic review, in which the methodological quality was assessed. With regard to six studies, which explicitly dealt with physical activity during COVID-19, the evidence level is classified by three articles to level II, and in the other three to level VI. Regarding the physical activity recommendations in these papers, three of them were classified to a medium, and the same number to a weak evidence base. Of the 25 papers which refer to other pandemics and/or isolation situations, one was classified to evidence level I, four were ranged to level II, three to level III, one to level V, and the others to level VI. This systematic review revealed that reduced physical activity levels are of serious concern during home confinement in pandemic times. The recommendations provided by many international organizations to maintain active lifestyles during these times mainly target the general population, with less consideration for vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults, people with health issues). Therefore, personalized and supervised physical activity programs are urgently needed, with the option to group-play physical activity programs (e.g., exergames). These can be assisted, delivered, and disseminated worldwide through information and communication technology solutions. If it is permitted and safe, being active outside in daylight is advised, with an effort level of mild to moderate using the rating of perceived exertion scale. Relaxation techniques should be integrated into the daily routine to reduce stress levels. On the evidence base and levels of the included articles in this review, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Given that policies are different across regions and countries, further research is needed to categorize recommendations according to different social-distancing scenarios.","[{'authorId': '1680123821', 'name': 'Ellen Bentlage'}, {'authorId': '40531218', 'name': 'A.

The literature demonstrates a mediating role of emotional regulation in the development of depression and physical illness. Literature suggests in fact that the employment of adaptive emotional regulation strategies (e.g., reappraisal) causes a reduction of stress-elicited emotions leading to physical disorders. Conversely, dysfunctional emotional regulation strategies and, in particular, rumination and emotion suppression appear to be influential in the pathogenesis of depression and physiological disease. More specifically, the evidence suggests that depression and rumination affect both cognitive (e.g., impaired ability to process negative information) and neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis overactivation and higher rates of cortisol production). Understanding the factors that govern the variety of health outcomes that different people experience following exposure to stress has important implications for the development of effective emotion-regulation interventional approaches (e.g., mindfulness-based therapy, emotion-focused therapy, and emotion regulation therapy).","[{'authorId': '1722591', 'name': 'A.

The SD-R framework allows the study of salutogenic and pathogenic effects of university settings on students’ health and well-being. Using a large sample of university students (n = 5660), our aim was to translate and validate the JD-R’s essential assumptions within the university context, and thus establish the SD-R framework. We performed structural equation modelling to examine these essential assumptions. As assumed, we found that study demands—the “bad things” at university—predict student burnout (β = 0.50), whereas study resources—the “good things” at university—predict student engagement (β = 0.70) as well as burnout (β = −0.35). Also, in line with the SD-R’s assumptions, student burnout predicts life satisfaction negatively (β = −0.34), whereas student engagement predicts life satisfaction positively (β = 0.29). Hence, we were able to introduce the novel SD-R framework and validate its core assumptions. The SD-R framework serves as an excellent theoretical basis to examine both the salutogenic and pathogenic effects of the study context on students’ health and well-being. However, the framework needs further longitudinal and meta-analytical verification in accordance with the research on the JD-R framework.","[{'authorId': '113225222', 'name': 'T.

The neural basis of reactive aggression, especially its control, remains poorly understood, however. We conducted an event-related potential (ERP) study using a competitive reaction time task that elicits aggression through provocation. Participants were selected from a larger sample because of extreme scores in trait aggressiveness, yielding high and low trait aggressive groups. As each trial in the task is separated into a decision phase, during which the punishment level for the opponent is set, and an outcome phase, during which the punishment is applied or received, we were able to disentangle provocation-related and evaluation-related modulations of the ERPs during the aggressive interaction. Specifically, we observed an enhanced frontal negativity during the decision phase under high provocation that was positively correlated with the participants' ability to refrain from retaliation. This held true for high trait aggressive participants only, pointing to a higher need for inhibitory and control processes in these people when provoked. During the outcome phase, we detected a mediofrontal negativity in loss compared to win trials, resembling previous ERP findings to negative feedback stimuli, which have been linked to the evaluation of an outcome's valence. This mediofrontal negativity was differentially pronounced in aggressive and nonaggressive participants: Nonaggressive participants showed only a slightly smaller mediofrontal negativity in win than in loss trials, suggesting that for them punishing the opponent had a similar negative valence as being punished.","[{'authorId': '31451042', 'name': 'U.

Methods:A total of 563 college students were administered measures of BIS and BAS and asked to indicate both (1) the average intensity of pain at 10 body sites during the past week and (2) the frequency with which they experience mild, moderate, and severe headaches. The associations between (1) the BIS and BAS scale scores and (2) the worst average pain intensity experienced and headache frequencies were examined using a series of 1-way analyses of variance. Results:As predicted, the measure of BIS demonstrated significant and nonlinear associations with both pain intensity and headache frequency. The measure of BAS was not significantly related to pain intensity, but did demonstrate a nonlinear association with the frequency of severe headaches. Discussion:The findings are consistent with predictions based on a model hypothesizing that pain has a nonlinear impact on both BIS and BAS, with a stronger impact on BIS than BAS. If the current results are replicated in other samples, including samples of individuals with chronic pain, they have important implications for identifying biological factors that could influence pain and behavioral responses to pain, as well as for the development and evaluation of treatments that could enhance positive treatment outcomes.","[{'authorId': '2241581128', 'name': 'M.

Few studies have taken a whole‐brain perspective in the functional connectivity (FC) analysis of these two disorders in resting state. It limits the ability to identify regionally and psychopathologically specific network abnormalities with their subsequent use as diagnostic marker and novel treatment strategy. The whole brain FC using a novel FC metric was compared, that is, scaled correlation, which they demonstrated to be a reliable FC statistics, but have higher statistical power in two‐sample t‐test of whole brain FC analysis. About 21 GAD and 18 PD patients were compared with 22 matched control subjects during resting‐state, respectively. It was found that GAD patients demonstrated increased FC between hippocampus/parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus among the most significantly changed FC, while PD was mainly associated with greater FC between somatosensory cortex and thalamus. Besides such regional specificity, it was observed that psychopathological specificity in that the disrupted FC pattern in PD and GAD correlated with their respective symptom severity. The findings suggested that the increased FC between hippocampus/parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus in GAD were mainly associated with a fear generalization related neural circuit, while the greater FC between somatosensory cortex and thalamus in PD were more likely linked to interoceptive processing. Due to the observed regional and psychopathological specificity, their findings bear important clinical implications for the potential treatment strategy.

d64c6a5832c4dd527b12440ff32cc49592c2845d,"Abstract Anxiety, stress, and trauma-related disorders are a major public health concern in the United States. Drugs that target the γ-aminobutyric acid or serotonergic system, such as benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, respectively, are the most widely prescribed treatments for these disorders. However, the role of glutamate in anxiety disorders is becoming more recognized with the belief that drugs that modulate glutamatergic function through either ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors have the potential to improve the current treatment of these severe and disabling illnesses. Animal models of fear and anxiety have provided a method to study the role of glutamate in anxiety. This research has demonstrated that drugs that alter glutamate transmission have potential anxiolytic action for many different paradigms including fear-potentiated startle, punished responding, and the elevated plus maze. Human clinical drug trials have demonstrated the efficacy of glutamatergic drugs for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. Recent data from magnetic resonance imaging studies provide an additional link between the glutamate system and anxiety. Collectively, the data suggest that future studies on the mechanism of and clinical efficacy of glutamatergic agents in anxiety disorders are appropriately warranted.","[{'authorId': '2230156981', 'name': 'Bernadette'}, {'authorId': None, 'name': 'M.'}, {'authorId': '120169977', 'name': 'Cortese'}, {'authorId': None, 'name': 'K.'}, {'authorId': '2055399808', 'name': 'L.

Because any change in human's life, either pleasant or unpleasant, requires some level of adjustment, lack of mental health causes failure to adjust to new conditions (2). Mental health refers to the ability to have harmonious and coordinated relationship with self and others, recognize and accept realities and be able to adjust to them, and resolve personal conflicts and tendencies in a reasonable and appropriate manner (3). Because pregnant women's mental conditions are influenced by several factors including their feelings about feminine identity, husband's family, agreements and contradictions, sexual intercourse, marital life, and choosing to have or not to have child, failure to cope with these issues can lead to serious traumas to them (1). Unhealthy mental conditions during pregnancy can be associated with adverse effects such as premature birth and declined infant growth indices; therefore, it is essential to take into account mental health, alongside physical healthcare services, during pregnancy, and identify women with predisposition to mental disorders and deliver necessary healthcare services to them to prevent many associated problems (4-6). Studies on pregnant women in different cultural and socioeconomic conditions indicated that high levels of stress and lack of adjustment to conditions during pregnancy might lead to spontaneous abortion and neonatal abnormalities (2,7).

The time‐course of these distant influences is unknown, although this information is important for resolving debates over likely pathways mediating an apparent rapidity in emotional processing. To address this, we recorded event‐related potentials (ERPs) to seen fearful face expressions, in preoperative patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy who had varying degrees of amygdala pathology, plus healthy volunteers. We found that amygdala damage diminished ERPs for fearful versus neutral faces within the P1 time‐range, ∼100–150 ms, and for a later component at ∼500–600 ms. Individual severity of amygdala damage determined the magnitude of both these effects, consistent with a causal amygdala role. By contrast, amygdala damage did not affect explicit perception of fearful expressions nor a distinct emotional ERP effect at 150–250 ms. These results demonstrate two distinct time‐points at which the amygdala influences fear processing. The data also demonstrate that while not all aspects of expression processing are disrupted by amygdala damage, there is a crucial impact on an early P1 component. These findings are consistent with the existence of multiple processing stages or routes for fearful faces that vary in their dependence on amygdala function.

De aquí la importancia de la interpretación que realizan las personas al éxito o fracaso de la tarea, en función de sus expectativas previas (Weiner, 1985). Por otra parte, los aspectos motivacionales son apoyados o socavados, ya sea por la satisfacción o insatisfacción, respectivamente, de las necesidades psicológicas básicas, que hacen que las personas actúen de determinada forma (Domenech Betoret y Gómez Artiga, 2011). A su vez, algunos autores han verificado la existencia de relación entre el tipo de motivación y el enfoque de aprendizaje que utilizan los estudiantes (Biggs, 1989; Entwistle, 1987). El presente trabajo pretende explorar los tres constructos mencionados en estudiantes universitarios, con el objetivo de explorar sus enfoques de aprendizaje, necesidades psicológicas básicas y atribuciones motivacionales al logro. BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS, LEARNING APPROACHES AND ALLOCATION OF ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. EXPLORATORY STUDY Abstract Several investigations in recent years indicate the importance of considering both the cognitive and motivational aspects involved in learning, emphasizing the interplay between affect and cognition (Rinaudo, Chiecher and Donolo, 2003). Hence, the importance of the interpretation made by individuals to the success or failure of the task, based on their prior expectations (Weiner, 1985). Moreover, the motivational aspects are supported or undermined by either satisfaction or dissatisfaction, respectively, of the basic psychological needs, to make people act in a certain way (Domenech and Gomez Betoret Artiga, 2011). In turn, some authors have verified the existence of a relationship between the type of motivation and learning approach used by students (Biggs, 1989; Entwistle, 1987). This paper aims to explore the three constructs mentioned in university students, in order to explore their approaches to learning, basic psychological needs and motivational attributions to achievement.   ","[{'authorId': '26353070', 'name': 'C.

By using logistic regression, burnout associated variables were: Higher score in perceived stress scale (OR: 1.20; CI 95 %: 1.12-1.28), lower score in satisfaction scale (OR: 8.42; CI 95 %: 1.96-36.10), having more patients in their quota (OR: 1.01; CI 95 %:1.00-1.02) and no resident supervision (OR: 2.88; CI 95 %: 1.06-8.25). Conclusion: Burnout affects one in five primary care providers in our Autonomous Community, being depersonalization the most altered subscale. Professionals with burnout present higher perceived stress and lower job satisfaction. Other job-related variables are also associated with the presence of burnout.","[{'authorId': '50416859', 'name': 'I.

d7e6d3e7abba88c74e5658689b25880dd09bacbf,"Two theories suggest contrasting predictions regarding maternal responses to adolescent depressive behavior. Social cognitive theory implies that adolescent depressive behaviors are positively reinforced by parents who respond with increased warmth and support (Bandura, 1986). Social interaction theory implies that depressive behaviors elicit negative affect in others (e.g., parents), resulting in diminished support or increased rejection (Coyne, 1976a). Sequence analysis of 72 mother-adolescent interactions suggested that mothers of relatively depressed adolescents generally provided lower rates of positive parenting than did mothers of nondepressed adolescents. Additionally, mothers of relatively depressed adolescents were less likely to respond to adolescents’ depressive affect and behavior with supportive parenting than were mothers of nondepressed adolescents. These findings are consistent with social interaction theory. Both theories suggest similar predictions regarding adolescents’ responses to maternal criticism. Consistent with both theories, we found that relatively depressed adolescents responded with depressive behavior following maternal criticism.","[{'authorId': '3898238', 'name': 'Ashley Q.

In this work, we introduce and study an RNN-based variational autoencoder generative model that incorporates distributed latent representations of entire sentences. This factorization allows it to explicitly model holistic properties of sentences such as style, topic, and high-level syntactic features. Samples from the prior over these sentence representations remarkably produce diverse and well-formed sentences through simple deterministic decoding. By examining paths through this latent space, we are able to generate coherent novel sentences that interpolate between known sentences. We present techniques for solving the difficult learning problem presented by this model, demonstrate its effectiveness in imputing missing words, explore many interesting properties of the model's latent sentence space, and present negative results on the use of the model in language modeling.","[{'authorId': '3644767', 'name': 'Samuel R.

Separate multivariate analyses of variance indicated that the RFLdifferentiated suicidal from nonsuicidal individuals in both samples.

Based on those recurring themes, the conclusion is that effective teachers share at least twelve clear characteristics. Those characteristics consistently affected students in positive ways. This article results from a longitudinal, qualitative, quasi-research study of students in education, including in-service as well as pre-service teachers. An out-of-class essay assignment asked this question: What were the qualities of the most memorable teacher who encouraged you to teach? Participants and Courses Involved in the Study This study utilized both traditional and nontraditional students the author taught in the past fifteen years. The undergraduate students (pre-service teachers) in the study were working toward bachelor’s degrees in teaching and not actually teaching when they wrote their essays. Most of the graduate students were in-service education professionals who had returned to school for advanced degrees. “Traditional” students were defined as on-campus students with tuition support from parents or student loans. “Nontraditional” students were defined as those living off campus and working or raising a family. 61 The students were enrolled in various courses, some held during the day, others at night. The courses included Methods of Teaching Science; Methods of Teaching Math; Methods of Teaching Social Studies; Curriculum Development; Child Development; Introduction to Special Education; Problems in the Elementary School; Educational Technology; and Teaching in the Urban Setting. More than one thousand students matriculated through these undergraduate and graduate classes, held in the United States, Canada, Bermuda, and the Caribbean. Several students from Africa participated. The courses were taught at both predominately white and historically black institutions, including two private colleges; three public universities; a junior college; and a technical college. The multiplicity of institutions and courses over the years provided the study with a diverse student population: young and old, black and white, Hispanic, those of Asian nationality, males, and females. The students were mainly early childhood majors, training to teach nursery to grade three (N–3); elementary education majors, training to teach kindergarten to sixth grade (K–6); and secondary education majors, training to teach seventh to twelfth grades (7–12) in specific subject areas such as physical education, mathematics, science, history, and music.

To identify the mechanisms involved in the association between self-compassion and depression, we examined whether adaptive emotion regulation would mediate the relationship between self-compassion and depression in individuals with unipolar depression. Furthermore, we explored which specific emotion regulation skills would be most important in this relationship.


DESIGN AND METHOD
Sixty-nine individuals with unipolar depression were assessed with the Self-Compassion Scale and the Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire at baseline and with the Beck Depression Inventory-II 1 week later.


RESULTS
The results showed that successful application of emotion regulation skills mediates the association between self-compassion and depression. Among eight specific emotion regulation skills, only the ability to tolerate negative emotions was identified as a significant mediator in the self-compassion-depression relationship.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings provide preliminary evidence that systematically fostering self-compassion might help depressed individuals cope with their symptoms by enhancing their abilities to tolerate undesired emotions.


PRACTITIONER POINTS
Systematically fostering self-compassion through specific compassion-focused interventions might facilitate a reduction in depressive symptoms by improving the person's emotion regulation abilities, especially by improving his or her ability to tolerate negative emotions. Hence, compassion-focused interventions might be particularly promising in depressed patients with a tendency to avoid negative emotions and deficits in tolerating them.","[{'authorId': '40069111', 'name': 'Alice Diedrich'}, {'authorId': '48198809', 'name': 'J.

 We consider incorporating topic information into a sequence-to-sequence framework to generate informative and interesting responses for chatbots. To this end, we propose a topic aware sequence-to-sequence (TA-Seq2Seq) model. The model utilizes topics to simulate prior human knowledge that guides them to form informative and interesting responses in conversation, and leverages topic information in generation by a joint attention mechanism and a biased generation probability. The joint attention mechanism summarizes the hidden vectors of an input message as context vectors by message attention and synthesizes topic vectors by topic attention from the topic words of the message obtained from a pre-trained LDA model, with these vectors jointly affecting the generation of words in decoding. To increase the possibility of topic words appearing in responses, the model modifies the generation probability of topic words by adding an extra probability item to bias the overall distribution. Empirical studies on both automatic evaluation metrics and human annotations show that TA-Seq2Seq can generate more informative and interesting responses, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art response generation models.

However, psychometric testing of this scale has not been conducted. In two studies, we examine its psychometric properties. In the first study, 101 parents (mostly mothers) completed the CCNES and a variety of other scales. The results reveal that the CCNES is internally reliable and has sound test-retest reliability and construct validity. Factor analysis of the structure of the CCNES suggests that there may be only four rather than six subscales. In the second study, we examined the predictive validity of the CCNES to 36 children's emotional competence (decoding and expressiveness).

Method The World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys were used to examine the associations of mental disorders with college entry and attrition by comparing college students (n = 1572) and non-students in the same age range (18–22 years; n = 4178), including non-students who recently left college without graduating (n = 702) based on surveys in 21 countries (four low/lower-middle income, five upper-middle-income, one lower-middle or upper-middle at the times of two different surveys, and 11 high income). Lifetime and 12-month prevalence and age-of-onset of DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behavioral and substance disorders were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results One-fifth (20.3%) of college students had 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorders; 83.1% of these cases had pre-matriculation onsets. Disorders with pre-matriculation onsets were more important than those with post-matriculation onsets in predicting subsequent college attrition, with substance disorders and, among women, major depression the most important such disorders. Only 16.4% of students with 12-month disorders received any 12-month healthcare treatment for their mental disorders. Conclusions Mental disorders are common among college students, have onsets that mostly occur prior to college entry, in the case of pre-matriculation disorders are associated with college attrition, and are typically untreated. Detection and effective treatment of these disorders early in the college career might reduce attrition and improve educational and psychosocial functioning.","[{'authorId': '34821537', 'name': 'R.

d9e529ca5823ab31c35d7d3f60f15857db597a9c,"Individuals differ in the degree to which they tend to habitually accept their emotions and thoughts without judging them—a process here referred to as habitual acceptance. Acceptance has been linked with greater psychological health, which we propose may be due to the role acceptance plays in negative emotional responses to stressors: acceptance helps keep individuals from reacting to—and thus exacerbating—their negative mental experiences. Over time, experiencing lower negative emotion should promote psychological health. To test these hypotheses, Study 1 (N = 1,003) verified that habitually accepting mental experiences broadly predicted psychological health (psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and depressive and anxiety symptoms), even when controlling for potentially related constructs (reappraisal, rumination, and other mindfulness facets including observing, describing, acting with awareness, and nonreactivity). Next, in a laboratory study (Study 2, N = 156), habitual acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotional responses to a standardized stressor. Finally, in a longitudinal design (Study 3, N = 222), acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotion experienced during daily stressors that, in turn, accounted for the link between acceptance and psychological health 6 months later. This link between acceptance and psychological health was unique to accepting mental experiences and was not observed for accepting situations. Additionally, we ruled out potential confounding effects of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and life stress severity. Overall, these results suggest that individuals who accept rather than judge their mental experiences may attain better psychological health, in part because acceptance helps them experience less negative emotion in response to stressors.","[{'authorId': '5743779', 'name': 'B.

However, several studies report inconsistent findings that raise critical questions about the effect's reliability, robustness, and potential moderators. To address these questions, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis of 100 empirical studies of the positivity effect (N = 7,129). Results indicate that the positivity effect is reliable and moderated by theoretically implicated methodological and sample characteristics. The positivity effect is larger in studies that do not constrain (vs. constrain) cognitive processing-reflecting older adults' natural information processing preferences-and in studies incorporating wider (vs. narrower) age comparisons. Analyses indicated that older adults show a significant information processing bias toward positive versus negative information, whereas younger adults show the opposite pattern. We discuss implications of these findings for theoretical perspectives on emotion-cognition interactions across the adult life span and suggest future research directions.","[{'authorId': '2503149', 'name': 'Andrew E.

da0f0faecdf6064b327f48a91ab948cab5cf6a08,"OBJECTIVE
To construct growth curves for school-aged children and adolescents that accord with the WHO Child Growth Standards for preschool children and the body mass index (BMI) cut-offs for adults.


METHODS
Data from the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO growth reference (1-24 years) were merged with data from the under-fives growth standards' cross-sectional sample (18-71 months) to smooth the transition between the two samples. State-of-the-art statistical methods used to construct the WHO Child Growth Standards (0-5 years), i.e. the Box-Cox power exponential (BCPE) method with appropriate diagnostic tools for the selection of best models, were applied to this combined sample.


FINDINGS
The merged data sets resulted in a smooth transition at 5 years for height-for-age, weight-for-age and BMI-for-age. For BMI-for-age across all centiles the magnitude of the difference between the two curves at age 5 years is mostly 0.0 kg/m(2) to 0.1 kg/m(2). At 19 years, the new BMI values at +1 standard deviation (SD) are 25.4 kg/m(2) for boys and 25.0 kg/m(2) for girls. These values are equivalent to the overweight cut-off for adults (> or = 25.0 kg/m(2)). Similarly, the +2 SD value (29.7 kg/m(2) for both sexes) compares closely with the cut-off for obesity (> or = 30.0 kg/m(2)).


CONCLUSION
The new curves are closely aligned with the WHO Child Growth Standards at 5 years, and the recommended adult cut-offs for overweight and obesity at 19 years. They fill the gap in growth curves and provide an appropriate reference for the 5 to 19 years age group.","[{'authorId': '113506849', 'name': 'M. de Onís'}, {'authorId': '5889447', 'name': 'A.

This high metabolic rate and this behavior suggest the existence of an organized mode of default brain function, elements of which may be either attenuated or enhanced. Extant data suggest that these MPFC regions may contribute to the neural instantiation of aspects of the multifaceted “self.” We explore this important concept by targeting and manipulating elements of MPFC default state activity. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, subjects made two judgments, one self-referential, the other not, in response to affectively normed pictures: pleasant vs. unpleasant (an internally cued condition, ICC) and indoors vs. outdoors (an externally cued condition, ECC). The ICC was preferentially associated with activity increases along the dorsal MPFC. These increases were accompanied by decreases in both active task conditions in ventral MPFC. These results support the view that dorsal and ventral MPFC are differentially influenced by attentiondemanding tasks and explicitly self-referential tasks. The presence of self-referential mental activity appears to be associated with increases from the baseline in dorsal MPFC. Reductions in ventral MPFC occurred consistent with the fact that attention-demanding tasks attenuate emotional processing. We posit that both self-referential mental activity and emotional processing represent elements of the default state as represented by activity in MPFC. We suggest that a useful way to explore the neurobiology of the self is to explore the nature of default state activity.","[{'authorId': '3711846', 'name': 'D.

Despite the considerable physical, emotional and social change that occurs during emerging adulthood, there is little research that examines the association between having a chronic health condition and mental disorder during this developmental period. The aims of this study were to examine the sex-specific prevalence of lifetime mental disorder in an epidemiological sample of emerging adults aged 15–30 years with and without chronic health conditions; quantify the association between chronic health conditions and mental disorder, adjusting for sociodemographic and health factors; and, examine potential moderating and mediating effects of sex, level of disability and pain. Method. Data come from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health. Respondents were 15–30 years of age (n = 5947) and self-reported whether they had a chronic health condition. Chronic health conditions were classified as: respiratory, musculoskeletal/connective tissue, cardiovascular, neurological and endocrine/digestive. The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 was used to assess the presence of mental disorder (major depressive disorder, suicidal behaviour, bipolar disorder and generalised anxiety disorder). Results. Lifetime prevalence of mental disorder was significantly higher for individuals with chronic health conditions compared with healthy controls. Substantial heterogeneity in the prevalence of mental disorder was found in males, but not in females. Logistic regression models adjusting for several sociodemographic and health factors showed that the individuals with chronic health conditions were at elevated risk for mental disorder. There was no evidence that the level of disability or pain moderated the associations between chronic health conditions and mental disorder. Sex was found to moderate the association between musculoskeletal/connective tissue conditions and bipolar disorder (β = 1.71, p = 0.002). Exploratory analyses suggest that the levels of disability and pain mediate the association between chronic health conditions and mental disorder. Conclusions. Physical and mental comorbidity is prevalent among emerging adults and this relationship is not augmented, but may be mediated, by the level of disability or pain. Findings point to the integration and coordination of public sectors – health, education and social services – to facilitate the prevention and reduction of mental disorder among emerging adults with chronic health conditions.","[{'authorId': '34884557', 'name': 'M.

Differing from the cross-sectional focus of most JD-R model reviews, this meta-analytic review uses longitudinal evidence to validate the essential assumptions within the JD-R model. We highlight two aspects: (1) The assessment of the methodological quality of the available longitudinal studies, and (2) the examination of the essential assumptions – the impact of job characteristics on well-being, and vice-versa – with meta-analytic structural equation modelling (metaSEM). We included 74 studies and evaluated their quality. Eighteen studies suffered from serious methodological shortcomings, whereas 29 studies (39%) were considered high-quality studies. Our meta-analytic structural equation models confirmed the essential assumptions simultaneously. The quality of the studies also had an influence on the goodness-of-fit indices. The models with reciprocal assumptions between job characteristics and well-being fitted the data best. The findings of this meta-analytic review suggest that the JD-R model is an excellent theoretical basis to assess employee well-being for a broad range of organisations. However, more research is needed to clarify the reciprocal relationships between job characteristics and employee well-being, as well as the different influences of challenging and hindering job demands on work engagement.","[{'authorId': '113225222', 'name': 'T.

However, the literature has mostly focused on the functionality design and utilitarian value of such decision support systems, mostly ignoring the potential social influence they could exert on their users. The objective of this study is to apply a social relationship perspective to the design of interfaces for PRAs. We investigate the effects of applying anthropomorphic interfaces—namely, humanoid embodiment and voice output—on users' perceived social relationship with a technological and software-based artifact designed for electronic commerce contexts. The findings from a laboratory experiment indicate that using humanoid embodiment and human voice-based communication significantly influences users' perceptions of social presence, which in turn enhances users' trusting beliefs, perceptions of enjoyment, and ultimately, their intentions to use the agent as a decision aid. These results extend the applicability of theories concerning traditional shopper-salesperson relationships to customers' interactions with technological artifacts residing on Web sites—that is, the recommendation agent software—and provide practitioners with guidelines on how to design Internet stores with the goal of building social relationships with online shoppers and enhancing their overall shopping experiences.","[{'authorId': '1714338', 'name': 'Lingyun Qiu'}, {'authorId': '1732947', 'name': 'I.

Exercise is considered an acceptable method for improving and maintaining physical and emotional health. A growing body of evidence supports the belief that yoga benefits physical and mental health via down-regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The purpose of this article is to provide a scholarly review of the literature regarding research studies comparing the effects of yoga and exercise on a variety of health outcomes and health conditions.


METHODS
Using PubMed((R)) and the key word ""yoga,"" a comprehensive search of the research literature from core scientific and nursing journals yielded 81 studies that met inclusion criteria. These studies subsequently were classified as uncontrolled (n = 30), wait list controlled (n = 16), or comparison (n = 35). The most common comparison intervention (n = 10) involved exercise. These studies were included in this review.


RESULTS
In the studies reviewed, yoga interventions appeared to be equal or superior to exercise in nearly every outcome measured except those involving physical fitness.


CONCLUSIONS
The studies comparing the effects of yoga and exercise seem to indicate that, in both healthy and diseased populations, yoga may be as effective as or better than exercise at improving a variety of health-related outcome measures. Future clinical trials are needed to examine the distinctions between exercise and yoga, particularly how the two modalities may differ in their effects on the SNS/HPA axis. Additional studies using rigorous methodologies are needed to examine the health benefits of the various types of yoga.","[{'authorId': '38912688', 'name': 'A.

To address this issue we enrolled 58 participants in an fMRI study in which participants were instructed to reappraise both negative and neutral stimuli. This design allowed us to separately study activations reflecting cognitive processes associated with reappraisal in general and activations specifically related to reappraisal of negative emotion. Our results confirmed that both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contribute to emotion regulation through reappraisal. However, activity in the DLPFC was related to reappraisal independently of whether negative or neutral stimuli were reappraised, whereas the lateral OFC was uniquely related to reappraisal of negative stimuli. We suggest that relative to the lateral OFC, the DLPFC serves a more general role in emotion regulation, perhaps by reflecting the cognitive demand that is inherent to the regulation task.","[{'authorId': '2635434', 'name': 'A.

We propose that this immunity emerges from the accrued experiences of coping with disturbances and problems in stressful teaching environments, and that it functions as an indispensable protective armor allowing language teachers to survive the unavoidable hassles of classroom practice. We draw parallels with biological immunity and established constructs in psychology, while describing the development of this emergent immunity through the framework of self-organization from complexity theory. We further argue that, similar to biological immunity, teacher immunity can have potential negative consequences if it develops into a maladaptive form that is associated with a rigid and conservative practice as well as a general resistance to methodological change or innovation. Therefore, the article concludes by outlining how counterproductive teacher immunity can be “rebooted” through a three-step sequence that involves triggering the process through awareness raising, familiarizing teachers with productive coping strategies, and encouraging the formation of appropriate narratives that stabilize the transformation.","[{'authorId': '66322279', 'name': 'Phil Hiver'}, {'authorId': '8142683', 'name': 'Z.

When designed as supportive and ""safe"" interaction partners, VHs may improve such screenings by encouraging patients to disclose more personal information [2-3]. In medical contexts, patients often feel resistance to self-disclosure and engage in impression management to be viewed more positively by healthcare providers. This paper provides the first empirical evidence that VHs can reduce such resistance and impression management. In the context of health-screening interviews, we report a study in which participants interacted with a VH that was either teleo-operated by humans (Wizard-of-Oz) or fully-automated (AI). Independently, we manipulated whether participants believed the VH was controlled by humans or automation. As predicted, participants who believed they were interacting with a computer reported lower resistance to self-disclosure, lower impression management and higher system usability than those who believed they were interacting with a human operator. Whether the virtual human was actually operated by a human or AI only affected ratings of the system's usability. These results suggest that automated VHs can help overcome a significant barrier to obtaining truthful patient information in medical domains.","[{'authorId': '145438097', 'name': 'J.

Nearly all of these non-tenure-track (NTT) appointments share a quality that may produce stress for those who hold them: contingency. Most NTT appointments are contingent on budget, enrollment, or both, and the majority of contingent faculty members are hired for one quarter or semester at a time. Significant research has investigated the effects of contingency on teaching, students, departments, colleges, and universities; however, little research has focused on the psychological experiences of NTT faculty. The current study examined perceptions of workplace stressors and harm, organizational commitment, common coping mechanisms, and depression, anxiety and stress among NTT faculty using a longitudinal design that spanned 2–4 months. Results indicate that NTT faculty perceive unique stressors at work that are related to their contingent positions. Specific demographic characteristics and coping strategies, inability to find a permanent faculty position, and commitment to one's organization predispose NTT faculty to perceive greater harm and more sources of stress in their workplaces. Demographic characteristics, lower income, inability to find a permanent faculty position, disengagement coping mechanisms (e.g., giving up, denial), and organizational commitment were associated with the potential for negative outcomes, particularly depression, anxiety, and stress. Our findings suggest possibilities for institutional intervention.

A new neuropsychological theory is proposed that accounts for many of these effects by assuming that positive affect is associated with increased brain dopamine levels. The theory predicts or accounts for influences of positive affect on olfaction, the consolidation of long-term (i.e., episodic) memories, working memory, and creative problem solving. For example, the theory assumes that creative problem solving is improved, in part, because increased dopamine release in the anterior cingulate improves cognitive flexibility and facilitates the selection of cognitive perspective.","[{'authorId': '144891762', 'name': 'F.

The vulnerability model hypothesizes that low self-esteem serves as a risk factor for depression, whereas the scar model hypothesizes that low self-esteem is an outcome, not a cause, of depression. To test these models, the authors used 2 large longitudinal data sets, each with 4 repeated assessments between the ages of 15 and 21 years and 18 and 21 years, respectively. Cross-lagged regression analyses indicated that low self-esteem predicted subsequent levels of depression, but depression did not predict subsequent levels of self-esteem. These findings held for both men and women and after controlling for content overlap between the self-esteem and depression scales. Thus, the results supported the vulnerability model, but not the scar model, of self-esteem and depression.","[{'authorId': '46288300', 'name': 'U. Orth'}, {'authorId': '4601827', 'name': 'R.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.","[{'authorId': '1775321', 'name': 'J.

Despite a wealth of empirical research demonstrating the benefits of interventions aimed at increasing middle and high school students' well-being, few educational institutions have adopted evidence-based curricula that address this construct as a means of promoting future academic and social achievement. In addition, numerous studies have begun to identify several factors that contribute to well-being and thus have helped children and adolescents to be successful in both academic and social domains. These critical factors include personal goal setting, structured mentoring or life coaching, increasing gratitude, problem solving, and interpersonal skills. The present article provides a broad discussion of relevant research findings on these factors and advocates for the adoption of curricula that incorporate these components in order to ensure that best practices are utilized in the school environment and for positive youth development.

dced02a223313e5b43c78cabee280b3ce6ccb381,"ABSTRACT Although there is a large decrement in central episodic memory processes as adults age, there is no appreciable decrement in central semantic memory processes (Allen et al., Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, 57B, P173–P186, 2002; Allen et al., Experimental Aging Research, 28, 111–142, 2002; Mitchell, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 15, 31–49, 1989). The authors develop a theory of episodic memory's connections to cognitive, emotional, and motivational systems to explain these differential age effects. The theory is discussed within the context of the cognitive neuroscience research regarding limbic system connectivity in conjunction with Damasio's notion of somatic markers (Descartes’ error: Emotion, reason, and the human brain, New York: Grosset/Putnam, 1994). The central hypothesis is that elements of limbic system circuitry, including portions of the medial temporal lobes and frontal cortex, are associated with both working and long-term episodic memory performance, and by extension, with the capacity to engage in emotion-guided, self-regulatory processes that depend heavily on episodic memory. In contrast, the semantic memory system may have less shared interface with episodic and affective networks (i.e., the limbic-related system), and therefore remain independent of neurocognitive changes impacting emotional states and episodic-type memory processes. Accordingly, this framework may account for the pattern of age-related declines in episodic relative to semantic memory, particularly if older adults experience less emotional activation, and therefore fewer somatic markers, than younger adults. An initial empirical examination of this emotional mediation theory is presented, using preexisting data that include indicators of age, chronic tendency to focus on negative emotional stimuli (neuroticism), and working memory performance.","[{'authorId': '32744634', 'name': 'P.

Difficulties in emotion regulation have been proposed to be at the core of these cardinal symptoms of MDD. It remains unclear, however, what underlies emotion regulation difficulties. Cognitive theories of depression have focused on cognitive processes and recent studies suggest that cognitive biases and deficits in cognitive control may help explain affective symptoms of this disorder. Specifically, it is proposed that cognitive biases and deficits affect emotion regulation ability thereby setting the stage for maintained negative affect and diminished levels of positive affect.

Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants’ comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. Conclusions Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT.","[{'authorId': '2194363', 'name': 'K.

Most students with poor mental health, however, do not receive professional help. Internet-based self-help formats may increase the utilization of treatment. Objective The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based, app-supported stress management intervention for college students. Methods College students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4-item version, PSS-4 ≥8) were randomly assigned to either an internet- and mobile-based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group. Self-report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS-4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college-related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies’ Depression Scale >17). Results A total of 106 participants (76.8%) indicated that they were first-time help-seekers, and 77.3% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95% CI 0.36-1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95% CI 0.43-1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95% CI 0.30-0.96), college-related productivity (d=0.33; 95% CI 0.01-0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95% CI 0.01-0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment). Response rates for stress symptoms were significantly higher for the intervention group (69%, 52/75) compared with the waitlist control group (35%, 26/75, P<.001; number needed to treat=2.89, 95% CI 2.01-5.08) at posttest (7 weeks). Effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up, and similar findings emerged in students with symptoms of depression. Conclusions Internet- and mobile-based interventions could be an effective and cost-effective approach to reduce consequences of college-related stress and might potentially attract students with clinically relevant depression who would not otherwise seek help.

Previous research on the database, relying on an average measure of FLE and FLCA (Dewaele & MacIntyre, 2014) revealed significant gender differences. The present study looks at gender differences in FLE and FLCA at item level. Independent t-tests revealed that female participants reported having significantly more fun in the FL class, where they felt that they were learning interesting things, and they were prouder than male peers of their FL performance. However, female participants also experienced significantly more (mild) FLCA: they worried significantly more than male peers about their mistakes and were less confident in using the FL. Our female participants thus reported experiencing both more positive and more mild negative emotions in the FL classroom.

de04ee850f2a4255d497f6cf0de986efeb1bffb7,"Obesity represents one of the most serious global health issues with approximately 310 million people presently affected. It develops because of a mismatch between energy intake and expenditure that results from behavior (feeding behavior and time spent active) and physiology (resting metabolism and expenditure when active). Both of these traits are affected by environmental and genetic factors. The dramatic increase in the numbers of obese people in Western societies reflects mostly changing environmental factors and is linked to reduced activity and perhaps also increased food intake. However, in all societies and subpopulations, there are both obese and nonobese subjects. These differences are primarily a consequence of genetic factors as is revealed by the high heritability for body mass index. Most researchers agree that energy balance and, hence, body weight are regulated phenomena. There is some disagreement about exactly how this regulation occurs. However, a common model is the ""lipostatic"" regulation system, whereby our energy stores generate signals that are compared with targets encoded in the brain, and differences between these drive our food intake levels, activity patterns, and resting and active metabolisms. Considerable advances were made in the last decade in understanding the molecular basis of this lipostatic system. Some obese people have high body weight because they have broken lipostats, but these are a rare minority. This suggests that for the majority of obese people, the lipostat is set at an inappropriately high level. When combined with exposure to an environment where there is ready availability of food at low energy costs to obtain it, obesity develops. The evolutionary background to how such a system might have evolved involves the evolution of social behavior, the harnessing of fire, and the development of weapons that effectively freed humans from the risks of predation. The lipostatic model not only explains why some people become obese whereas others do not, but also allows us to understand why energy-controlled diets do not work. Drug-based solutions to the obesity problem that work with the lipostat, rather than against it, are presently under development and will probably be in regular use within 5-10 y. However, several lines of evidence including genetic mapping studies of quantitative trait loci associated with obesity suggest that our present understanding of the regulatory system is still rudimentary. In particular, we know nothing about how the target body weight in the brain is encoded. As our understanding in this field advances, new drug targets are likely to emerge and allow us to treat this crippling disorder.","[{'authorId': '3229359', 'name': 'J.

Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative and quantitative studies on work engagement are reviewed to uncover the manifestation of engagement, and reveal its antecedents and consequences. Findings - Work engagement can be defined as a state including vigor, dedication, and absorption. Job and personal resources are the main predictors of engagement; these resources gain their salience in the context of high job demands. Engaged workers are more creative, more productive, and more willing to go the extra mile. Originality/value - The findings of previous studies are integrated in an overall model that can be used to develop work engagement and advance career development in today's workplace.","[{'authorId': '1776932', 'name': 'A.

With newspapers going online and television becoming increasingly digital, the current generation of youth has little reason to consume analog media. Music, movies, and all other forms of mass-mediated content can be obtained via a wide array of digital devices, ranging from CDs to DVDs, from iPods to PDAs. Even their nonmedia experiences are often characterized by a reliance on digital devices. Most young people communicate with most of their acquaintances through cell phones and computer-mediated communication tools such as instant messengers and e-mail systems. 1 And, with the arrival of personal broadcasting technologies such as blogs and social networking sites, many youngsters experience the world through their own self-expression and the expressions of their peers. This serves to blur the traditional boundary between interpersonal and mass communication, leading to an idiosyncratic construction of one's media world. Customization in the digital age—be it in the form of Web sites such as cus-tomizable portals that allow users to shape content or devices such as iPods that allow for customized playlists—enables the user to serve as the gatekeeper of content. As media get highly interactive, multimodal, and navigable, the receiver tends to become the source of communication. 2 While this leads naturally to egocentric construals of one's information environment, it also raises questions about the veracity of all the material that is consumed. The ease of digital publishing has made authors out of us all, leading to a dramatic profusion of information available for personal as well as public consumption. Much of this information, however, is free-floating and does not follow any universally accepted gatekeeping standards, let alone a professional process of writing and editing. Therefore, the veridicality of information accessed on the Web and other digital media is often suspect. 3 This makes credibility a supremely key concern in the new media environment, necessitating the constant need to critically assess information while consuming it. Credibility is classically ascertained by considering the source of information. If the attributed source of a piece of information is a credible person or organization, then, according to conventional wisdom, that information is probably reliable. However, in Internet-based media, source is a murky entity because there are often multiple layers of sources in online transmission of information (e.g., e-mail from a friend giving you a piece of information that he or she found on a newsgroup, posted …","[{'authorId': '47493614', 'name': 'S.

To address this question, I draw on research on the interpersonal effects of emotions on behavior in personal relationships, parent–child interactions, conflict, negotiation, and leadership, and propose a new framework that can account for existing findings and guide future research: the emotions as social information (EASI) model. I demonstrate that emotional expressions affect observers' behavior by triggering inferential processes and/or affective reactions in them. The predictive strength of these two processes—which may inspire different behaviors—depends on the observer's information processing and on social-relational factors. Examples of moderators that determine the relative predictive strength of inferences and affective reactions include power, need for cognitive closure, time pressure, display rules, and the appropriateness and target of the emotional expression, which are all discussed.","[{'authorId': '5980688', 'name': 'Gerben A. van Kleef'}]",995.0,,25.0,How Emotions Regulate Social Life,2009.0

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic syndrome characterised by widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with other symptoms, including psychological distress. While negative mood (anxiety, depression, and anger) has been widely explored in FM, few studies have investigated emotional dysregulation. Our purpose was to evaluate problems in the processes of emotional regulation and to explore their influence on the severity of pain and disability.


METHODS
Emotional regulations, anxiety, depression, anger, pain and disability were evaluated in 47 FM patients and 47 healthy subjects. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the role that emotional regulation processes have on pain severity and disability of FM patients.


RESULTS
Results showed that although FM patients do not differ in terms of the attention paid to their emotional states, FM patients had greater difficulties in the emotional regulation process. In addition, emotional rejection and interference are two variables that influence the pain severity and disability.


CONCLUSIONS
FM patients need to be trained in strategies for regulating their emotions, in order to achieve a reduction in negative mood states, as well as their impact in pain and disability.","[{'authorId': '80990545', 'name': 'Almudena Trucharte'}, {'authorId': '144770521', 'name': 'L.

We hypothesized that behavioral problems would be associated with cognitive impairment and environmental factors and that differences between the 2 groups would be reduced but persist after adjusting for cognitive performance and environmental factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS. The Etude Epidémiologique sur les Petits Ages Gestationnels (EPIPAGE) study was a prospective population-based cohort study that included all births occurring between 22 and 32 weeks' gestation and a control group of infants born at 39 to 40 weeks' gestation in 1997 in 9 French regions. Neonatal and obstetrics data were collected at birth. At 5 years of age, sociodemographic status and neurodevelopmental and cognitive development of the children, as well as maternal mental well-being, were assessed. The behavioral problems of 1102 very preterm and 375 term singletons without major impairments were studied by using the parent-completed Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. RESULTS. Parents of very preterm children reported significantly more behavioral problems, with a twofold higher prevalence compared with term children for hyperactivity/inattention, emotional symptoms, and peer problems. Behavioral problems were associated with low cognitive performance, developmental delay, hospitalizations of the child, young maternal age, and poor maternal mental well-being. Very preterm children were still at higher risk of behavioral problems compared with term children after adjustment for cognitive performance and all others factors. CONCLUSIONS. Behavioral problems were strongly related to cognitive impairment, but very preterm children were still at higher risk even after adjusting for cognitive performance. Early screening for behavioral problems should be encouraged for all very preterm children, and maternal well-being should also be the focus of special attention.","[{'authorId': '1403408355', 'name': 'Malika Delobel-Ayoub'}, {'authorId': '48043874', 'name': 'C.

The epidemic of obesity is not just isolated to the US, but is worldwide,3,,4 including less affluent countries.4

Obesity and overweight have many causes, including genetic, metabolic, behavioural and environmental. The rapid increase in prevalence suggests that behavioural and environmental influences predominate, rather than biological changes.

Direct associations between obesity and several diseases, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and ischaemic heart disease, are well recognized. Despite this, the relationship between body weight and all-cause mortality is more controversial. A very high degree of obesity (BMI ⩾35 kg/m2) seems to be linked to higher mortality rates,5 but the relationship between more modest degrees of overweight and mortality is unclear.

Initial data from actuarial studies of more than 4 million men and women showed a direct positive association between body weight and overall mortality rates.6 Subsequent studies confirmed increased mortality risk above a certain threshold, but found a U-shaped association between weight and mortality.7,,8 In the Build study,9 there was a higher mortality in lean subjects, but there was no adjustment for smoking. The American Cancer Society found a much stronger association between leanness and mortality, specifically cancer mortality, in the group of smokers compared to non-smokers.10

The Harvard Alumni Study11 was a prospective cohort study of more than 19 000 middle-aged …

Both types of materials are uniformly integrated into one spectral simulator. Based on the modal warping technique, we employ a new constraint strategy which eliminates the accumulation of approximation errors at the boundary interfaces, thus naturally gluing different materials. We also utilize the GPU to accelerate the run‐time computation when updating the geometry of the hybrid solid—the most expensive step in this framework.

Mood disturbance is common among patients with fibromyalgia (FM), but the influence of psychological symptoms on pain processing in this disorder is unknown. We undertook the present study to investigate the differential effect of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and catastrophizing on 1) pain symptoms and subjective ratings of general health status and 2) sensitivity to pain and cerebral processing of pressure pain.


METHODS
Eighty-three women (mean ± SD age 43.8 ± 8.1 years) who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of FM participated in the study. Patients rated pain intensity (100-mm visual analog scale [VAS]), severity of FM (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), general health status (Short Form 36), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and catastrophizing (Coping Strategies Questionnaire). Experimental pain in the thumb was induced using a computer-controlled pressure stimulator. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during administration of painful stimuli representing 50 mm on a pain VAS, as well as nonpainful pressures.


RESULTS
A correlation analysis including all self-ratings showed that depressive symptoms, anxiety, and catastrophizing scores were correlated with one another (P < 0.001), but did not correlate with ratings of clinical pain or with sensitivity to pressure pain. However, the subjective rating of general health was correlated with depressive symptoms and anxiety (P < 0.001). Analyses of imaging results using self-rated psychological measures as covariates showed that brain activity during experimental pain was not modulated by depressive symptoms, anxiety, or catastrophizing.


CONCLUSION
Negative mood in FM patients can lead to a poor perception of one's physical health (and vice versa) but does not influence performance on assessments of clinical and experimental pain. Our data provide evidence that 2 partially segregated mechanisms are involved in the neural processing of experimental pain and negative affect.","[{'authorId': '38517240', 'name': 'Karin B.

On the basis of ironic process theory, they proposed that efforts to suppress experiential or expressive components of anger may paradoxically enhance cognitive accessibility of anger-related thoughts and feelings, thereby contaminating perception of succeeding pain in an anger-congruent manner. Participants were randomly assigned to nonsuppression or experiential or expressive suppression conditions during mental arithmetic with or without harassment. A cold-pressor task followed. Results revealed that participants instructed to suppress experiential or expressive components of emotion during harassment not only reported the greatest pain levels, but also rated the anger-specific dimensions of pain uniquely strong. Results suggest that attempts to suppress anger may amplify pain sensitivity by ironically augmenting perception of the irritating and frustrating qualities of pain.","[{'authorId': '4307761', 'name': 'P.

However, the unique and the shared neuroanatomical characteristics of the two disorders have not been fully identified. The aim of this study was to compare the topological organization of gray matter networks between non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients and SAD patients. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 37 non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients, 24 non-comorbid medication-naive SAD patients, and 41 healthy controls. Single-subject gray matter graphs were extracted from structural MRI scans, and whole-brain neuroanatomic organization was compared across the three groups. The relationships between brain network measures and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Relative to healthy controls, both the MDD and the SAD patients showed global decreases in clustering coefficient, normalized clustering coefficient, and small-worldness and locally decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the left insular, lingual, and calcarine cortices. Compared with healthy controls, the SAD patients exhibited increased nodal centralities and morphological connections mainly involving the prefrontal cortex and the sensorimotor network. Furthermore, compared to the SAD patients, the MDD patients showed increased characteristic path length, reduced global efficiency, and decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus. Our findings provide new evidence for shared and specific similarity-based gray matter network alterations in MDD and SAD and emphasize that the psychopathological changes in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus might be different between the two disorders.","[{'authorId': '7637061', 'name': 'Youjin Zhao'}, {'authorId': '23597096', 'name': 'R.

A cross-sectional study was done using an anonymous online survey in which 412 participants filled out the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-2; the Impact of Events Scale; and the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form, reporting severe symptomatology of posttraumatic stress and mild anxiety and depression. Quality of cohabitation and age were found to be key variables in the psychological impact of confinement. The impact of confinement was more negative for those who reported very poor cohabitation as opposed to very good (F (3, 405) = 30.75, p ≤ 0.001, d = 2.44, r = 0.054) or for those under 35 years of age compared to those over 46 (F (2, 409) = 5.14, p = 0.006, d = 0.36). Practicing meditation was not revealed as a protective factor, but self-compassion was related to better cohabitation during confinement (F (3, 403) = 11.83, p ≤ 0.001, d = 1.05). These results could be relevant in designing psychological interventions to improve coping and mental health in other situations similar to confinement.","[{'authorId': '2056488024', 'name': 'Óliver Jiménez'}, {'authorId': '1422079903', 'name': 'Laura C.

This study applies a consumption value model as the basic framework, which includes the functional value, the social value, the emotional value, the epistemic value and the conditional value. We also include cultural dimensions as influencers, such as power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation. The combination of these two theories results in an original method to discover whether the consumption value of innovative mobile commerce is influenced by cultural factors. After surveying young mobile users and implementing a canonical analysis, we find two types of correlation between cultural influencers and mobile consumption values. One type is defined as the achievement-facilitated relationship, which means that the mobile users are associated with high levels of power distance, individualism, masculinity, and long-term orientation in terms of positive correlation to more mobile demands of higher functional, epistemic, and conditional values. The second type is referred to as the relationship-maintained relationship, which means that mobile users who are more averse to uncertainty also highly demand social and emotional mobile applications.

The World Health Organization has reported that breast cancer, with 502,000 deaths in 2005, surpassed lung, stomach, colorectal, and cervical cancers as the leading cause of death in women. The main objective of the current study was to examine the predictive role of emotional selfregulation in quality of life and perception of suffering among patients with breast cancer. Methods: This was a descriptive-analytical study followed by a correlational design. The sample population consisted of 42 patients with breast cancer selected by the census method. Participants completed questionnaires on emotional self-regulation, quality of life (Aaronson et al., 1987), and perception of suffering. The obtained data was statistically analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and regression analysis via SPSS 22. Results: There was a significant, positive association between emotional selfregulation and the functional and general dimensions of quality of life. A significant, inverse correlation existed between emotional self-regulation and the symptoms dimension of quality of life. The results of the enter regression analysis showed that selfregulation respectively predicted 0.18 of variance in the functional, 0.26 in symptoms, and 0.37 of the variance in the general health dimensions of the quality of life. Emotional self-regulation had a significant, diverse relationship to the physical, psychological, and existential dimensions of perception of suffering. The results of the regression analysis carried out to predict perception of suffering indicated that emotional self-regulation respectively predicted 0.33 of variance in the physical, 0.19 in psychological, and 0.06 of the variance in the existential dimensions of perception of suffering. Conclusion: A major step forward can be taken towards improving the level of quality of life among breast cancer patients through the use of books and educational brochures, individual and group counseling sessions associated with emotional self-regulation, and encouragement of patients to participate in cultural and sports activities.","[{'authorId': '6844053', 'name': 'Z.

During recent decades, self-regulated learning (SRL) has become a major research field. SRL successfully integrates the cognitive and motivational components of learning. Self-regulation is usually seen as an individual process, with the social aspects of regulation conceptualized as one aspect of the context. However, recent research has begun to investigate whether self-regulation processes are complemented by socially shared regulation processes.


AIMS
The presented study investigated what kind of socio-emotional challenges students experience during collaborative learning and whether the students regulate the emotions evoked during these situations. The interplay of the emotion regulation processes between the individual and the group was also studied.


SAMPLE
The sample for this study was 63 teacher education students who studied in groups of three to five during three collaborative learning tasks.


METHOD
Students' interpretations of experienced social challenges and their attempts to regulate emotions evoked by these challenges were collected following each task using the Adaptive Instrument for the Regulation of Emotions.


RESULTS
The results indicated that students experienced a variety of social challenges. Students also reported the use of shared regulation in addition to self-regulation. Finally, the results suggested that intrinsic group dynamics are derived from both individual and social elements of collaborative situations.


CONCLUSION
The findings of the study support the assumption that students can regulate emotions collaboratively as well as individually. The study contributes to our understanding of the social aspects of emotional regulation in collaborative learning contexts.","[{'authorId': '2445256', 'name': 'H.

Mothers who were more knowledgeable, satisfied, and attributed successes in their parenting to themselves when their toddlers were 20 months of age engaged in increased supportive parenting during joint activity tasks 2 years later when their children were 4 years of age, and 6 years after that their 10-year-olds were rated by teachers as having fewer classroom externalizing behavior problems. This developmental cascade of a “standard model” of parenting applied equally to families with girls and boys, and the cascade from parenting attributions to supportive parenting to child externalizing behavior obtained independent of 12 child, parent, and family covariates.

The success and survival of any form of online community relies on the presence and active participation of its users. Hence, ensuring active user participation and retaining existing users is a key concern of the moderators of online communities. To address these challenges, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the epistemic, emotional, and social values that influence users’ intention to continue using an online social media brand community. Moreover, the study also investigates the differences in the influence of the investigated constructs and users’ various activity levels. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
This study utilized the consumption value theory framework for testing the relationship between different measures. An empirical analysis of the consumption values of 577 users in an online social media brand community was accomplished using structural equation modeling. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The study findings revealed that emotional and social values exert partial influence in predicting users’ intention to continue using online social media brand communities. In particular, social enhancement and playfulness predict users’ continuation intentions. Moreover, the results show that the influence of the investigated constructs (except playfulness) is consistent across users with various activity levels in online social media brand communities. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
These findings pave the way for further theoretical and practical considerations of the role of consumption values in resolving challenges of user participation and retention. However, there are still some open gaps concerning the generalizability of the findings as well as other factors that could potentially influence the user intentions. Future studies should validate the findings by recruiting diverse users in terms of their age and cultural background. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
The study findings are of special relevance for the service operators interested in practicing user-centric innovation. Moreover, the findings can help online social media brand community managers to kick start user-centric innovation activities in their community. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
The study provides a novel perspective on the challenges of assessing users’ consumption behavior. The perceived values have been conceptualized using the constructs of social influence, problem solving, playfulness, social enhancement, and social interaction.","[{'authorId': '23450589', 'name': 'Puneet Kaur'}, {'authorId': '1889986', 'name': 'A.

Moreover, becoming a mother of a VPT infant is a traumatic event, which might affect the establishment of a bonding relationship toward the infant during the postnatal period. The main aim of the present study was to assess the association between maternal postnatal bonding and socio-emotional stress response in 3-month-old VPT infants, compared to full-term (FT) controls. Thirty-three VPT and 28 FT infant-mother dyads underwent the maternal Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) procedure to assess socio-emotional stress regulation. Maternal postnatal bonding was measured through the Maternal Post-Natal Attachment Scale (MPAS), which includes three scales: Quality of attachment, Absence of hostility, and Pleasure in interaction. The VPT infants exhibited less self-directed and other-directed regulatory behaviors during the Still-Face episode. Mothers of VPT infants reported lower Quality of attachment compared to FT counterparts. Importantly, higher levels of Quality of attachment were associated with more other-directed behaviors during the Still-Face episode in FT dyads, whereas this was not observed in VPT dyads. In conclusion, VPT infants might be exposed to a double-risk condition for socio-emotional development, encompassing both difficulties in stress response and the exposure to a less-than-optimal maternal bonding.","[{'authorId': '4040954', 'name': 'L.

The aim of the article is to draw up a structural and functional model of development of profession-oriented and specialized competences of students during the studying of profession-related disciplines and to test this model. The leading method to study this problem is pedagogical modeling, enabling us to consider this problem as the process of development of profession-oriented and specialized competences through self-development and self-fulfillment by doing vocational and pedagogical tasks. The article outlines the structural and functional model of development of profession-oriented and specialized competences of students while studying professionrelated disciplines, consisting of interconnected components: purpose-oriented, theoretical and methodological, informative, organizational and activity-related, assessment and adjustment, and performance-related; an algorithm to introduce this model was also developed. The results of the study contain the invariable foundation of methodological support of profession-oriented disciplines and can be recommended for use for the entire range of educational disciplines for profilisation.

On the one hand, emotion is a “double-edged sword” that may affect various aspects of our cognition and behaviour, by enhancing or hindering them and exerting both transient and long-term influences. On the other hand, emotion processing is also susceptible to cognitive influences, typically exerted in the form of emotion regulation. Noteworthy, both of these reciprocal influences are subjective to individual differences that may affect the way we perceive, experience, and eventually remember emotional experiences, or respond to emotionally challenging situations. Understanding these relationships is critical, as unbalanced emotion–cognition interactions may lead to devastating effects, such as those observed in mood and anxiety disorders. The present review analyses the reciprocal relationships between emotion and cognition, based on evidence derived from brain imaging investigations focusing on three main topics: (1) the impact of emotion on cognition, (2) the impact of cognition on emotion, and (3) the role of individual differences in emotion–cognition interactions. This evidence will be discussed in the context of identifying aspects that are fundamental to understanding the mechanisms underlying emotion–cognition interactions in healthy functioning, and to understanding changes associated with affective disorders.","[{'authorId': '2600862', 'name': 'F.

A growing body of basic science, clinical research, and population health evidence points to the benefits of healthy behaviors, environments and policies to maintain health and prevent, treat, and reverse the root causes of common chronic diseases. Similarly, innovations in research methodologies, standards of evidence, emergence of unique study cohorts, and breakthroughs in data analytics and modeling create new possibilities for producing biomedical knowledge and clinical translation. To understand these advances and inform future directions research, The Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit was convened at the University of Pittsburgh on December 4–5, 2019. The Summit's goal was to review current status and define research priorities in the six core areas of lifestyle medicine: plant-predominant nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, addictive behaviors, and positive psychology/social connection. Forty invited subject matter experts (1) reviewed existing knowledge and gaps relating lifestyle behaviors to common chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, many cancers, inflammatory- and immune-related disorders and other conditions; and (2) discussed the potential for applying cutting-edge molecular, cellular, epigenetic and emerging science knowledge and computational methodologies, research designs, and study cohorts to accelerate clinical applications across all six domains of lifestyle medicine. Notably, federal health agencies, such as the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration have begun to adopt “whole-person health and performance” models that address these lifestyle and environmental root causes of chronic disease and associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. Recommendations strongly support leveraging emerging research methodologies, systems biology, and computational modeling in order to accelerate effective clinical and population solutions to improve health and reduce societal costs. New and alternative hierarchies of evidence are also be needed in order to assess the quality of evidence and develop evidence-based guidelines on lifestyle medicine. Children and underserved populations were identified as prioritized groups to study. The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately impacts people with chronic diseases that are amenable to effective lifestyle medicine interventions, makes the Summit's findings and recommendations for future research particularly timely and relevant.","[{'authorId': '8403000', 'name': 'Y.

Despite a growing body of research on teacher stress and development of stress-management programmes, studies come almost exclusively from just a few industrialised nations and the applicability of their recommendations for teacher training in developing regions is difficult to ascertain. The present study helps to redress this imbalance, and reports on data from 444 secondary school teachers in Barbados using a 36-item self-report instrument. Individual item means indicated that difficulties associated with classroom instructional and management demands were perceived by the majority of teachers to be the most stressful aspects of their work. On the other hand, factor analysis and ANOVA computations revealed that problems associated with time management most clearly differentiated between teachers when compared on the basis of sex, qualifications, and years of experience. Findings are discussed generally with reference to the existing international literature, and more specifically in terms of living and working conditions in the West Indies.","[{'authorId': '116774303', 'name': 'M.

Therefore, the present study aims to assess the respective levels of fear, anxiety, depression, stress, social support, and the associated factors, experienced by Jordanian health-care workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This study adopted a cross-sectional, correlational design to collect data from 365 health-care workers in Amman, Jordan, from August 16th to 23rd, 2020. Along with collecting sociodemographic characteristics, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support electronically administered to participants. The majority of the participants (69.3%) were registered nurses. The mean overall score for the Fear of COVID-19 scale was 23.64 (SD + 6.85) which again exceeded the mid-point for the total score range (21), indicating elevated level fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants had displayed extremely severe depression 40%, extremely severe anxiety 60%, and 35% severely distressed. Scores for depression (21.30 ± 10.86), anxiety (20.37 ± 10.80), stress (23.33 ± 10.87) were also high. Factors determined to be associated with psychological distress were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Assessment of social support indicated moderate-to-high levels of perceived support for all dimensions (significant other: 5.17 ± 1.28, family: 5.03 ± 1.30, friends: 5.05 ± 1.30). Weak significant correlations were found between social support and the other study variables (r < 0.22), indicating a weak association with fear, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Overall, Jordanian health-care workers sample reported fear, depression, anxiety, and stress. The associated factors were being male, married, aged 40 years and older, and having more clinical experience. Regarding social support, participants primarily relied on support from their families, followed by support from friends.","[{'authorId': '15981755', 'name': 'E.

e2ba528a606f693e2655d9c990145b84eb80f9aa,"This essay proposes an emotion-management perspective as a lens through which to inspect the self, interaction, and structure. Emotion, it is argued, can be and ofter is subject to acts of management. The individual often works on inducing or inhibiting feelings so as to render them ""appropriate"" to a situation. The emotion-management perspective draws on an interactive account of emotion. It differs from the dramaturgical perspective on the one hand and the psychoanalytic perspective on the other. It allows us to inspect at closer range than either of those perspectives the relation among emotive experience, emotion management, feeling rules, and ideology. Feeling rules are seen as the side of ideology that deals with emotion and feeling. Emotion management is the type of work it takes to cope with feeling rules. Meaning-making jobs, more common in the middle class, put more premium on the individual's capacity to do emotion work. A reexamination of class differences in child rearing suggest that middle-class families prepare their children for emotion management more and working-class families prepare them less. In this way each prepares its children to psychologically reproduce the class structure.","[{'authorId': '65887305', 'name': 'A.

Results show that 85.7% of the parents perceived changes in their children’s emotional state and behaviors during the quarantine. The most frequent symptoms were difficulty concentrating (76.6%), boredom (52%), irritability (39%), restlessness (38.8%), nervousness (38%), feelings of loneliness (31.3%), uneasiness (30.4%), and worries (30.1%). Spanish parents reported more symptoms than Italians. As expected, children of both countries used monitors more frequently, spent less time doing physical activity, and slept more hours during the quarantine. Furthermore, when family coexistence during quarantine became more difficult, the situation was more serious, and the level of stress was higher, parents tended to report more emotional problems in their children. The quarantine impacts considerably on Italian and Spanish youth, reinforcing the need to detect children with problems as early as possible to improve their psychological well-being.","[{'authorId': '4117334', 'name': 'M.

The present study examines the mediating role of positive youth development and the moderating role of mindfulness to determine the association between Internet addiction and depression. A sample of 522 Chinese adolescents completed measures related to Internet addiction, positive youth development, mindfulness, depression, and their background information, for which the results reveal that positive youth development mediates the relation between Internet addiction and depression. Moreover, the associations between both Internet addiction and depression as well as positive youth development and depression are moderated by mindfulness. These two effects were stronger for adolescents with low mindfulness than for those with high mindfulness. The present study contributes to a more thorough understanding of how and when Internet addiction increases the risk of depression in adolescents, suggesting that Internet addiction may affect adolescent depression through positive youth development and that mindfulness can alleviate the negative effect of Internet addiction or a low level of psychological resources on depression.

In particular, we describe the Empathic Companion, an animated interface agent that accompanies the user in the setting of a virtual job interview. This interface application takes physiological data (skin conductance and electromyography) of a user in realtime, interprets them as emotions, and addresses the user's affective states in the form of empathic feedback. The Empathic Companion is conceived as an educational agent that supports job seekers preparing for a job interview. We also present results from an exploratory study that aims to evaluate the impact of the Empathic Companion by measuring users' skin conductance and heart rate. While an overall positive effect of the Empathic Companion could not be shown, the outcome of the experiment suggests that empathic feedback has a positive effect on the interviewee's stress level while hearing the interviewer question.","[{'authorId': '2356111', 'name': 'H.

The data show that subjects who are told they are interdependent with the computer affiliate with the computer as a team. The data also show that the effects of being in a team with a computer are the same as the effects of being in a team with another human: subjects in the interdependence conditions perceived the computer to be more similar to themselves, saw themselves as more cooperative, were more open to influence from the computer, thought the information from the computer was of higher quality, found the information from the computer friendlier, and conformed more to the computer's information. Subjects in the identity conditions showed neither team affiliation nor the effects of team affiliation.","[{'authorId': '2029850', 'name': 'C. Nass'}, {'authorId': '145469150', 'name': 'B.

e367d94bc9cad7868b728d35ed621c9f533bb067,"OBJECTIVE
The paucity of data concerning the long-term natural history of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common childhood psychiatric disorder, prompted a longitudinal study to investigate the adult sequelae of the childhood disorder.


DESIGN
Prospective study, follow-up intervals ranging from 13 to 19 years (mean, 16 years), with blind systematic clinical assessments.


SUBJECTS
Ninety-one white males (mean age, 26 years), representing 88% of a cohort systematically diagnosed as hyperactive in childhood, and 95 (95%) of comparison cases of similar race, gender, age, whose teachers had voiced no complaints about their school behavior in childhood.


RESULTS
Probands had significantly higher rates than comparisons of ADHD symptoms (11% vs 1%), antisocial personality disorders (18% vs 2%), and drug abuse disorders (16% vs 4%). Significant comorbidity occurred between antisocial and drug disorders. Educational and occupational achievements were significantly compromised in the probands. These disadvantages were independent of psychiatric status. We did not find increased rates of affective or anxiety disorders in the probands.


CONCLUSIONS
Childhood ADHD predicts specific adult psychiatric disorders, namely antisocial and drug abuse disorders. In the adolescent outcome of this cohort, we found that these disturbances were dependent on the continuation of ADHD symptoms. In contrast, in adulthood, antisocial and drug disorders appeared, in part, independent of sustained ADHD. In addition, regardless of psychiatric status, ADHD placed children at relative risk for educational and vocational disadvantage. The results do not support a relationship between childhood ADHD and adult mood or anxiety disorders.","[{'authorId': '5198509', 'name': 'S. Mannuzza'}, {'authorId': '118537122', 'name': 'R.

Methods: Systematic review searching Medline, Psychinfo and Embase to March 2013 for studies measuring DD. Two reviewers assessed citations and full papers for eligibility based on RCT design and Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale or Diabetes Distress Scale outcome measure. Interventions were categorised by content and medium of delivery. Meta-analyses were undertaken by intervention category where ≥7 studies were available. Standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were computed and combined in a random effects meta-analysis. Results: Of 16 627 citations reviewed, 41 RCTs involving 6650 participants were included. Twenty-one a priori meta-analyses were undertaken. Effective interventions were psycho-education (−0.21 [−0.33, −0.09]), generalist interventionist (−0.19 [−0.31, −0.08]), ≥6 sessions (−0.14 [−0.26, −0.03]) and ≥3 months duration (−0.14 [−0.24, −0.03]). Motivational interviewing reduced DD (−0.09 [−0.18, −0.00]) and improved baseline elevated glycaemia (−0.16 [−0.28, −0.04]). Although statistical significance was observed most effect sizes were below 0.2. Conclusion: The review signposts interventions likely to reduce elevated DD in Type 1 and Type 2 and across the age profile. Interventional research is needed and warranted targeting elevated distress.","[{'authorId': '49611891', 'name': 'J.

(2) Pathological versus nonpathological dissociation is associated with alexithymic traits. Methods: Psychiatric in- and outpatients (n = 173) and nonclinical subjects (n = 38) were investigated with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the FDS (German version of Dissociation Experience Scale) and the Symptom Check List (SCL-90-R; GSI). Correlation analyses followed by MANOVA and logistic regression were performed. Results: Significant correlations and partial correlations, controlling for GSI, were observed between dissociation and alexithymia. The MANOVA demonstrated significantly higher scores for the two TAS-20 dimensions ‘difficulty identifying feelings’ and ‘difficulty expressing feelings’ in the group with pathological dissociation. On the basis of the TAS-20 subscores, logistic regression analysis correctly classified 72.5% of the cases into the pathological and the nonpathological dissociation group. Conclusions: These results support our hypothesis that pathological traits of dissociation are highly associated with alexithymia. A model is discussed in which alexithymic characteristics may contribute to the development of pathological dissociation and stress-related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder.","[{'authorId': '2070718', 'name': 'H.

In the present review it has been addressed the issue of whether some forms of emotion regulation are healthier than others by focusing on two commonly used emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal (changing the way one thinks about potentially emotion-eliciting events) and expressive suppression (changing the way one behaviorally responds to emotion-eliciting events). In the first section, experimental findings showing that cognitive reappraisal has a healthier profile of short-term affective, cognitive, and social consequences than expressive suppression are briefly reported. In the second section, individual-difference findings are reviewed showing that using cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions is associated with healthier patterns of affect, social functioning, and well-being than is using expressive suppression. Finally, brain structural basis and functional activation linked to the habitual usage of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression are discussed in detail.","[{'authorId': '4490379', 'name': 'D.

In this time span the proportion of low-birthweight infants rose, the proportion of diplegia decreased, while the proportion of hemiplegia increased. CP is more prevalent in more deprived socio-economic populations. The majority of people with CP have the spastic syndrome of which the diplegic group is the smallest. Dependent on the subgroup of CP, 25 – 80% have additional impairments. A large proportion has some kind of cognitive impairment; the prevalence varies with the type of CP and especially increases when epilepsy is present. Epilepsy is present in 20 – 40%; it is most common among the hemi- and tetraplegics. Sensibility of the hands is impaired in about half. Chronic pain is reported by more than a quarter of the adults. Up to 80% have at least some impairment of speech. Low visual acuity is reported in almost three-quarters of all children. Half of all children have gastrointestinal and feeding problems. Stunted growth occurs in a quarter, while under- or overweight problems are present in half of the children. Almost 70% of people with spastic CP have abnormal brain CT findings; abnormal cranial ultrasounds is most strongly associated with hemiplegia, normal cranial ultrasounds with diplegia.

Higher EC is associated with greater happiness, better mental and physical health, more satisfying social and marital relationships and greater occupational success. While it is well-known that EC (as a whole) predicts a number of important outcomes, it is unclear so far which specific competency(ies) participate(s) in a given outcome. This is because no measure of EC distinctly measures each of the five core emotional competences, separately for one’s own and others’ emotions. This lack of information is problematic both theoretically (we do not understand the processes at stake) and practically (we cannot develop customized interventions). This paper aims to address this issue. We developed and validated in four steps a complete (albeit short: 50 items) self-reported measure of EC: the Profile of Emotional Competence.

e4bebceba5acfae807b7264a2aae24a75587953b,"Death by suicide is a major occupational hazard for physicians (1). The suicide rate among male physicians is more than 40% higher than among men in the general population, whereas that of female physicians is a staggering 130% higher than among women in the general population (1, 2). The increased risk for suicide among physicians may begin during medical school (3). Available studies suggest that the suicide rate among medical students is higher than in the age-matched population (35). Other small, single-institution studies (610) have reported that 3% to 15% of medical students have suicidal ideation during medical school training. Suicidal ideation is a well-established predictor of suicidal planning and attempts. The National Comorbidity Survey found that 34% of individuals in the general population with suicidal ideation develop a suicide plan and, of those who plan, more than 70% will attempt suicide (11). Notably, 26% of individuals with suicidal ideation progressed directly to an unplanned suicide attempt (11). Suicide is at the extreme end of the personal distress continuum, and it is critical for medical schools to identify students at greatest risk for suicide in the hope of intervening before a tragic outcome. Several multi-institutional studies (1214) reveal that medical students have a substantially lower mental quality of life than similarly aged individuals in the general population and that burnout affects up to 50% of U.S. medical students. We hypothesized that burnout would relate to suicidal ideation among medical students. We used a mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional study design to evaluate the prevalence of suicidal ideation among U.S. medical students and to evaluate the relationship between suicidal ideation and burnout, symptoms of depression, and quality of life. Our objective was to assess the frequency of suicidal ideation among medical students and explore its relationship with burnout. Methods Participants In the spring of 2006 (baseline) and 2007 (1-year follow-up), we invited all medical students at the Mayo Medical School, University of Washington School of Medicine, University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, and University of Alabama School of Medicine to complete Web-based surveys. Students at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences also participated in the 2007 survey. Participation was elective, and responses were anonymized. We included all students who responded to the 2007 survey in the cross-sectional analysis and those who responded in both 2006 and 2007 in the longitudinal analysis. Each institution's institutional review board approved the study before participation of their students. Data Collection Participants returned the surveys electronically. Preserving student confidentiality was an essential feature. We linked individual responses on the 2006 and 2007 surveys for longitudinal analysis by using unique identifiers and stripped all data of identifiers before forwarding them to study statisticians for analysis. Study Measures We used established instruments to measure burnout, symptoms of depression, and quality of life on both the 2006 and 2007 surveys. These surveys also included questions about demographic characteristics, and the 2007 survey included questions about suicidal ideation. Suicidal Ideation We assessed suicidal ideation by asking students: Have you ever had thoughts of taking your own life, even if you would not really do it?, During the past 12 months have you had thoughts of taking your own life?, and Have you ever made an attempt to take your own life? These questions, which originated from an inventory developed by Meehan and colleagues (15) that has been used to assess suicidal ideation among medical students (9), are similar to questions used in large U.S. epidemiologic studies intended to assess suicidality (11, 1618). Burnout, Symptoms of Depression, and Quality of Life The Maslach Burnout Inventory is a 22-item instrument that is considered the gold standard for measuring burnout (1921). This instrument has separate subscales to evaluate each domain of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Tests of discriminant and convergent validity have been acceptable, construct validity of the 3 dimensions has been demonstrated (22, 23), and predictive validity has been suggested by burnout score predicting risk for future sick leave absences (24). The Maslach Burnout Inventory has also been used extensively in studies of both physicians (20,21, 25) and medical students (13, 14, 2628). According to convention, a score of 27 or higher on the emotional exhaustion subscale or 10 or higher on the depersonalization subscale was considered an indicator of professional burnout for medical professionals (19). Health professionals are considered to have a low score on the personal accomplishment scale if their score is 33 or less. Normal scores for health care professionals, including physicians, are 22.19, 7.12, and 36.53 on the emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment subscales, respectively (19). We identified symptoms of depression by using the 2-item Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (29), a screening tool which performs as well as longer instruments (30). This instrument has a sensitivity of 86% to 96% and a specificity of 57% to 75% for major depressive disorder (29, 30). With a reported positive likelihood ratio of up to 3.42 for the diagnosis of major depression (30) and an estimated 25% prevalence of depression among medical students (12), a positive result implies a 50% probability of current major depression. We measured mental and physical quality of life by using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-8 (SF-8) (31, 32), an alternate version of the SF-36. Norm-based scoring methods of responses on this instrument are used to calculate mental and physical quality of life summary scores (31). The mean mental and physical quality of life summary scores for the U.S. population are 49.2 (SD, 9.46) and 49.2 (SD, 9.07), respectively (31). Previous research has demonstrated acceptable reliability and testretest reliability (31). Several studies (31) have demonstrated content, construct, and criterion-related validity for the SF-8, and other studies (33) have demonstrated high convergent validity and good discriminate validity. The SF-8 has also been used in samples of residents (32) and medical students (14, 27, 28). Statistical Analysis Our primary analysis involved descriptive summary statistics for estimating the prevalence of suicidal ideation, burnout, a positive depression screen, and mental and physical quality of life for medical students. We evaluated differences by reported suicidal ideation in the previous year by using the WilcoxonMannWhitney test (for continuous variables) and the Fisher exact test (for categorical variables). We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test rather than parametric tests to account for the interval level nature of the psychological tests. All tests were 2-sided, with a type I error rate of 0.05. We performed collinearity testing to determine whether multiple-way collinearity existed among the independent variables (34). No variables had achieved a level of collinearity that would bias the modeling process. We performed forward stepwise logistic regression to evaluate independent associations of the independent variables with suicidal ideation. We used a saturated model and backward stepping to confirm results of the initial stepwise regression. In all cases, backward stepping produced the same model as the stepwise approach.

Results Cross-Sectional Survey A total of 2248 (52.4%) of 4287 medical students responded to the 2007 survey. Responders were less likely than the overall population to be male (51.6% vs. 54.9%), between 25 and 30 years of age (55.4% vs. 62.4%), or nonwhite (25.8% vs. 31.0%) (all P< 0.02). Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of cross-sectional survey respondents. Table 1. Participant Characteristics, 2007 Table 2 shows the percentage of responders reporting suicidal ideation, burnout, and symptoms of depression and the mean quality-of-life scores. Of the 2230 responders on the 2007 survey who responded to questions on suicidal ideation, 249 (11.2% [CI, 9.9% to 12.6%]) reported considering suicide in the previous year and 43 (1.9% [CI, 1.4% to 2.6%]) had made a suicide attempt at some point in the past. On sensitivity analysis, assuming that all nonresponders did not have suicidal ideation, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 12 months would be 249 (5.8%) of 4287 students. Table 2. Burnout, Quality of Life, and Depression Symptoms, 2007 Overall, 1069 (49.6%, [CI, 47.5%51.8%]) of 2154 students met the criteria for burnout (94 students did not answer enough Maslach Burnout Inventory questions to be included in this analysis). Among these students, 860 (40.1%) of 2142 had high emotional exhaustion, 648 (31.8%) of 2037 had high depersonalization, and 595 of 1945 (30.6%) had a low sense of personal accomplishment. Compared with age-comparable individuals and the general U.S. population, medical students had lower mental quality-of-life scores (mean, 43.5 [SD, 11.0] vs. 47.2 [SD, 9.9] for age-comparable individuals [P< 0.001] and 49.2 [SD, 9.5] for the general U.S. population [P< 0.001]) but higher physical quality-of-life scores (mean, 52.2 [6.9] vs. 51.4 [SD, 7.9] for age-comparable ","[{'authorId': '3616348', 'name': 'L.

e4e4dee53bf80872f0a6a3a7de13921bb0fb22bd,"Background Students in need of mental health care face many barriers including cost, location, availability, and stigma. Studies show that computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a less-intensive and more cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although CBT is one of the most effective treatment methods, applying an integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment improvement. Integrative psychological artificial intelligence (AI) offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable, convenient, lasting, and secure support grows. Objective This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using an integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce self-identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students. Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 75 participants were recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All participants completed Web-based surveys, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks later (T2). The 2 test groups consisted of 50 participants in total and were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks (n=24) or 4 weeks (n=26). The information-only control group participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National Institute of Mental Health’s (NIMH) eBook on depression among college students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the study. Results A sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0% attrition from the test group and less than 1% attrition from the control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years, with 70% of participants being female (52/74), mostly Asian (37/74, 51%), and white (32/74, 41%). Group 1 received unlimited access to Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group 2 received unlimited access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only control group was provided with an electronic link to the NIMH’s eBook. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that group 1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found between the control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, whereas the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did impact scores. Conclusions This study offers evidence that AI can serve as a cost-effective and accessible therapeutic agent. Although not designed to appropriate the role of a trained therapist, integrative psychological AI emerges as a feasible option for delivering support.

e53a331f81ea2be2684b7ad67dc727534499b143,"Background: Health care is a demanding field, with a high level of responsibility and exposure to emotional and physical danger. High levels of stress may result in depression, anxiety, burnout syndrome, and in extreme cases, post-traumatic stress disorder. The aim of this study was to determine which personal, professional, and organizational variables are associated with greater perceived stress among critical care nurses for purposes of developing integrative solutions to decrease stress in the future. Methods: We conducted a correlation research survey using a cross-sectional design and an in-person survey method. The questionnaire consisted of 2 parts: (1) socioeconomic, professional, and institutional variables and (2) work stressors. Surveys were conducted between January 1, 2011, and December 1, 2015. Multistage cluster random sampling was utilized for data collection. Inclusion criteria were (1) age ≥18 years, (2) registered nurse, (3) works in the intensive care unit (ICU), and (4) willing and able to complete the survey. Results: We surveyed 21 767 ICU nurses in Iran and found that male sex, lower levels of peer collaboration, working with a supervisor in the unit, nurse–patient ratios, and working in a surgical ICU were positively associated with greater stress levels. Increasing age and married status were negatively associated with stress. Intensive care unit type (semi-closed vs open), ICU bed number, shift time, working on holidays, education level, and demographic factors including body mass index, and number of children were not significantly associated with stress levels. Conclusion: As the largest study of its kind, these findings support those found in various European, North, and South American studies. Efforts to decrease workplace stress of ICU nurses by focusing on facilitating peer collaboration, improving resource availability, and staffing ratios are likely to show the greatest impact on stress levels.","[{'authorId': '103116583', 'name': 'A. vahedian-azimi'}, {'authorId': '5600829', 'name': 'M.

One cannot be all things, which would require mastery of every realm of human life. People differ in the areas in which they cultivate their efficacy and in the levels to which they develop it even within their given pursuits. For example, a business executive may have a high sense of organizational efficacy but low parenting efficacy. Thus, the efficacy belief system is not a global trait but a differentiated set of self-beliefs linked to distinct realms of functioning. Multidomain measures reveal the patterning and degree of generality of people's sense of personal efficacy. There is no all-purpose measure of perceived self-efficacy. The "" one measure fits all "" approach usually has limited explanatory and predictive value because most of the items in an all-purpose test may have little or no relevance to the domain of functioning. Moreover, in an effort to serve all purposes, items in such a measure are usually cast in general terms divorced from the situational demands and circumstances. This leaves much ambiguity about exactly what is being measured or the level of task and situational demands that must be managed. Scales of perceived self-CHAPTER 14 Note that this date is incorrect. The book was published in 2006. 308 A. BANDURA efficacy must be tailored to the particular domain of functioning that is the object of interest. Although efficacy beliefs are multifaceted, social cognitive theory identifies several conditions under which they may co-vary even across distinct domains of functioning (Bandura, 1997). When different spheres of activity are governed by similar sub-skills there is some inter-domain relation in perceived efficacy. Proficient performance is partly guided by higher-order self-regulatory skills. These include generic skills for diagnosing task demands, constructing and evaluating alternative courses of action, setting proximal goals to guide one's efforts, and creating self-incentives to sustain engagement in taxing activities and to manage stress and debilitating intrusive thoughts. Generic self-management strategies developed in one realm of activity are serviceable in other activity domains with resulting co-variation in perceived efficacy among them. Co-development is still another correlative process. Even if different activity domains are not sub-served by common sub-skills, the same perceived efficacy can occur if development of competencies is socially structured so that skills in dissimilar domains are developed together. For example, students are likely to develop similarly high perceived self-efficacy …","[{'authorId': '107940205', 'name': 'A. Bandura'}, {'authorId': '107940205', 'name': 'A.

It is related to decreased quality of life, isolation, and institutionalisation. It also poses a risk for future falls when activity is avoided because of fear of falling and muscle deconditioning occurs. Relatively little is known about the psychological factors underpinning fear of falling. This study explored the relationship between emotion regulation and fear of falling in community dwelling older adults. Method: A sample of 117 older adults (>65 years) were recruited from community based exercise classes, falls reduction classes, NHS and charity organisations. Self-reported measures included the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), the Fear of Falling Behaviour Questionnaire (FFABQ), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Results: A significant positive correlation was found between emotion regulation and fear of falling, as well as between emotional regulation and fear-related avoidance behaviour. A regression model found that after controlling for depression and age, emotion regulation was no longer significantly related to fear of falling. Conclusions: Fear of falling is associated with emotion regulation difficulties in community dwelling older adults. However, this link no longer exists once depression is controlled for. The key clinical implication is the importance of the assessment of depression in older adults with a fear of falling. Future research should use a longitudinal design to further unpick the causal relationships between these variables.","[{'authorId': '51934329', 'name': 'L.

e6487a4d293d1f06efcf1127ee647fa9fc02fb4b,"This review examines mechanisms contributing to the intergenerational transmission of self-regulation. To provide an integrated account of how self-regulation is transmitted across generations, we draw from over 75 years of accumulated evidence, spanning case studies to experimental approaches, in literatures covering developmental, social, and clinical psychology, and criminology, physiology, genetics, and human and animal neuroscience (among others). First, we present a taxonomy of what self-regulation is and then examine how it develops--overviews that guide the main foci of the review. Next, studies supporting an association between parent and child self-regulation are reviewed. Subsequently, literature that considers potential social mechanisms of transmission, specifically parenting behavior, interparental (i.e., marital) relationship behaviors, and broader rearing influences (e.g., household chaos) is considered. Finally, evidence that prenatal programming may be the starting point of the intergenerational transmission of self-regulation is covered, along with key findings from the behavioral and molecular genetics literatures. To integrate these literatures, we introduce the self-regulation intergenerational transmission model, a framework that brings together prenatal, social/contextual, and neurobiological mechanisms (spanning endocrine, neural, and genetic levels, including gene-environment interplay and epigenetic processes) to explain the intergenerational transmission of self-regulation. This model also incorporates potential transactional processes between generations (e.g., children's self-regulation and parent-child interaction dynamics that may affect parents' self-regulation) that further influence intergenerational processes. In pointing the way forward, we note key future directions and ways to address limitations in existing work throughout the review and in closing. We also conclude by noting several implications for intervention work.","[{'authorId': '6785375', 'name': 'David J.

e6803dd8c88a02e7be39ca0056d8dbb9e14e6029,"In monkeys, the somatosensory cortex on the parietal operculum can be differentiated into several distinct cortical fields. Potential human homologues for these areas have already been defined by cytoarchitectonic mapping and functional imaging experiments. Differences between the two most widely studied areas [operculum parietale (OP) 1 and OP 4] within this region particularly pertain to their connection with either the perceptive parietal network or the frontal motor areas. In the present study, we investigated differences in anatomical connection patterns probed by probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. Functional connectivity was then mapped by coordinate-based meta-analysis of imaging studies. Comparison between these two aspects of connectivity showed a good congruency and hence converging evidence for an involvement of these areas in matching brain networks. There were, however, also several instances in which anatomical and functional connectivity diverged, underlining the independence of these measures and the need for multimodal characterization of brain connectivity. The connectivity analyses performed showed that the two largest areas within the human parietal operculum region display considerable differences in their connectivity to frontoparietal brain regions. In particular, relative to OP 1, area OP 4 is more closely integrated with areas responsible for basic sensorimotor processing and action control, while OP 1 is more closely connected to the parietal networks for higher order somatosensory processing. These results are largely congruent with data on nonhuman primates. Differences between anatomical and functional connectivity as well as between species, however, highlight the need for an integrative view on connectivity, including comparison and cross-validation of results from different approaches.","[{'authorId': '1717616', 'name': 'S.

The present study examined the hypothesis that the ability to deploy a particularly adaptive type of emotion regulation-cognitive reappraisal-may be a protective factor. It expands upon existing research in three ways. First, participants' ability to use reappraisal (cognitive reappraisal ability: CRA) was measured by using a behavioral challenge that assessed changes in experiential and physiological domains, rather than questionnaires. Second, all participants had been exposed to one or more recent stressful life events, a context in which emotion regulation may be particularly important. Third, a community sample of 78 women aged 20 to 60 was recruited, as opposed to undergraduates. Results indicate that, at low levels of stress, participants' CRA was not associated with depressive symptoms. However, at high levels of stress, women with high CRA exhibited less depressive symptoms than those with low CRA, suggesting that CRA may be an important moderator of the link between stress and depressive symptoms.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S.

Two models were tested. The 1st model, derived from developmental theories, proposed that basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness would predict identity and intimacy achievement, which would, in turn, predict academic intrinsic motivation. A 2nd model, based on self-determination theory, proposed that identity and intimacy would predict academic motivation and that this relationship would be mediated by basic psychological needs. Results from path analyses supported the model derived from self-determination theory over the model derived from developmental theories. Competence and identity were found to be the 2 constructs most strongly associated with academic motivation. These findings support the view that identity formation plays a critical role in facilitating academic motivation in university.","[{'authorId': '34001883', 'name': 'Cathy L Faye'}, {'authorId': '47898660', 'name': 'D.

However, new theorizing suggests the benefits of emotion regulation should depend on its context. One important contextual moderator might be socioeconomic status (SES), because SES powerfully shapes people’s ecology: lower SES affords less control over one’s environment and thus, the ability to self-regulate should be particularly important. Accordingly, effectively regulating one’s emotions (e.g., using cognitive reappraisal) could be more beneficial in lower (vs. higher) SES contexts. Three studies (N = 429) tested whether SES moderates the link between cognitive reappraisal ability (CRA; measured with surveys and in the laboratory) and depression. Each study and a meta-analysis of the 3 studies revealed that CRA was associated with less depression for lower SES but not higher SES individuals. Thus, CRA may be uniquely beneficial in lower SES contexts. More broadly, the effects of emotion regulation depend upon the ecology within which it is used.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S. Troy'}, {'authorId': '5743779', 'name': 'B.

Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving. Purpose: To test a new brief resilience scale. Method: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients. Results: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without fibromyalgia.

Applicants who responded more favorably to their interviewers felt somewhat more positive about taking a job in the recruiting organization.

Multivariate effects were found for applicant sex, applicant race, and interviewer sex on reactions to the interviewer and the interview.

The differences in playfulness between young children with cerebral palsy and developmental delays and children who are typically developing, and the comparative effects of two interventions (one focused on improving mother-child interaction patterns, the other a neurodevelopmental treatment [NDT] session) on children's playfulness were examined in this study. Reliability and validity of the Test of Playfulness (ToP) also were examined.


METHOD
Three trained raters used the ToP to score 38 children, half with cerebral palsy and developmental delays and half typically developing, as they played with their mothers. Mental ages of the children ranged from 3 to 18 months. The mother-child dyads in which the children had cerebral palsy and developmental delays were then randomly assigned to an intervention group. After a 1-hr intervention to improve mother-child interaction, the children were rescored on the ToP.


RESULTS
After examination of ToP reliability and validity, children with cerebral palsy and developmental delays were found to score significantly lower on the ToP than their peers who were typically developing. In addition, children whose mothers received an intervention to improve mother-child interactions scored significantly higher on the ToP after intervention than before intervention. However, the gain scores of children whose mothers received the intervention were not significantly higher than those of children who received direct NDT.


CONCLUSION
The results suggested that when the shared goal of parents and therapists is to enable children to express their inherent playfulness, intervention to improve parent-child interactions may be more potent than intervention directed at improving the child's developmental skills.","[{'authorId': '2239765721', 'name': 'Ann Mari Okimoto'}, {'authorId': '2239775882', 'name': 'Anita Bundy'}, {'authorId': '81207024', 'name': 'J.

However, when samples are sufficiently large, the central limit theorem may be used for the sample means. In this article, we evaluate the use of the central limit theorem for various distributions and sample sizes, as well as its effects on the performance of a Shewhart control chart for these large non‐normally distributed datasets. To this end, we use the sample means as individual observations and a Shewhart control chart for individual observations to monitor processes. We study the unconditional performance, expressed as the expectation of the in‐control average run length (ARL), as well as the conditional performance, expressed as the probability that the control chart based on estimated parameters will have a lower in‐control ARL than a specified desired in‐control ARL. We use recently developed factors to correct the control limits to obtain a specified conditional or unconditional in‐control performance.

For PBC, the authors distinguished global causality beliefs from self-related agency beliefs and intraself (effort, ability) from extraself (parents, teachers) means. Intraself agency beliefs strongly predicted healthy intentions, whereas intraself causality beliefs had a negative influence. Patterns differed somewhat across behaviors and gender.

Therefore, this paper propose a design of a chatbot with avatar and voice interaction to make a conversation more alive. This proposed approach method will come from using several API and using its output as another input to next API. It would take speech recognition to take input from user, then proceed it to chatbot API to receive the chatbot reply in a text form. The reply will be processed to text-to-speech recognition and created a spoken, audio version of the reply. Last, the computer will render an avatar whose gesture and lips are sync with the audio reply. This design would make every customer service or any service with human interaction can use it to make interaction more natural.

e912b102902c4a2de2a3dac89af03639f8fda570,"Backgrounds . The Covid-19 pandemic offered a unique opportunity to investigate trends in hospitalizations related to psychoactive substance intoxication, since the usual health burden of social use at parties and gatherings was likely to be decreased during lockdowns and curfew periods. Since young adults are the main users of psychoactive substances for experimental and recreational purposes, this study identified and compared hospitalization trends in young adults and adults over 30 years old. Methods. This national cohort study was conducted using the French hospital discharge database. An interrupted time-series analysis for the period between 2014 and 2020 was performed in two groups: young (age 18-29) and other adults (30+) to ascertain the trends in the monthly incidence of hospitalization related to psychoactive substance intoxication (opiates, cocaine, benzodiazepines, psychostimulants, alcohol and cannabis). Hospitalization characteristics during the first and second lockdown and the period between them were compared to the reference period (from 01/01/2014 to 29/02/2020). Results. Among 1,358,007 stays associated with psychoactive substance intoxication, 215,430 concerned young adults. Compared with adults 30+, hospitalization trends in young adults showed a greater decrease in the number of stays during lockdown, with a maximum decrease of -39% during the first lockdown (1,566 vs . 2,576; CI95%: 2,285-2,868) versus - 20% (10,212 vs . 12,894; CI95%: 12,001-13,787) in the second lockdown. Presentations for alcohol intoxication decreased throughout the pandemic, particularly during the second lockdown, while admissions for benzodiazepine intoxication increased during both lockdowns. Admissions for cannabis intoxication increased throughout the entire period. Conclusions. Lockdowns were associated with fewer hospitalizations related to psychoactive substance intoxication in both age groups, especially among young adults, which might reflect a decrease in social use. Recreational use might therefore be an important target for prevention and risk minimization.","[{'authorId': '2242464411', 'name': 'Brian Galvin'}]",1648.0,,26.0,Impact of COVID-19,2020.0

Typically, features of emotion regulation are assessed with self-report questionnaires. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an objective measure proposed as an index of emotional regulation capacity. A limited number of studies have shown that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation are associated with HRV. However, results from prior studies are inconclusive, and an ecological validation of the association has not yet been tested. Therefore, further exploration of the relation between self-report questionnaires and psychophysiological measures of emotional regulation is needed. The present study investigated the contribution of self-reported emotion regulation difficulties on HRV in a student sample. We expected higher scores on emotion regulation difficulties to be associated with lower vagus-mediated HRV (vmHRV). Sixty-three participants filled out the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and their resting HRV was assessed. In addition, a subsample of participants provided ambulatory 24-h HRV data, in order to ecologically validate the resting data. Correlation analyses indicated that self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation was negatively associated with vmHRV in both resting HRV and 24-h HRV. Specifically, when exploring the contribution of the different facets of emotion dysregulation, the inability to accept negative emotions showed the strongest association with HRV. The results are discussed and need for future research is described.","[{'authorId': '6708093', 'name': 'Endre Visted'}, {'authorId': '1400858442', 'name': 'L.

e98ec5467e4fb7154132ee1e833b347cdefdf85f,"Background Low social support is consistently associated with postpartum depression. Previous studies do not always control for previous mental health and do not consider what type of support (tangible, emotional, informational or positive social interaction) is most important. The objectives are: to examine if low social support contributes to subsequent risk of depressive or anxiety symptoms and to determine which type of support is most important. Methods Data from the All Our Families longitudinal pregnancy cohort were used (n=3057). Outcomes were depressive or anxiety symptoms at 4 months and 1 year postpartum. Exposures were social support during pregnancy and at 4 months postpartum. Log binomial models were used to calculate risk ratios (RRs) and absolute risk differences, controlling for past mental health. Results Low total social support during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.82) and anxiety symptoms (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.93) at 4 months postpartum. Low total social support at 4 months was associated with an increased risk of anxiety symptoms (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.09) at 1 year. Absolute risk differences were largest among women with previous mental health challenges resulting in a number needed to treat of 5 for some outcomes. Emotional/informational support was the most important type of support for postpartum anxiety. Conclusion Group prenatal care, prenatal education and peer support programmes have the potential to improve social support. Prenatal interventions studies are needed to confirm these findings in higher risk groups.","[{'authorId': '145655648', 'name': 'Erin Hetherington'}, {'authorId': '143613324', 'name': 'S.

ea30321a744bd987813674dc82338a12dbd95485,"In neurocognitive research on language, the processing principles of the system at hand are usually assumed to be relatively invariant. However, research on attention, memory, decision-making, and social judgment has shown that mood can substantially modulate how the brain processes information. For example, in a bad mood, people typically have a narrower focus of attention and rely less on heuristics. In the face of such pervasive mood effects elsewhere in the brain, it seems unlikely that language processing would remain untouched. In an EEG experiment, we manipulated the mood of participants just before they read texts that confirmed or disconfirmed verb-based expectations about who would be talked about next (e.g., that “David praised Linda because … ” would continue about Linda, not David), or that respected or violated a syntactic agreement rule (e.g., “The boys turns”). ERPs showed that mood had little effect on syntactic parsing, but did substantially affect referential anticipation: whereas readers anticipated information about a specific person when they were in a good mood, a bad mood completely abolished such anticipation. A behavioral follow-up experiment suggested that a bad mood did not interfere with verb-based expectations per se, but prevented readers from using that information rapidly enough to predict upcoming reference on the fly, as the sentence unfolds. In all, our results reveal that background mood, a rather unobtrusive affective state, selectively changes a crucial aspect of real-time language processing. This observation fits well with other observed interactions between language processing and affect (emotions, preferences, attitudes, mood), and more generally testifies to the importance of studying “cold” cognitive functions in relation to “hot” aspects of the brain.","[{'authorId': '73776184', 'name': 'J.

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions of these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and streamlined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited hgih convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significnatly correlated with both self-reported current usage r = .63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage r = .85, Study 2).

A Continuous Performance Task and a Working Memory Task were used to measure cognitive functions. Sixty-five male participants from the Royal Norwegian Navy participated. HRV was measured during baseline, test conditions and recovery. Participants were randomly assigned into non-threat and threat groups. Based on the median split of the high frequency (HF) spectral power, groups were divided into two additional groups. Overall, the high HRV participants showed superior performance on cognitive tasks independent of non-threat or threat conditions. During threat condition the low HRV group showed improved performance. Thus, individuals with high HRV were more stress tolerant and resilient in the face of environmental changes. The results from the study might have implications with regard to performance in operational settings, but also for other fields of psychological research such as individual differences, anxiety and coping.","[{'authorId': '5691200', 'name': 'A.

Model fit is commonly evaluated using the cutoff values for the fit indices proposed by Hu and Bentler (1999). There is a body of research showing that those cutoff values cannot be generalized. Model fit does not only depend on the severity of misspecification, but also on nuisance parameters, which are independent of the misspecification. Using a simulation study, we demonstrate their influence on measures of model fit. We specified a severe misspecification, omitting a second factor, which signifies factorial invalidity. Measures of model fit showed only small misfit because nuisance parameters, magnitude of factor loadings and a balanced/imbalanced number of indicators per factor, also influenced the degree of misfit. Drawing from our results, we discuss challenges in the assessment of factorial validity.","[{'authorId': '103884440', 'name': 'Esther T. Beierl'}, {'authorId': '48800799', 'name': 'M.

The evolution shows how the numbers of students who combine work and study has increased, especially among those whose parents have little education. Furthermore, this means that lower marks are obtained and that there is a greater degree of inequality in labour market insertion, depending on the educational background of the family of origin.

eb5583763621788b6a1c8dfe25091dc20a21e4b1,"Background A World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.","[{'authorId': '46691130', 'name': 'B.

eb56d9202cc28dbfd03db82dfdaef47f3a0a8b3a,"BACKGROUND
Infants born preterm are at increased risk of developing cognitive and motor impairment compared with infants born at term. Early developmental interventions have been provided in the clinical setting with the aim of improving overall functional outcomes for these infants. Long-term benefits of these programmes remain unclear.


OBJECTIVES
Primary objective To compare the effectiveness of early developmental intervention programmes provided post hospital discharge to prevent motor or cognitive impairment in preterm (< 37 weeks) infants versus standard medical follow-up of preterm infants at infancy (zero to < three years), preschool age (three to < five years), school age (five to < 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Secondary objectives To perform subgroup analyses to determine the following.• Effects of gestational age, birth weight and brain injury (periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)/intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)) on cognitive and motor outcomes when early intervention is compared with standard follow-up. ∘ Gestational age: < 28 weeks, 28 to < 32 weeks, 32 to < 37 weeks. ∘ Birth weight: < 1000 grams, 1000 to < 1500 grams, 1500 to < 2500 grams. ∘ Brain injury: absence or presence of grade III or grade IV IVH or cystic PVL (or both) or an abnormal ultrasound/magnetic resonance image (MRI) before initiation of the intervention.• Effects of interventions started during inpatient stay with a post-discharge component versus standard follow-up care.• Effects of interventions focused on the parent-infant relationship, infant development or both compared with standard follow-up care.To perform sensitivity analysis to identify the following.• Effects on motor and cognitive impairment when early developmental interventions are provided within high-quality randomised trials with low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome measures and selective reporting bias.


SEARCH METHODS
The search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to identify randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental interventions provided post hospital discharge. Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Advanced, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and EMBASE (1966 to August 2015).


SELECTION CRITERIA
Studies included had to be randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental intervention programmes that began within the first 12 months of life for infants born before 37 weeks' gestational age. Interventions could commence on an inpatient basis but had to include a post-discharge component for inclusion in this review. Outcome measures were not prespecified, other than that they had to assess cognitive outcomes, motor outcomes or both. Rates of cerebral palsy were documented.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two independent review authors extracted and entered data. Cognitive and motor outcomes were pooled by four age groups: infancy (zero to < three years), preschool age (three to < five years), school age (five to < 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Meta-analysis using RevMan 5.1 was carried out to determine the effects of early developmental interventions at each age range. Subgroup analyses focused on gestational age, birth weight, brain injury, commencement of the intervention, focus of the intervention and study quality.


MAIN RESULTS
Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (3615 randomly assigned participants). Only 12 of these studies were randomised controlled trials with appropriate allocation concealment. Variability was evident with regard to focus and intensity of the intervention, participant characteristics and length of follow-up. Meta-analysis led to the conclusion that intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infancy (developmental quotient (DQ): standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32 standard deviations (SDs), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.47; P value < 0.001; 16 studies; 2372 participants) and at preschool age (intelligence quotient (IQ); SMD 0.43 SDs, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.54; P value < 0.001; eight studies; 1436 participants). However, this effect was not sustained at school age (IQ: SMD 0.18 SDs, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.43; P value = 0.17; five studies; 1372 participants). Heterogeneity between studies for cognitive outcomes at infancy and at school age was significant. With regards to motor outcomes, meta-analysis of 12 studies showed a significant effect in favour of early developmental interventions at infancy only; however, this effect was small (motor scale DQ: SMD 0.10 SDs, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.19; P value = 0.03; 12 studies; 1895 participants). No effect was noted on the rate of cerebral palsy among survivors (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.27; seven studies; 985 participants). Little evidence showed a positive effect on motor outcomes in the long term, but only five included studies reported outcomes at preschool age (n = 3) or at school age (n = 2).


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with cognitive benefits persisting into preschool age. A great deal of heterogeneity between studies was due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes tested and to gestational ages of included preterm infants; thus, comparisons of intervention programmes were limited. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are most effective in improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and to discern the longer-term effects of these programmes.","[{'authorId': '1897445', 'name': 'A.

The present study was conducted to investigate the mediating role of emotional regulation in the relationship between spiritual health with quality of life, psychological health, and burnout. Method : In this study, 231 staff from Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences completed Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The gathered data were analyzed using Pearson correlation, Hierarchical Regression analysis, and Sobel’s test. Results: All variables were correlated with one another (p<0.001). The hierarchical regression analysis and Sobel’s test indicated that the emotional regulation have a relative mediating role in the relationship between spiritual health and quality of life (ß=0.53, Z=4.05, p<0.001) and a complete mediating role in the relationship between spiritual health with mental health (ß=0.68, Z=5.62, p<0.001) and burnout (ß=0.70, Z=6.12, p<0.001). Conclusion: There is a complex and non-linear relationship between spiritual health and the areas of quality of life, mental health and burnout.

eb91fc875d5f5934516dedf72ff24fb099cb57fb,"Abstract Self-compassion refers to having an accepting and caring orientation towards oneself. Although self-compassion has been studied primarily in healthy populations, one particularly compelling clinical context in which to examine self-compassion is social anxiety disorder (SAD). SAD is characterized by high levels of negative self-criticism as well as an abiding concern about others’ evaluation of one's performance. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that: (1) people with SAD would demonstrate less self-compassion than healthy controls (HCs), (2) self-compassion would relate to severity of social anxiety and fear of evaluation among people with SAD, and (3) age would be negatively correlated with self-compassion for people with SAD, but not for HC. As expected, people with SAD reported less self-compassion than HCs on the Self-Compassion Scale and its subscales. Within the SAD group, lesser self-compassion was not generally associated with severity of social anxiety, but it was associated with greater fear of both negative and positive evaluation. Age was negatively correlated with self-compassion for people with SAD, whereas age was positively correlated with self-compassion for HC. These findings suggest that self-compassion may be a particularly important target for assessment and treatment in persons with SAD.","[{'authorId': '4534592', 'name': 'K.

The recent literature on emotion regulation (ER), however, highlights that humans typically make efforts to control emotion experiences. This leaves open the possibility that decision effects previously attributed to acute emotion may be a consequence of acute ER strategies such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. In Study 1, we manipulated ER of laboratory-induced fear and disgust, and found that the cognitive reappraisal of these negative emotions promotes risky decisions (reduces risk aversion) in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and is associated with increased performance in the prehunch/hunch period of the Iowa Gambling Task. In Study 2, we found that naturally occurring negative emotions also increase risk aversion in Balloon Analogue Risk Task, but the incidental use of cognitive reappraisal of emotions impedes this effect.

This article first reviews 2 classes of formulas for effect sizes associated with classical repeated-measures designs that use the standard deviation of either change scores or raw scores for the denominator. It then broadens the scope to subsume GMA and demonstrates that the independent groups, within-subjects, pretest-posttest control-group, and GMA designs all estimate the same effect size when the standard deviation of raw scores is uniformly used.

Qualitative analyses were conducted based on videotaped observations of groups across a series of three mathematics tasks. Variation in the quality of social regulation as a function of group processes (positive and negative socioemotional interactions, collaborative and non-collaborative interactions) was also considered. Findings suggested that the synergy among the social regulatory processes of planning, monitoring, and behavioral engagement was important for differentiating quality variation between groups. Positive socioemotional interactions and collaboration also appeared to facilitate higher quality social regulation. Implications for comprehensively supporting high quality social regulation, alongside positive socioemotional interactions and collaboration, in small group contexts are discussed.","[{'authorId': '2831367', 'name': 'Toni Kempler Rogat'}, {'authorId': '1403711756', 'name': 'Lisa Linnenbrink-Garcia'}]",251.0,,44.0,Socially Shared Regulation in Collaborative Groups: An Analysis of the Interplay Between Quality of Social Regulation and Group Processes,2011.0

Comorbidities may complicate the clinical management of asthma, increasing the risk for exacerbation and even death. The objective of the present research was to establish the prevalence of 31 asthma comorbidities and to assess the association of these comorbidities with physical activity (PA) in Spanish asthmatics. Data of the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 (cross-sectional design) were used in this study. A total of 1014 people (42.1% males) with asthma participated in this study (age range 15–69 years). The IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) short form was the instrument administered to evaluate PA (exposure), and the self-reported answer to the question “Have you ever been diagnosed with…?” determined the presence of comorbidities (outcomes). This association was assessed by multivariable logistic regression. Results demonstrated a huge presence of comorbidities (89.3%). The most prevalent were chronic allergy (61.1%), chronic lumbar pain (28.7%), chronic cervical pain (24.2%), high cholesterol (20.9%), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (19.4%), migraine (19.2%) and hypertension (19.3%). PA level under 600 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)·min/week showed a significant association with urinary incontinence (3.10 [1.62–5.94]), osteoporosis (1.90 [1.00–3.61]) and chronic anxiety (1.69 [1.13–2.53]). Therefore, comorbidities and PA levels should be considered in the prevention and treatment of asthmatics, in order to improve their quality of life.","[{'authorId': '1403591266', 'name': 'Sheila Sánchez Castillo'}, {'authorId': '145007088', 'name': 'Lee Smith'}, {'authorId': '4299389', 'name': 'Arturo Díaz Suárez'}, {'authorId': '7421730', 'name': 'G.

Compared with younger adults, older adults react less to negative situations, ignore irrelevant negative stimuli better, and remember relatively more positive than negative information. Older adults’ ability to insulate their thoughts and emotional reactions from negative situations is likely due to a number of factors, such as being less influenced by interoceptive cues, selecting different emotion regulation strategies, having less age‐related decline in prefrontal regions associated with emotional control than in other prefrontal regions, and engaging in emotion regulation strategies as a default mode in their everyday lives. Healthy older adults’ avoidance of processing negative stimuli may contribute to their well‐maintained emotional well‐being. However, when cardiovascular disease leads to additional prefrontal white matter damage, older adults have fewer cognitive control mechanisms available to regulate their emotions, making them more vulnerable to depression. In general, although age‐related changes in the brain help shape emotional experience, shifts in preferred strategies and goal priorities are also important influences.","[{'authorId': '2145954', 'name': 'M.

Overall, both level of depression and level of relational spirituality were higher in girls as compared with boys. Regression analyses conducted independently for boys and girls revealed that daily spiritual experiences, forgiveness, and religious coping were associated with less-depressive symptomatology exclusively in girls.

Although various mechanisms have been suggested to understand these processes, empirical evidence for these mechanisms is scarce within the JD-R framework. This study examines the role of basic need satisfaction, as defined within Self-Determination Theory, in the relationships between job demands, job resources, and employees’ exhaustion and vigour, the main components of burnout and engagement, respectively. Structural equation modelling in a heterogeneous sample of 745 employees of the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium confirmed that satisfaction of basic psychological needs partially explained the relationships from job demands to exhaustion and from job resources to vigour. It fully accounted for the relationship between job resources and exhaustion. We conclude that the current study adds to the research pointing at need satisfaction as a promising underlying mechanism for employees’ thriving at work.","[{'authorId': '50987626', 'name': 'A. van den Broeck'}, {'authorId': '49651843', 'name': 'M.

To address this issue in an evidence-based manner, worksite stress management programs must be able to engage individuals as well as capture data on stress, health indices, work productivity, and health care costs. In this randomized controlled pilot, our primary objective was to evaluate the viability and proof of concept for two mind-body workplace stress reduction programs (one therapeutic yoga-based and the other mindfulness-based), in order to set the stage for larger cost-effectiveness trials. A second objective was to evaluate 2 delivery venues of the mindfulness-based intervention (online vs. in-person). Intention-to-treat principles and 2 (pre and post) × 3 (group) repeated-measures analysis of covariance procedures examined group differences over time on perceived stress and secondary measures to clarify which variables to include in future studies: sleep quality, mood, pain levels, work productivity, mindfulness, blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate variability (a measure of autonomic balance). Two hundred and thirty-nine employee volunteers were randomized into a therapeutic yoga worksite stress reduction program, 1 of 2 mindfulness-based programs, or a control group that participated only in assessment. Compared with the control group, the mind-body interventions showed significantly greater improvements on perceived stress, sleep quality, and the heart rhythm coherence ratio of heart rate variability. The two delivery venues for the mindfulness program produced basically equivalent results. Both the mindfulness-based and therapeutic yoga programs may provide viable and effective interventions to target high stress levels, sleep quality, and autonomic balance in employees.","[{'authorId': '4594082', 'name': 'R.

In contrast to drive models of anxiety but consistent with social learning theory, it is argued that the cognitive state of the individual mediates both affective arousal and behavior.

The interaction between a customer and the customer care representative contributes substantially to the overall customer experience. Thus it is imperative for customer care agents and chatbots engaging with humans to be personal, cordial and emphatic to ensure customer satisfaction and retention. Our system aims at automatically transforming neutral customer care responses into courteous replies. Along with stylistic transfer (of courtesy), our system ensures that responses are coherent with the conversation history, and generates courteous expressions consistent with the emotional state of the customer. Our technique is based on a reinforced pointer-generator model for the sequence to sequence task. The model is also conditioned on a hierarchically encoded and emotionally aware conversational context. We use real interactions on Twitter between customer care professionals and aggrieved customers to create a large conversational dataset having both forms of agent responses: ‘generic’ and ‘courteous’. We perform quantitative and qualitative analyses on established and task-specific metrics, both automatic and human evaluation based. Our evaluation shows that the proposed models can generate emotionally-appropriate courteous expressions while preserving the content. Experimental results also prove that our proposed approach performs better than the baseline models.","[{'authorId': '51941280', 'name': 'Hitesh Golchha'}, {'authorId': '40195882', 'name': 'Mauajama Firdaus'}, {'authorId': '1734904', 'name': 'Asif Ekbal'}, {'authorId': '145532184', 'name': 'P.

Two forms of motivation were studied: autonomous motivation, in which employees act with volition,; and controlled motivation, in which they act under internal or external pressure. Data were collected at two time points nine months apart from a sample of 586 school principals in Quebec, Canada. SEM analysis results support the hypothesized model. Specifically, job resources had a positive effect on autonomous motivation but a negative effect on controlled motivation. In addition, taking into account the cross-lagged effects of job resources on commitment and exhaustion, autonomous motivation had a negative effect on exhaustion but a positive effect on commitment whereas controlled motivation had a positive effect on exhaustion. These results advance the understanding of why work motivation acts on employee functioning and how it can play an active role in both the motivational and energetic processes of the job demands-resources model. Practical implications and further theoretical implications are discussed.","[{'authorId': '4210065', 'name': 'Claude Fernet'}, {'authorId': '3912871', 'name': 'S.

Two studies tested expected relationships between doctors’ emotion regulation (ER) skills and patient satisfaction and quality of doctor–patient interaction, focusing in particular on the role patient perceptions’ of doctors’ emotion regulation skills play in these associations. Study 1 comprised 100 patients reporting on their perceptions of doctors’ overall emotion regulation skills, communication quality and nonverbal immediacy, and their satisfaction with the care provided. Patients’ perceptions of doctors’ emotion regulation skills were associated with patient satisfaction and communication quality; patient perceptions of doctors’ nonverbal immediacy partially mediated these relationships. Study 2 collected data from 30 doctors who reported on their typical emotion regulation strategies of reappraisal and suppression and 139 of their patients who reported on satisfaction with the medical treatment and positive affect. As expected, doctors’ self-reported reappraisal was positively associated with their patients’ satisfaction and positive affect. Doctors’ suppression was also positively associated with patient satisfaction, while patients’ gender moderated these effects.

However, there has been little direct evidence of any association due to the paucity of longitudinal studies reporting mental health before and during the lockdown. This present study provides the first longitudinal examination of changes in childhood mental health, a key component of an urgently needed evidence base that can inform policy and practice surrounding the continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Mental health assessments on 168 children (aged 7.6–11.6 years) were taken before and during the UK lockdown (April–June 2020). Assessments included self-reports, caregiver reports, and teacher reports. Mean mental health scores before and during the UK lockdown were compared using mixed linear models. Results A significant increase in depression symptoms during the UK lockdown was observed, as measured by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) short form. CIs suggest a medium-to-large effect size. There were no significant changes in the RCADS anxiety subscale and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional problems subscale. Conclusions During the UK lockdown, children’s depression symptoms have increased substantially, relative to before lockdown. The scale of this effect has direct relevance for the continuation of different elements of lockdown policy, such as complete or partial school closures. This early evidence for the direct impact of lockdown must now be combined with larger scale epidemiological studies that establish which children are most at risk and tracks their future recovery.","[{'authorId': '48489662', 'name': 'G.

 BACKGROUND
 Psychological distress increases across adolescence and has been associated with several important health outcomes with consequences that can extend into adulthood. One type of technological innovation that may serve as a unique intervention for youth experiencing psychological distress is the conversational agent, otherwise known as a chatbot. Further research is needed on the factors that may make mental health chatbots destined for adolescents more appealing and increase the likelihood that adolescents will use them.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 The aim of this study was to assess adolescents’ emotional reactions and likelihood of responding to questions that could be posed by a mental health chatbot. Understanding adolescent preferences and factors that could increase adolescents’ likelihood of responding to chatbot questions could assist in future mental health chatbot design destined for youth.
 
 
 METHODS
 We recruited 19 adolescents aged 14 to 17 years to participate in a study with a 2×2×3 within-subjects factorial design. Each participant was sequentially presented with 96 chatbot questions for a duration of 8 seconds per question. Following each presentation, participants were asked to indicate how likely they were to respond to the question, as well as their perceived affective reaction to the question. Demographic data were collected, and an informal debriefing was conducted with each participant.
 
 
 RESULTS
 Participants were an average of 15.3 years old (SD 1.00) and mostly female (11/19, 58%). Logistic regressions showed that the presence of GIFs predicted perceived emotional valence (β=–.40, P<.001), such that questions without GIFs were associated with a negative perceived emotional valence. Question type predicted emotional valence, such that yes/no questions (β=–.23, P=.03) and open-ended questions (β=–.26, P=.01) were associated with a negative perceived emotional valence compared to multiple response choice questions. Question type also predicted the likelihood of response, such that yes/no questions were associated with a lower likelihood of response compared to multiple response choice questions (β=–.24, P=.03) and a higher likelihood of response compared to open-ended questions (β=.54, P<.001).
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 The findings of this study add to the rapidly growing field of teen-computer interaction and contribute to our understanding of adolescent user experience in their interactions with a mental health chatbot. The insights gained from this study may be of assistance to developers and designers of mental health chatbots.

edc907e215af8ac0a258d3342b0f79c6bd65e3bc,"Childhood obesity has reached epidemic levels in developed as well as in developing countries. Overweight and obesity in childhood are known to have significant impact on both physical and psychological health. Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age. The mechanism of obesity development is not fully understood and it is believed to be a disorder with multiple causes. Environmental factors, lifestyle preferences, and cultural environment play pivotal roles in the rising prevalence of obesity worldwide. In general, overweight and obesity are assumed to be the results of an increase in caloric and fat intake. On the other hand, there are supporting evidence that excessive sugar intake by soft drink, increased portion size, and steady decline in physical activity have been playing major roles in the rising rates of obesity all around the world. Childhood obesity can profoundly affect children's physical health, social, and emotional well-being, and self esteem. It is also associated with poor academic performance and a lower quality of life experienced by the child. Many co-morbid conditions like metabolic, cardiovascular, orthopedic, neurological, hepatic, pulmonary, and renal disorders are also seen in association with childhood obesity.","[{'authorId': '39472251', 'name': 'K.

Also, independent of their life situations, individuals with higher emotional intelligence tend to feel higher life satisfaction. It remains unclear, however, the question of whether personal experiences and personality traits interact. This paper, therefore, examines the hypotheses that: 1) Life satisfaction is predicted by the satisfaction experienced in specific domains such as: job, social environment, and self, and by emotional intelligence. 2) Emotional intelligence moderates the relation between the satisfaction experienced in those three context-specific areas and the general satisfaction with life. To test these hypotheses, we surveyed 2,233 adults and university post-graduate students participanting in various courses in Cataluna and Aragon. Regression analysis showed that the three context-specific dimensions of satisfaction and emotional intelligence explain 54% of life satisfaction. Emotional intelligence moderated the relation between satisfaction with self and life satisfaction, and between satisfaction with the social environment and life satisfaction","[{'authorId': '2090955283', 'name': 'N.

Work overload and continuous exposure to positive COVID-19 cases have caused them fatigue, stress, anxiety, insomnia and other detriments. This research aims: 1) to analyze whether the use of cognitive reevaluation and emotional suppression strategies decreases and increases, respectively, stress levels of health personnel, 2) to quantify the impact of contact with patients with COVID-19 on stress s level of medical staff. Method. Emotion regulation strategies and stress level were evaluated in 155 Dominican physicians by means of psychological tests with adequate levels of reliability. In addition, a questionnaire created by the researchers quantified the impact that contact with those infected had on their stress levels. Results. Contact with patients with COVID-19 predicts increased use of emotion suppression strategies, although is not associated with the use of cognitive reevaluation. These findings lead to an even greater increase in stress on health care providers. Conclusions. Contextual contingencies demand immediate responses and may not allow health personnel to use cognitive re-evaluation strategies, leaning more towards emotion suppression. However, findings regarding high levels of stress require the implementation of intervention programs focused on the promotion of more functional emotion regulation strategies. Such programs may reduce current stress and prevent post-traumatic symptoms.","[{'authorId': '2099546320', 'name': 'Zoilo Emilio García-Batista'}, {'authorId': '1403476653', 'name': 'Kiero Guerra-Peña'}, {'authorId': '2139334059', 'name': 'Vahid Nouri Kandany'}, {'authorId': '2126763732', 'name': 'María Isabel Marte'}, {'authorId': '144367155', 'name': 'L.

To address some investigative questions in plastic surgery, randomized controlled trials are not always indicated or ethical to conduct. Instead, observational studies may be the next best method of addressing these types of questions. Well-designed observational studies have been shown to provide results similar to those of randomized controlled trials, challenging the belief that observational studies are second rate. Cohort studies and case-control studies are two primary types of observational studies that aid in evaluating associations between diseases and exposures. In this review article, the authors describe these study designs and methodologic issues, and provide examples from the plastic surgery literature.","[{'authorId': '102906965', 'name': 'Jae-Wook Song'}, {'authorId': '145070103', 'name': 'K.

ee6052b15d8435bad7584deec2374a4f63e3598a,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to report the safety, tolerability, and serum micronutrient concentrations and their correlations with mood changes from an 8 week pilot feasibility study of a 36 ingredient multinutrient supplement, EMPowerplus (EMP+), for pediatric bipolar spectrum disorders (BPSD).


METHODS
Ten children ages 6-12 received EMP+ escalating from one to four capsules t.i.d., with four children increased to the maximum suggested dose, five capsules t.i.d. Outcome measures were micronutrient concentrations in serum and red blood cells, vital signs, body mass index (BMI), dietary intake (Food Frequency Questionnaire and 24 hour dietary recall interview), and mood and global functioning ratings.


RESULTS
Seven children (70%) completed the study. Three (30%) terminated early for tolerability and compliance issues. Adverse effects were mild and transient, and chiefly consisted of initial insomnia or gastrointestinal (GI) upset. No differences occurred in BMI (p = 0.310) or waist-hip ratio (WHR; p = 0.674) pre- to postsupplementation. Four of the tested serum vitamin concentrations increased from pre- to postsupplementation: vitamin A-retinol, vitamin B6, vitamin E-α-tocopherol; and folate (all p<0.05). The increase in serum 25-OH vitamin D approached significance (p = 0.063). No differences were found in dietary intake pre- to postsupplementation, suggesting that blood nutrient level increases were caused by EMP+.


CONCLUSIONS
In this open prospective study, short-term use of EMP+ in children with BPSD appeared safe and well-tolerated, with a side effect profile preferable to first-line psychotropic drugs for pediatric bipolar spectrum disorders. A double-blind, randomized clinical trial is feasible, appears safe, and is warranted by open-label clinical outcomes and plausible mechanisms of action, combined with documentation of increased serum concentrations of specific micronutrients.","[{'authorId': '31873330', 'name': 'Elisabeth A.

The older subjects studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were, that is, they showed perfect recall. The younger children studied for a while, said they were ready, and usually were not. In another study, elementary school children were asked to help the experimenter evaluate the communicative adequacy of verbal instructions, indicating any omissions and obscurities (Markman, 1977). Although the instructions were riddled with blatant omissions and obscurities, the younger subjects were surprisingly poor at detecting them. They incorrectly thought they had understood and could follow the instructions, much as their counterparts in the study by Flavell et al. (1970) incorrectly thought they had memorized and could recall the items. Results such as these have suggested that young children are quite limited in their knowledge and cognition about cognitive phenomena, or in their metacognition, and do relatively little monitoring of their own memory, comprehension, and other cognitive enterprises (see, e.g., Brown, 1978; Flavell, 1978; Flavell & Wellman, 1977; Kreutzer, Leonard, & Flavell, 1975; Flavell, Note 1, Note 2, Note 3; Markman, Note 4). Investigators have recently concluded that metacognition plays an important role in oral communication of information, oral persuasion, oral comprehension, reading comprehension, writing, language acquisition, attention, memory, problem solving, social cognition, and, various types of self-control and self-instruction; there are also clear indications that ideas about metacognition are beginning to make contact with similar ideas in the areas of social learning theory, cognitive behavior modification, personalty development, and education (Flavell, Note 1, Note 2, Note 3).

However, trust has been positioned in justice theorizing in 2 different ways, either as an indicator of the depth of an exchange relationship or as a variable that reflects levels of work-related uncertainty. Moreover, trust scholars distinguish between multiple forms of trust, including affect- and cognition-based trust, and it remains unclear which form is most relevant to justice effects. To explore these issues, we built and tested a more comprehensive model of trust mediation in which procedural, interpersonal, and distributive justice predicted affect- and cognition-based trust, with those trust forms predicting both exchange- and uncertainty-based mechanisms. The results of a field study in a hospital system revealed that the trust variables did indeed mediate the relationships between the organizational justice dimensions and job performance, with affect-based trust driving exchange-based mediation and cognition-based trust driving uncertainty-based mediation.","[{'authorId': '6099791', 'name': 'J.

eeb1053b7d0f408b4a19dcf504eef8c9d29e5333,"Background A history of falls or imbalance may lead to a fear of falling, which may lead to self-imposed avoidance of activity; this avoidance may stimulate a vicious cycle of deconditioning and subsequent falls. Objective The purpose of this study was to develop a questionnaire that would quantify avoidance behavior due to a fear of falling. Design This study consisted of 2 parts: questionnaire development and psychometric testing. Questionnaire development involved an expert panel and 39 residents of an assisted living facility. Sixty-three community-dwelling individuals with various health conditions participated in psychometric testing. Method Questionnaire development included the evaluation of face and content validity and factor analysis of the initial questionnaire. The final result of questionnaire development was the Fear of Falling Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire (FFABQ). In order to determine its psychometric properties, reliability and construct validity were assessed through administration of the FFABQ to participants twice, 1 week apart, and comparison of the FFABQ with other questionnaires related to fear of falling, functional measures of balance and mobility, and daily activity levels using an activity monitor. Results The FFABQ had good overall test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=.812) and was found to differentiate between participants who were considered “fallers” (ie, at least one fall in the previous year) and those who were considered “nonfallers.” The FFABQ predicted time spent sitting or lying and endurance. Limitations A relatively small number of people with a fear of falling were willing to participate. Conclusion Results from this study offer evidence for the reliability and validity of the FFABQ and support the notion that the FFABQ measures avoidance behavior rather than balance confidence, self-efficacy, or fear.","[{'authorId': '36664956', 'name': 'C.

Therefore, success in life depends not only on intellectual abilities, but also on emotion regulation competence. Emotion regulation is of greater importance in professions with high levels of daily occupational stress such as nursing. The aim of this study was to determine cognitive emotion regulation strategies used by a group of Iranian critical care nurses. Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 193 critical care nurses. They were recruited through stratified random sampling from ICU, CCU, and Hemodialysis center and Emergency departments of six hospitals under supervision of Qazvin university of medical science, qazvin, Iran,. The 36-item Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was used for data gathering.

However, most of the research on body motion has relied on exaggerated displays of emotions. In this paper we present two experiments where we investigated whether emotional body expressions could be recognized when they were recorded during natural narration. Our actors were free to use their entire body, face, and voice to express emotions, but our resulting visual stimuli used only the upper body motion trajectories in the form of animated stick figures. Observers were asked to perform an emotion recognition task on short motion sequences using a large and balanced set of emotions (amusement, joy, pride, relief, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, shame, and neutral). Even with only upper body motion available, our results show recognition accuracy significantly above chance level and high consistency rates among observers. In our first experiment, that used more classic emotion induction setup, all emotions were well recognized. In the second study that employed narrations, four basic emotion categories (joy, anger, fear, and sadness), three non-basic emotion categories (amusement, pride, and shame) and the “neutral” category were recognized above chance. Interestingly, especially in the second experiment, observers showed a bias toward anger when recognizing the motion sequences for emotions. We discovered that similarities between motion sequences across the emotions along such properties as mean motion speed, number of peaks in the motion trajectory and mean motion span can explain a large percent of the variation in observers' responses. Overall, our results show that upper body motion is informative for emotion recognition in narrative scenarios.","[{'authorId': '39888810', 'name': 'Ekaterina P.

Specifically, the Still-Face Paradigm (Tronick, Als, Adamson, Wise, ' Brazelton, 1978) was used as a stress induction paradigm to assess both mother-infant interaction and infant self-regulation. In addition to the mothers' interactive style, the effect of mothers' drinking during and after pregnancy on the infant was explored. Participants were 76 six-month-old infants and their mothers. Infant affect and maternal interaction style was coded second-by-second for the 6 min of the Still-Face Paradigm. Results indicated that infants whose mothers made fewer attempts at engaging them during the play portion of the still-face (e.g., either watched their infant or paid minimal attention to their infant) showed greater negative affect in contrast to infants whose mothers played in an interactive manner. A gender effect was found among female infants. That is, female infants whose mothers drank more during pregnancy showed greater negative affect. The study demonstrates the possibility of early identification of negativity in infants with prenatal alcohol exposure. The impact of mother-child relationship on emotional regulation of infants prenatally alcohol exposed may be a target of future intervention and further study.","[{'authorId': '145188979', 'name': 'J.

There has been controversy over the past three decades about whether this slowing is generalized or process-specific. A growing literature indicates that it is process-specific and suggests it is most dramatic at the interface where a stimulus input is translated into a response output. We tested this hypothesis using a task in which young and older adult males made either compatible or incompatible responses to the word LEFT or RIGHT shown briefly and variously located in a 4 row × 6 column matrix surrounded by # signs or by letters chosen randomly from the sets A-G or A-Z. Processing speed was measured using P300 latency and reaction time. Experimental effects on these two measures provided support for the hypothesis in revealing that stimulus identification processes were preserved, whereas processes related to translating a stimulus input into a designated response output and then selecting that response were compromised in the elderly.","[{'authorId': '2519560', 'name': 'T.

There were two main findings. First, fathers' playfulness in toddlerhood was associated with children's vocabulary skills in prekindergarten whereas mothers' playfulness was related to children's emotion regulation. Cross-parental effects were found only for mothers. The association between mothers' playfulness and children's vocabulary and emotion regulation was strengthened when fathers engaged in more pretend play and when children were affectively positive during the play. These findings show that playfulness is an important source of variation in the vocabulary and emotion regulation of children growing up in low-income families.

The question of whether infants’ emotional expressions communicate discrete negative emotions has been widely debated in the literature on infant emotional development, but it has rarely been discussed in the parental sensitivity literature. This article explores how insights from the parental sensitivity literature and from evolutionary and dynamical systems perspectives on infant emotion expressions can be brought together to enhance our understanding of parental responsiveness to infant distress. The current research concludes that sensitivity does not rely on reading discrete negative emotions in infant signals, but rather on an integration of complex, graded distress expressions with contextual factors and iterative interaction processes.","[{'authorId': '4967538', 'name': 'J.

ef5d679a0ac19e9179e7aafe6dfd381b9cae0cf1,"Background Shift-working nurses are exposed to a stressful work environment, which puts them at an increased risk for burnout and depression. We explored the effect of environmental stress on serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) promoter methylation among nurses from high and low work stress environments. Methodology Using bisulfite sequencing, we investigated the methylation status of five CpG residues of a CpG-rich region in the promoter of SLC6A4 by comparing female shift working nurses from a high work stress environment (n = 24) to low work stress environment (n = 25). We also analyzed the association of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism at 5′ end of SLC6A4. Work stress was assessed by the Karasek’s Model and possible signs of burnout or depression were measured by the Maslach Burnout Index General Survey and Beck Depression Index. Methylation levels were assessed by bisulfite sequencing of DNA extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes. Restriction enzyme treatment followed by standard PCR was used to identify 5-HTTLPR genotypes. Principal Findings We found that nurses in the high stress environment had significantly lower promoter methylation levels at all five CpG residues compared to nurses in the low stress environment (p<0.01). There was no significant interaction of 5-HTTLPR genotype and work stress with methylation (p = 0.58). In unadjusted (bivariate) analysis, burnout was not significantly associated to methylation levels. However, when mutually adjusted for both, burnout and work stress were significant contributors (p = 0.038 and p<0.0001 respectively) to methylation levels. Conclusions Our findings show that environmental stress is concurrent with decreased methylation of the SLC6A4 promoter. This may lead to increased transcriptional activity of the gene, increased reuptake of serotonin from synaptic clefts, and termination of the activity of serotonin. This could present a possible coping mechanism for environmental stress in humans that could eventually increase risk for disturbed functional capability and experience of depressed mood in long-term stress.","[{'authorId': '5554418', 'name': 'J.

f03c01ed0ec002b81b4882b17d435cedbe0a0f7e,"Awareness of the emotion of those who communicate with others is a fundamental challenge in building affective intelligent systems. Emotion is a complex state of the mind influenced by external events, physiological changes, or relationships with others. Because emotions can represent a user's internal context or intention, researchers suggested various methods to measure the user's emotions from analysis of physiological signals, facial expressions, or voice. However, existing methods have practical limitations to be used with consumer devices, such as smartphones; they may cause inconvenience to users and require special equipment such as a skin conductance sensor. Our approach is to recognize emotions of the user by inconspicuously collecting and analyzing user-generated data from different types of sensors on the smartphone. To achieve this, we adopted a machine learning approach to gather, analyze and classify device usage patterns, and developed a social network service client for Android smartphones which unobtrusively find various behavioral patterns and the current context of users. Also, we conducted a pilot study to gather real-world data which imply various behaviors and situations of a participant in her/his everyday life. From these data, we extracted 10 features and applied them to build a Bayesian Network classifier for emotion recognition. Experimental results show that our system can classify user emotions into 7 classes such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, sadness, fear, and neutral with a surprisingly high accuracy. The proposed system applied to a smartphone demonstrated the feasibility of an unobtrusive emotion recognition approach and a user scenario for emotion-oriented social communication between users.","[{'authorId': '2176177', 'name': 'Hosub Lee'}, {'authorId': '2555850', 'name': 'Youngsang Choi'}, {'authorId': '3077590', 'name': 'Sunjae Lee'}, {'authorId': '123733635', 'name': 'I.

Serial in‐depth interviews were then conducted with representative respondents from each archetype (N = 18) to trace developmental trajectories and investigate how these profiles manifested phenomenologically in teachers’ motivated thought and instructional practices. Results indicate that teacher immunity is associated with practitioners’ psychological, emotional, and cognitive functioning in the social setting of the L2 classroom. These findings contribute to the field's understanding of how language teachers sustain their adaptivity, openness to change, psychological well‐being, and their sense of purpose and investment in students’ learning.

The purpose of this paper is to integrate broaden theoretical perspectives in the investigation of the key antecedents of consumers’ continuous review contribution behavior on restaurant guide online opinion platforms (OOPs). Integrating both rational and relational theoretical perspectives with an extension of the investment model, a research model was proposed to explain what factors influence consumers’ intention to continuously contribute electronic WOM (eWOM) on OOPs. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
The research model was empirically tested with an online survey study of 438 eWOM contributors from a leading Chinese restaurant guide OOP, Dianping.com. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The results indicated that satisfaction, affective commitment, and continuance commitment were key determinants of consumers’ continuance intention to contribute eWOM on the platform. Satisfaction was driven by concern for other consumers, social benefits, platform assistance, and venting negative feelings. Quality of alternatives and investment size significantly affected continuance commitment.

f0d316fa76d4121cb55fb098c2ee0a5299ceb7fc,"CONTEXT
Burnout, a psychological state of mental weariness that occurs when work stresses become overwhelming, has frequently been documented in athletic trainers and has been hypothesized to affect professional retention. Experiences of burnout may be influenced by individual-level factors such as gender or personality, though few researchers have investigated such interactions in athletic trainers.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the relationship between personalities, as measured by the Big Five Personality Inventory, and burnout.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.


SETTING
Online Web-based survey.


PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS
A total of 189 athletic trainers working in the collegiate setting, 65 men (34.4%) and 124 women (65.6%), with an average of 5 ± 3 years certified and 2.5 ± 2 years working in their current position.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Data were collected using a Web-based survey instrument consisting of 3 sections: (1) demographics, (2) burnout survey, and (3) Big Five Personality Inventory. Likert responses for the burnout score were summed. Independent t tests, Pearson correlations, and multiple regressions were calculated to evaluate the relationships between demographics and burnout and between burnout and personality.


RESULTS
This group of athletic trainers experienced moderate burnout, regardless of gender. A weak negative correlation was present between burnout score and both agreeableness and extraversion. A weak positive correlation existed between burnout and neuroticism. These variables did not predict burnout scores; only neuroticism added significantly to the weak predictive value. Personality explained only 17.3% of the variability in burnout scores.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study confirms the findings of previous researchers highlighting moderate burnout in athletic trainers employed in the collegiate setting. We did not find that personality significantly predicted burnout, though it did account for a small amount of the variance in burnout scores. Thus, organizational-level factors may play a greater role in determining burnout in athletic trainers than individual-level factors such as personality.","[{'authorId': '6116076', 'name': 'Jessica L.

This study compared PA—i.e., daily occupation, transportation to and from daily occupation, leisure time activities, and regular sporting activities—prior (PRE) and during (POST) the on-going COVID-19 outbreak in the Greece lockdown environment. A Greek version of the web-based Active-Q questionnaire was used to access PA. The questionnaire was filled out twice (once each for the PRE and POST conditions) by 8495 participants (age = 37.2 ± 0.2 years (95% confidence interval (CI), 36.9–37.5); males = 38.3% (95%CI, 36.7–40.0); females = 61.7% (95%CI, 60.4–63.0). The relative frequency of overall sporting activities, which, prior to lockdown, occurred at least once per month, and overall participation in competitive sports was significantly reduced (8.6% (95%CI, 7.9–9.3) and 84.7% (95%CI, 82.9–86.6) respectively). With the exception of overall leisure time activities, which were significantly increased in the POST condition, daily occupational, transportation, and sporting activities significant reduced (p < 0.05). Overall PA was reduced in all genders, age, body mass index (BMI) and PA level subgroups in the POST condition, and an interaction between the males and High PA subgroups was observed. The change in overall PA (from PRE to POST conditions) was −16.3% (95%CI, −17.3 to −15.4), while in daily occupational, transportation, and sporting activities, it was −52.9% (95%CI, −54.8–51.0), −41.1% (95%CI, −42.8–39.5) and −23.9% (95%CI, −25.1–22.8), respectively.

Exercise may help to cope with hectic or demanding events after a stressful situation occurs. Limited research has evaluated whether exercise, prior to a stressor, helps to facilitate subsequent emotional regulation. This pilot study addresses this novel paradigm. We employed a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of acute exercise on emotional regulation.


METHODS
Participants were randomly assigned to stretch (control group, N = 10), walk (N = 9), or jog (N = 8) for 15-minutes, after which they were exposed to a film clip intended to elicit a negative emotional response. Participants' emotions were monitored before and during exercise, as well as after the film clip. Emotional responses were evaluated using the Exercise Induced Feeling Inventory and Affective Circumplex Scale.


RESULTS
A group x time splitplot interaction effect was significant for anger (p = .046) and anxiousness (p = .038). Follow-up analyses showed that only the stretching group (p = .048) had a significantly increased anger score from baseline to post-film clip, suggesting a protective emotional effect from walking and jogging.


CONCLUSIONS
Exercise was effective in regulating anger and anxiousness after a stressful event. These findings provide evidence for potential preventive effects of exercise in facilitating emotional regulation.","[{'authorId': '35204266', 'name': 'Meghan K.

Method: The Raine Study is a prospective study following 2,868 live births. At the 14-year follow-up, the authors collected detailed adolescent dietary data, allowing for the determination of major dietary patterns using factor analysis. ADHD diagnoses were recorded according to International Classification of Deiseases, 9th Revision coding conventions. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between scores for major dietary pattern and ADHD diagnoses. Results: Data were available for 1,799 adolescents, and a total of 115 adolescents had an ADHD diagnosis.

Based on the job demands-resources model, this study examines the mediating effects of teachers’ self-monitoring and self-efficacy on the relationships between the emotional job demands of teaching and trust in colleagues and teacher well-being. A questionnaire was administered to 1115 primary school teachers in Hong Kong. The results highlight the maladaptive role of self-monitoring as a personal demand and the adaptive role of self-efficacy as a personal resource: self-monitoring is positively related to anxiety and depression; self-efficacy is positively related to enthusiasm and contentment and negatively related to anxiety and depression. The results not only support the beneficial role of trust in colleagues, which is positively associated with teacher self-efficacy and well-being, but also reveal the rewarding side of emotional job demands in enhancing teacher self-efficacy.

f138835b5aa46dce4cffebe6499dadfb0023c779,"Background: Emotional stress regulation (ESR) rapidly develops during the first months of age and includes different behavioral strategies which largely contribute to children’s behavioral and emotional adjustment later in life. The assessment of ESR during the first years of life is critical to identify preschool children who are at developmental risk. Although ESR is generally included in larger temperament batteries [e.g., the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery (Lab-TAB)], there is no standardized observational procedure to specifically assess and measure ESR in preschool aged children. Aim: Here, we describe the development of an observational procedure to assess ESR in preschool aged children [i.e., the Preschooler Regulation of Emotional Stress (PRES) Procedure] and the related coding system. Methods: Four Lab-TAB emotional stress episodes (i.e., the Stranger, the Perfect Circle, the Missing Sticker, and the Transparent Box) have been selected. Independent coders developed a list of ESR codes resulting in two general indexes (i.e., active engagement and stress level) and five specific indexes (i.e., anger, control, fear, inhibition, sadness). Finally, specific actions have been planned to assess the validity and the coding system reliability of PRES procedure. Ethics and Dissemination: The study has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the Scientific Institute IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Bosisio Parini (Italy). The PRES validation and reliability assessment as well as its use with healthy and at-risk populations of preschool children will be object of future scientific publications and international conference presentations.","[{'authorId': '4040954', 'name': 'L.

Prior research analyzing surface acting—employees' regulation of emotional expressions—has mostly focused on the interactions between front-line employees and their customers in service industries and paid very little attention to intra-organizational relationships. With an aim to shed light on this important yet relatively unexplored area, I developed a theoretical model analyzing the antecedents and outcomes of surface acting within organizations, by drawing on the sociometer theory and self-presentation theory frameworks. 
 
 
 
To test the model, I conducted a cross-level field study in a sample of 65 work groups and 478 employees in two organizations, located in a large city in Northern California. I have collected the data from two sources, including employees and their supervisors who rated their performance. Results indicated that employees were more likely to engage in surface acting when their affective traits and personal goals were less congruent with work environment. Surface acting was also positively related to perceived organizational politics and self-monitoring. As for outcomes, surface acting was positively related to emotional exhaustion and negatively to performance. I discuss limitations, implications, and future research direction.

By loosely applying self-thematization theory to collect and analyze data from former teachers, a variety of elements were identified that combined in timing and intensity to influence the decision to leave the profession. These elements are also experienced by teachers who stay. However, in this study, collegial relationships was identified as the mitigating factor regardless of any combination of other factors influencing the decision to leave or stay. Although small-scale convenience sampling was employed, this study allows for an intimate accounting of the relational elements of teaching that exist among educators, which are often overlooked.

In the present account, we propose a new linkage between mindfulness and improved emotion regulation—one that highlights the role played by executive control. Specifically, we suggest that the present-moment awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance that is cultivated by mindfulness training is crucial in promoting executive control because it increases sensitivity to affective cues in the experiential field. This refined attunement and openness to subtle changes in affective states fosters executive control because it improves response to incipient affective cues that help signal the need for control. This, in turn, enhances emotion regulation. In presenting our model, we discuss how new findings in executive control can improve our understanding of how mindfulness increases the capacity for effective emotion regulation.","[{'authorId': '4732534', 'name': 'Rimma Teper'}, {'authorId': '4726670', 'name': 'Z.

However, these assistants are not optimised to simulate key social aspects of human conversational environments. Humans are intellectually biased toward social activity when facing anthropomorphic agents or when presented with subtle social cues. In this paper, we test whether humans respond the same way to assistants in guided tasks, when in different forms of embodiment and social behaviour. In a within-subject study (N=30), we asked subjects to engage in dialogue with a smart speaker and a social robot. We observed shifting of interactive behaviour, as shown in behavioural and subjective measures. Our findings indicate that it is not always favourable for agents to be anthropomorphised or to communicate with nonverbal cues. We found a trade-off between task performance and perceived sociability when controlling for anthropomorphism and social behaviour.","[{'authorId': '2150503', 'name': 'Dimosthenis Kontogiorgos'}, {'authorId': '11845717', 'name': 'André Pereira'}, {'authorId': '2060719046', 'name': 'Olle Andersson'}, {'authorId': '150217283', 'name': 'Marco Koivisto'}, {'authorId': '150093796', 'name': 'Elena Gonzalez Rabal'}, {'authorId': '2067222884', 'name': 'Ville Vartiainen'}, {'authorId': '1941279', 'name': 'Joakim Gustafson'}]",38.0,,58.0,The Effects of Anthropomorphism and Non-verbal Social Behaviour in Virtual Assistants,2019.0

We argue that when employees feel angry, guilty, joyous, or proud at work, those with higher levels of ability-based emotional intelligence will turn to emotion-focused coping as a means to deal with the immediate aftermath of the emotion. This form of coping requires the least amount of cognitive resources and facilitates performance by helping individuals to meet their task demands. Random coefficient modelling findings from daily diary data collected in a law enforcement setting support our proposed ideas concerning the interactive effects of emotions and emotional intelligence on coping, as well as the effects of coping on task performance.

Growing evidence suggests an impact of weight suppression (WS) on severity and course of symptoms in patients with eating disorders (ED), but no study explored also the role of the weight loss speed (WLS) together with WS on the same clinical variables, which is the aim of the present work.


METHOD
A mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study was employed. Four hundred and fourteen patients with anorexia nervosa (AN = 208) or bulimia nervosa (BN = 206) according to DSM-5 criteria were recruited and assessed at referral by means of clinical interviews and self-reported questionnaires. Body mass index and diagnostic status were re-evaluated at the end of treatment.


RESULTS
WS was positively correlated with body dissatisfaction in patients with AN (p = .005), but negatively correlated in BN (p = .022). In contrast, WLS was significantly inversely correlated with age and duration of illness in all ED (p < .001), and positively correlated with drive for thinness in BN (p = .007). After treatment, WS at intake predicted higher BMI increase in both AN and BN (p < .03), while higher WLS was significantly associated with a lower drop-out rate in patients with BN (p = .02), and predicted BMI increase only in restricting AN patients (p = .02). In the whole group, WLS significantly predicted remission status (p = .039).


DISCUSSION
In our study, both WS and WLS were associated with baseline ""core"" clinical variables and provided complementary abilities to predict weight gain and remission at the end of treatment. If replicated, our data suggest the importance of considering both WS and WLS as useful clinical variables in the baseline assessment of ED.","[{'authorId': '3891924', 'name': 'M.

Methods: The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children was used for psychiatric evaluations. Emotion recognition skills were evaluated using Faces Test and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. The Difficulties in Emotions Regulation Scale was used for evaluating skills of emotion regulation. Results: Children with obesity had lower scores on Faces Test and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, and experienced greater difficulty in emotional regulation skills. Conclusions: Improved understanding of emotional recognition and emotion regulation in young people with obesity may improve their social adaptation and help in the treatment of their disorder.

In this study we assessed the incidence rates of psychiatric diagnoses and drugs in Israeli adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of health records data of over 200,000 12-17 years old adolescents identified a significant increase in all mental health diagnoses and most psychiatric drugs dispensation during the COVID-19 period compared to a corresponding pre-COVID period. A gender sub-analysis revealed that most of this increase was associated with adolescent girls. Girls exhibited increases of 68% in depression, 67% in eating disorders, 42% in anxiety and 29% in stress-related diagnoses during the COVID-19 period, which are significantly higher rates than those seen in boys and in the pre-COVID period. Sector sub-analysis showed that the increase was mainly in the general Jewish sector with almost no significant increases in the Arab and ultra-orthodox sectors. Our study highlights the mental health burden of Israeli adolescents during the pandemic and suggests that careful consideration should be given to it while deciding on measures to mitigate the pandemic.","[{'authorId': '7716008', 'name': 'Y.

We fill this gap in the literature by experimentally investigating the effects of facial gender cues on stereotypical trait and application ascriptions to robots. As predicted, the short-haired male robot was perceived as more agentic than was the long-haired female robot, whereas the female robot was perceived as more communal than was the male counterpart. Analogously, stereotypically male tasks were perceived more suitable for the male robot, relative to the female robot, and vice versa. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that gender stereotypes, which typically bias social perceptions of humans, are even applied to robots.

f686b1ba379ef3aa291c3c5b9b83ff34cb02023e,"This meta-analysis builds upon a previous meta-analysis by (1) including 65 per cent more studies that have over twice the sample size to estimate the relationships between emotional intelligence (EI) and job performance; (2) using more current meta-analytical studies for estimates of relationships among personality variables and for cognitive ability and job performance; (3) using the three-stream approach for classifying EI research; (4) performing tests for differences among streams of EI research and their relationships with personality and cognitive intelligence; (5) using latest statistical procedures such as dominance analysis; and (6) testing for publication bias. We classified EI studies into three streams: (1) ability-based models that use objective test items; (2) self-report or peer-report measures based on the four-branch model of EI; and (3) “mixed models” of emotional competencies. The three streams have corrected correlations ranging from 0.24 to 0.30 with job performance. The three streams correlated differently with cognitive ability and with neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Streams 2 and 3 have the largest incremental validity beyond cognitive ability and the Five Factor Model (FFM). Dominance analysis demonstrated that all three streams of EI exhibited substantial relative importance in the presence of FFM and intelligence when predicting job performance. Publication bias had negligible influence on observed effect sizes. The results support the overall validity of EI. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

For instance, cognitive reappraisal (reframing an emotional situation) is generally an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy (i.e., it is associated with increased psychological health). However, a person-by-situation approach suggests that the adaptiveness of different emotion-regulation strategies depends on the context in which they are used. Specifically, reappraisal may be adaptive when stressors are uncontrollable (when the person can regulate only the self) but maladaptive when stressors can be controlled (when the person can change the situation). To test this prediction, we measured cognitive-reappraisal ability, the severity of recent life stressors, stressor controllability, and level of depression in 170 participants. For participants with uncontrollable stress, higher cognitive-reappraisal ability was associated with lower levels of depression. In contrast, for participants with controllable stress, higher cognitive-reappraisal ability was associated with greater levels of depression. These findings support a theoretical model in which particular emotion-regulation strategies are not adaptive or maladaptive per se; rather, their adaptiveness depends on the context.","[{'authorId': '4041983', 'name': 'Allison S.

f6e6ff2af85931b55ef381f62dcaa562a914379b,"Objectives Adverse life events increase vulnerability to affective disorders later in life, possibly mediated by methylation of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). We investigated the relationship of SLC6A4 methylation with various types of adversity (perinatal adversity, traumatic youth experiences and stressful life events [SLEs]), as well as with the timing of SLEs (during childhood [0–11 years] or during adolescence [12–15 years]). In addition, we investigated whether different serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region genotypes were equally sensitive to SLE-related methylation. Methods In a population sample of 939 adolescents (mean age = 16.2 years), we assessed SLC6A4 methylation, SLC6A4 functionality (serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region “long” and “short” alleles, and rs25531), and adverse life events. Results Only a higher number of SLEs was positively associated with higher SLC6A4 methylation (B = 0.11, p = .011). Adolescent SLEs were associated with higher SLC6A4 methylation (B = 0.13, p = .004) independently of childhood SLEs (B = 0.02, p = .57). L-allele homozygotes showed a greater impact of SLEs on methylation (B = 0.37, p < .001) than did s-allele carriers (B = 0.04, p = .66), resulting in higher levels of SLC6A4 methylation for l-allele homozygotes among those experiencing high levels of SLEs. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate a higher level of SLC6A4 methylation after SLEs in adolescents, with a more pronounced association for SLEs during adolescence than during childhood. Considering the allele-specific sensitivity of SLC6A4 methylation to SLEs, this study may help clarify the role of SLC6A4 in the development of affective disorders.","[{'authorId': '118140941', 'name': 'L.

The small talk structures are placed within the tutoring conversation by an agent designed as a cognitive assistant, in order to make communication smoother and less formal, presenting a more “concerned” behavior. Twelve small talk segments are suggested, included in conversation stages such as opening and closing the conversation, maintaining the rhythm and managing learning. We also explore some branches of the theoretical assumptions and concepts grounding THOTH, such as Dennett’s intentional stance, Bloom’s taxonomy and microlearning theory. In order to measure the perception and effects of using THOTH, we performed a quantitative and qualitative study with a group of students from a course in Applied Artificial Intelligence over one semester. The outcomes are classified into two main categories of analysis – interactivity and intentionality – informing the discussion on the potential uses of a small talk agent as a valuable resource in tutoring interaction, and also raising some points for improvement. In addition to this study, we also drew a small talk profile for this group of students revealing what structures and topics they use the most, as well as a partial performance analysis that allows identifying some effects on learning.","[{'authorId': '2056027406', 'name': 'L.

Drawing on his experience with neurological patients affected with brain damage, Dr Damasio shows how absence of emotions and feelings can break down rationality. He also offers a new perspective on what emotions and feelings actually are: a direct view of our own body states; a link between the body and its survival-oriented regulation on the one hand, and consciousness on the other. Written as a conversation between the author and an imaginary listener, Descartes' Error leads us to conclude that human organisms are endowed from their very beginning with a spirited passion for making choices, which the social mind can then use to build rational behaviour.","[{'authorId': '2656777', 'name': 'A.

The regulation of emotion can be either automatic or controlled. This study extends research on the consequences and processes of emotional labour in two ways. First, it examines how the use of different emotion regulation strategies with patients relates to doctors’ emotional exhaustion. Second, it tests two mechanisms that may explain those relationships. A survey of 345 general practitioners (GPs) working in a large urban community in Spain was conducted for the study. Based on Côté's (2005) social interaction model, GP satisfaction with the responses of their patients was tested as a potential interpersonal mediator between their use of automatic, surface, and deep emotion regulation strategies and their emotional exhaustion. Psychological effort was tested as a potential intrapersonal mediator in the same pathway. Regression analysis indicated that emotion regulation was associated with GP emotional exhaustion when it was performed automatically, but that it had a positive and a neutral association when it was performed using surface and deep acting respectively. The mediating role of interpersonal and intrapersonal factors helped explain the differential associations between the GPs’ emotion regulation strategies and their emotional exhaustion.","[{'authorId': '1398636433', 'name': 'David Martínez-Iñigo'}, {'authorId': '1993236', 'name': 'P.

Most products from Nigeria industries lack the ability to compete with similar products from developed countries. Such appalling competitiveness of the Nigeria economy has bequeathed untold hardship on the citizens of Nigeria. The rationale for undertaking this study is to determine globalisation's brunt on Nigeria's economic competitiveness empirically.


Methodology: The Least Square method was employed to analyse the data collected from various statistical agencies such as the Nigeria statistical bulletin, World Economic Forum report and the United Nations Industrial Development report. The data collected is for the period spanning 2006 to 2017. Microfit 5.1 Statistical software is used in the analysis.


Main Findings: The findings of the study shows that there is a negative relationship between globalization and Nigeria global economic competitiveness. The results further indicate that Nigeria’s participation in the global arena has not yielded the desired benefit associated with globalization with respect to the country’s competitiveness. 


Research limitations/implications: The study adds to earlier works on economic competitiveness as a sound pillar of globalization by carving out an empirical analysis of Nigeria experience with globalization. The implications of the study's findings show that Nigeria's innovation strategies significantly lag behind the innovation strategies in developed countries.


Novelty/Originality of this study: This work put-forward a useful awareness into the existential challenge facing Nigeria and other developing economies in terms of equal capacity to confront their developmental problems as a result of globalization. The study further provides a pathway for Nigeria’s economic managers to overcome such challenges with dynamic strategies to achieve the desired benefits of globalization.","[{'authorId': '122106770', 'name': 'M.

Most previous research on such costs has used self-reported and cross-sectional designs. The authors use an experimental approach to test tenets of resource depletion theories; specifically, whether the self-regulation of emotions required by display rules depletes energy and attentional resources during a service encounter. Using a call center simulation with three ""customer"" interactions, the authors found that participants given positive display rules (e.g., be enthusiastic and hide frustration) reported more postsimulation exhaustion and made more errors on the order form compared to those with display autonomy. Customer hostility during one of the calls also increased exhaustion overall and the number of errors during that specific call, though proposed interactions with display rules were not supported. Surface-level emotion regulation, but not deep-level, was the mechanism for the energy depletion effect of display rules, while display rules had a direct effect on performance decrements. Theoretical and practical implications for display rules as part of job requirements are discussed.","[{'authorId': '48655562', 'name': 'Lori S. Goldberg'}, {'authorId': '5248218', 'name': 'Alicia A.

Key questions concerned the extent to which these emotion regulation strategies are associated with positive and negative parenting practices and predict quality of parenting through interplay with parental depression. Design. Participants were families of toddlers (n = 84) referred to a tertiary-level health service for the treatment of disruptive behavior problems. Parenting practices were indexed through observational coding of parent–child interactions and self-report data on multiple dimensions of positive and negative parenting. Parents self-reported their use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression—the two emotion regulation strategies that are most robustly associated with psychosocial functioning in adults. Results. Associations between emotion regulation strategy and quality of parenting were moderated by parental depressive symptom severity, with distinct effects seen for positive and negative parenting practices. In terms of positive parenting, more frequent use of cognitive reappraisal was associated with increased use of labeled praise among parents with lower levels of depressive symptoms, whereas parents who had higher levels of depressive symptoms engaged in less such praise regardless of how frequently they used reappraisal. In terms of negative parenting, frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and expression suppression were associated with reduced levels of negative parenting, but only among parents with high levels of depression. Conclusions. These findings add to growing support for the integration of emotion regulation strategies into family process models of early-onset conduct problems and related clinical interventions.","[{'authorId': '3884182', 'name': 'J.

with entry into nursing education programs and continues with the completion of nursing 
education and entry into the work environment. In order to improve this process, its reinforcing 
factors must be identified. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the relationship 
between emotional intelligence and professional socialization of nursing students of Tabriz 
University of Medical Sciences, Iran. 
Methods: In this correlational study, after calculating the sample size, all nursing students of 
Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in their 6 
th, 7th 
, and 8th semesters were studied. Data 
collection tools consisted of demographic characteristics questionnaire, Toit’s Professional 
Socialization Scale, and Shiring/Siberia Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. All data were 
analyzed using SPSS software and descriptive and analytical statistics. 
Results: The professional socialization and emotional intelligence of nursing students was above 
average level. Total emotional intelligence and its subscales had no significant correlation with 
students’ professional socialization score. However, professional socialization had significant 
correlation with gender, grade point average of previous semesters, and hope for future career. 
Conclusion: It seems that the professional socialization of nursing students is impacted by 
learning in cognitive and psychomotor domains more than by their emotional intelligence. 
However, considering the importance of the emotional domain in comprehensive and humane 
care, emotional intelligence skills training seems necessary for students.

In doing so we note that compassion is embedded within relationships and should underpin high quality mental health care. The idea of compassion is widely recognized, yet it is difficult to fully define because it is a complex concept that can manifest differently depending on context and meanings can vary according to individuals and circumstances (Dewar, Pullin, & Tocheris, 2011). Research shows that mental health consumers’ understanding of compassion devolves on professionals valuing them as people worthy of intrinsic respect and interacting with them in ways that maintain their personal dignity (Lloyd & Carson, 2011). These attitudes and behaviors are equivalent to Carl Rogers’ humanist values that pivot on the provision of unconditional positive regard to encourage patients to hope, gain meaning in their life, and facilitate a realistic and practical journey in the direction of recovery (Rogers, 1961).","[{'authorId': '145497487', 'name': 'M.

In order for DHBE research to maintain its promises, these issues need to be addressed in a systematic way according to a careful methodological planning of study design. In this contribution, we provide pragmatic insights on methodological aspects that should be dealt with while designing DHBE studies.

Ninety-four nurses completed a general questionnaire and 54 of them a diary booklet over five consecutive working days in two different moments, immediately after work and at bedtime. The results showed that nurses' emotional dysregulation moderated the relationship between daily workplace incivility and daily fatigue, and positive affect at night at home.

fa2874ae6869e83a86c5607aa40dd7d049857b07,"Visual processing is not determined solely by retinal inputs. Attentional modulation can arise when the internal attentional state (current task) of the observer alters visual processing of the same stimuli. This can influence visual cortex, boosting neural responses to an attended stimulus. Emotional modulation can also arise, when affective properties (emotional significance) of stimuli, rather than their strictly visual properties, influence processing. This too can boost responses in visual cortex, as for fear-associated stimuli. Both attentional and emotional modulation of visual processing may reflect distant influences upon visual cortex, exerted by brain structures outside the visual system per se. Hence, these modulations may provide windows onto causal interactions between distant but interconnected brain regions. We review recent evidence, noting both similarities and differences between attentional and emotional modulation. Both can affect visual cortex, but can reflect influences from different regions, such as fronto-parietal circuits versus the amygdala. Recent work on this has developed new approaches for studying causal influences between human brain regions that may be useful in other cognitive domains. The new methods include application of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) measures in brain-damaged patients to study distant functional impacts of their focal lesions, and use of transcranial magnetic stimulation concurrently with fMRI or EEG in the normal brain. Cognitive neuroscience is now moving beyond considering the putative functions of particular brain regions, as if each operated in isolation, to consider, instead, how distinct brain regions (such as visual cortex, parietal or frontal regions, or amygdala) may mutually influence each other in a causal manner.","[{'authorId': '2152501', 'name': 'P.

fa53c9ec574f7fc8d80af7118fe17d1171a8c01d,"BACKGROUND
There is growing research interest in the association between parental control and child anxiety. Parental control may enhance child anxiety and parents may exert control in anticipation of their child's anxiety-related distress. Moreover, high levels of anxiety in parents could influence the development of parental control. Whereas past reviews have solely examined the relation between child anxiety and parental control, this meta-analysis focuses on the associations between both child and parent anxiety and parental control.


METHODS
The associations of parent anxiety and child anxiety with observed parental control (k = 23 studies, N = 1,305 parent-child dyads) were investigated using a meta-analytic approach. Moreover, factors were identified that may function as moderators of these relations, such as parent and child gender, family socioeconomic status, child age, and design and measurement characteristics.


RESULTS
A substantial association between child anxiety and parental control (d = .58) was found. Moderator analyses yielded the strongest effect sizes for studies with an overrepresentation of girls, for school-aged children, for families from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, and for studies using a discussion task to assess parental control. Although a nonsignificant relation was found for the relation between parent anxiety and parental control (d = .08), small but significant effects were found for school-aged children, for studies using a discussion task to assess parental control, and for samples with an overrepresentation of boys.


CONCLUSIONS
As the direction of the association between child anxiety and parental control is unknown, future studies should use experimental designs to further explore the causal link between child anxiety and parental control.","[{'authorId': '4554398', 'name': 'C.

To describe the psychometric properties of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) interview, which surveys additional disorders not assessed in prior K-SADS, contains improved probes and anchor points, includes diagnosis-specific impairment ratings, generates DSM-III-R and DSM-IV diagnoses, and divides symptoms surveyed into a screening interview and five diagnostic supplements.


METHOD
Subjects were 55 psychiatric outpatients and 11 normal controls (aged 7 through 17 years). Both parents and children were used as informants. Concurrent validity of the screen criteria and the K-SADS-PL diagnoses was assessed against standard self-report scales. Interrater (n = 15) and test-retest (n = 20) reliability data were also collected (mean retest interval: 18 days; range: 2 to 36 days).


RESULTS
Rating scale data support the concurrent validity of screens and K-SADS-PL diagnoses. Interrater agreement in scoring screens and diagnoses was high (range: 93% to 100%). Test-retest reliability kappa coefficients were in the excellent range for present and/or lifetime diagnoses of major depression, any bipolar, generalized anxiety, conduct, and oppositional defiant disorder (.77 to 1.00) and in the good range for present diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (.63 to .67).

The adolescent years are characteristic of changes in body composition (location and quantity of body fat), physical fitness and decreased insulin sensitivity during puberty. This period of growth and maturation is also marked with behavioural changes in diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and psychological health. Physical activity and sport participation decline during adolescence especially in teenage girls, while sedentary behaviour, risk for depression and body esteem issues increase during the teenage years.

Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Faculty of Medicine, Tunis. Participants All Tunisian medical residents brought together between 14 and 22 December 2015 to choose their next 6-month rotation. Intervention The items of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire were employed to capture the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among the residents. The statistical relationships between anxiety and depression (HAD score) and sociodemographic and work-related data were explored by Poisson regression. Results 1700 out of 2200 (77%) medical residents (mean age: 28.5±2 years, female: 60.8%) answered the questionnaire. The mean working hours per week was 62±21 hours; 73% ensured a mean of 5.4±3 night shifts per month; and only 8% of them could benefit from a day of safety rest. Overall, 74.1% of the participating residents had either definite (43.6%) or probable (30.5%) anxiety, while 62% had definite (30.5%) or probable (31.5%) depression symptoms, with 20% having both definite anxiety and definite depression. The total HAD score was significantly associated with the resident’s age (OR=1.014, 95% CI 1.006 to 1.023, p=0.001); female gender (OR=1.114, 95% CI 1.083 to 1.145, p<0.0001); and the heavy burden of work imposed on a weekly or monthly basis, as reflected by the number of night shifts per month (OR=1.048, 95% CI 1.016 to 1.082, p=0.03) and the number of hours worked per week (OR=1.008, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.011, p<0.0001). Compared with medical specialties, the generally accepted difficult specialties (surgical or medical-surgical) were associated with a higher HAD score (OR=1.459, 95% CI 1.172 to 1.816, p=0.001). Conclusion Tunisian residents experience a rate of anxiety/depression substantially higher than that reported at the international level. This phenomenon is worrying as it has been associated with an increase in medical errors, work dissatisfaction and attrition.

Hypotheses were generated from recent theory pertinent to the categorization and measurement of aggressive behavior as well as widely supported effects of alcohol intoxication and gender on aggression. Participants were 328 (163 men and 165 women) healthy social drinkers between 21 and 35 years of age who completed self-report personality inventories designed to assess one's propensity toward direct physical aggression, verbal aggression, trait anger, and hostility. Following the consumption of either an alcohol or a placebo beverage, participants were tested on the TAP, in which mild electric shocks were received from, and administered to, a fictitious opponent during a competitive task. Direct physical aggression was operationalized as the shock intensities (i.e., first trial shock intensity, mean shock intensity, proportion of highest shock) administered to the fictitious opponent. Although all self-report measures were significantly associated with the three TAP indices, the associations involving physical aggression were strongest. In addition, self-report measures of physical aggression consistently predicted higher levels of aggression on the TAP indices in men, compared with women, and in intoxicated, relative to sober, participants. Taken as a whole, this pattern of findings provides further evidence for the validity of the TAP as a measure of direct physical aggression for men and women.","[{'authorId': '6058555', 'name': 'P.

Online surveys generated responses to indicators of instructor autonomy support, academic self-efficacy, and academic problems. Grade point average (GPA) was obtained from the institution. Multiple regression models found that academic self-efficacy and academic problems independently predicted GPA. Health-related factors (e.g. depression) explained academic self-efficacy, academic problems and academic achievement. Academic self-efficacy and academic problems independently mediated the relationship between instructor autonomy support and GPA. Results indicate that greater academic self-efficacy, fewer academic problems and an autonomy-supportive education environment may promote academic achievement in SSM/V despite the presence of health-related factors such as depression, posttraumatic stress and mild traumatic brain injury.

Counterfactuals explain the past and prepare for the future, they implicate various relations including causal ones, and they affect intentions and decisions. They modulate emotions such as regret and relief, and they support moral judgments such as blame. The loss of the ability to imagine alternatives as a result of injuries to the prefrontal cortex is devastating. The basic cognitive processes that compute counterfactuals mutate aspects of the mental representation of reality to create an imagined alternative, and they compare alternative representations. The ability to create counterfactuals develops throughout childhood and contributes to reasoning about other people's beliefs, including their false beliefs.

This paper expands upon recent efforts to advance beyond the examination of concurrent comorbidity between affective and behavioral disorders by testing developmental sequences among disorders. Doing so allows for improved tests of theories, such as Capaldi and Patterson's failure model of Conduct Disorder (CD) and depression. Furthermore, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is rarely considered distinctly from CD, minimizing the ability to identify distinct effects among behavioral disorders.


METHODS
This paper used data from the Developmental Trends Study, a clinic-referred cohort of 177 boys, along with their parents, who were assessed regularly using a structured clinical interview and a comprehensive set of other measures. Boys were recruited when they were between the ages of 7 and 12, and were reassessed annually until age 18. Predictive regression models tested the continuities among disorders, with depression, overanxious disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), ODD and CD examined separately as outcomes.


RESULTS
Each disorder showed homotypic continuity, but a clear developmental sequence of heterotypic continuity also emerged. ADHD was predicted by no other disorders, and exclusively predicted ODD. CD was predicted only by ODD. However, ODD was also directly predictive of future anxiety and depression, and anxiety predicted future depression as well. A specific test of the failure model of CD and depression supported that model.


CONCLUSIONS
ODD appears as a pivotal developmental disorder in young males, in that ODD is notably influential in both subsequent behavioral and affective disorders. CD influences later depression only indirectly, through psychosocial impairment. Anxiety precedes depression, and ADHD is not predicted by other disorders.","[{'authorId': '38810467', 'name': 'Jeffrey D. Burke'}, {'authorId': '152220639', 'name': 'R.

A predominant theory proposes that individuals with poor ECFs are more aggressive because they are unable to inhibit impulsive behaviors. However, evidence for this relationship is typically indirect. In this study, 46 healthy men and women completed measures of ECF, the Taylor Aggression Paradigm, and the Go/No-Go discrimination task, a behavioral measure of impulsivity. Also, impulsiveness of participant responses during the aggression task was directly assessed by measuring latency of responses to provocation (‘‘set-time’’). It was hypothesized that lowquartile–scoring ECF men and women would perform more aggressively and more impulsively than high-quartile peers. Consistent with expectations, results indicated that ECF was related to aggression and to impulsivity on the Go/No-Go task. However, low-ECF men and women did not have shorter settimes; in fact, on this task, low-ECF participants’ behavioral decisions seemed slightly slower than those of high-ECF participants. In light of these results, the authors speculate that a social informationprocessing problem may mediate the ECF aggression relationship rather than altered impulsivity per se. Aggr.

The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) is an instrument that assesses nine cognitive strategies to cope with negative situations. The aim of this study was to validate the CERQ for a sample of Spanish adolescents, to analyse reliability and validity, and to examine the factor structure by confirmatory factor analysis.


METHOD
The Spanish version of CERQ (CERQ-S) and other scales (gratitude, emotional intelligence, satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety and stress) were completed by 835 adolescents aged 14-18 (455 girls) from the South of Spain.


RESULTS
The results showed that the CERQ-S in adolescents (CERQ-SA) has appropriate psychometric properties with indexes of reliability a = .89 and w = .96, and the original nine-factor structure was confirmed. There was also significant correlation between the CERQ-SA and the other scales, showing evidence of convergent validity.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that the CERQ-SA could be useful for appraising cognitive coping in adolescents. This will help to expand the study and understanding of these strategies, their influence and their consequences for adolescents' psychological functioning and health.","[{'authorId': '1490428136', 'name': 'M.

fcabd4413ff386afac8dbe37d2f242ab24161059,"Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions, although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by Jöreskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test–retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the points.","[{'authorId': '3650003', 'name': 'T.

Recent efforts to explain and treat these conditions have emphasized the role of emotion dysregulation. However, emotional problems are not always the result of emotion dysregulation, and even when emotional problems do arise from emotion dysregulation, it is necessary to specify precisely what type of emotion dysregulation might be operative. In this review, we present an extended process model of emotion regulation, and we use this model to describe key points at which emotion-regulation difficulties can lead to various forms of psychopathology. These difficulties are associated with (a) identification of the need to regulate emotions, (b) selection among available regulatory options, (c) implementation of a selected regulatory tactic, and (d) monitoring of implemented emotion regulation across time. Implications and future directions for basic research, assessment, and intervention are discussed.","[{'authorId': '5236984', 'name': 'G. Sheppes'}, {'authorId': '47763916', 'name': 'G.

Studies have shown that yoga practices reduce anxiety and depression and improve wellbeing. Objective: The aims of the study were to, (i) examine the safety and feasibility of conducting a weeklong free yoga camp, and (ii) assess its impact on the negative and positive affect in normal healthy volunteers. Materials and Methods: In this open-arm study450 participants were taught integrated yoga module. It included asanas, pranayama, relaxation, notional correction and devotional sessions. Assessment was carried out on the first and last day of the camp, using a modified version of Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). It has ten questions each to measure positive (PA) and negative affect (NA). Nine questions have been added which are referred as other positive affect (OPA) and other negative affect (ONA) domains. Results: Three hundred and twelve sets of pre–post data were analyzed. There was an increase in PA of PANAS by 13% (P<0.001, Wilcoxon’s signed rank test) and OPA by 17% (P<0.001). The NA reduced by 47% (P<0.001) and ONA by 48% (P<0.001). Conclusion: It is feasible and safe to conduct a weeklong yoga camp in an urban setting, and integrated yoga practices can reduce the negative affect and increase the positive affect within one week.","[{'authorId': '48044566', 'name': 'L.

Disclosure resulted in immediate increases in negative mood. At 2 weeks the 2 groups did not differ on any health measure, but at 3 months disclosure patients had less affective disturbance and better physical functioning in daily activities. There was no main effect of disclosure on pain or joint condition, but among the disclosure patients, those who experienced larger increases in negative mood after talking demonstrated improvements in the condition of their joints. This study concludes that, among RA patients, verbal disclosure and emotional processing of stressful life events induces an immediate negative mood followed by improved psychological functioning.","[{'authorId': '114509850', 'name': 'J.

Nevertheless, very little empirical research has investigated mindfulness from a workplace perspective. In the study reported here, we address this oversight by examining workplace mindfulness – the degree to which individuals are mindful in their work setting. We hypothesize that, in a dynamic work environment, workplace mindfulness is positively related to job performance and negatively related to turnover intention, and that these relationships account for variance beyond the effects of constructs occupying a similar conceptual space – namely, the constituent dimensions of work engagement (vigor, dedication, and absorption). Testing these claims in a dynamic service industry context, we find support for a positive relationship between workplace mindfulness and job performance that holds even when accounting for all three work engagement dimensions. We also find support for a negative relationship between workplace mindfulness and turnover intention, though this relationship becomes insignificant when accounting for the dimensions of work engagement. We consider the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and highlight a number of avenues for conducting research on mindfulness in the workplace.","[{'authorId': '71661442', 'name': 'Erik Dane'}, {'authorId': '2870378', 'name': 'Bradley J.

The current provisional diagnostic criteria for the fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) include a cognitive index score (SSS-Cog), which constitutes a part of the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS). The current study aimed at assessing the validity of the cognitive index score, by comparing this subjective measure of cognitive impairment with an objective measure of cognitive functioning, collected through comprehensive computerised cognitive testing and assessment.


METHODS
50 FM patients underwent a computerised cognitive assessment battery, including testing in domains of memory, executive function, attention and information processing speed (NeuroTraxCorp.). Age and education standardised scores were computed. FM symptoms were assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of clinical pain and the Beck Depression inventory (BDI-II).


RESULTS
The index score for subjective assessment of cognitive decline (SSS-Cog) was not correlated with any of the objective cognitive measures. However, a positive correlation was found between the SSS-Cog and the FIQ, the WPI and the VAS measures, all reflecting subjective overall functional ability.


CONCLUSIONS
No significant relationship was found between FM patients' subjective appraisal of cognitive deficit and objective cognitive scores on all computerised subtests. However, subjective appraisal of cognitive impairment was found to be strongly and significantly related to patients' functional ability. Therefore, we suggest reconsidering the definition of this index score (SSS-Cog) and propose developing novel and more accurately defined tools in order to measure cognitive impairment in FM patients, for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes.","[{'authorId': '4922498', 'name': 'O.

Objectives We aimed to study the effect of social isolation and subsequent re- exposure and eventual changes in general and ED-specific psychopathology in people with Eating Disorders (EDs). Methods Three-hundred twelve Italian people with EDs (179 Anorexia Nervosa, 83 Bulimia Nervosa, 48 Binge Eating Disorder and 22 Other Specific Feeding Eating Disorder) were asked to fill-in an online survey to explore several dimensions such as: anxiety, depression, panic, insomnia, suicide ideation, stress, post-traumatic stress and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Differences in ED specific and general symptoms among the 3 investigated time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were assessed with a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Subsequently, ED diagnosis was introduced as covariate in the analysis in order to investigate the possible contribution on psychopathological changes. Results ED core symptoms increased during the lockdown but most of them returned to pre-COVID19 levels at re-opening. The severity of general psychopathology also increased during the lockdown and persisted high in the following phase, except for depression and suicide ideation. None of this symptoms was affected by ED diagnosis, participants’age and illness duration. Conclusions People with EDs showed worsening of both general and specific psychopathology; moreover, changes in general psychopathology persisted in the re-opening period suggesting a higher stress vulnerability in this kind of patients.

Further analysis provided good evidence for both the internal reliability of the subscales and the short (3 week) and longer term (6 month) retest reliability.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the interactions of mothers with normative or high levels of depressive symptomatology on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and their 3-month-old infants. Although successful mutual regulation of affect is critical to children's socio-emotional development, little is known about the factors that influence dyadic processes such as synchrony, matching, mismatching, and bi-directionality during early infancy. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of maternal depressive symptom status, infant gender, and interactional context on mother-infant affective expressiveness and the dyadic features of their interactions.


METHODS
Participants were 133 mothers and their healthy full-term infants. Mothers were classified into three groups on the basis of their total score on the CES-D at 2 months of infant age: a high symptom group (CES-D score > or = 16), a mid symptom control group (CES-D score = 2-12), and a low symptom group (CES-D score = 0-1). Mothers and infants were then videotaped in the Face-to-Face Still-Face paradigm at 3 months of infant age. The mothers' and infants' affect during the interactions prior to (first play) and following the still-face (reunion play) were coded microanalytically using Izard's AFFEX system.


RESULTS
Results indicated that male as compared to female infants were more vulnerable to high levels of maternal depressive symptoms and that high symptom mothers and their sons had more difficult interactions in the challenging reunion episode.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that a cycle of mutual regulatory problems may become established between high symptom mothers and their sons, particularly in challenging social contexts. The long-term consequences of this early social interactive vulnerability in terms of later development need to be further investigated.","[{'authorId': '10418177', 'name': 'M. K.

Building on studies suggesting that the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) is associated with regulation of negative emotions, the present experiment tests the hypothesis that decreasing the cortical excitability of the rVLPFC may increase negative emotional reactions to social exclusion. Specifically, we applied cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the rVLPFC and predicted an increment of negative emotional reactions to social exclusion. In Study 1, participants were either socially excluded or included, while cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation was applied over the rVLPFC. Cathodal stimulation of rVLPFC boosted the typical negative emotional reaction caused by social exclusion. No effects emerged from participants in the inclusion condition. To test the specificity of tDCS effects over rVLPFC, in Study 2, participants were socially excluded and received cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation over a control region (i.e., the right posterior parietal cortex). No effects of tDCS stimulation were found. Our results showed that the rVLPFC is specifically involved in emotion regulation and suggest that cathodal stimulation can increase negative emotional responses to social exclusion.","[{'authorId': '37814606', 'name': 'P.

fe62e9051e773ab65d35cbf3742e7f7a735338ca,"Background. Although parenting has long been considered an important risk factor for subsequent psychopathology, most investigations of this question have studied a single informant, clinical populations, one or a few disorders and did not consider relevant covariates. Methods. Three dimensions of parenting (coldness, protectiveness and authoritarianism) were measured by combining the retrospective reports from adult female twins, their co-twins, and their mothers and fathers. We assessed by personal interview, lifetime history in the twins of eight common psychiatric and substance abuse disorders and a range of predictors of parenting. Analyses were performed using logistic regression. Results. Examined individually, high levels of coldness and authoritarianism were modestly but significantly associated with increased risk for nearly all disorders, while the impact of protectiveness was more variable. These associations declined modestly when putative predictors of parenting were added as covariates. Maternal and paternal parenting were equally associated with outcomes in adult daughters. When coldness, protectiveness and authoritarianism were examined together, nearly all significant associations were seen solely with coldness. Few significant interactions were found between maternal and paternal parenting or between coldness, protectiveness and authoritarianism. The shared experience of these three dimensions of parenting predicts a quite small correlation in liability to these disorders in dizygotic twin pairs (e.g. r < 0·04). Conclusion. In women, parenting behaviour, especially levels of coldness, is probably causally related to risk for a broad range of adult psychiatric disorders. The impact of parenting on substance use disorders may be largely mediated through their co-morbidity with major depression, phobias and generalized anxiety disorder. In general population samples, the association of poor parenting with psychiatric illness is modest, largely non-specific and explains little of the observed aggregation of these disorders in families.","[{'authorId': '2237723433', 'name': 'K.

The sample consisted of 1004 Italian students (395 males and 609 females) attending high school. The average age of the students was 17.9 years (SD =0.8; range: 16–21). They completed self-report measures assessing binge behaviors and Emotion Regulation strategies. No differences resulted between adolescents assuming binge behaviors and no bingers as regards CR; conversely, adolescents engaging in binge eating and in both binge behaviors reported the highest levels of ES. Furthermore, both Emotion Regulation strategies were significant predictors of binge eating. The present study suggested that binge behaviors were strongly associated with adolescent’s ability to evaluate and manage their emotions, so that adolescents may benefit from more precise and specific prevention and treatment approaches focused on training to use more adaptive and effective strategies to regulate their emotions.","[{'authorId': '2662040', 'name': 'F.

Hedonic information systems aim to provide self-fulfilling rather than instrumental value to the user, are strongly connected to home and leisure activities, focus on the fun-aspect of using information systems, and encourage prolonged rather than productive use. The paper reports a cross-sectional survey on the usage intentions for one hedonic information system. Analysis of this sample supports the hypotheses that perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use are stronger determinants of intentions to use than perceived usefulness. The paper concludes that the hedonic nature of an information system is an important boundary condition to the validity of the technology acceptance model. Specifically, perceived usefulness loses its dominant predictive value in favor of ease of use and enjoyment.","[{'authorId': '1723957', 'name': 'H.

fe88b33df4f07394d37ac1e13c7cbcd2e784aa26,"Building on Kahn’ s (1990) ethnographic work, a e eld study in a U.S. Midwestern insurance company explored the determinants and mediating effects of three psychological conditions ‐ meaningfulness, safety and availability ‐ on employees’ engagement in their work. Results from the revised theoretical framework revealed that all three psychological conditions exhibited signie cant positive relations with engagement. Meaningfulness displayed the strongest relation. Job enrichment and work role e t were positively linked to psychological meaningfulness. Rewarding co-worker and supportive supervisor relations were positively associated with psychological safety, whereas adherence to co-worker norms and self-consciousness were negatively associated. Psychological availability was positively related to resources available and negatively related to participation in outside activities. Finally, the relations of job enrichment and work role e t with engagement were both fully mediated by the psychological condition of meaningfulness. The association between adherence to co-worker norms and engagement was partially mediated by psychological safety. Theoretical and practical implications related to psychological engagement at work are discussed. To explore the challenge to the human soul in organizations is to build a bridge between the world of the personal, subjective, and even unconscious elements of individual experience and the world of organizations that demand rationality, efficiency, and personal sacrifice . . . we must be willing to shift our viewpoint back and forth between what organizations want of people and what constitutes human complexity: the contradictory nature of human needs, desires, and experience.

fec3f9b0ab6aba1897a97638b7abbf32c82750f6,"Symbolic (i.e., with Arabic numerals) approximate arithmetic with large numerosities is an important predictor of mathematics. It was previously evidenced to onset before formal schooling at the kindergarten age (Gilmore et al., 2007) and was assumed to map onto pre-existing nonsymbolic (i.e., abstract magnitudes) representations. With a longitudinal study (Experiment 1), we show, for the first time, that nonsymbolic and symbolic arithmetic demonstrate different developmental trajectories. In contrast to Gilmore et al.’s (2007) findings, Experiment 1 showed that symbolic arithmetic onsets in grade 1, with the start of formal schooling, not earlier. Gilmore et al. (2007) had examined English-speaking children, whereas we assessed a large Dutch-speaking sample. The Dutch language for numbers can be cognitively more demanding, for example, due to the inversion property in numbers above 20. Thus, for instance, the number 48 is named in Dutch “achtenveertig” (eight and forty) instead of “forty eight.” To examine the effect of the language of numbers, we conducted a cross-cultural study with English- and Dutch-speaking children that had similar SES and math achievement skills (Experiment 2). Results demonstrated that Dutch-speaking kindergarteners lagged behind English-speaking children in symbolic arithmetic, not nonsymbolic and demonstrated a working memory overload in symbolic arithmetic, not nonsymbolic. Also, we show for the first time that the ability to name two-digit numbers highly correlates with symbolic approximate arithmetic not nonsymbolic. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that the symbolic number system is modulated more by development and education than the nonsymbolic system. Also, in contrast to the nonsymbolic system, the symbolic system is modulated by language.","[{'authorId': '1398183917', 'name': 'Iro Xenidou-Dervou'}, {'authorId': '40661140', 'name': 'C.

Expressive suppression was correlated negatively with positive indicators of mental health (r=–.12), and positively with negative indicators of mental health (r=.15). Expressive suppression was correlated positively with positive indicators of mental health within the category of samples with Western cultural values (r=–.11) but not the category with Eastern cultural values. Moreover, the correlation of expressive suppression and negative indicators of mental health was stronger in the Western cultural values category (r=.19) than in the Eastern cultural values category (r=.06).

According to user preference studies, the aesthetic and the usability of a system play an important role in the user appraisal and selection of a product. However, user preferences are just a part of the equation. The fact that a user prefers one product over the other does not mean that he or she would necessarily buy it. To understand the factors affecting the user's assessment of a product before the actual use of the product and the user's intention to purchase the product we conducted a study, reported in this article. Our study, a modification of a well‐known protocol, considers the users’ preferences of six simulated smartphones each with different combination of attributes. A sample consisting of 365 participants was involved in our analysis. Our results confirm that the main basis for the users’ pre‐use preferences is the aesthetics of the product, whereas our results suggest that the main basis for the user's intention to purchase are the expected usability of the product. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the personal characteristics of the users have different effects on both the users’ preferences and their intention to purchase a product. These results suggest that the designers should carefully balance the aesthetics and usability features of a prototype in tune with the users expectations. If the conceptualization of a product is done properly the redesign cycles after the usability testing can be reduced and speed up the process for releasing the product on the market.","[{'authorId': '2937810', 'name': 'S.

If people’s goals are to increase or maintain well-being, then their objectives will diverge depending on whether their fortunes have turned for the better (which necessitates slowing down or thwarting adaptation) or for the worse (which calls for activating and accelerating it). In this chapter, I fi rst introduce the construct of hedonic adaptation and its attendant complexities. Next, I review empirical evidence on how people adapt to circumstantial changes, and conjecture why the adaptation rate differs in response to favorable versus unfavorable life changes. I then discuss the relevance of examining adaptation to questions of how to enhance happiness (in the positive domain) and to facilitate coping (in the negative domain). Finally, I present a new dynamic theoretical model (developed with Sheldon) of the processes and mechanisms underlying hedonic adaptation. Drawing from the positive psychological literature, I propose ways that people can fashion self-practiced positive activities in the service of managing stress and bolstering well-being.","[{'authorId': '6986158', 'name': 'S.

Satisfaction with social support was related to anxiety through an interaction with mastery. Neither mastery nor satisfaction with support appeared to act as a stress-buffer through a statistical interaction with stress to moderate effects of high stress. However, earlier analysis of some of the same data showed that total stress, the best predictor of each outcome in this study, was reduced by the combination of strong situation-specific mastery beliefs and high satisfaction with support for subjects who faced many stressors.
