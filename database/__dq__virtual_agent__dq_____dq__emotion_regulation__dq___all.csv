3,0059dab998f4e1bb35c1ff609e90533aae104b24,A Survey of Exact Inference for Contingency Tables,"The past decade has seen substantial research on exact infer- ence for contingency tables, both in terms of developing new analyses and developing efficient algorithms for computations. Coupled with concomitant improvements in computer power, this research has re- sulted in a greater variety of exact procedures becoming feasible for practical use and a considerable increase in the size of data sets to which the procedures can be applied. For some basic analyses of contin- gency tables, it is unnecessary to use large-sample approximations to sampling distributions when their adequacy is in doubt. This article surveys the current theoretical and computational developments of exact methods for contingency tables. Primary attention is given to the exact conditional approach, which eliminates nuisance parameters by conditioning on their sufficient statistics. The presentation of various exact inferences is unified by expressing them in terms of parameters and their sufficient statistics in loglinear models. Exact approaches for many inferences are not yet addressed in the literature, particularly for multidimensional contingency tables, and this article also suggests additional research for the next decade that would make exact methods yet more widely applicable.",1992.0,162.0,1168.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '131-153', 'name': 'Statistical Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Agresti1992ASO,\n author = {A.

It was possible to divide it into two parts: septum pellucidum, composed of fiber tracts and glia, and septum verum (true septum) which in addition to fiber tracts and glia, contain neurons arranged in a nuclear pattern. The septum verum in the human corresponds to the septum as described in lower forms. The human septum has been thought to have regressed and be nearly functionless in contrast to lower forms. However, the nucleus septalis triangularis is the only septal nucleus which regressed in development when compared to that in the brains of insectivores and primates. The rest of the septal nuclei progressively increased in size during primate development. Finally, it should be emphasized that the septum verum of the human has attained its highest degree of development in primate phylogeny.",1968.0,16.0,138.0,"{'volume': '133', 'name': 'Journal of Comparative Neurology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Andy1968TheSI,\n author = {O.

Intrinsically this language is multimodal (heterogeneous), sequential and asynchronous; it consists of the language (words), visual (expressions) and acoustic (paralinguistic) modalities all in the form of asynchronous coordinated sequences. From a resource perspective, there is a genuine need for large scale datasets that allow for in-depth studies of this form of language. In this paper we introduce CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI), the largest dataset of sentiment analysis and emotion recognition to date. Using data from CMU-MOSEI and a novel multimodal fusion technique called the Dynamic Fusion Graph (DFG), we conduct experimentation to exploit how modalities interact with each other in human multimodal language.

Whereas early research in emotion regulation predominantly employed static, self-report measurement, the past decade has seen a shift in focus toward understanding the dynamic nature of regulation processes. This is reflected in recent refinements in the definition of emotion regulation that emphasize the importance of the ability to flexibly adapt regulation efforts across contexts. The latest proliferation of digital technologies employed in mental health research offers the opportunity to capture the state- and context-sensitive nature of emotion regulation. In this conceptual review, we examine the use of digital technologies (ecological momentary assessment; wearable and smartphone technology, physical activity, acoustic data, visual data, and geo-location; smart-home technology; virtual reality; social media) in the assessment of emotion regulation and describe their application to interventions. We also discuss challenges and ethical considerations and outline areas for future research.",2021.0,184.0,21.0,"{'name': 'Clinical Psychological Science', 'pages': '3 - 26', 'volume': '10'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bettis2021DigitalTF,\n author = {Alexandra H.

From time to time, these smart homes or microgrids are also capable of supplying energy to other houses, buildings, or energy grid in the time of available self-produced renewable energy. Therefore, researches have been carried out to develop optimal trading strategies, and many recent technologies are also being used in combination with microgrids. One such technology is blockchain, which works over decentralized distributed ledger. In this paper, we develop a blockchain based approach for microgrid energy auction. To make this auction more secure and private, we use differential privacy technique, which ensures that no adversary will be able to infer private information of any participant with confidence. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity at every trading node, we use consortium blockchain, in which selected nodes are given authority to add a new block in the blockchain. Finally, we develop differentially private Energy Auction for bLockchain-based microgrid systems (DEAL). We compare DEAL with Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction scenario and experimental results demonstrates that DEAL outperforms VCG mechanism by maximizing sellers’ revenue along with maintaining overall network benefit and social welfare.",2020.0,40.0,202.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '263-275', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Services Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hassan2020DEALDP,\n author = {M.

Substance users’ exposures to environmental stress (in terms of two variables: community social economic status and crime) were assessed from global positioning systems (GPS) data. Participants were 47 outpatients with substance use disorders admitted for methadone maintenance at a research clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. From 35.2 million GPS tracking points, we compared 7 different methods for defining activity space. The different methods yielded different exposure estimates, which would lead to different conclusions in studies using only one method. These results have important implications for future research on the effect of contextual influences on health behaviors and outcomes: whether a study observes any significant influence of an environmental factor on health may depend on what contextual units are used to assess individual exposure.",2018.0,53.0,55.0,"{'volume': '33', 'pages': '1176 - 1195', 'name': 'International Journal of Geographical Information Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kwan2018UncertaintiesIT,\n author = {M.

We also show that by carefully cooperating bimodal features, the recognition precision of each emotion category will exceed the limit set up by the single modality, both visual and acoustic.

Existing studies of experiential avoidance rely on trait measures with minimal contextual consideration. In two studies, we examined the association between experiential avoidance and anxiety within real-world social interactions. In the first study, we examined the effect of experiential avoidance on social anxiety in everyday life. For 2 weeks, 37 participants with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and 38 healthy controls provided reports of experiential avoidance and social anxiety symptoms during face-to-face social interactions. Results showed that momentary experiential avoidance was positively related to anxiety symptoms during social interactions and this effect was stronger among people with SAD. People low in EA showed greater sensitivity to the level of situational threat than high EA people. In the second study, we facilitated an initial encounter between strangers. Unlike Study 1, we experimentally created a social situation where there was either an opportunity for intimacy (self-disclosure conversation) or no such opportunity (small-talk conversation). Results showed that greater experiential avoidance during the self-disclosure conversation temporally preceded increases in social anxiety for the remainder of the interaction; no such effect was found in the small-talk conversation. Our findings provide insight into the association between experiential avoidance on social anxiety in laboratory and naturalistic settings, and demonstrate that the effect of EA depends upon level of social threat and opportunity.",2014.0,89.0,131.0,"{'volume': '14 4', 'pages': '\n          769-781\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kashdan2014ACA,\n author = {T.

This is realized through larger screens, sophisticated speaker systems, and high quality 2D and 3D content. Moreover, a recent trend in the film industry is to incorporate multiple interaction modalities, such as 4D film, to simulate rain, wind, vibration, and heat, in order to intensify viewers’ emotional reactions. In this context, humans’ sense of touch possesses significant potential for intensifying emotional reactions for the film experience beyond audio-visual sensory modalities. This article presents a framework for authoring tactile cues (tactile gestures as used in this article) and enabling automatic rendering of said gestures to intensify emotional reactions in an immersive film experience. To validate the proposed framework, we conducted an experimental study where tactile gestures are designed and evaluated for the ability to intensify four emotional reactions: high valence-high arousal, high valence-low arousal, low valence-high arousal, and low valence-low arousal. Using a haptic jacket, participants felt tactile gestures that are synchronized with the audio-visual contents of a film. Results demonstrated that (1) any tactile feedback generated a positive user experience; (2) the tactile feedback intensifies emotional reactions when the audio-visual stimuli elicit clear emotional responses, except for low arousal emotional response since tactile gestures seem to always generate excitement; (3) purposed tactile gestures do not seem to significantly outperform randomized tactile gesture for intensifying specific emotional reactions; and (4) using a haptic jacket is not distracting for the users.",2017.0,27.0,14.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '1 - 17', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Karafotias2017IntensifyingER,\n author = {Georgios Karafotias and Akiko Teranishi and Georgios Korres and F.

Mediante los cuestionarios WHOQOL- BREF, para medir CV y DRES para evaluar las DRE, los cuales fueron aplicados en 1190 participantes entre 18 a 65 anos de edad en la ciudad de Antofagasta, Chile. Los resultados obtenidos indican que la CV se relaciona de manera inversa con las DRE, donde la desatencion y la confusion emocional afectaron, tanto a la CV general, como a cada uno de sus dominios. Se observaron diferencias dadas por edad; siendo en el grupo mas joven la interferencia emocional la que ejercio una mayor influencia en la evaluacion negativa de la CV, en tanto a medida que aumenta la edad, fue la desatencion emocional la que tuvo un mayor peso en la evaluacion negativa de la CV. Los hallazgos sugieren la inclusion de objetivos de trabajo en el ambito de las emociones y sus dificultades de regulacion, tanto en la Psicoterapia como en intervenciones psicologicas destinadas a mejorar la CV de las personas a nivel de prevencion primaria, como secundaria y terciaria.

26,01e411620c11738854db65b2b647a1242bfb9b88,Change in daily life behaviors and depression: Within-person and between-person associations.,"OBJECTIVE
This study examined associations between daily physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors and depressive symptoms (a) at a macrolevel, over the course of an Experience Sampling (ESM) self-monitoring intervention, and (b) at a microlevel, by examining daily within-person associations. Second, we examined the effects of the ESM self-monitoring intervention on these daily life behaviors.


METHODS
Individuals with a diagnosis of depression (N = 102) receiving pharmacological treatment were randomized to 1 of 2 six-week ESM intervention conditions or a control condition. Physical, sedentary, social, and leisure behaviors as well as depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively in every-day life at baseline, postintervention, and during the ESM interventions.


RESULTS
Change in physical activity and talking from baseline to postintervention was associated with change in depressive symptoms from baseline to postintervention. Within-person daily fluctuations in talking, physical activity, doing nothing/resting, and being alone predicted end-of-day depressive symptoms over and above depressive symptoms at the previous day. The ESM interventions contributed to change in talking, doing nothing/resting, and being alone over time in comparison with the control group. The analyses revealed individual differences in the amount of behavioral change over time and in the within-subject associations between daily behaviors and depressive symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that physical, sedentary, and social behaviors have affective implications for daily mental health of individuals with depression. Self-monitoring using ESM may be a useful add-on tool to achieve behavioral change and to gain personalized insight in behaviors that improve daily depressive symptoms.",2016.0,51.0,59.0,"{'volume': '35 5', 'pages': '\n          433-41\n        ', 'name': 'Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Snippe2016ChangeID,\n author = {E.

27,01f3d3a34d4df1789c023454f8a0756ab8f6f3f6,Emotion regulation choice: the role of environmental affordances,"ABSTRACT Which emotion regulation strategy one uses in a given context can have profound affective, cognitive, and social consequences. It is therefore important to understand the determinants of emotion regulation choice. Many prior studies have examined person-specific, internal determinants of emotion regulation choice. Recently, it has become clear that external variables that are properties of the stimulus can also influence emotion regulation choice. In the present research, we consider whether reappraisal affordances, defined as the opportunities for re-interpretation of a stimulus that are inherent in that stimulus, can shape individuals’ emotion regulation choices. We show that reappraisal affordances have stability across people and across time (Study 1), and are confounded with emotional intensity for a standardised set of picture stimuli (Study 2). Since emotional intensity has been shown to drive emotion regulation choice, we construct a context in which emotional intensity is separable from reappraisal affordances (Study 3) and use this context to show that reappraisal affordances powerfully influence emotion regulation choice even when emotional intensity and discrete emotions are taken into account (Study 4).",2018.0,34.0,72.0,"{'volume': '32', 'pages': '963 - 971', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Suri2018EmotionRC,\n author = {G.

Despite multi‐sector investment along with wide‐scale advertising and availability to the general population, the evidence supporting the use of smartphone apps in the treatment of depression has not been empirically evaluated. Thus, we conducted the first meta‐analysis of smartphone apps for depressive symptoms. An electronic database search in May 2017 identified 18 eligible randomized controlled trials of 22 smartphone apps, with outcome data from 3,414 participants. Depressive symptoms were reduced significantly more from smartphone apps than control conditions (g=0.38, 95% CI: 0.24‐0.52, p<0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. Smartphone interventions had a moderate positive effect in comparison to inactive controls (g=0.56, 95% CI: 0.38‐0.74), but only a small effect in comparison to active control conditions (g=0.22, 95% CI: 0.10‐0.33). Effects from smartphone‐only interventions were greater than from interventions which incorporated other human/computerized aspects along the smartphone component, although the difference was not statistically significant. The studies of cognitive training apps had a significantly smaller effect size on depression outcomes (p=0.004) than those of apps focusing on mental health. The use of mood monitoring softwares, or interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy, or apps incorporating aspects of mindfulness training, did not affect significantly study effect sizes. Overall, these results indicate that smartphone devices are a promising self‐management tool for depression.

Although digital technology has the potential to address these issues, existing research on technology-enabled interventions for families remains limited. This paper focuses on emotion regulation (ER) as an example of a core protective factor that is commonly targeted by prevention interventions. Objective The aim of this pilot study was to provide an initial validation of the logic model and feasibility of in situ deployment for a new technology-enabled intervention, designed to support children’s in-the-moment ER efforts. The novelty of the proposed approach relies on delivering the intervention through an interactive object (a smart toy) sent home with the child, without any prior training necessary for either the child or their carer. This study examined (1) engagement and acceptability of the toy in the homes during 1-week deployments, and (2) qualitative indicators of ER effects, as reported by parents and children. In total, 10 families (altogether 11 children aged 6-10 years) were recruited from 3 predominantly underprivileged communities in the United Kingdom, as low SES populations have been shown to be particularly at risk for less developed ER competencies. Children were given the prototype, a discovery book, and a simple digital camera to keep at home for 7 to 8 days. Data were gathered through a number of channels: (1) semistructured interviews with parents and children prior to and right after the deployment, (2) photos children took during the deployment, and (3) touch interactions automatically logged by the prototype throughout the deployment. Results Across all families, parents and children reported that the smart toy was incorporated into the children’s ER practices and engaged with naturally in moments the children wanted to relax or calm down. Data suggested that the children interacted with the toy throughout the deployment, found the experience enjoyable, and all requested to keep the toy longer. Children’s emotional connection to the toy appears to have driven this strong engagement. Parents reported satisfaction with and acceptability of the toy. Conclusions This is the first known study on the use of technology-enabled intervention delivery to support ER in situ. The strong engagement, incorporation into children’s ER practices, and qualitative indications of effects are promising. Further efficacy research is needed to extend these indicative data by examining the psychological efficacy of the proposed intervention. More broadly, our findings argue for the potential of a technology-enabled shift in how future prevention interventions are designed and delivered: empowering children and parents through child-led, situated interventions, where participants learn through actionable support directly within family life, as opposed to didactic in-person workshops and a subsequent skills application.",2019.0,129.0,21.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'JMIR Mental Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Theofanopoulou2019AST,\n author = {Nikki Theofanopoulou and K.

Previous literature suggests that technology use, specifically internet use, can alleviate loneliness and improve wellbeing. This research study follows 32 people over the age of 65 using a digital technology for six months. A mixed-method approach was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data throughout the time period. The repeated questionnaire measured changes in frequency of use, emotional attachment towards a device, a sense of belonging and perceptions of self-worth, whilst an event-based diary was used to note usages and influences of technology on lifestyle. Results revealed positive relationships between frequency of use and emotional attachment and frequency of use and perceptions of self-worth. There was no significant relationship between frequency of use and a sense of belonging for the aggregate data. There was, however, a negative relationship between emotional attachment towards a device and a sense of belonging, suggesting a fine balance between technology use to improve self-esteem through connections with social networks and an over-dependence on technology that can actually reduce feelings of belonging.",2017.0,84.0,72.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '1307 - 1331', 'name': 'Ageing and Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wilson2017IsIL,\n author = {Carolyn Wilson},\n journal = {Ageing and Society},\n pages = {1307 - 1331},\n title = {Is it love or loneliness?

We developed and evaluated an implementation intention (II) based, JIT cessation intervention prototype to support Asian American young adult smokers to prevent lapses in their cessation attempts in real-time. We examined how a JIT II reminder may prevent lapses during self-identified high-risk smoking situation (HRSS) as a microtemporal process. We also tested whether the effect of JIT reminder changes over the course of study and differed between those who used their own versus project loan phones. Asian American young adult smokers (N = 57) who were interested in quitting or reducing smoking participated in a 4 week, mobile-based, cessation study (MyQuit USC, MQU). MQU is a JIT mobile app that deploys a user-specified II reminder at user-specified HRSS and assesses momentary lapse status. Generalized mixed linear models were conducted to assess the effect of the JIT intervention on lapse prevention. We found a significant interaction effect (p = .03) such that receiving JIT reminder reduced the likelihood of lapses for participants using their own phones but not for the loaners. The results also showed that when participants enacted the suggested II, they were less likely to lapse (p < .001). The JIT effect did not change over time in study (p = .21). This study provides evidence that receiving a reminder of a smoker's own plan just before a self-identified risky situation on a familiar device and successfully executing specified plans can be helpful in preventing lapses. Our results highlighted factors to consider when designing and refining a JIT intervention.",2020.0,52.0,10.0,{'name': 'Translational behavioral medicine'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Huh2020EffectOA,\n author = {J.

Coping and emotion regulation theorists have proposed dynamic models in which these two factors, the person and the situation, interact over time to inform adaptation. In practice, however, researchers have tended to assume that particular regulatory strategies are consistently beneficial or maladaptive. We label this assumption the fallacy of uniform efficacy and contrast it with findings from a number of related literatures that have suggested the emergence of a broader but as yet poorly defined construct that we refer to as regulatory flexibility. In this review, we articulate this broader construct and define both its features and limitations. Specifically, we propose a heuristic individual differences framework and review research on three sequential components of flexibility for which propensities and abilities vary: sensitivity to context, availability of a diverse repertoire of regulatory strategies, and responsiveness to feedback. We consider the methodological limitations of research on each component, review questions that future research on flexibility might address, and consider how the components might relate to each other and to broader conceptualizations about stability and change across persons and situations.",2013.0,178.0,769.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '591 - 612', 'name': 'Perspectives on Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bonanno2013RegulatoryF,\n author = {G.

Anger, irritability, and aggression are among the most common reasons for child mental health referrals. This review is focused on two forms of behavioral interventions for these behavioral problems: Parent management training (PMT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).


METHODS
First, we provide an overview of anger/irritability and aggression as the treatment targets of behavioral interventions, followed by a discussion of the general principles and techniques of these treatment modalities. Then we discuss our current work concerning the transdiagnostic approach to CBT for anger, irritability, and aggression.


RESULTS
PMT is aimed at improving aversive patterns of family interactions that engender children's disruptive behavior. CBT targets deficits in emotion regulation and social problem-solving that are associated with aggressive behavior. Both forms of treatment have received extensive support in randomized controlled trials. Given that anger/irritability and aggressive behavior are common in children with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses, a transdiagnostic approach to CBT for anger and aggression is described in detail.


CONCLUSIONS
PMT and CBT have been well studied in randomized controlled trials in children with disruptive behavior disorders, and studies of transdiagnostic approaches to CBT for anger and aggression are currently underway. More work is needed to develop treatments for other types of aggressive behavior (e.g., relational aggression) that have been relatively neglected in clinical research. The role of callous-unemotional traits in response to behavioral interventions and treatment of irritability in children with anxiety and mood disorders also warrants further investigation.",2016.0,80.0,157.0,"{'volume': '26 1', 'pages': '\n          58-64\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sukhodolsky2016BehavioralIF,\n author = {D.

To test whether a head-mounted display helmet enhances the effectiveness of videogame distraction for children experiencing cold pressor pain.


METHOD
Forty-one children, aged 6-14 years, underwent one or two baseline cold pressor trials followed by two distraction trials in which they played the same videogame with and without the helmet in counterbalanced order. Pain threshold (elapsed time until the child reported pain) and pain tolerance (total time the child kept the hand submerged in the cold water) were measured for each cold pressor trial.


RESULTS
Both distraction conditions resulted in improved pain tolerance relative to baseline. Older children appeared to experience additional benefits from using the helmet, whereas younger children benefited equally from both conditions. The findings suggest that virtual reality technology can enhance the effects of distraction for some children.

The importance of time in humans’ life is not in dispute and is reflected by several dimensions like duration, which is best representing the naïve meaning of time. Psychological time serves several important functions which are essential for being able to act and survive in a dynamic environment. In the present paper we argue that psychological time in the form of sensing the pace of the flow of time provides important information to the executive system which control and monitor behavior. When information processing load is below an optimal level for a specific Individual a feeling of boredom is raised. Boredom is accompanied by a slowing of the felt pace of the flow of time. Boredom is a unique mental state which is linked with decreasing efficiency in cognitive and perceptual performance and is correlated with low job satisfaction and general well-being. As such, boredom poses a threat to normal functioning. We suggest that the felt slowing in the flow of time is a signal which, similarly to pain, is aimed at alerting the executive system that resources should be recruited in order to cope with the hazardous state.",2014.0,64.0,114.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zakay2014PsychologicalTA,\n author = {D.

Despite recent neurocomputational advances, it is unknown whether brain signatures of affiliative emotions, such as tenderness/affection, can be decoded and voluntarily modulated. Here, we employed multivariate voxel pattern analysis and real-time fMRI to address this question. We found that participants were able to use visual feedback based on decoded fMRI patterns as a neurofeedback signal to increase brain activation characteristic of tenderness/affection relative to pride, an equally complex control emotion. Such improvement was not observed in a control group performing the same fMRI task without neurofeedback. Furthermore, the neurofeedback-driven enhancement of tenderness/affection-related distributed patterns was associated with local fMRI responses in the septohypothalamic area and frontopolar cortex, regions previously implicated in affiliative emotion. This demonstrates that humans can voluntarily enhance brain signatures of tenderness/affection, unlocking new possibilities for promoting prosocial emotions and countering antisocial behavior.",2014.0,70.0,73.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Moll2014VoluntaryEO,\n author = {J.

Scale construction and validation were carried out using seven independent samples with over 2,000 participants aged 18 to 55 in Croatia and the United States. Primary data collection was completed using online survey tools. Analyses did not confirm the proposed conceptual framework but suggested a two-dimensional structure focusing on self (“ego-centered”) and the other (a “partner- and sexual activity-centered” factor) domains, each containing items representing all five conceptual dimensions. Scale reliability (k = 20) was satisfactory for all samples, and construct validity was confirmed in both cultures. The NSSS was also found to have acceptable one-month stability.

We conducted a feasibility and proof-of-concept study to assess the potential of virtual reality and electroencephalography, with or without an intelligent agent, that adapts the presented material to the emotions elicited by the environment. Method: Older adults with subjective cognitive decline recruited from the community received a virtual reality-based intervention taking place in one of two virtual environments, a train (Part 1, N = 19) or a music theatre, complemented by the intelligent agent (Part 2, N = 19). A comparative control group (N = 19) receiving no intervention was also included. All participants completed measures of affect and cognition before and after the intervention. The intervention groups completed measures of cybersickness and user experience after the intervention. Results: Participants did not suffer from increased cybersickness following either intervention. They also reported a positive to highly positive user experience concerning the following aspects: attractivity, hedonic quality-identity and hedonic quality-stimulation. The measures of affect showed no pre-post change when comparing either intervention to the control condition. However, a reduction of negative affect was observed following the train intervention for participants with a high self-reported negative affect at baseline. Finally, there was a significant improvement in working memory when comparing either intervention group to the control condition. Conclusion: Our results support the feasibility and tolerability of the technology, and a positive impact on cognition, paving the way for a larger-scale randomized clinical trial to confirm efficacy.",2022.0,45.0,1.0,{'volume': '2'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Cuesta2022VirtualRA,\n author = {M.

Measuring such subjective data as reactions to color, heat, light, and sound would seem to be an almost impossible task; indeed, until now there has been no theory around which the research in this field could be organized. This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities. In the final chapters the authors present a series of hypotheses which relate the emotional response variables to a diversity of behaviors such as physical approach, performance, affiliation, and verbally or nonverbally expressed preference.",1974.0,0.0,5825.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mehrabian1974AnAT,\n author = {A.

Hardiness is a protective factor that reduces the likelihood of negative outcomes such as secondary trauma. In this study, we analyzed the responses to physical, emotional, cognitive, organizational‒relational and COVID-19 stress of 140 healthcare and 96 emergency workers. Decision-making difficulties due to high uncertainty and the fear of contracting the virus and infecting others were also considered. We aimed to detect which stressors caused secondary trauma and to assess the protective power of hardiness. Participants completed the questionnaire online measuring stress, secondary trauma and resilience. We performed a t-test, correlational analysis and hierarchical regression. The healthcare workers had higher levels of stress and arousal than the emergency workers group and those involved in the treatment of COVID-19 were exposed to a large degree of stress and were at high risk of developing secondary trauma. Commitment is associated with high levels of stress, arousal and intrusion, while control shows a protective function.

In the present study, young and older adults' ability to correctly recognize facial affect representative of 6 different emotions (happiness, surprise, disgust, fear, anger, and sadness) was examined in 3 conditions varying in difficulty. Task difficulty was measured by varying the number of labels available in a forced choice recognition task to 2, 4, and 6. Results showed that age differences were present in the 2 more difficult conditions for fear and sadness. Older adults were impaired in recognizing facial expressions of surprise only in the 4-label condition. Current findings suggest that task difficulty moderates age differences in emotion labeling. The present study has contributed to previous research by illuminating the conditions under which age differences in the accuracy of labeling of facial affect are more likely to be observed.",2010.0,16.0,46.0,"{'volume': '65B 3', 'pages': '\n          323-7\n        ', 'name': 'The journals of gerontology.

Nevertheless, laboratory experiments and retrospective assessments have been the 2 most common strands of ER research; thus, leaving open several crucial questions about ER antecedents and consequences in daily life. Beyond traditional methods, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has the potential to capture ER dynamics during the flow of daily experiences, in real-life settings and through repeated measurements. Here, we discuss what we currently know about ER antecedents and consequences. We will compare findings from previous literature to findings from EMA studies, pointing out both similarities and differences, as well as questions that can be answered better with the EMA approach.

This study was conducted to develop the Enculturation Scale for Filipino Americans (ESFA). Items were generated from a literature review, interviews with 5 Filipino American academic experts, and a survey of 24 cultural informants. Two community samples of Filipino Americans (Ns = 281 and 269) and 1 sample of non-Filipino Americans (N = 84) completed the ESFA. The Filipino American samples also completed existing enculturation/acculturation measures for Asian Americans and measures of subjective well-being. In factor analyses, 3 general enculturation dimensions— Connection With Homeland, Interpersonal Norms, and Conservatism—replicated well across samples. Internal consistency reliability estimates for the ESFA subscales were high, and construct validity was supported by the pattern of relationships with alternative, but less culture-specific, enculturation/ acculturation measures, as well as immigration, generational status, and cultural identity variables.

Research and theory on regulatory flexibility suggest that people switch strategies dynamically and that internal states provide feedback indicating when switches are appropriate. Frequent switching may predict positive outcomes among people who respond to this feedback. We investigated whether internal feedback (particularly corrugator activity, heart rate, or subjective negative intensity) guides people to switch to an optimal (i.e., distraction) but not nonoptimal (i.e., reappraisal) strategy for regulating strong emotion. We also tested whether switching frequency and responsiveness to internal feedback (RIF) together predict well-being. While attempting to regulate emotion elicited by unpleasant pictures, participants could switch to an optimal (Study 1; reappraisal-to-distraction order; N = 90) or nonoptimal (Study 2; distraction-to-reappraisal order; N = 95) strategy for high-arousal emotion. A RIF score for each emotion measure indexed the relative strength of emotion during the initial phase for trials on which participants later switched strategies. As hypothesized, negative intensity, corrugator activity, and the magnitude of heart rate deceleration during this early phase were higher on switch than maintain trials in Study 1 only. Critically, in Study 1 only, greater switching frequency predicted higher and lower life satisfaction for participants with high and low corrugator RIF, respectively, even after controlling for reappraisal success. Individual differences in RIF may contribute to subjective well-being provided that the direction of strategy switching aligns well with regulatory preferences for high emotion.

Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).",2015.0,83.0,102.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bombari2015StudyingSI,\n author = {Dario Bombari and M.

The environmental factors include prolonged parental separation, less exposure to early mother/father–infant interactions and the parents' ability to respond to the trauma of premature birth. In the case of premature birth, the father's ability to take an active part in the care of the infant from the start is essential. The parents' emotional closeness to the preterm infant hospitalised in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may be crucial to the well-being of the newborn, the development of mutual regulation, the establishment of a functioning parent–infant affective relationship and the parents' confidence in their ability to provide care for their baby. Methods and analysis This is a mixed-method, observational and longitudinal study. The methodological strategy will include: (1) ethnographic observation in a level III NICU located in Italy for a duration of 18 months; (2) 3-minute video recordings of mother–infant and father–infant interaction in the NICU; (3) a semistructured interview with fathers during the infants' hospital stay; (4) 3-minute video recordings of mother–infant and father–infant face-to-face interaction in the laboratory at 4 months of corrected age; (5) self-report questionnaires for parents on depression and quality of the couple relationship at the approximate times of the video recording sessions. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee for Clinical Trials of the Verona and Rovigo Provinces. Results aim to be published in international peer-reviewed journals, and presented at relevant national and international conferences. This research project will develop research relevant to (1) the quality and modalities of maternal and paternal communication with the preterm infant in the NICU; (2) the influence of maternal/paternal social stimulation on the infant behavioural states; (3) the quality and modalities of paternal support to the partner and possible influences on mother–infant relationship.",2017.0,92.0,40.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'BMJ Open'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Stefana2017ParentalEA,\n author = {A.

Although several approaches have been proposed to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions or speech, relatively limited work has been done to fuse these two, and other, modalities to improve the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition system. This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information. It also discusses two approaches used to fuse these two modalities: decision level and feature level integration. Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state. By the use of markers on her face, detailed facial motions were captured with motion capture, in conjunction with simultaneous speech recordings. The results reveal that the system based on facial expression gave better performance than the system based on just acoustic information for the emotions considered. Results also show the complementarily of the two modalities and that when these two modalities are fused, the performance and the robustness of the emotion recognition system improve measurably.",2004.0,24.0,868.0,{'pages': '205-211'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Busso2004AnalysisOE,\n author = {C.

Despite its range of applications, eye tracking has yet to become a pervasive technology. We believe that we can put the power of eye tracking in everyone's palm by building eye tracking software that works on commodity hardware such as mobile phones and tablets, without the need for additional sensors or devices. We tackle this problem by introducing GazeCapture, the first large-scale dataset for eye tracking, containing data from over 1450 people consisting of almost 2:5M frames. Using GazeCapture, we train iTracker, a convolutional neural network for eye tracking, which achieves a significant reduction in error over previous approaches while running in real time (10-15fps) on a modern mobile device. Our model achieves a prediction error of 1.71cm and 2.53cm without calibration on mobile phones and tablets respectively. With calibration, this is reduced to 1.34cm and 2.12cm. Further, we demonstrate that the features learned by iTracker generalize well to other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

However, there are mixed findings on whether older adults are better at regulating emotion-a hallmark feature of emotional health-and most research is based on laboratory studies that may not capture how people regulate their emotions in everyday life. We used experience sampling to examine how multiple measures of emotional health, including mean affect, dynamic fluctuations between affective states and the ability to resist desires-a common form of emotion regulation-differ in daily life across adulthood. Participants (N = 122, ages 20-80) reported how they were feeling and responding to desire temptations for 10 days. Older adults experienced more intense positive affect, less intense negative affect, and were more emotionally stable, even after controlling for individual differences in global life satisfaction. Older adults were more successful at regulating desires, even though they experienced more intense desires than younger adults. In addition, adults in general experiencing more intense affect were less successful at resisting desires. These results demonstrate how emotional experience is related to more successful desire regulation in everyday life and provide unique evidence that emotional health and regulation improve with age.

96,06c65fb31e5d1febf73770c02b4665d12cb0411b,Shaping and policy search in reinforcement learning,"To make reinforcement learning algorithms run in a reasonable amount of time, it is frequently necessary to use a well-chosen reward function that gives appropriate “hints” to the learning algorithm. But, the selection of these hints—called shaping rewards—often entails significant trial and error, and poorly chosen shaping rewards often change the problem in unanticipated ways that cause poor solutions to be learned. In this dissertation, we give a theory of reward shaping that shows how these problems can be eliminated. This theory further gives guidelines for selecting good shaping rewards that in practice give significant speedups of the learning process. We also show that shaping can allow us to use “myopic” learning algorithms and still do well. 
The “curse of dimensionality” refers to the observation that many simple reinforcement learning algorithms, ones based on discretization, scale exponentially with the size of the problem and are thus impractical for many applications. In this dissertation, we consider the policy search approach to reinforcement learning. Here, we wish to select a controller from among some restricted set of controllers for a task. We see that a key issue in policy search is obtaining uniformly good estimates of the quality of the controllers being considered. We show that simple Monte Carlo methods will not in general give uniformly good estimates. We then present the P EGASUS policy search method, which is derived using the surprising observation that all reinforcement learning problems can be transformed into ones in which all state transitions (given the current state and action) are deterministic. We show that PEGASUS has sample complexity that scales at most polynomially with the size of the problem, and give strong guarantees on the quality of the solutions it finds. In deriving these results, we also take the ideas of VC dimension and sample complexity that are familiar from supervised learning and apply them to the reinforcement learning setting, thus putting the two problems on a more equal footing. 
Finally, we apply these ideas to designing a controller for an autonomous helicopter. Autonomous helicopter flight is widely viewed as a difficult control problem. Using shaping and the PEGASUS policy search method, we are able to automatically design a stable hovering controller for a helicopter, as well as make it fly a number of challenging maneuvers taken from an RC helicopter competition.

To evaluate the reliability and validity of the PANAS (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988b) and provide normative data.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional and correlational.


METHOD
The PANAS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,003). Competing models of the latent structure of the PANAS were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression and correlational analysis were used to determine the influence of demographic variables on PANAS scores as well as the relationship between the PANAS with measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the DASS).


RESULTS
The best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon & Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory.


CONCLUSION
The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data.",2004.0,49.0,2560.0,"{'volume': '43 Pt 3', 'pages': '\n          245-65\n        ', 'name': 'The British journal of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Crawford2004ThePA,\n author = {J.

This field bridges two largely distinct areas of enquiry: (a) psychological research into how and why people regulate their emotions, which has yet to systematically explore the role of digital technology, and (b) computing research into how digital technologies impact users’ emotions, which has yet to integrate psychological theories of emotion regulation.

 Although various methods have been developed to evaluate conversational interfaces, there has been a lack of methods specifically focusing on evaluating user experience. This paper reviews the understandings of user experience (UX) in conversational interfaces literature and examines the six questionnaires commonly used for evaluating conversational systems in order to assess the potential suitability of these questionnaires to measure different UX dimensions in that context. The method to examine the questionnaires involved developing an assessment framework for main UX dimensions with relevant attributes and coding the items in the questionnaires according to the framework. The results show that (i) the understandings of UX notably differed in literature; (ii) four questionnaires included assessment items, in varying extents, to measure hedonic, aesthetic and pragmatic dimensions of UX; (iii) while the dimension of affect was covered by two questionnaires, playfulness, motivation, and frustration dimensions were covered by one questionnaire only. The largest coverage of UX dimensions has been provided by the Subjective Assessment of Speech System Interfaces (SASSI). We recommend using multiple questionnaires to obtain a more complete measurement of user experience or improve the assessment of a particular UX dimension.

One possibility is suggested by the observation that effective SF requires adaptive emotion awareness and regulation. Previous reports have documented deficits in emotion awareness and regulation in individuals with schizophrenia, and have shown that such deficits predicted SF. However, it is unknown whether these deficits are present prior to the onset of psychosis or whether they are linked to SF in CHR individuals. Method We conducted a cross-sectional comparison of emotion awareness and regulation in 54 individuals at CHR, 87 with schizophrenia and 50 healthy controls (HC). Then, within the CHR group, we examined links between emotion awareness, emotion regulation and SF as indexed by the Global Functioning Scale: Social (Cornblatt et al. 2007). Results Group comparisons indicated significant differences between HC and the two clinical groups in their ability to identify and describe feelings, as well as the use of suppression and reappraisal emotion-regulation strategies. Specifically, the CHR and schizophrenia groups displayed comparable deficits in all domains of emotion awareness and emotion regulation. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that difficulties describing feelings accounted for 23.2% of the SF variance. Conclusions The results indicate that CHR individuals display substantial emotion awareness and emotion-regulation deficits, at severity comparable with those observed in individuals with schizophrenia. Such deficits, in particular difficulties describing feelings, predate the onset of psychosis and contribute significantly to poor SF in this population.",2016.0,95.0,55.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '2907 - 2918', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kimhy2016TheIO,\n author = {D.

Fear and anxiety caused by corona virus disease are destructive and they can lead to mental disorders in people. The aim of this study was to investigate role of health promoting behaviors and health beliefs to predict corona virus anxiety among nurses in Ardabil. Methods: The method of the present study was descriptive-correlation. The statistical population consisted of all nurses of Ardabil province in the summer of 2020. According to the latest statistics of the province's nursing system, 3,500 nurses are working in the province. Among these people, 382 people were selected as a statistical sample with Cochran's formula and participated in the research by placing link questions in Telegram and WhatsApp groups. In this study, Alipour et al. Coronavirus Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), Walker Health Promoting Lifestyle Questionnaire and Weissfeld et al.'s Health Beliefs Questionnaire were used. Data analysis was performed using Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression simultaneously with 24SPSS software. Results: Correlation results showed that coronary anxiety was associated with general health concerns (r=0.61), general health threats (r=0.37), vulnerability (r=0.57), and severity (r= 0.28). Positive and with medical treatment benefits (r=-0.44), self-help benefits (r=-0.44), self-actualization (r=-0.45), nutrition (r=-0.43), exercise (r=-0.52), stress management (r=-0.44), stress responsibility (r=-0.55) and interpersonal support (r=-0.59) are negatively related. The results of regression analysis also showed that 67% of the total variance of coronary anxiety is explained by health beliefs and 62% by promotional behaviors. Conclusions: The results of this study show that health-promoting behaviors and health beliefs are associated with low corona virus anxiety. Therefore, interventions focused on these components can be effective in preventing nurses from developing corona virus anxiety.",2021.0,47.0,7.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Farivar2021TheRO,\n author = {Farivar},\n title = {The Role of Health Promoting Behaviors and Health Beliefs in Predicting of Corona Anxiety (COVID-19) among Nurses},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '103107353', 'name': 'Farivar'}]"

111,0769a93845df407b5acc6000596973162cbbb315,Everyday Empathic Accuracy in Younger and Older Couples,"On average, older adults are less accurate than younger adults at recognizing emotions from faces or voices. We challenge the view that such differences in emotion-recognition tasks reflect differences in empathic accuracy (the ability to infer other people’s feelings): Empathic accuracy relies not only on sensory cues (e.g., emotional expressions) but also on knowledge about the target person. Using smartphone-based measures, we assessed empathic accuracy in younger and older couples’ daily lives and found that younger adults’ empathic accuracy was higher than older adults’ empathic accuracy when their partners were visibly present.

Yet there is little knowledge on how this self-regulatory use of music develops across the life span. A qualitative study was conducted to initially explore central processes and strategies of the emotional self-regulation during adulthood. The data were collected through group interviews and analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Participants were 21 interviewees with an age range of 21—70 years. The results clarified conceptual features of music-related emotional self-regulation in adulthood and revealed two main trends. First, the basic nature of regulation, including various regulatory goals and strategies, remained highly similar throughout adulthood. Second, however, several changes were also evident, and they could be further categorized into three types: change by age, event-related fluctuations, and retirement transition. The study provided knowledge about the role of music-related emotional experiences as a functional and meaningful part of human behavior and psychosocial development during adulthood.",2011.0,53.0,291.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '307 - 327', 'name': 'Psychology of Music'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Saarikallio2011MusicAE,\n author = {Suvi Saarikallio},\n journal = {Psychology of Music},\n pages = {307 - 327},\n title = {Music as emotional self-regulation throughout adulthood},\n volume = {39},\n year = {2011}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '6732966', 'name': 'Suvi Saarikallio'}]"

We adopted a bottom-up, synthetic approach towards interactive competencies in robots using simple, minimal computational models underlying the robot's interaction dynamics. We present two empirical, exploratory studies investigating a drumming experience with a humanoid robot (KASPAR) and a human. In the first experiment, the turn-taking behaviour of the humanoid is deterministic and the non-verbal gestures of the robot accompany its drumming to assess the impact of non-verbal gestures on the interaction. The second experiment studies a computational framework that facilitates emergent turn-taking dynamics, whereby the particular dynamics of turn-taking emerge from the social interaction between the human and the humanoid. The results from the HRI experiments are presented and analysed qualitatively (in terms of the participants’ subjective experiences) and quantitatively (concerning the drumming performance of the human–robot pair). The results point out a trade-off between the subjective evaluation of the drumming experience from the perspective of the participants and the objective evaluation of the drumming performance. A certain number of gestures was preferred as a motivational factor in the interaction. The participants preferred the models underlying the robot's turn-taking which enable the robot and human to interact more and provide turn-taking closer to ‘natural’ human–human conversations, despite differences in objective measures of drumming behaviour. The results are consistent with the temporal behaviour matching hypothesis previously proposed in the literature which concerns the effect that the participants adapt their own interaction dynamics to the robot's.",2010.0,78.0,39.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '103 - 134', 'name': 'Connection Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kose-Bagci2010DrummateID,\n author = {H.

Previous studies on aging and attention to emotional information found that older adults may look away from negative stimuli to regulate their moods. However, it is an open question whether older adults' tendency to look less at negative material comes at the expense of learning when negative information is also health-relevant. This study investigated how age-related changes in attention to negative but relevant information about skin cancer risk reduction influenced both subsequent health behavior and mood regulation.


METHODS
Younger (18-25 years of age, n = 78) and older (60-92 years of age, n = 77) adults' fixations toward videos containing negatively valenced content and risk-reduction information about skin cancer were recorded with eye-tracking. Self-reported mood ratings were measured throughout. Behavioral outcome measures (e.g., answering knowledge questions about skin cancer, choosing a sunscreen, completing a skin self-exam) assessed participants' learning of key health-relevant information, their interest in seeking additional information, and their engagement in protective behaviors.


RESULTS
Older adults generally looked less at the negative video content, more rapidly regulated their moods, and learned fewer facts about skin cancer; yet, they engaged in a greater number of protective behaviors than did younger adults.


CONCLUSIONS
Older adults may demonstrate an efficient looking strategy that extracts important information without disrupting their moods, and they may compensate for less learning by engaging in a greater number of protective behaviors. Younger adults may be distracted by disruptions to their mood, constraining their engagement in protective behaviors.",2012.0,43.0,40.0,"{'volume': '31 5', 'pages': '\n          650-9\n        ', 'name': 'Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Isaacowitz2012LookingFA,\n author = {D.

Toward a Situated Cognition Analysis of Emotion-Regulatory Dynamics,"In “Emotion Regulation: Current Status and Future Prospects,” Gross (this issue) reviews the state of the art in modern emotion regulation research and presents a new model of emotion regulation. The new model directly builds upon a highly influential earlier process model (Gross, 1998, 2001), which addressed how people may strategically direct their emotionregulatory efforts within the cycle of emotion generation. However, the extended process model goes considerably beyond the original process model, by analyzing the complete dynamics of emotion regulation as it unravels over time: How people identify appropriate opportunities for emotion regulation; how people chose between different emotion-regulatory strategies; and, finally, whether people maintain a chosen strategy, switch between strategies, or decide to stop regulating their emotions. We applaud the extended process model (Gross, this issue), as part of a more general push toward more dynamic conceptions of emotion regulation (Aldao, 2013; Bonnanno & Burton, 2013; Sheppes & Levin, 2013; Webb, Schweiger Gallo, Miles, Gollwitzer, & Sheeran, 2012). At the same time, we feel that the field still has a long way to go before it can provide a satisfactory account of people’s emotion-regulatory dynamics. The extended process model and its conceptual cousins maintain that emotion regulation is driven by mental representations like goals and “valuation systems” (Gross, this issue). In our view, such static representations do not adequately explain the dynamic nature of emotion regulation. To tackle this problem, we propose a situated cognition approach, which treats emotion regulation as an activity that emerges dynamically from people’s interactions with their environment.",2015.0,79.0,45.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '61 - 68', 'name': 'Psychological Inquiry'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Koole2015DoesER,\n author = {S.

We assess the prototype game regarding motivation to play and game usability, and also participants’ emotional recognition abilities and technology usage. People with autism are less likely to gaze at faces and are also impaired in face discrimination tasks. Recently, technology plays an active role in helping these individuals to understand emotions and recognise facial expressions. LIFEisGAME prototype was played during a 15 minute game session by 11 children with ASD, with ages varying from 5-15 years old (M=9.27, SD=2.97), 91% were male and 9% were female, 82% were verbal ASD and 18% were non-verbal ASD. We video recorded each child and the footage was analysed according to game usability and motivation to play. Parents (n=11) filled out a parental consent form and a questionnaire about their child ́s technology usage and their emotional understanding. Therapists' opinions (n=8) about the game were given during an unstructured interview. The game was presented on an Ipad 4 (9.7 inches, 2048x1536). Participants enjoyed the prototype but it still needs to be simplified. All participants had experience with computer games. Fear, disgust and surprise were the most challenging emotions to recognise. Parents suggested adding musical stimuli to promote motivation and therapists recommended to include visual game instructions. Technology is a useful resource for autism and LIFEisGAME utilises technology to promote emotional understanding, bringing positive outcomes to quality of life for children with autism.

The current study aimed to bridge the gap between questionnaire and experimental methods of measuring secondary control coping strategies, specifically distraction and cognitive reappraisal, and examine associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression in youth. A community sample of 70 youth (ages 9–15) completed a novel experimental coping and emotion regulation paradigm and self-report measures of coping and emotion regulation and symptoms. Findings indicate that use of distraction and reappraisal during the laboratory paradigm was associated with lower levels of negative emotion during the task. Youth emotion ratings while implementing distraction, but not reappraisal, during the laboratory task were associated with youth self-reported use of secondary control coping in response to family stress. Youth symptoms of anxiety and depression were also significantly positively associated with negative emotion ratings during the laboratory task, and both laboratory task and self-reported coping and emotion regulation accounted for significant variance in symptoms in youth. Both questionnaire and laboratory methods to assess coping and emotion regulation in youth are important for understanding these processes as possible mechanisms of risk and resilience and continued integration of these methods is a priority for future research.",2018.0,43.0,7.0,"{'volume': '48', 'pages': '855 - 865', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bettis2018LaboratoryAS,\n author = {Alexandra H.

A key factor in human social interaction is our beliefs about others, a theory of mind. Whether we believe a message depends not only on its content but also on our model of the communicator. How we act depends not only on the immediate effect but also on how we believe others will react. In this paper, we discuss PsychSim, an implemented multiagent-based simulation tool for modeling interactions and influence. While typical approaches to such modeling have used first-order logic, Psych-Sim agents have their own decision-theoretic model of the world, including beliefs about its environment and recursive models of other agents. Using these quantitative models of uncertainty and preferences, we have translated existing psychological theories into a decision-theoretic semantics that allow the agents to reason about degrees of believability in a novel way. We discuss PsychSim's underlying architecture and describe its application to a school violence scenario for illustration.",2005.0,16.0,204.0,{'pages': '1181-1186'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Pynadath2005PsychSimMT,\n author = {D.

For this purpose, common biosignal feature extraction methods were exploited and their capability to identify boredom was assessed. Moreover, for the first time, Legendre and Krawtchouk moments, as well as novel moment variations, were extracted as biosignal features and their potential toward automatic affect recognition was examined using the specific application scenario. The present analysis was conducted with ECG and GSR data collected from 19 different subjects, while boredom was naturally induced during the repetitive playing of a 3D video game. Conventional biosignal features as well as moment-based ones were found to be effective for the automatic recognition of boredom by achieving classification accuracies around 85 percent. Then, the joint use of moments and moment variations with conventional features was found to significantly improve classification accuracy by producing a maximum correct classification ratio of 94.17 percent.",2011.0,43.0,65.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '119-133', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Giakoumis2011AutomaticRO,\n author = {Dimitrios Giakoumis and D.

This essential emotional component how- ever, needs to be continuously monitored. Emotion regulation strategies target the potential risk of having inappropriate level of emotions in the process of decision making. This study is a follow-up on a formerly proposed computational model for emotion regulation strategies based on Gross theory and applies several enhancements to it. In particular, we extend the dynamism and realism of the original model by considering a dynamic environment in which we study the effect of emotion eliciting events such as psychiatric therapies or traumas occurring during the simulation period. Furthermore, the new model uses an emotion-dependent regulation process based on the mood of individuals. This approach is consistent with human behavior in the real life. In addition, some key pa- rameters in our proposed computational model, such as emotion persistence factor were made adaptive. Results obtained from the simulation experiments using our proposed model show further consistency with the base theory.",2012.0,22.0,4.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Soleimani2012AMD,\n author = {Ahmad Soleimani and Ziad Kobti},\n title = {A Mood Driven Computational Model for Gross Emotion Regulation Process Paradigm},\n year = {2012}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '9458014', 'name': 'Ahmad Soleimani'}, {'authorId': '1763459', 'name': 'Ziad Kobti'}]"

However, given the everyday problems that patients struggle with, questions of ecological validity arise. For example, abstract tasks have little meaning to patients and decrease motivation to practice skills frequently. This study proposes a spatial memory task with high ecological validity that can be integrated into any virtual environment. Environments and target objects can be individually designed for each user to provide a relevant context and high motivation for patients with cognitive deficits. The task has been evaluated with both brain-injured and healthy individuals. 45 participants completed the virtual task and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Strong associations have been found with established tests of visual short-term memory. Due to high variability of test scores, no significant relationship with tests of spatial abilities has been established. High ecological validity of the spatial memory task caused five patients to show awareness of their cognitive deficits.

146,0b98cf62799ff0dd4900e937a7a5d2f8c56af110,The double-edged sword: Emotional regulation for children at risk,"Abstract The capacity to manage emotion is based on the growth of self-regulatory capacities in the early years, but is also affected by situational demands, influences from other people, and the child's goals for regulating emotion in a particular setting. For most children growing up in supportive contexts, the growth of emotional regulation is associated with enhanced psychosocial well-being and socioemotional competence. But for children who are at risk for the development of psychopathology owing to environmental stresses or intrinsic vulnerability (or their interaction), emotional regulation often entails inherent trade-offs that make nonoptimal strategics of managing emotion expectable, perhaps inevitable, in a context of difficult environmental demands and conflicting emotional goals. This analysis discusses how emotional regulation in children at risk may simultaneously foster both resiliency and vulnerability by considering how emotion is managed when children (a) are living with a parent who is depressed, (b) witness or experience domestic violence, or (c) are temperamentally inhibited when encountering novel challenges. In each case, the child's efforts to manage emotion may simultaneously buffer against certain stresses while also enhancing the child's vulnerability to other risks and demands. This double-edged sword of emotional regulation in conditions of risk for children cautions against using “optimal” emotional regulation as an evaluative standard for such children or assuming that emotional regulation necessarily improves psychosocial well-being. It also suggests how the study of emotional regulation must consider the goals for regulating emotion and the contexts in which those goals are sought.",1996.0,92.0,342.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '163 - 182', 'name': 'Development and Psychopathology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Thompson1996TheDS,\n author = {Ross A.

Accordingly, providing retrieval opportunity during vocabulary learning is encouraged in this essay. After reviewing some literature related to retrieval process, repetition is one effective way to promote retrieval process. Since repeated encounters of the words facilitate the students to access the words-related information in their mind, repetition activity will be the effective solution for this context. The spaced repetition as proposed by Baddley (1990) can be appropriate for this context since learners will not be bored about the repetition. This idea is then developed by providing students with Southeast Sulawesi folklore as the reading material in order to obtain target words. It is believed that this kind of reading material can enhance the students’ active engagement in the classroom as well.",2018.0,16.0,5.0,"{'volume': '175', 'name': 'IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Atikah2018RepetitionFR,\n author = {D.

It is a life-long disability that prevents people from understanding what they see, hear, and sense. This results in severe problems with social relationships, communications, and behavior. Autism is typically diagnosed between the ages of two and six, although variations of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) can sometimes be diagnosed earlier or later [1]. Children with learning disability such as autism who have serious impairments with social, emotional and communication skills require high degree of personalization in using the educational software developed for them. In this paper we present a personalized game based on digital story-telling concept that helps the children of age ranging from 9 to 14 years old with autism to understand the use of money. It also teaches the autistic children the social behavior appropriate while shopping.

A comparison between a virtual and a real waiting situation concerning boredom, self-regulation, and the experience of time.","Virtual environments are typically associated with entertainment and a fast subjective passage of time. This study examined the opposite effect by exposing participants (n = 83) to a virtual reality (VR) waiting room for 7.5 min. We assessed the participants’ capacity for emotion regulation and self-control as well as their level of boredom, affective states, and experience of time while waiting. We designed this study after one previously conducted by in a real waiting room, based on which we modeled the virtual room to compare the results. We expected our VR study to yield similar results to the real waiting room study, with correlations between boredom and a slower passage of time and increased thinking about time. Participants with a higher capacity for emotion regulation and self-control were expected to be less bored and experience time as passing faster than others. VR being an interesting new technology, we hypothesized that the virtual waiting room would be less boring and therefore lead to a faster subjective passage of time than the real room. Our results partly confirm the findings of the real waiting room study, showing correlations between boredom and increased thinking about time and a slower subjective passage of time. Contrary to our expectations, waiting in VR was more boring and led to a slower experience of time and more thoughts about time than waiting in the real room.

Such prototypic expressions, however, occur rather infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are more often communicated by changes in one or a few discrete facial features. In this paper, we develop an Automatic Face Analysis (AFA) system to analyze facial expressions based on both permanent facial features (brows, eyes, mouth) and transient facial features (deepening of facial furrows) in a nearly frontal-view face image sequence. The AFA system recognizes fine-grained changes in facial expression into action units (AUs) of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), instead of a few prototypic expressions. Multistate face and facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling the various facial features, including lips, eyes, brows, cheeks, and furrows. During tracking, detailed parametric descriptions of the facial features are extracted. With these parameters as the inputs, a group of action units (neutral expression, six upper face AUs and 10 lower face AUs) are recognized whether they occur alone or in combinations. The system has achieved average recognition rates of 96.4 percent (95.4 percent if neutral expressions are excluded) for upper face AUs and 96.7 percent (95.6 percent with neutral expressions excluded) for lower face AUs. The generalizability of the system has been tested by using independent image databases collected and FACS-coded for ground-truth by different research teams.",2001.0,53.0,1819.0,"{'volume': '23 2', 'pages': '\n          97-115\n        ', 'name': 'IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2001RecognizingAU,\n author = {Ying-li Tian and T.

Assessment of this trait in stroke subjects with a standardized tool would promote the rehabilitation protocols and occupational therapy interventions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to standardize the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) for Persian Iranian people who have had strokes. Methods: A descriptive observational study was adopted in order to standardize the CD-RISC in stroke population. The population was comprised of 34 female and 29 male subjects with a mean age of 51.4±10.6 years and the history of ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents. Subjects were recruited based on inclusion criteria within the period of two months between May and July of 2014. Descriptive statistics were calculated along with the Cronbach's alpha to determine reliability. Standard multiple regression analyses searched for any correlation between variables and resilience. Results: Statistical parameters revealed a mean of 58.4±15.5 for CD-RISC raw scores. Percentile ranks were also calculated from raw data. Cronbach's alpha of 0.892 revealed that the CD-RISC had high reliability for the population of this study. Multiple regression analyses showed that the functional status was the only variable that uniquely predicted subjects’ resilience (s = 0.41; P< 0.01). Conclusion: The findings of this research confirmed applicability of CD-RISC in Iranian people who have had strokes. The standardized CD-RISC was determined to be suitable for use in the clinic and for utilization in research studies in Iranian people status post-stroke.",2014.0,27.0,24.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '73-77', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Alireza2014StandardizationOC,\n author = {Derakhshan Rad Seyed Alireza and Piven Emily and Rassafiani Mehdi and Hosseini Seyed Ali and M.

The design of such systems reflects a compromise between competing, sometimes unarticulated, demands: They must realistically exhibit the behaviors and characteristics of their role, they must facilitate the desired learning, and they must work within the limitations of current technology, and there is little theoretical or empirical guidance on the impact of these compromises on learning. Our perspective on this problem is shaped by our interest in the role of emotion and emotional behaviors in such forms of learning. In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in the role of emotion in the design of virtual humans. The techniques and motivations underlying these various efforts can seem, from an outsider's perspective, as bewildering and multifaceted as the concept of emotion itself is generally accused of being. Drawing on insights from emotion psychology, this article attempts to clarify for the designers of educational agents the various theoretical perspectives on the concept of emotion with the aim of giving guidance to designers of educational agents.",2005.0,88.0,94.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '215 - 233', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gratch2005LESSONSFE,\n author = {J.

This reflects the power of presence – seen as the feeling of being located in a perceived, external world – in developing and affecting psychological wellbeing. Until today Virtual reality Environments (VEs) have been incorporated into a variety of clinical and everyday settings to improve mental health. Nevertheless many areas in the health field can be still explored by using this innovative technology. One example is represented by stress management area, one of the leading mental health problems of western societies linked to several pathologies. Following this trend our proposal is to investigate with a non clinical sample the efficacy of a relaxing narrative through a virtual experience. In a controlled study we compared three different media: Immersive VR, DVD and Audio speaker, by using the same therapeutic narrative and protocol. A control group without treatment was also included in the study. The sample included 60 university students, randomly divided in four experimental conditions. Non parametric test and correlation were used to analyse self-reports and physiological parameters. Within groups analysis - in both VR and DVD conditions - showed a significant improvement of the emotional state and significative physiological changes. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that a relationship exists between the sense of presence and the outcome achieved by the mediated experience. However, the absence of significant differences from the analysis between groups suggests that the principal determinant of presence might be the content proposed within the mediated experience. Further reflections about sense of presence in relaxing virtual environments will be discussed.",2008.0,39.0,20.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '7-25', 'name': 'PsychNology J.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Villani2008PresenceAR,\n author = {D.

The availability of these data sets, combined with the convergence between social and computer sciences, has led researchers to develop automated methods to extract digital traces from social media and use them to predict individual psychological characteristics and behaviors. In this article, we reviewed the literature on this topic and conducted a series of meta-analyses to determine the strength of associations between digital traces and specific individual characteristics; personality, psychological well-being, and intelligence. Potential moderator effects were analyzed with respect to type of social media platform, type of digital traces examined, and study quality. Our findings indicate that digital traces from social media can be studied to assess and predict theoretically distant psychosocial characteristics with remarkable accuracy. Analysis of moderators indicated that the collection of specific types of information (i.e., user demographics), and the inclusion of different types of digital traces, could help improve the accuracy of predictions.",2018.0,0.0,62.0,"{'volume': '21 4', 'pages': '\n          217-228\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Settanni2018PredictingIC,\n author = {Michele Settanni and Danny Azucar and D.

166,0cd5df8f88339d9b8ba7ae83dfe6df14d09ca949,"More Realistic Human Behavior Models for Agents in Virtual Worlds: Emotion, Stress, and Value Ontologies","This paper focuses on challenges to improving the behavioral realism of computer generated agents and attempts to reflect the state of the art in human behavior modeling with particular attention to value ontologies, emotion, and stress in game-theoretic settings. The goal is to help those interested in constructing more realistic software agents for use in simulations, in virtual reality environments, and in training and performance aiding settings such as on the web or in embedded applications. This paper pursues this goal by providing a framework for better integrating the theories and models contained in the diverse human behavior modeling literatures, such as those that straddle physiological, cognitive and emotive processes; individual differences; emergent group and crowd behavior; and (punctuated) equilibria in social settings. The framework is based on widely available ontologies of world values and how these and physiological factors might be construed emotively into subjective expected utilities to guide the reactions and deliberations of agents. For example what makes one set of opponent groups differ from another? This framework serves as an extension of Markov decision processes appropriate for iterative play in game-theoretic settings, with particular emphasis on agent capabilities for redefining drama and for finding meta-games to counter the human player.

These findings have been interpreted as evidence for recruitment of controlled processes, at the expense of automatic processes when responding to emotional stimuli. However, activation of semantic areas has also been reported. The aim of the present work was to address the issue of the importance of semantic areas in emotion regulation by comparing recruitment of executive and semantic neural substrates in studies investigating different reappraisal strategies. With this aim, we reviewed neuroimaging studies on reappraisal and we classified them in two main categories: reappraisal of stimuli (RS) and reappraisal via perspective taking (RPT). We applied a coordinate-based meta-analysis to summarize the results of fMRI studies on different reappraisal strategies. Our results showed that reappraisal, when considered regardless of the specific instruction used in the studies, involved both executive and semantic areas of the brain. When considering different reappraisal strategies separately, in contrast, we found areas associated with executive function to be prominently recruited by RS, even if also semantic areas were activated. Instead, in RPT the most important clusters of brain activity were found in parietal and temporal semantic areas, without significant clusters in executive areas. These results indicate that modulation of activity in semantic areas may constitute an important aspect of emotion regulation in reappraisal, suggesting that semantic processes may be more important to understand the mechanism of emotion regulation than previously thought.",2015.0,93.0,84.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Messina2015ExecutiveAS,\n author = {Irene Messina and Simone Bianco and M.

But do such effects depend on the motives underlying these attempts? In an experimental study, we tested whether leaders' apparent motives influence the effects of their interpersonal emotion regulation on followers. We found that the positive effects of using affect-improving (vs. affect-worsening) strategies on relational outcomes and discretional performance outcomes were largely enhanced when the leader exhibited prosocial motives but diminished when the leader exhibited egoistic motives. Our findings add nuance to our understanding of the effects of interpersonal emotion regulation at work. Practitioner points: When leaders try to influence their followers' emotions, the consequences not only depend on the type of strategy used (improving vs. worsening), but also the leaders' apparent motives. If egoistic (vs. prosocial) motives underpin leaders' interpersonal emotional regulation, the positive effects of affect-improving (vs. affect-worsening) on leader–follower relationship quality and follower discretional performance are significantly reduced. Leaders should be aware of the behaviours they use during interactions with their followers as well as how their motives might be perceived.",2019.0,16.0,17.0,{'name': 'Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Niven2019DoTE,\n author = {Karen Niven and A.

It is based on findings from the JISC-funded DEsign of Learning spaces in 3D Virtual Environments (DELVE) project at the University of Nottingham and the Open University. Given continued confusion about the term immersion, what it means for a learner to be immersed, and the relationship between immersion, presence and engagement, notions of immersion and engagement in 3D virtual environments are explored in the context of previous published studies ranging from virtual reality to psychology. The resultant improved understanding of the terminology is then used as the basis for coding results from a qualitative, inductive analysis of 20 students that undertook a substantive learning task in the virtual environment Second Life. Emergent themes from the analysis identify key factors that act to both enhance and restrict learner engagement in 3D virtual worlds and a set of principles for practitioners who wish to use 3D virtual environments to enhance learner engagement is presented.",2009.0,25.0,47.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '40 - 55', 'name': 'Innovation in Teaching and Learning in Information and Computer Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mount2009LearnerIE,\n author = {N.

Given the important contribution of caregiver emotion socialization, parenting programs targeting these socialization practices represent an effective method of preventative intervention for childhood difficulties with emotion regulation. This review examines emotion socialization parenting programs that target the development of emotion regulation in young children aged 0-6. Through a systematic search of multiple databases, 1117 articles were retrieved for title, abstract, and full-text screening. After screening, 12 articles remained and were summarized using a narrative approach. Herein, we provide an overview of 3 main intervention frameworks: Tuning in to Kids (TIK), Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Emotion Development (PCIT-ED), and Emotion Enhanced Triple P (EETP). Overall, these emotion socialization programs have demonstrated efficacy in their ability to improve parenting behaviors related to the coaching of young children's emotion regulation; however, there has been limited examination of their effectiveness in promoting children's emotion regulation. Future research is required to address this limitation, with rigorous parenting intervention studies incorporating valid assessments of children's emotion regulation in order to promote children's development of adaptive emotion regulation.

Experiment 1 tested a group of adults diagnosed with AS/HFA (n = 19) who used the software at home for 10–15 weeks. Participants were tested on recognition of faces and voices at three different levels of generalization. A matched control group of adults with AS/HFA (n = 22) were assessed without any intervention. In addition, a third group of general population controls (n = 24) was tested. Experiment 2 repeated the design of Experiment 1 with a group of adults with AS/HFA who used the software at home and met in a group with a tutor on a weekly basis. They were matched to a control group of adults with AS/HFA attending social skills training and to a general population control group (n = 13 for all three groups). In both experiments the intervention group improved significantly more than the control group on close, but not distant, generalization tasks. Verbal IQ had significant effects in Experiment 2. Using Mind Reading for a relatively short period of time allows users to learn to recognize a variety of complex emotions and mental states. However, additional methods are required to enhance generalization.The first author was supported by the National Alliance for Autism Research, the Corob Charitable Trust, the Cambridge Overseas Trust and B'nai B'rith Leo Baeck scholarships.

In the present study subjects were exposed to pictures of happy and angry facial expressions, in response to which their facial electromyographic (EMG) activities, heart rate (HR), and palmar skin conductance responses (SCRs) were recorded. It was found that happy and angry faces evoked different facial EMG response patterns, with increased zygomatic region activity to happy stimuli and increased corrugator region activity to angry stimuli. Furthermore, both happy and angry faces evoked HR decelerations and similar SCR magnitudes.

In particular, a holistic method of extracting affective information from the multifaceted audio stream has been introduced. Besides classifying every scene in Hollywood domain movies probabilistically into the affective categories, some exciting applications are demonstrated.

We surveyed 280 users, and qualitatively interviewed 12 users to understand their expectation from a conversational agent in adapting the interaction style. Grounded on our findings, we develop a first-of-its-kind emotion regulator for a conversational agent on kinetic earable that dynamically adjusts its conversation style, tone, volume in response to users emotional, environmental, social and activity context gathered through speech prosody, motion signals and ambient sound. We describe these context models, the end-to-end system including a purpose-built kinetic earable and their real-world assessment. The experimental results demonstrate that our regulation mechanism invariably elicits better and affective user experience in comparison to baseline conditions in different real-world settings.",2019.0,29.0,15.0,"{'name': '2019 8th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)', 'pages': '725-731'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Katayama2019SituationAwareER,\n author = {Shin Katayama and Akhil Mathur and M.

Poor engagement may lead to worse clinical outcomes, with symptom relapse and rehospitalization. Numerous variables may affect level of treatment engagement, including therapeutic alliance, accessibility of care, and a client's trust that the treatment will address his/her own unique goals. As such, we have found that the concept of recovery‐oriented care, which prioritizes autonomy, empowerment and respect for the person receiving services, is a helpful framework in which to view tools and techniques to enhance treatment engagement. Specifically, person‐centered care, including shared decision making, is a treatment approach that focuses on an individual's unique goals and life circumstances. Use of person‐centered care in mental health treatment models has promising outcomes for engagement. Particular populations of people have historically been difficult to engage, such as young adults experiencing a first episode of psychosis, individuals with coexisting psychotic and substance use disorders, and those who are homeless. We review these populations and outline how various evidence‐based, recovery‐oriented treatment techniques have been shown to enhance engagement. Our review then turns to emerging treatment strategies that may improve engagement. We focus on use of electronics and Internet, involvement of peer providers in mental health treatment, and incorporation of the Cultural Formulation Interview to provide culturally competent, person‐centered care. Treatment engagement is complex and multifaceted, but optimizing recovery‐oriented skills and attitudes is essential in delivery of services to those with serious mental illness.",2016.0,77.0,351.0,"{'volume': '15', 'name': 'World Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dixon2016TreatmentEO,\n author = {L.

Employing a multiple baseline design, 13 males (9.0–10.2 years of age) with a history of school suspensions were sequentially introduced to KooLKIDS, a school-based interactive multimedia intervention for young children with EOCP and CU. Teacher and child self-report data revealed significant reductions for the group in proactive and reactive aggression, and antisocial traits. Significant changes in the desired direction were also found on measures of emotion regulation. When the data were analyzed for each individual child, however, the magnitude of any effects for behaviour change varied greatly.

The lack of information about the content of therapy packages is a frequent criticism in stroke rehabilitation research. This study aimed to describe, in detail, the content of one aspect of physiotherapy; the rehabilitation of postural control. Methods. The design was a cross-sectional survey and the setting was in 11 NHS Trusts. The participants were 35 stroke physiotherapists working in acute and rehabilitation settings who recorded the treatment of 132 patients in 644 treatment sessions using the Stroke Physiotherapy Intervention Recording Tool. Analysis was carried out by descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVAS and chi-squares which were used to describe content of interventions and effects of the aim of treatment. Results and conclusions. Physiotherapists' clinical practice focused on therapist-led interventions, which aimed to normalize muscle tone and promote normal movement patterns. The most frequent interventions were ‘preparation for treatment’ (n = 1969, 43%), ‘practising balance and walking activities’ (n = 1583, 34%) and ‘practising functional tasks’ (n = 703, 15%). Interventions to encourage independence or activity outside the treatment session were rarely used. This pattern was seen regardless of the aim of treatment (the restoration of sitting balance, standing balance or stepping/walking).",2006.0,30.0,34.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '865 - 872', 'name': 'Disability and Rehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tyson2006ACA,\n author = {S.

197,0fabf5ebff05a958bdf720eddd1a950335e08a67,Listeners as co-narrators.,"A collaborative theory of narrative story-telling was tested in two experiments that examined what listeners do and their effect on the narrator. In 63 unacquainted dyads (81 women and 45 men), a narrator told his or her own close-call story. The listeners made 2 different kinds of listener responses: Generic responses included nodding and vocalizations such as ""mhm."" Specific responses, such as wincing or exclaiming, were tightly connected to (and served to illustrate) what the narrator was saying at the moment. In experimental conditions that distracted listeners from the narrative content, listeners made fewer responses, especially specific ones, and the narrators also told their stories significantly less well, particularly at what should have been the dramatic ending. Thus, listeners were co-narrators both through their own specific responses, which helped illustrate the story, and in their apparent effect on the narrator's performance. The results demonstrate the importance of moment-by-moment collaboration in face-to-face dialogue.",2000.0,53.0,572.0,"{'volume': '79 6', 'pages': '\n          941-52\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bavelas2000ListenersAC,\n author = {J.

The main objective of this meta‐analysis is to compare the efficacy of VRET, used in a behavioral or cognitive‐behavioral framework, with that of the classical evidence‐based treatments, in anxiety disorders. A comprehensive search of the literature identified 23 studies (n = 608) that were included in the final analysis. The results show that in the case of anxiety disorders, (1) VRET does far better than the waitlist control; (2) the post‐treatment results show similar efficacy between the behavioral and the cognitive behavioral interventions incorporating a virtual reality exposure component and the classical evidence‐based interventions, with no virtual reality exposure component; (3) VRET has a powerful real‐life impact, similar to that of the classical evidence‐based treatments; (4) VRET has a good stability of results over time, similar to that of the classical evidence‐based treatments; (5) there is a dose–response relationship for VRET; and (6) there is no difference in the dropout rate between the virtual reality exposure and the in vivo exposure.

200,0fb4fc357b0e7f9366809898d32680dacf82462e,Social Touch in Human–Computer Interaction,"Touch is our primary non-verbal communication channel for conveying intimate emotions and as such essential for our physical and emotional wellbeing. In our digital age, human social interaction is often mediated. However, even though there is increasing evidence that mediated touch affords affective communication, current communication systems (such as videoconferencing) still do not support communication through the sense of touch. As a result, mediated communication does not provide the intense affective experience of co-located communication. The need for ICT mediated or generated touch as an intuitive way of social communication is even further emphasized by the growing interest in the use of touch-enabled agents and robots for healthcare, teaching, and telepresence applications. Here, we review the important role of social touch in our daily life and the available evidence that affective touch can be mediated reliably between humans and between humans and digital agents. We base our observations on evidence from psychology, computer science, sociology, and neuroscience with focus on the first two. Our review shows that mediated affective touch can modulate physiological responses, increase trust and affection, help to establish bonds between humans and avatars or robots, and initiate pro-social behavior. We argue that ICT mediated or generated social touch can (a) intensify the perceived social presence of remote communication partners and (b) enable computer systems to more effectively convey affective information. However, this research field on the crossroads of ICT and psychology is still embryonic and we identify several topics that can help to mature the field in the following areas: establishing an overarching theoretical framework, employing better research methodologies, developing basic social touch building blocks, and solving specific ICT challenges.",2015.0,204.0,139.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '2', 'name': 'Frontiers Digit.

To investigate functional neural plasticity underlying the augmentation of empathy and to test the counteracting potential of compassion, one group of participants was first trained in empathic resonance and subsequently in compassion. In response to videos depicting human suffering, empathy training, but not memory training (control group), increased negative affect and brain activations in anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex-brain regions previously associated with empathy for pain. In contrast, subsequent compassion training could reverse the increase in negative effect and, in contrast, augment self-reports of positive affect. In addition, compassion training increased activations in a non-overlapping brain network spanning ventral striatum, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. We conclude that training compassion may reflect a new coping strategy to overcome empathic distress and strengthen resilience.",2014.0,45.0,483.0,"{'volume': '9 6', 'pages': '\n          873-9\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Klimecki2014DifferentialPO,\n author = {O.

Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. Objective The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. Methods A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. Results A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-.63, P=.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r=-.58, P=.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r=-.58, P=.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated (r=.54, P=.011, and r=.52, P=.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥5) from those without (PHQ-9 score <5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants’ PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5%. Conclusions Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.",2015.0,41.0,568.0,"{'volume': '17', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Saeb2015MobilePS,\n author = {Sohrab Saeb and Mi Zhang and C.

The need-to-access gap is especially wide among children and adolescents, with up to 80% of youths with mental health needs going without services, and the remainder often receiving insufficient or untested care. Single-session interventions (SSIs) may offer a promising path toward improving accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and completion rates for youth mental health services. SSIs are structured programs that intentionally involve only one visit or encounter with a clinic, provider, or program; they may serve as stand-alone or adjunctive clinical services. A growing body of evidence supports the capacity of SSIs to reduce and prevent youth psychopathology of multiple types. Here, we provide a working definition of SSIs for use in future research and practice; summarize the literature to date on SSIs for child and adolescent mental health; and propose recommendations for the future design, evaluation, and implementation of SSIs across a variety of settings and contexts. We hope that this paper will serve as an actionable research agenda for gauging the full potential of SSIs as a force for youth mental health.",2019.0,103.0,92.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '264 - 278', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schleider2019FutureDI,\n author = {J.

However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and “meltdowns”). In this study, 21 high‐functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group‐matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age‐appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy. Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long‐term outcomes in youth with ASD.

213,11a3974ceb49f7ccda03ae9fd1ef89892de142fc,Depression and mental control: the resurgence of unwanted negative thoughts.,"In three experiments we examined depressed individuals' mental control abilities and strategies. Experiment 1 revealed that although depressed college students were initially successful in suppressing negative material, they eventually experienced a resurgence of unwanted negative thoughts. Analysis of subjects' stream-of-consciousness reports indicated that this resurgence was associated with the use of negative thoughts as distracters from the unwanted item. In Experiment 2 depressed subjects acknowledged that positive distracters were more effective than negative ones in suppressing negative thoughts. This acknowledgement suggests that depressed subjects in Experiment 1 did not deliberately focus on negative distracters but that those thoughts automatically occurred because they were highly accessible. Experiment 3 demonstrated that depressed subjects' use of positive distracters could be increased somewhat when we provided such distracters and made them easily accessible. Taken together, the findings suggest that depression involves an enhanced accessibility of interconnected negative thoughts that can undermine mental control efforts.",1988.0,31.0,412.0,"{'volume': '55 6', 'pages': '\n          882-92\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wenzlaff1988DepressionAM,\n author = {R.

Yet, the neural mechanisms supporting the training of these emotions are poorly understood. To study affective plasticity in healthy adults, we measured functional neural and subjective responses to witnessing the distress of others in a newly developed task (Socio-affective Video Task). Participants' initial empathic responses to the task were accompanied by negative affect and activations in the anterior insula and anterior medial cingulate cortex--a core neural network underlying empathy for pain. Whereas participants reacted with negative affect before training, compassion training increased positive affective experiences, even in response to witnessing others in distress. On the neural level, we observed that, compared with a memory control group, compassion training elicited activity in a neural network including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, putamen, pallidum, and ventral tegmental area--brain regions previously associated with positive affect and affiliation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the deliberate cultivation of compassion offers a new coping strategy that fosters positive affect even when confronted with the distress of others.",2013.0,56.0,491.0,"{'volume': '23 7', 'pages': '\n          1552-61\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Klimecki2013FunctionalNP,\n author = {O.

Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes indicate brain areas involved in stimulus processing.

To investigate the extent of residual variability the authors have collected over 300 MRI volumetric datasets from normal individuals and transformed these datasets into stereotaxic space using a 3D linear re-sampling algorithm. The authors then generated a series of statistical measures which express this population nonlinear variability in the form of parametric volumes, e.g. mean intensity, intensity variance. A model for anatomical variability, expressed as the width of a Gaussian blurring kernel applied to an ideal single subject, was developed and tested against the observed data.<<ETX>>",1993.0,9.0,1529.0,"{'pages': '1813-1817 vol.3', 'name': '1993 IEEE Conference Record Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Evans19933DSN,\n author = {Alan C.

219,11e45d0a34437fa5a3f660a66649c4e290c6b7ae,Mindfulness-Based Mobile Applications: Literature Review and Analysis of Current Features,"Background Interest in mindfulness has increased exponentially, particularly in the fields of psychology and medicine. The trait or state of mindfulness is significantly related to several indicators of psychological health, and mindfulness-based therapies are effective at preventing and treating many chronic diseases. Interest in mobile applications for health promotion and disease self-management is also growing. Despite the explosion of interest, research on both the design and potential uses of mindfulness-based mobile applications (MBMAs) is scarce. Objective Our main objective was to study the features and functionalities of current MBMAs and compare them to current evidence-based literature in the health and clinical setting. Methods We searched online vendor markets, scientific journal databases, and grey literature related to MBMAs. We included mobile applications that featured a mindfulness-based component related to training or daily practice of mindfulness techniques. We excluded opinion-based articles from the literature. Results The literature search resulted in 11 eligible matches, two of which completely met our selection criteria–a pilot study designed to evaluate the feasibility of a MBMA to train the practice of “walking meditation,” and an exploratory study of an application consisting of mood reporting scales and mindfulness-based mobile therapies. The online market search eventually analyzed 50 available MBMAs. Of these, 8% (4/50) did not work, thus we only gathered information about language, downloads, or prices. The most common operating system was Android. Of the analyzed apps, 30% (15/50) have both a free and paid version. MBMAs were devoted to daily meditation practice (27/46, 59%), mindfulness training (6/46, 13%), assessments or tests (5/46, 11%), attention focus (4/46, 9%), and mixed objectives (4/46, 9%). We found 108 different resources, of which the most used were reminders, alarms, or bells (21/108, 19.4%), statistics tools (17/108, 15.7%), audio tracks (15/108, 13.9%), and educational texts (11/108, 10.2%). Daily, weekly, monthly statistics, or reports were provided by 37% (17/46) of the apps. 28% (13/46) of them permitted access to a social network. No information about sensors was available. The analyzed applications seemed not to use any external sensor. English was the only language of 78% (39/50) of the apps, and only 8% (4/50) provided information in Spanish. 20% (9/46) of the apps have interfaces that are difficult to use. No specific apps exist for professionals or, at least, for both profiles (users and professionals). We did not find any evaluations of health outcomes resulting from the use of MBMAs. Conclusions While a wide selection of MBMAs seem to be available to interested people, this study still shows an almost complete lack of evidence supporting the usefulness of those applications. We found no randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of these applications on mindfulness training or health indicators, and the potential for mobile mindfulness applications remains largely unexplored.",2013.0,76.0,175.0,"{'volume': '1', 'name': 'JMIR mHealth and uHealth'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Plaza2013MindfulnessBasedMA,\n author = {I.

Individuals experiencing impairment due to depressive symptomatology are most likely to report their symptoms to a primary care provider. As such, national guidelines highlight the need to assess and effectively treat depression via primary care. Despite these guidelines, the dissemination of evidence-based psychotherapy via primary care is limited, likely due to both provider- and patient-level treatment barriers. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are promising for addressing these barriers and for promoting uptake of evidence-based depression treatment. Among evidence-based psychotherapies for depression, brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) has shown great promise and is particularly amenable to mHealth delivery.

The chapter reviews these developments briefly and attempts to identify gaps in the field and new directions in recent research. There are notable shortcomings in several important topics: measurement and evaluation of chronic stress and depression; exploration of potentially different processes of stress and depression associated with first-onset versus recurrent episodes; possible gender differences in exposure and reactivity to stressors; testing kindling/sensitization processes; longitudinal tests of diathesis-stress models; and understanding biological stress processes associated with naturally occurring stress and depressive outcomes. There is growing interest in moving away from unidirectional models of the stress-depression association, toward recognition of the effects of contexts and personal characteristics on the occurrence of stressors, and on the likelihood of progressive and dynamic relationships between stress and depression over time-including effects of childhood and lifetime stress exposure on later reactivity to stress.",2005.0,140.0,2636.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '\n          293-319\n        ', 'name': 'Annual review of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hammen2005StressAD,\n author = {C.

An alternating treatment conditions design was established and a non-concurrent multiple baseline design across individuals (four participants) was used. Both conditions were equally effective and after the treatment all the participants took a flight. At the end of each session the participants were asked for their opinion on the condition they received. High mean scores were obtained in both conditions; non-significant differences between the two conditions were found. When the treatment was finished the participants were also asked for their preferences regarding both treatment conditions. All participants preferred VRET+CR, considered it more effective, recommended it more to others, and claimed this treatment was less aversive.

I argue that properly regulating one’s emotions displays emotional rationality, and failing to do so displays emotional irrationality. If an agent feels an emotion that is obviously problematic for the agent to feel and she is aware that it is problematic, then the agent ought to regulate her emotions in future similar situations. To capture this aspect of emotional rationality, I introduce the concept of imprudence, which is meant to capture a familiar way that we assess each other’s emotions, despite the fact that it has yet to be a factor in the literature on emotions in philosophy, psychology, or affective science.",2021.0,43.0,1.0,"{'name': 'Philosophical Psychology', 'pages': '453 - 473', 'volume': '34'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kerr2021OnTR,\n author = {Alison Duncan Kerr},\n journal = {Philosophical Psychology},\n pages = {453 - 473},\n title = {On the rationality of emotion regulation},\n volume = {34},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '122035405', 'name': 'Alison Duncan Kerr'}]"

The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of ""gaming"" has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so.",2014.0,85.0,1650.0,"{'volume': '69 1', 'pages': '\n          66-78\n        ', 'name': 'The American psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Granic2014TheBO,\n author = {I.

The present study focused on the ""similarity-attraction hypothesis,"" which predicts that people will prefer to interact with others who are similar in personality. In a 2 × 2, balanced, between-subjects experiment (n = 48), dominant and submissive subjects were randomly matched with a computer that was endowed with the properties associated with dominance or submissiveness. Subjects recognized the computer's personality type, distinct from friendliness and competence. In addition, subjects not only preferred the similar computer, but they were more satisfied with the interaction. The findings demonstrate that personality does not require richly defined agents, sophisticated pictorial representations, nautral language processing, or artificial intelligence.

In a meta-analysis of 28 studies including 1,880 adults, the authors reviewed the world's published literature on cognitive-behavioral therapies (CT) aimed at preventing relapse-recurrence in MDD. Results indicate that after discontinuation of acute-phase treatment, many responders to CT relapse-recur (29% within 1 year and 54% within 2 years). These rates appear comparable to those associated with other depression-specific psychotherapies but lower than those associated with pharmacotherapy. Among acute-phase treatment responders, continuation-phase CT reduced relapse-recurrence compared with assessment only at the end of continuation treatment (21% reduction) and at follow-up (29% reduction). Continuation-phase CT also reduced relapse-recurrence compared with other active continuation treatments at the end of continuation treatment (12% reduction) and at follow-up (14% reduction).

All these knowledge tools are typically strongly supported by statistical software including the open-source programming language R. Within this environment, there are nearly 100 packages to support meta-analyses each with different functions and specific capabilities (Lortie and Filazzola 2020). Meta-analyses are defined in most domains as the calculation of effect sizes or a weighted relative strength of evidence from a set of studies or trials to then subsequently examine high-level statistical patterns and variance (Gurevitch, Koricheva, Nakagawa, and Stewart 2018). They are increasingly used in many fields of science to examine consilience in hypotheses (Lortie 2014) and have been proposed as the gold or even platinum standard of evidence when there is statistical agreement in the efficacy of an intervention across studies (Stegenga 2011).

We conducted 2 autobiographical recall studies to investigate receivers' evaluations of intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation interactions, to ascertain the number of dimensions required to capture variation in those evaluations, and then to examine associations of those dimensions with perceived benefits of the interactions. To do so, we developed a new questionnaire, the Interpersonal Regulation Interaction Scale (IRIS). In Study 1 (n = 390), an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the IRIS yielded 4 dimensions, which we labeled responsiveness, hostility, cognitive support, and physical presence. Each dimension was uniquely associated with perceived benefits of receiving interpersonal emotion regulation. In Study 2, we collected multiple, diverse samples (ns = 199-895) and found support for the replicability and generalizability of key findings from Study 1, including the factor structure and associations with perceived benefits. In summary, across 2 studies and multiple, diverse samples, we identified 4 conceptually and practically important dimensions of receivers' evaluations of interpersonal emotion regulation interactions and developed a brief measure that taps interaction variability in these dimensions.

The Guilford Press, New York, 1998, 438 pp., $50.00, ISBN 1-57230-102-3. Attachment theory, as first espoused by John Bowlby, became a pervasive theoretical influence on clinicans and researchers working with children, parents, and families. The work of Mary Ainsworth introducing the methodology of the Strange Situation made it possible to observe parent-child dyads and assess the type of relationship. The categories of secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-anxious attachment, later extended to include disorganized attachment, were ways of describing different attachment patterns. According to Bowlby, attachment paradigms are encoded in internal working models, the theorized basis for developing attachment systems. Both Bowlby and Ainsworth assumed internal working models formed in early childhood persisted throughout life and continued to be vital into maturity, and beyond maturity into old age. The concept of internal working models was used to account for continuity in relationships and transmission of trauma between generations. Can the attachment model be extended meaningfully to adult relationships and development throughout a lifetime? The purpose of this intriguing and informative synthetic volume edited by Jeffrey Simpson and Steven Rholes is to orient us to important theoretical and empirical advances that have taken place in the area of adult attachment during the last decade. They distinguish two components within attachment theory. The first component is normative and attempts to explain stages of development through which nearly all human beings pass. A second component is focused on individual differences and attempts to explain stable deviations from modal behavioral patterns. Simpson and Rholes note the study of individual differences has dominated research for adults as well as children. The authors distinguish two traditions emanating from the study of individual differences. The first tradition, the nuclear family tradition, is exemplified by the work of Mary Main and her colleagues. They developed the Adult Attachment Interview to predict the Strange Situation behavior of respondents' children. The peer/romantic partner tradition, on the other hand, focuses on contemporary views and perceptions of current life partners. These studies utilize self-report questionnaires, accessing a more conscious domain of feelings. In this book, Simpson and Rholes focus almost exclusively on research and clinical work utilizing self-report measures. They recognize that the two traditions of research diverge not only in methodology, but also in generalizability of results. …",1999.0,0.0,162.0,"{'volume': '53', 'pages': '269-270', 'name': 'American Journal of Psychotherapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chazan1999AttachmentTA,\n author = {S.

Virtual agents should be capable of similarly empathizing with users in interactive environments. A key challenge posed by empathetic reasoning in virtual agents is determining whether to respond with parallel or reactive empathy. Parallel empathy refers to mere replication of another's affective state, whereas reactive empathy exhibits greater cognitive awareness and may lead to incongruent emotional responses (i.e., emotions different from the recipient's and perhaps intended to alter negative affect). Because empathy is not yet sufficiently well understood, it is unclear as to which type of empathy is most effective and under what circumstances they should be applied. Devising empirically informed models of empathy from observations of ""empathy in action"" may lead to virtual agents that can accurately respond in social situations. 
 
This paper proposes a unified inductive framework for modeling parallel and reactive empathy. First, in training sessions, a trainer guides a virtual agent through a series of problem-solving tasks in a learning environment and encounters empathetic characters. The proposed inductive architecture tracks situational data including actions, visited locations, intentions, and the trainer's physiological responses to generate models of empathy. Empathy models are used to drive runtime situation-appropriate empathetic behaviors by selecting suitable parallel or reactive empathetic expressions. An empirical evaluation of the approach in an interactive learning environment suggests that the induced empathy models can accurately assess social contexts and generate appropriate empathetic responses for virtual agent control.",2008.0,29.0,65.0,{'pages': '167-174'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{McQuiggan2008ModelingPA,\n author = {Scott W.

As an FDA cleared product on the market for more than 2 years, the collected body of patient data represents a unique and powerful source of clinical information. Analysis of a sample of 951 NUVANT patients has revealed interesting statistics on the prevalence of various cardiac arrhythmias in the patient population. The population is non-randomized and largely consists of US patients where a traditional Holter Monitor study was negative. The analysis here is focused on classifying the detected arrhythmias using potential therapy solutions as a classifier. Across the total population, 2.2% of patients presented arrhythmias indicating assessment for clinically significant tachycardia, 19% indications of potential bradycardia, 20% had indications of atrial fibrillation, 1% indicating arrhythmias requiring other conditional treatment, and 58% presenting arrhythmias likely not requiring treatment.",2012.0,6.0,39.0,"{'pages': '2440-2443', 'name': '2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Engel2012StudyOA,\n author = {Jonathan M.

To characterise these two aspects of awareness, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine monitoring of enduring traits ('narrative' focus, NF) or momentary experience ('experiential' focus, EF) in both novice participants and those having attended an 8 week course in mindfulness meditation, a program that trains individuals to develop focused attention on the present. In novices, EF yielded focal reductions in self-referential cortical midline regions (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) associated with NF. In trained participants, EF resulted in more marked and pervasive reductions in the mPFC, and increased engagement of a right lateralised network, comprising the lateral PFC and viscerosomatic areas such as the insula, secondary somatosensory cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Functional connectivity analyses further demonstrated a strong coupling between the right insula and the mPFC in novices that was uncoupled in the mindfulness group. These results suggest a fundamental neural dissociation between two distinct forms of self-awareness that are habitually integrated but can be dissociated through attentional training: the self across time and in the present moment.",2007.0,66.0,1156.0,"{'volume': '2 4', 'pages': '\n          313-22\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Farb2007AttendingTT,\n author = {N.

Early detection and prospective evaluation of individuals who will develop schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders are critical to efforts to isolate mechanisms underlying psychosis onset and to the testing of preventive interventions, but existing risk prediction approaches have achieved only modest predictive accuracy.


OBJECTIVES
To determine the risk of conversion to psychosis and to evaluate a set of prediction algorithms maximizing positive predictive power in a clinical high-risk sample.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Longitudinal study with a 2 1/2-year follow-up of 291 prospectively identified treatment-seeking patients meeting Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes criteria. The patients were recruited and underwent evaluation across 8 clinical research centers as part of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Time to conversion to a fully psychotic form of mental illness.


RESULTS
The risk of conversion to psychosis was 35%, with a decelerating rate of transition during the 2 1/2-year follow-up. Five features assessed at baseline contributed uniquely to the prediction of psychosis: a genetic risk for schizophrenia with recent deterioration in functioning, higher levels of unusual thought content, higher levels of suspicion/paranoia, greater social impairment, and a history of substance abuse. Prediction algorithms combining 2 or 3 of these variables resulted in dramatic increases in positive predictive power (ie, 68%-80%) compared with the prodromal criteria alone.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings demonstrate that prospective ascertainment of individuals at risk for psychosis is feasible, with a level of predictive accuracy comparable to that in other areas of preventive medicine. They provide a benchmark for the rate and shape of the psychosis risk function against which standardized preventive intervention programs can be compared.",2008.0,66.0,1240.0,"{'volume': '65 1', 'pages': '\n          28-37\n        ', 'name': 'Archives of general psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cannon2008PredictionOP,\n author = {Tyrone D.

Using the GT, 11% of healthy control participants and 61% of ISDs opted for choices with high immediate gains in spite of higher future losses. For the ISDs and controls with equal GT impairments, the ISDs performed significantly lower than controls on the DNMS task. The nonimpaired ISDs on the GT also performed significantly worse than matched controls on the DNMS task. The DNMS task deficit in ISDs was across all delay times, suggesting the deficit may lie in the ""executive"" process of working memory, which supports earlier findings (E. M. Martin et al., 2003). The authors suggest that the prefrontal cortex hosts multiple distinct mechanisms of decision making and inhibitory control and that ISDs may be affected in any one or combination of them.",2004.0,69.0,441.0,"{'volume': '18 1', 'pages': '\n          152-62\n        ', 'name': 'Neuropsychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bechara2004ImpairedDM,\n author = {A.

Relaxation techniques, which are facilitated by external (bio)feedback of electrodermal activity, can be used by trained subjects to actively control bodily and emotional arousal. Biofeedback relaxation provides an experimental model to explore neural mechanisms contributing to emotional representations and intentional autonomic control. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore neural mechanisms contributing to integration of volitional intent, self-representation, and autonomic states of arousal, embodied within performance of a biofeedback relaxation exercise. Data were obtained from 17 subjects to assess brain activity during relaxation in which a visual index of electrodermal arousal was modulated by accuracy (addition of random ""noise"") or sensitivity (by scalar adjustments of feedback). A central matrix of cortical, subcortical and brainstem autonomic centres was activated during biofeedback relaxation, as well as regions that mediate visual and somatesthetic representations and executive control. Anterior cingulate, amygdala, and insula activity was modulated by task manipulations that increased demand on processing interoceptive representations, while variation in anterior insula activity reflected an interaction between accuracy and sensitivity of feedback.

Affect and mood can influence what book people choose, based partly on whether their goal is to change or maintain their current emotional state. Once having chosen a book, the narrative itself acts to evoke and transform emotions, both directly through the events and characters depicted and through the cueing of emotionally valenced memories. Once evoked by the story, these emotions can in turn influence a person's experience of the narrative.

Of major interest is the fact that the authors propose a Multilevel Personality in Context (MPIC) model that may prove useful in understanding the multiple causal influences on subjective well-being and optimal functioning. We commend the authors for taking on such an ambitious project and agree that integrative perspectives in science in general, and personality psychology in particular, represent an important goal to pursue. Although we agree with several elements of the MPIC model, we also disagree with some aspects of the Sheldon et al. model and raise questions with respect to others. Using the Hierarchical Model of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation (Vallerand, 1997, 2007; Vallerand & Ratelle, 2002) as a lens, the purpose of this article is to present a critique of the MPIC model that focuses on its proposed structure, processes, and outcomes.

In this study, each participant played three games with a humanoid robot that played a drum whilst simultaneously making (or not making) head gestures. The three games included the participant interacting with the real robot (physical embodiment condition), interacting with a hidden robot when only the sound of the robot is heard (disembodiment condition; note that the term 'disembodiment' is used in this paper specifically to refer to an experimental condition where a physical robot produces the sound cues, but is not visible to the participants), or interacting with a real-time image of the robot (virtual embodiment condition). We used a mixed design where repeated measures were used to evaluate embodiment effects and independent-groups measures were used to study the gestures effects. Data from the implementation of a human–robot interaction experiment with 66 children are presented, and statistically analyzed in terms of participants' subjective experiences and drumming performance of the human–robot pair. The subjective experiences showed significant differences for the different embodiment conditions when gestures were used in terms of enjoyment of the game, and perceived intelligence and appearance of the robot. The drumming performance also differed significantly within the embodiment conditions and the presence of gestures increased these differences significantly. The presence of a physical, embodied robot enabled more interaction, better drumming and turn-taking, as well as enjoyment of the interaction, especially when the robot used gestures.",2009.0,61.0,116.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '1951 - 1996', 'name': 'Advanced Robotics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kose-Bagci2009EffectsOE,\n author = {H.

Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is a construct that describes the emergence at ≥50 years of age of sustained and impactful neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), as a precursor to cognitive decline and dementia. MBI describes NPS of any severity, which are not captured by traditional psychiatric nosology, persist for at least 6 months, and occur in advance of or in concert with mild cognitive impairment. While the detection and description of MBI has been operationalized in the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment - Alzheimer's Association (ISTAART-AA) research diagnostic criteria, there is no instrument that accurately reflects MBI as described.


OBJECTIVE
To develop an instrument based on ISTAART-AA MBI criteria.


METHODS
Eighteen subject matter experts participated in development using a modified Delphi process. An iterative process ensured items reflected the five MBI domains of 1) decreased motivation; 2) emotional dysregulation; 3) impulse dyscontrol; 4) social inappropriateness; and 5) abnormal perception or thought content. Instrument language was developed a priori to pertain to non-demented functionally independent older adults.


RESULTS
We present the Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C), a 34-item instrument, which can easily be completed by a patient, close informant, or clinician.


CONCLUSION
The MBI-C provides the first measure specifically developed to assess the MBI construct as explicitly described in the criteria. Its utility lies in MBI case detection, and monitoring the emergence of MBI symptoms and domains over time. Studies are required to determine the prognostic value of MBI for dementia development, and for predicting different dementia subtypes.",2017.0,47.0,249.0,"{'volume': '56 3', 'pages': '\n          929-938\n        ', 'name': ""Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD""}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Ismail2017TheMB,\n author = {Z.

271,15d2cee6ca6838c26bf6d53df4d8ba765b34940e,Cultural Differences in Interpersonal Emotion Regulation,"Cultural differences exist in the use of emotion regulation (ER) strategies, but the focus to date has been on intrapersonal ER strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal ER, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal ER strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) ER strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar ER strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (high frequency power – HF-HRV) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal ER strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated HF-HRV (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive ER, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased HF-HRV and decreased HR across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the ER prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The findings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal ER strategies may be more beneficial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term benefits.",2019.0,76.0,22.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Liddell2019CulturalDI,\n author = {B.

The core of the system is a real-time 3D virtual simulation of a classroom, populated by twenty-four semi-autonomous virtual students. The system has been designed as a companion tool for classroom management seminars in a syllabus for primary and secondary school teachers. Whereby, it will allow lecturers to link theory with practice, using the medium of VR. The system is therefore designed for two users: a trainee teacher and an instructor supervising the training session. The teacher is immersed in a real-time 3D simulation of a classroom by means of a head-mounted display and headphone. The instructor operates a graphical desktop console which renders a view of the class and the teacher, whose avatar movements are captured by a marker-less tracking system. This console includes a 2D graphics menu with convenient behaviour and feedback control mechanisms to provide human-guided training sessions. The system is built using low-cost consumer hardware and software. Its architecture and technical design are described in detail. A first evaluation confirms its conformance to critical usability requirements (i.e., safety and comfort, believability, simplicity, acceptability, extensibility, affordability and mobility).

These technologies not only illuminate our understanding of autism, but they can also be used to develop new technologies for people without autism. So, as well as being an area of specialism, I argue that VE research in autism has extended ‐ and will go onto ‐ the boundaries of human‐computer interaction more generally.

282,16cc547d1e6aa9f54de1f278bdcccf2b0efde790,Impact of stress on paranoia: an experimental investigation of moderators and mediators,"Background Vulnerability–stress models ascribe stress a pivotal role in the development of psychosis. However, moderating and mediating mechanisms translating stress into psychosis and the specificity of the association are not clearly established. It is hypothesized that stress will trigger paranoid ideation in vulnerable individuals through an increase in negative emotion. Method Using a repeated-measures design, 64 healthy participants with varying levels of vulnerability [psychosis symptoms assessed by the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE)] were assigned to a stress and a non-stress condition in random order. Stress was induced by exposing participants to building-site noise (75 dB) applied concurrently with difficult knowledge questions. Symptoms of paranoia, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were assessed by state-adapted versions of clinical scales. Results In the stress condition there was an increase in paranoia, depression and negative emotion. Multilevel linear modeling (MLM) revealed the increase in paranoia under stress to be moderated by the level of vulnerability and mediated by anxiety. Although participants generally showed an increase in anxiety under stress, anxiety was more strongly related to paranoia in participants with higher baseline symptomatology. Conclusions The results support and specify the role of emotional reactions to stressors on the pathway from vulnerability to psychosis and highlight the relevance of anxiety.",2008.0,71.0,142.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '1129 - 1139', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lincoln2008ImpactOS,\n author = {T.

Objective This study examined (1) whether older adults’ health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others’ homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or “other” racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults’ learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

With development, overt signs of social reticence may diminish but could still manifest themselves in neural responses to peers. We obtained measures of social reticence across 2 to 7 years of age. At age 11, preadolescents previously characterized as high (n = 30) or low (n = 23) in social reticence completed a novel functional-MRI-based peer-interaction task that quantifies neural responses to the anticipation and receipt of distinct forms of social evaluation. High (but not low) social reticence in early childhood predicted greater activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and left and right insula, brain regions implicated in processing salience and distress, when participants anticipated unpredictable compared with predictable feedback. High social reticence was also associated with negative functional connectivity between insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region commonly implicated in affect regulation.

Anxiety among health science students is a potential problem that may diminish their performance during OSCEs. This investigation aimed to fill the gap in the literature regarding the effectiveness of VR to reduce anxiety in OT students. Objective This investigation aimed to uncover the effectiveness of immersive VR in reducing state anxiety in OT students who were preparing for OSCEs. Methods A prospective, experimental, nonrandomized controlled trial compared levels of state anxiety, test anxiety, and academic self-efficacy in two groups of first-year OT students; these levels were measured at four different time points by self-reported psychometric scales, analyzed with a mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). Members of Phase 1 (NoVR) were not exposed to the VR simulation and acted as a control group for members of Phase 2 (YesVR), who were exposed to the VR simulation. VR simulation featured a virtual clinic and a standardized patient who students could interview in natural language. Measures of student study strategies and previous experience with VR were also recorded. Results A total of 49 participants—29 in the NoVR group and 20 in the YesVR group—showed that state anxiety had a rise-then-fall trend, peaking at the time point just before the OSCE. At that point, the YesVR students showed significantly less state anxiety than did the NoVR students (t46.19=2.34, P=.02, Cohen d=0.65, ηp2=0.105). The mean difference was 6.78 units (95% CI 0.96-12.61). In similar trends for both groups, student test anxiety remained relatively static across the time points, while academic self-efficacy continually increased. A moderate positive correlation was found for total time spent studying and peak state anxiety (NoVR r=.46, n=28, P=.01; YesVR r=.52, n=19, P=.02). Conclusions This investigation shows evidence of immersive VR’s capability to reduce state anxiety in OT students preparing for clinical practical exams.

As a step in this direction, this paper introduces a computational model for a Theory of Emotion Regulation (ToER), which combines the notions of Theory of Mind (ToM) and emotion regulation. This model has been implemented and tested using the modeling language LEADSTO, and found to show the expected behaviour. In addition, a virtual environment application has been developed, which is inhabited by agents that are equipped with the model for ToER. A first evaluation indicates that the model indeed enables the virtual agents to show more realistic affective behavior.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.",2001.0,13.0,53.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mellers2001EmotionRI,\n author = {A.

 We investigate the task of building open domain, conversational dialogue systems based on large dialogue corpora using generative models. Generative models produce system responses that are autonomously generated word-by-word, opening up the possibility for realistic, flexible interactions. In support of this goal, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and back-off n-gram models. We investigate the limitations of this and similar approaches, and show how its performance can be improved by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings.

Research has demonstrated their efficacy in a wide range of psychological conditions characterized by emotion dysregulation. Neuroimaging studies have evidenced functional and structural changes in a myriad of brain regions mainly involved in attention systems, emotion regulation, and self-referential processing. In this article we review studies on psychological and neurobiological correlates across different empirically derived models of research, including dispositional mindfulness, mindfulness induction, MBIs, and expert meditators in relation to emotion regulation. From the perspective of recent findings in the neuroscience of emotion regulation, we discuss the interplay of top-down and bottom-up emotion regulation mechanisms associated with different mindfulness models. From a phenomenological and cognitive perspective, authors have argued that mindfulness elicits a “mindful emotion regulation” strategy; however, from a clinical perspective, this construct has not been properly differentiated from other strategies and interventions within MBIs. In this context we propose the distinction between top-down and bottom-up mindfulness based emotion regulation strategies. Furthermore, we propose an embodied emotion regulation framework as a multilevel approach for understanding psychobiological changes due to mindfulness meditation regarding its effect on emotion regulation. Finally, based on clinical neuroscientific evidence on mindfulness, we open perspectives and dialogues regarding commonalities and differences between MBIs and other psychotherapeutic strategies for emotion regulation.",2017.0,170.0,296.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Guendelman2017MindfulnessAE,\n author = {Simón Guendelman and Sebastián Medeiros and H.

In this paper, we propose a model for designing trustworthy agents by assuming two factors of trust, that is, emotion and knowledgeableness perceived. Our hypothesis is that when a user feels happy and perceives an agent as being highly knowledgeable, a high level of trust results between the user and agent. We conducted four experiments with participants to verify this hypothesis by preparing transition operators utilizing emotional contagion and knowledgeable utterances. As a result, we verified that users' internal states transitioned as expected and that the two factors significantly influenced their trust states.",2019.0,40.0,15.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '10'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matsui2019DesigningTP,\n author = {T.

There is limited information regarding the effects of interactive virtual reality (VR) games on psychological and physical well-being among adults with physical disabilities. We aimed to examine the impact of VR games on psychological well-being, upper limb motor function and reaction time in adults with physical disabilities.


METHODS
Fifteen participants completed the intervention using Wii VR games in this pilot study. Depressive, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) and Capabilities of Upper Extremity (CUE) questionnaires were used to measure psychological well-being and upper limb motor function respectively. Upper limb reaction time was measured using reaction time test.

It begins by noting practical and theoretical reasons for studying this concept. Six conceptualizations of presence found in a diverse set of literatures are identified and a detailed explication of the concept that incorporates these conceptualizations is presented.

Objective To determine the effect of a self-applied wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) patch in detecting AF and the clinical consequences associated with such a detection strategy. Design, Setting, and Participants A direct-to-participant randomized clinical trial and prospective matched observational cohort study were conducted among members of a large national health plan. Recruitment began November 17, 2015, and was completed on October 4, 2016, and 1-year claims-based follow-up concluded in January 2018. For the clinical trial, 2659 individuals were randomized to active home-based monitoring to start immediately or delayed by 4 months. For the observational study, 2 deidentified age-, sex- and CHA2DS2-VASc–matched controls were selected for each actively monitored individual. Interventions The actively monitored cohort wore a self-applied continuous ECG monitoring patch at home during routine activities for up to 4 weeks, initiated either immediately after enrolling (n = 1364) or delayed for 4 months after enrollment (n = 1291). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was the incidence of a new diagnosis of AF at 4 months among those randomized to immediate monitoring vs delayed monitoring. A secondary end point was new AF diagnosis at 1 year in the combined actively monitored groups vs matched observational controls. Other outcomes included new prescriptions for anticoagulants and health care utilization (outpatient cardiology visits, primary care visits, or AF-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations) at 1 year. Results The randomized groups included 2659 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [7.3] years; 38.6% women), of whom 1738 (65.4%) completed active monitoring. The observational study comprised 5214 (mean [SD] age, 73.7 [7.0] years; 40.5% women; median CHA2DS2-VASc score, 3.0), including 1738 actively monitored individuals from the randomized trial and 3476 matched controls. In the randomized study, new AF was identified by 4 months in 3.9% (53/1366) of the immediate group vs 0.9% (12/1293) in the delayed group (absolute difference, 3.0% [95% CI, 1.8%-4.1%]). At 1 year, AF was newly diagnosed in 109 monitored (6.7 per 100 person-years) and 81 unmonitored (2.6 per 100 person-years; difference, 4.1 [95% CI, 3.9-4.2]) individuals. Active monitoring was associated with increased initiation of anticoagulants (5.7 vs 3.7 per 100 person-years; difference, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.9-2.2]), outpatient cardiology visits (33.5 vs 26.0 per 100 person-years; difference, 7.5 [95% CI, 7.2-7.9), and primary care visits (83.5 vs 82.6 per 100 person-years; difference, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.4-1.5]). There was no difference in AF-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations (1.3 vs 1.4 per 100 person-years; difference, 0.1 [95% CI, −0.1 to 0]). Conclusions and Relevance Among individuals at high risk for AF, immediate monitoring with a home-based wearable ECG sensor patch, compared with delayed monitoring, resulted in a higher rate of AF diagnosis after 4 months. Monitored individuals, compared with nonmonitored controls, had higher rates of AF diagnosis, greater initiation of anticoagulants, but also increased health care resource utilization at 1 year.

Background: Although shame and guilt are related to psychological symptoms, the separate effect of each in postnatal psychological symptoms are not yet known. Methods: Seven electronic databases were systematically reviewed for articles on: (1) quantitative measures of shame, guilt, and psychological symptoms (2) in the postnatal period for infants under two years of age (3) published in English. Results: Of the 1,615 articles retrieved using PRISMA guidelines, five met criteria and were analysed independently by two reviewers using the STROBE criteria. In mothers, shame was significantly related to stress and postnatal depression. Shame significantly predicted postnatal depression. Guilt was significantly related to postnatal depression; however, the relationship was substantially reduced when included with shame. In fathers, shame, but not guilt, was significantly related to stress, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion: Shame and guilt are trans-diagnostic phenomena, negatively impacting on postnatal psychological health, and potentially the parent-child relationship. More research is needed to develop awareness of the unique effects of shame and guilt to optimise perinatal intervention.",2020.0,74.0,12.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '67 - 85', 'name': 'Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Caldwell2020ShameAG,\n author = {Julia Caldwell and P.

Studies on healthy subjects have implicated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region involved in emotional and social information processing, in neural responses to social exclusion. Impairments in social interactions are common in schizophrenia and are associated with reduced quality of life. Core symptoms such as delusions usually have a social content. However little is known about the neural underpinnings of social abnormalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the neural substrates of social exclusion in schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls underwent fMRI while participating in a popular social exclusion paradigm. This task involves passing a ‘ball’ between the participant and two cartoon representations of other subjects. The extent of social exclusion (ball not being passed to the participant) was parametrically varied throughout the task. Replicating previous findings, increasing social exclusion activated the mPFC in controls. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia failed to modulate mPFC responses with increasing exclusion. Furthermore, the blunted response to exclusion correlated with increased severity of positive symptoms. These data support the hypothesis that the neural response to social exclusion differs in schizophrenia, highlighting the mPFC as a potential substrate of impaired social interactions.",2012.0,49.0,31.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gradin2012AbnormalNR,\n author = {V.

We define three types of relationships; (1) stranger relationship, (2) business relationship, and (3) friendly relationship. First we model the space around an agent as a probability distribution function which reflects at each point in the space the importance of that point to the agent. The agent updates dynamically this function according to(1) his relation with the other agent, (2) his face orientation, and(3) the evolution of the relationship over time as a stranger agent may become a friend.

A systematic search of the literature identified 306 experimental comparisons of different emotion regulation (ER) strategies. ER instructions were coded according to a new taxonomy, and meta-analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy across studies. The findings revealed differences in effectiveness between ER processes: Attentional deployment had no effect on emotional outcomes (d(+) = 0.00), response modulation had a small effect (d(+) = 0.16), and cognitive change had a small-to-medium effect (d(+) = 0.36). There were also important within-process differences. We identified 7 types of attentional deployment, 4 types of cognitive change, and 4 types of response modulation, and these distinctions had a substantial influence on effectiveness. Whereas distraction was an effective way to regulate emotions (d(+) = 0.27), concentration was not (d(+) = -0.26).

Participants were assigned to either an HRV-BFB group (Group 1) or a combined HRV-BFB + MRS-NFB group (Group 2).  All children underwent pre- and postassessments of electroencephalography (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), and parent-reported behaviors.  No significant between-groups differences were observed on any parent-reported behaviors.  Group 1 showed significant pre–post improvements in emotion regulation and social behavior, while Group 2 showed significant pre–post improvements in emotional lability and autistic behaviors.  Group 2 also showed significant improvements in RMSSD and lnHF (vagal tone) indices of HRV over time, while Group 1 displayed no significant changes in HRV over time.  Group 1 showed an increase in mu suppression posttraining, and Group 2 showed a reduction in mu suppression posttraining.  The results suggest that HRV-BFB, alone or in combination with MRS-NFB, may improve behavioral features of autism.  A combined approach may be more efficacious in enhancing HRV, while the implications of each approach on mu suppression are mixed.  Neurovisceral approaches that teach self-regulation offer a novel treatment avenue for ASD.",2018.0,71.0,12.0,"{'volume': '5', 'pages': '9-9', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Goodman2018ANA,\n author = {Matthew S.

Correlations and partial correlations controlling for neuroticism were examined. Hardiness was negatively correlated with neuroticism, rumination, worry, and anxiety and positively correlated with mindfulness, coping, and health. When neuroticism was statistically controlled, the relationships between hardiness and rumination, health, and coping became nonsignificant, and the relationships between hardiness and worry, mindfulness, and anxiety, although attenuated, remained significant. Rumination and worry were positively correlated, but when neuroticism was statistically controlled, this relationship became nonsignificant.

We also tested to what extent these emotion regulation strategies were useful for each age group in managing response to age-relevant sad information. Forty-two young participants (Mage = 18.5, SE = .15) and 48 older participants (Mage = 71.42, SE = 1.15) watched four sadness-eliciting videos (about death/illness, four to five minutes long) under four conditions—no-regulation (no regulation instructions), attentional deployment (divert attention away), positive reappraisal (focus on positive outcomes) and suppression (conceal emotional expressions). We assessed negative emotional experience, expression, skin conductance level (SCL) and visual fixation duration while participants watched the emotional clips and followed the instructions for each condition. Results suggest that older adults were more successful than younger adults at implementing both attentional deployment and positive reappraisal. Ability to suppress emotions appears to remain stable with age.

Method A combined cross-sectional and longitudinal design was used to examine the associations over time of stress sensitivity and exposure (i.e. life events) with ‘prodromal’ symptoms in a cohort of 65 CHR patients assessed quarterly for up to 4 years, and at baseline in 24 healthy controls similar in age and gender. Results Impaired stress tolerance was greater in patients, in whom it was associated over time with positive and negative symptoms, in addition to depression, anxiety and poor function. By contrast, life events were comparable in patients and controls, and bore no association with symptoms. In this treated cohort, there was a trajectory of improvement in stress tolerance, symptoms and function over time. Conclusions Impaired stress tolerance was associated with a wide range of ‘prodromal’ symptoms, consistent with it being a core feature of the psychosis risk state. Self-reported life events were not relevant as a correlate of clinical status.

Classic analysis methods, such as meta‐regression, are used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. However, it may be difficult to apply such a method in complex cases or in the absence of an a priori hypothesis. This paper presents a graphical method to identify trials, groups of trials or groups of patients that are sources of heterogeneity. The contribution of these trials to the overall result can also be evaluated with this method. Each trial is represented by a dot on a 2D graph. The X‐axis represents the contribution of the trial to the overall Cochran Q‐test for heterogeneity. The Y‐axis represents the influence of the trial, defined as the standardized squared difference between the treatment effects estimated with and without the trial. This approach has been applied to data from the Meta‐Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH‐NC) comprising 10850 patients in 65 randomized trials. The graphical method allowed us to identify trials that contributed considerably to the overall heterogeneity and had a strong influence on the overall result. It also provided useful information for the interpretation of heterogeneity in this meta‐analysis. The proposed graphical method identifies trials that account for most of the heterogeneity without having to explore all possible sources of heterogeneity by subgroup analyses. This method can also be applied to identify types of patients that explain heterogeneity in the treatment effect.

In the first part of the thesis we consider the formation of the traditional organised forms of attachment (as defined by Mary Ainsworth) within the context of the free energy principle, showing how each type of attachment might arise in infant agents who minimise free energy over interoceptive states while interacting with caregivers with varying responsiveness. We show how exteroceptive cues (in the form of disrupted affective communication from the caregiver) can result in disorganised forms of attachment (as first uncovered by Mary Main) in infants of caregivers who consistently increase stress on approach, but can have an organising (towards ambivalence) effect in infants of inconsistent caregivers. The second part of the thesis concerns Self-Attachment: a new self-administrable attachment-based psychotherapy recently introduced by Abbas Edalat, which aims to induce neural plasticity in order to retrain an individual’s suboptimal attachment schema. We begin with a model of the hypothesised neurobiological underpinnings of the Self-Attachment bonding protocols, which are concerned with the formation of an abstract, self-directed bond. Finally, using neuroscientific findings related to empathy and the self-other distinction within the context of pain, we propose a simple spiking neural model for how empathic states might serve to motivate application of the aforementioned bonding protocols.",2016.0,399.0,3.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cittern2016ComputationalMO,\n author = {David Cittern},\n title = {Computational models of attachment and self-attachment},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2585368', 'name': 'David Cittern'}]"

Though it is clear that prosocial behaviors emerge early and play a uniquely important role in the social lives of humans, there is less consensus regarding the mechanisms that underlie and maintain these fundamental acts. The goal of this paper is to clarify inconsistencies in our understanding of the early emergence and development of prosocial behavior by proposing a taxonomy of prosocial behavior anchored in the social-cognitive constraints that underlie the ability to act on behalf of others. I will argue that within the general domain of prosocial behavior, other-oriented actions can be categorized into three distinct types (helping, sharing, and comforting) that reflect responses to three distinct negative states (instrumental need, unmet material desire, and emotional distress). In support of this proposal, I will demonstrate that the three varieties of prosocial behavior show unique ages of onset, uncorrelated patterns of production, and distinct patterns of individual differences. Importantly, by differentiating specific varieties of prosocial behavior within the general category, we can begin to explain inconsistencies in the past literature and provide a framework for directing future research into the ontogenetic origins of these essential social behaviors.",2014.0,156.0,230.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dunfield2014ACD,\n author = {Kristen A.

Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on consumers or healthcare professionals; involved a conversational agent using any unconstrained natural language input; and reported evaluation measures resulting from user interaction with the system. Studies were screened by independent reviewers and Cohen’s kappa measured inter-coder agreement. Results The database search retrieved 1513 citations; 17 articles (14 different conversational agents) met the inclusion criteria. Dialogue management strategies were mostly finite-state and frame-based (6 and 7 conversational agents, respectively); agent-based strategies were present in one type of system. Two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was cross-sectional, and the remaining were quasi-experimental. Half of the conversational agents supported consumers with health tasks such as self-care. The only RCT evaluating the efficacy of a conversational agent found a significant effect in reducing depression symptoms (effect size d = 0.44, p = .04). Patient safety was rarely evaluated in the included studies. Conclusions The use of conversational agents with unconstrained natural language input capabilities for health-related purposes is an emerging field of research, where the few published studies were mainly quasi-experimental, and rarely evaluated efficacy or safety. Future studies would benefit from more robust experimental designs and standardized reporting.

341,1b0d55734c66b713477a4d1ef358ca1399ca0e69,A Theory of Human Motivation,"1. The integrated wholeness of the organism must be one of the foundation stones of motivation theory. 2. The hunger drive (or any other physiological drive) was rejected as a centering point or model for a definitive theory of motivation. Any drive that is somatically based and localizable was shown to be atypical rather than typical in human motivation. 3. Such a theory should stress and center itself upon ultimate or basic goals rather than partial or superficial ones, upon ends rather than means to these ends. Such a stress would imply a more central place for unconscious than for conscious motivations. 4. There are usually available various cultural paths to the same goal. Therefore conscious, specific, local-cultural desires are not as fundamental in motivation theory as the more basic, unconscious goals. 5. Any motivated behavior, either preparatory or consummatory, must be understood to be a channel through which many basic needs may be simultaneously expressed or satisfied. Typically an act has more than one motivation. 6. Practically all organismic states are to be understood as motivated and as motivating. 7. Human needs arrange themselves in hierarchies of prepotency. That is to say, the appearance of one need usually rests on the prior satisfaction of another, more pre-potent need. Man is a perpetually wanting animal. Also no need or drive can be treated as if it were isolated or discrete; every drive is related to the state of satisfaction or dissatisfaction of other drives. 8. Lists of drives will get us nowhere for various theoretical and practical reasons.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a state-based multidimensional measure of emotion dysregulation. Psychometric properties of the State Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (S-DERS) were examined in a large representative community sample of young adult women drawn from four sites (N = 484). Exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor solution, with results supporting the internal consistency, construct validity, and predictive validity of the total scale and the four subscales: Nonacceptance (i.e., nonacceptance of current emotions), Modulate (i.e., difficulties modulating emotional and behavioral responses in the moment), Awareness (i.e., limited awareness of current emotions), and Clarity (i.e., limited clarity about current emotions). S-DERS scores were significantly associated with trait-based measures of emotion dysregulation, affect intensity/reactivity, experiential avoidance, and mindfulness, as well as measures of substance use problems. Moreover, significant associations were found between the S-DERS and state-based laboratory measures of emotional reactivity, even when controlling for the corresponding original DERS scales. Results provide preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the S-DERS as a state-based measure of emotion regulation difficulties.",2017.0,68.0,62.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '197 - 209', 'name': 'Assessment'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lavender2017DevelopmentAV,\n author = {J.

Specifically, we formulate this problem as a transfer learning problem between an expert and a learner agent in the presence of contexts that are only observable by the expert but not by the learner. Thus, such contexts are unobserved confounders (UCs) from the learner’s perspective. Given a dataset generated by the expert that excludes the UCs, the goal for the learner is to identify the true minimum-risk arm with fewer online learning steps, while avoiding possible biased decisions due to the presence of UCs in the expert’s data. To achieve this, we first formulate a mixed-integer linear program that uses the expert data to obtain causal bounds on the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of the true return for all possible UCs. We then transfer these causal bounds to the learner by formulating a causal bound constrained Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm to reduce the variance of online exploration and, as a result, identify the true minimum-risk arm faster, with fewer new samples. We provide a regret analysis of our proposed method and show that it can achieve zero or constant regret. Finally, we use an emotion regulation in mobile health example to show that our proposed method outperforms risk-averse MAB methods without causal bounds.",2022.0,30.0,0.0,"{'name': '2022 IEEE 61st Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)', 'pages': '144-149'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shen2022RiskAverseMB,\n author = {Yi Shen and J.

Starting from a three-way classification of construals of the world––events, the attribution of responsibility for events, and objects––the authors propose a systematic account of emotion differentiation. Rejecting the oft-favored features of bodily feelings, emotion-related behaviors, and facial expressions as too intensity-dependent and insufficiently diagnostic, they provide a detailed analysis of emotion differentiation in terms of the cognitive underpinnings of emotion types. Using numerous examples, they explain how different variables influence emotion intensity, and show how emotions can be formalized for computational purposes. Now with a contributed chapter describing the OCC model's influence, this book will interest a wide audience in cognitive, clinical, and social psychology, as well as in artificial intelligence and affective computing, and other cognitive science disciplines.",1988.0,3.0,6589.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ortony1988TheCS,\n author = {A.

Instead of reaching an optimal decision based on the facts, we find it often easier and sometimes more useful to rely on hunches. In this work, we extend a previously developed model for such a mechanism where a simple neural associative memory was used to implement a visual recall system for a humanoid robot. In the model, the changes in the neural state consume (neural) energy, and to minimize the total cost and the time to recall a memory pattern, the robot should take the action that will lead to minimal neural state change. To do so, the robot needs to learn to act rationally, and for this, it has to explore and find out the cost of its actions in the long run. In this study, a humanoid robot (iCub) is used to act in this scenario. The robot is given the sole action of changing his gaze direction. By reinforcement learning (RL) the robot learns which state-action pair sequences lead to minimal energy consumption. More importantly, the reward signal for RL is not given by the environment but obtained internally, as the actual neural cost of processing an incoming visual stimuli. The results indicate that reinforcement learning with the internally generated reward signal leads to non-trivial behaviours of the robot which might be interpreted by external observers as the robot's `liking' of a specific visual pattern, which in fact emerged solely based on the neural cost minimization principle.",2016.0,21.0,6.0,"{'pages': '1101-1106', 'name': '2016 IEEE-RAS 16th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kirtay2016SequentialDM,\n author = {M.

See my ""The Right to Lie: Kant on Dealing with Evil"" in Creating the Kingdom of Ends (Ncw York: Cambridge Press, 1996), especially 147-154. That is, he acts well, except in those moments when true goodness calls for concession, compromise, a less strict or even-though this is rare-actions that are formally wrong. See my ""Taking the Law into Our Own Hands: Kant on the Right to Revolution,"" in Reclaiming the His­ tory of Ethics: Essays for John Rawls, eds. Andrews Reath, Barbara Herman, and Chris­ tine M. Korsgaard (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, IQQ7) for a discussion of this kind of case. 17. See Plato, Phaedo 68d-69C. 18. A number of people have argued that the problem described here would not arise for the rational egoist in the more ordinary modern sense, the person who seeks to maximize the satisfaction of his own interests. Indeed this is sllggested by my own re­ marks about how imitation virtue can help hold the oligarch together, for modern ego­ ism is much like Plato's imitation virtue. If correct, this objection would suggest that you can constitute yourself through thc egoistic principle. A full response to this objec­ tion requires a full treatment of the claim that there is a coherently formulable pIe of rational egoism. See my ""The Myth of Egoism"" available from the Department of Philosophy at the University of Kansas as the Lindley Lecture for 1999. 19· I have lifted this example from a footnote in my ""The Normativity of Instrumen­ tal Reason,"" in Ethics and Practical Reason, ed. Garrett Cullity and Berys Caut ford: Clarendon Press, 1997), 215-254; 247, n. 64. 20. The problem with tyranny is not the same as that with timocraey, oligarchy, and democracy-it is not that the unity it produces in the soul is contingent. Plato envi­ sions tyranny as a kind of madness (see 573c ff.). As I imagine the tyrant, his relation to his obsession is like a psychotic's relation to his delusion: he is able, and prepared, to organize everything else around it, but at the expense of a loss of his grip on reality, on the world. But that is only a sketch, and a fuller treatment of this principle, and of the question why a person cannot successful integrate himself under its governance, is re­ quired for the completeness of the argument of this paper. 21. To put it somewhat more strictly, you take yourself to be the cause of your intel­ ligible movements, since it is only really an action if you are, or to the extent that yOll are, the cause. I think that there are important philosophical questions, yet to be worked out, about exactly how this point should be phrased, but for now I leave the more familiar formulation in the text. I am indebted to Sophia Reibetanz and Tamar for discussions of these points. 22. The argument that follows made its first appearance in Section 1 of my ""Reply"" in The Sources of Normativity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 225-2 3). I hope that the present version is clearer. 23· lowe this formulation of my point to Covert den Hartogh. 24· In Lecture 3 of The Sources of Normativity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), I give an argument that aims to move from the formal version of the cate­ gorical imperative to moral requiremellt~ by way of Kant's Formula of Humanitv.

However, studies assessing physiological reactions to social rejection are rare and results of these studies were found to be ambiguous. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. Methods: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. Results: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. Conclusions: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. In addition, results revealed gender-specific response patterns suggesting that sample characteristics such as differences in gender may account for ambiguous findings of physiological reactions to social rejection.",2014.0,84.0,48.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Iffland2014RapidHB,\n author = {Benjamin Iffland and L.

In addition, experimentally elicited suppression resulted in reduced interpersonal responsiveness during face-to-face interaction, along with negative partner-perceptions and hostile behavior. These deleterious effects were reduced when individuals with more Asian values suppressed, and these reductions were mediated by cultural differences in the responsiveness of the suppressors.

However, such studies tend to explore each factor in isolation. This paper aims to better understand the inter-relations among these three factors by conducting a subjective matching experiment. In the presented experiment ($\mathrm{n}=40$), participants had to match a given “optimal” SoE avatar configuration (realistic avatar, full-body motion capture, first-person point of view), starting by a “minimal” SoE configuration (minimal avatar, no control, third-person point of view), by iteratively increasing the level of each factor. The choices of the participants provide insights about their preferences and perception over the three factors considered. Moreover, the subjective matching procedure was conducted in the context of four different interaction tasks with the goal of covering a wide range of actions an avatar can do in a VE. The paper also describes a baseline experiment ($\mathrm{n}=20$) which was used to define the number and order of the different levels for each factor, prior to the subjective matching experiment (e.g. different degrees of realism ranging from abstract to personalised avatars for the visual appearance). The results of the subjective matching experiment show that point of view and control levels were consistently increased by users before appearance levels when it comes to enhancing the SoE. Second, several configurations were identified with equivalent SoE as the one felt in the optimal configuration, but vary between the tasks. Taken together, our results provide valuable insights about which factors to prioritize in order to enhance the SoE towards an avatar in different tasks, and about configurations which lead to fulfilling SoE in VE.",2020.0,49.0,66.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '2062-2072', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fribourg2020AvatarAS,\n author = {Rebecca Fribourg and F.

Among these, an emerging approach is the use of virtual reality (VR) within exposure-based protocols for anxiety disorders, and in particular posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no systematically tested VR protocols are available for the management of psychological stress. Objective Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, for the management and prevention of psychological stress. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and the real world achieved through experiential virtual scenarios (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and improve self-efficacy) with real-time monitoring and support (identifying critical situations and assessing clinical change) using advanced technologies (virtual worlds, wearable biosensors, and smartphones). Methods The study was designed as a block randomized controlled trial involving 121 participants recruited from two different worker populations—teachers and nurses—that are highly exposed to psychological stress. Participants were a sample of teachers recruited in Milan (Block 1: n=61) and a sample of nurses recruited in Messina, Italy (Block 2: n=60). Participants within each block were randomly assigned to the (1) Experimental Group (EG): n=40; B1=20, B2=20, which received a 5-week treatment based on the Interreality paradigm; (2) Control Group (CG): n=42; B1=22, B2=20, which received a 5-week traditional stress management training based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and (3) the Wait-List group (WL): n=39, B1=19, B2=20, which was reassessed and compared with the two other groups 5 weeks after the initial evaluation. Results Although both treatments were able to significantly reduce perceived stress better than WL, only EG participants reported a significant reduction (EG=12% vs CG=0.5%) in chronic “trait” anxiety. A similar pattern was found for coping skills: both treatments were able to significantly increase most coping skills, but only EG participants reported a significant increase (EG=14% vs CG=0.3%) in the Emotional Support skill. Conclusions Our findings provide initial evidence that the Interreality protocol yields better outcomes than the traditionally accepted gold standard for psychological stress treatment: CBT. Consequently, these findings constitute a sound foundation and rationale for the importance of continuing future research in technology-enhanced protocols for psychological stress management.

Advances in the development of information and communication technologies have facilitated social and sexual interrelationships, thanks to the websites and apps created to this end. However, these resources can also encourage sexual contacts without appropriate preventive measures in relation to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). How can users be helped to benefit from the advantages of these apps while keeping in mind those preventive measures?


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to prevent STIs by helping users to remember preventive measures in the risky situations.


METHODS
We have used the design and creation methodology and have developed a software system. This system has two parts: an Android operating system app with emphasis on ubiquitous computing and gamification as well as a server with a webpage. First, a functional test with 5 men who have sex with men (MSM) allowed us to test the app with end users. In addition, a feasibility test with 4 MSM for a month allowed us to try the UBESAFE system with all its functionalities.


RESULTS
The main output is a system called UBESAFE that is addressed to MSM. The system has two main parts: (1) an app that sends preventive contextualized messages to users when they use a contact app or when they are near a point where sexual contacts are likely and (2) a server part that was managed by the public health agency of Barcelona (ASPB), which preserves the quality and pertinence of messages and places and offers instant help to users. To increase users' adherence, UBESAFE uses a gamified system to engage users in the creation of preventive messages. Users increased the initial pool of messages by more than 100% (34/30) and created more than 56% (9/16) of places (named hot zones).


CONCLUSIONS
The system helped MSM who used it to become conscious about HIV and other STIs. The system also helped the ASPB to stay in contact with MSM and to detect behaviors that could benefit from preventive measures. All functions were performed in a nonintrusive manner because users used the app privately. Furthermore, the system has shown how important it is to make users a part of the creation process as well as to develop apps that work by themselves and thus become useful to the users.",2020.0,35.0,16.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'JMIR mHealth and uHealth'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Besoain2020PreventionOH,\n author = {F.

Irrespective of the experimental setting, EEG recordings are contaminated with noise that has to be removed before the data can be functionally interpreted. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a commonly used tool to remove artifacts such as eye movement, muscle activity, and external noise from the data and to analyze activity on the level of EEG effective brain sources. While the effectiveness of filtering the data as one key preprocessing step to improve the decomposition has been investigated previously, no study thus far compared the different requirements of mobile and stationary experiments regarding the preprocessing for ICA decomposition. We thus evaluated how movement in EEG experiments, the number of channels, and the high-pass filter cutoff during preprocessing influence the ICA decomposition. We found that for commonly used settings (stationary experiment, 64 channels, 0.5 Hz filter), the ICA results are acceptable. However, high-pass filters of up to 2 Hz cutoff frequency should be used in mobile experiments, and more channels require a higher filter to reach an optimal decomposition. Fewer brain ICs were found in mobile experiments, but cleaning the data with ICA proved to be important and functional even with 16 channels. Based on the results, we provide guidelines for different experimental settings that improve the ICA decomposition.",2020.0,33.0,47.0,{'name': 'bioRxiv'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Klug2020IdentifyingKF,\n author = {Marius Klug and K.

To date, our understanding of use of reappraisal is based either on self-reports of tendencies to use a specific strategy in general or in the last week or on performance on lab-based tasks. There has been little effort to measure use of reappraisal immediately following an emotionally evocative situation (i.e., state-reappraisal). To close this gap, we developed the State-Reappraisal Inventory (SRI) that ascertains use of reappraisal immediately after an emotional event. In Study 1, exploratory factor analyses yielded two reliable subscales measuring state levels of construal of an emotion-eliciting situating as more positive (Increase Positive) and less negative (Decrease Negative). In two further studies, confirmatory factor analyses using a bifactor model provided a good fit for the data and surpassed three competing models. In a fourth study, the SRI showed sensitivity to experimentally induced state changes in reappraisal. Across studies, the questionnaire demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity. Thus, the SRI is a new measure of state-reappraisal that can allow researchers and clinicians to examine the extent to which individuals use reappraisal in emotional situations.",2018.0,94.0,3.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '1663–1677', 'name': 'Psychological Assessment'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ganor2018DevelopmentAV,\n author = {Tal Ganor and Nilly Mor and J.

Herein, we discuss the potential of virtual reality for enhancing ecological validity while maintaining experimental control in social neuroscience research. Virtual reality is a technology that allows for the creation of fully interactive, three-dimensional computerized models of social situations that can be fully controlled by the experimenter. Furthermore, the introduction of interactive virtual characters—either driven by a human or by a computer—allows the researcher to test, in a systematic and independent manner, the effects of various social cues.

In particular, mood related mental health problems, such as mood disorders, depressions, and elation, are seriously impacting people's quality of life. However, due to the complexity and unstableness of personal mood, assessing and analyzing daily mood is both difficult and inconvenient, which is a major challenge in mental health care. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Mood Miner for assessing and analyzing mood in daily life. Mood Miner uses mobile phone data - mobile phone sensor data and communication data (including acceleration, light, ambient sound, location, call log, etc.) - to extract human behavior pattern and assess daily mood. Our approach overcomes the problem of subjectivity and inconsistency of traditional mood assessment methods, and achieves a fairly good accuracy (around 50%) with minimal user intervention. We have built a system with clients on Android platform and an assessment model based on factor graph. We have also carried out experiments to evaluate our design in effectiveness and efficiency.",2012.0,16.0,107.0,"{'pages': '142-147', 'name': '2012 Ninth International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ma2012DailyMA,\n author = {Yuanchao Ma and Bin Xu and Yin Bai and Guodong Sun and Run Zhu},\n journal = {2012 Ninth International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks},\n pages = {142-147},\n title = {Daily Mood Assessment Based on Mobile Phone Sensing},\n year = {2012}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3220402', 'name': 'Yuanchao Ma'}, {'authorId': '143876183', 'name': 'Bin Xu'}, {'authorId': '2115232918', 'name': 'Yin Bai'}, {'authorId': '2147566', 'name': 'Guodong Sun'}, {'authorId': '2070270321', 'name': 'Run Zhu'}]"

The aim of this study was to compare emotional and symptomatic responses to stress in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing psychosis, in age- and gender-matched healthy controls, and in patients with non-affective psychosis. Method A total of 27 UHR, 27 psychotic and 27 healthy individuals completed the experience sampling method, an ambulant diary technique, where they were required to fill in self-assessment questions about their emotions, symptoms and perceived stress at semi-random times of the day for 6 days. Quesionnaire and interview assessments were also completed. Results Multilevel regression analyses showed that individuals at UHR of developing psychosis reported greater negative emotions in response to stress than the healthy individuals. Against the initial hypotheses, the UHR individuals also experienced greater emotional reactivity to stress when compared with the patient group. No significant differences were observed between the patients and the non-clinical sample. Stress measures significantly predicted the intensity of psychotic symptoms in UHR individuals and patients, but the extent of this did not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusions Individuals at UHR of developing psychosis may be particularly sensitive to everyday stressors. This effect may diminish after transition to psychosis is made and in periods of stability. Subtle increases in psychotic phenomena occur in response to stressful events across the continuum of psychosis.",2011.0,56.0,117.0,"{'volume': '42', 'pages': '1003 - 1012', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Palmier-Claus2011EmotionalAS,\n author = {J.

Reviews have highlighted anxious youths' affective disturbances, specifically, elevated negative emotions and reliance on ineffective emotion regulation strategies. However, no study has examined anxious youth's emotional reactivity and regulation in real-world contexts.


METHODS
This study utilized an ecological momentary assessment approach to compare real-world emotional experiences of 65 youth with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or social phobia (ANX) and 65 age-matched healthy controls (CON), ages 9-13 years.


RESULTS
Hierarchical linear models revealed that ANX reported higher levels of average past-hour peak intensity of nervous, sad and upset emotions than CON youth but similar levels during momentary reports of current emotion. As expected, ANX youth reported more frequent physiological reactions in response to a negative event; however, there were no group differences in how frequently they used cognitive-behavioral strategies. Avoidance, distraction and problem solving were associated with the down-regulation of all negative emotions except nervousness for both ANX and CON youth; however, group differences emerged for acceptance, rumination and physiological responding.


CONCLUSIONS
In real-world contexts, ANX youth do not report higher levels of momentary negative emotions but do report heightened negative emotions in response to challenging events. Moreover, ANX youth report no differences in how frequently they use adaptive regulatory strategies but are more likely to have physiological responses to challenging events. They are also less effective at using some strategies to down-regulate negative emotion than CON youth.",2012.0,30.0,126.0,"{'volume': '53 2', 'pages': '\n          197-206\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tan2012EmotionalRA,\n author = {P.

384,1e1c7c6bc4482d4def21439fe29c4b34b59c7451,The development of emotion regulation and dysregulation: a clinical perspective.,"Clinical conceptualizations of emotion that stress its disruptive influences and functional models of emotion that emphasize its adaptive aspects can be integrated into a developmental psychopathology framework. Under certain conditions, emotion regulation may develop dysregulatory aspects that can become a characteristic of an individual's coping style. This style may then jeopardize or impair functioning and become associated with symptomatic, disordered functioning. Emotional development provides a critical vantage point from which to study the development of symptomatology and psychopathology, particularly given the prevalence of emotional symptoms in various forms of psychopathology. Dimensions of emotionality that can be used to characterize dysregulation include access to the range of emotions, flexible modulation of intensity, duration, and transitions between emotions, acquisition and use of cultural display rules, and the ability to reflect on the complexity and value of one's own emotions in a self-supporting manner. Developmental psychopathology provides a framework within which to examine how emotions are regulatory, how their regulation changes over time, and under what conditions an adaptive emotion process can develop into a pattern of dysregulation that then becomes, or sustains, some symptoms of mental disorders. Such research requires samples that include children with and without risk or presence of particular mental health problems, paradigms that allow the examination of dimensions of emotionality in context and provide multiple assessments that include observations of children's reactions beyond what they themselves can report, and analyses that extend beyond simple global aggregates such as positive and negative emotion. We believe that it is particularly important to study children and their families in situations that challenge their emotional adaptation. The developmental tasks of emotional life evolve in exchanges between the child and the world of events and relationships. The emotional conditions of early childhood appear to be very important in optimizing or interfering with how the child's emotionality regulates his or her interpersonal and intrapsychic functioning and how the child learns to regulate emotion. The experiences that accrue around emotional events influence the stable aspects of the developing personality and become trait-like aspects of the person (Malatesta & Wilson, 1988). Dysregulation occurs when an emotional reaction loses breadth and flexibility. If a dysregulatory pattern becomes stabilized and part of the emotional repertoire, it is likely that this pattern is a symptom and supports other symptoms. When development and adaptation are compromised, the dysregulation has evolved into a form of psychopathology. The line between normative variations and clinical conditions is not clearly drawn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1994.0,0.0,1387.0,"{'volume': '59 2-3', 'pages': '\n          73-100\n        ', 'name': 'Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cole1994TheDO,\n author = {P.

390,1e43c7084bdcb6b3102afaf301cce10faead2702,BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining,"Abstract Motivation Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. Results We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora.

This study tested whether this relationship could be explained by exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity to work or impaired recovery in leisure time. Vagal tone was assessed as a possible determinant of these work stress effects. Participants included 109 male white-collar workers (age, 47.2+/-5. 3) who were monitored on 2 workdays and 1 nonworkday for ambulatory blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rate variability. Chronic work stress was defined according to Siegrist's model as (1) high imbalance, a combination of high effort and low reward at work, or (2) high overcommitment, an exhaustive work-related coping style indexing the inability to unwind. All findings were adjusted for possible differences in posture and physical activity between the work stress groups. High imbalance was associated with a higher heart rate during work and directly after work, a higher systolic blood pressure during work and leisure time, and a lower 24-hour vagal tone on all 3 measurement days. Overcommitment was not associated with an unfavorable ambulatory profile. Logistic regression analysis revealed that heart rate [odds ratio 1-SD increase 1.95 (95% CI, 1.02 to 3.77)] and vagal tone [odds ratio 1-SD decrease 2.67 (95% CI, 1.24 to 5.75)] were independently associated with incident mild hypertension. Surprisingly, the values during sleep were more predictive for mild hypertension than the values during work. The results from the present study suggest that the detrimental effects of work stress are partly mediated by increased heart rate reactivity to a stressful workday, an increase in systolic blood pressure level, and lower vagal tone.",2000.0,35.0,696.0,"{'volume': '35 4', 'pages': '\n          880-6\n        ', 'name': 'Hypertension'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vrijkotte2000EffectsOW,\n author = {T.

In this review, we integrate 3 evolutionary arguments that converge on the hypothesis that compassion evolved as a distinct affective experience whose primary function is to facilitate cooperation and protection of the weak and those who suffer. Our empirical review reveals compassion to have distinct appraisal processes attuned to undeserved suffering; distinct signaling behavior related to caregiving patterns of touch, posture, and vocalization; and a phenomenological experience and physiological response that orients the individual to social approach. This response profile of compassion differs from those of distress, sadness, and love, suggesting that compassion is indeed a distinct emotion.

The sample consisted of N = 1990 children and adolescents (957 boys, 1033 girls; grade levels 3-8). Participants responded to a coping questionnaire (Fragebogen zur Erhebung von Stress und Stressbewaltigung im Kindes- und Jugendalter, SSKJ 3-8; Lohaus, Eschenbeck, Kohlmann, & Klein-Hesling, 2006) with the five subscales: seeking social support, problem solving, avoidant coping, palliative emotion regulation, and anger-related emotion regulation. Repeated measures ANOVAs with Gender and Grade Level as the between-subject factors and Situation (social, academic) as the within-subject factor were performed separately for each of the subscales.

This paper provides a brief review of researches in the field of FER conducted over the past decades. First, conventional FER approaches are described along with a summary of the representative categories of FER systems and their main algorithms. Deep-learning-based FER approaches using deep networks enabling “end-to-end” learning are then presented. This review also focuses on an up-to-date hybrid deep-learning approach combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the spatial features of an individual frame and long short-term memory (LSTM) for temporal features of consecutive frames. In the later part of this paper, a brief review of publicly available evaluation metrics is given, and a comparison with benchmark results, which are a standard for a quantitative comparison of FER researches, is described. This review can serve as a brief guidebook to newcomers in the field of FER, providing basic knowledge and a general understanding of the latest state-of-the-art studies, as well as to experienced researchers looking for productive directions for future work.",2018.0,69.0,465.0,"{'volume': '18', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ko2018ABR,\n author = {ByoungChul Ko},\n journal = {Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)},\n title = {A Brief Review of Facial Emotion Recognition Based on Visual Information},\n volume = {18},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '144893429', 'name': 'ByoungChul Ko'}]"

One factor that has received a great deal of attention is that of emotion regulation, namely, the ability to modulate the intensity and/or duration of emotional states (e.g., Cicchetti, Ackerman, & Izard, 1995; Gross, 1998). Recent theoretical and empirical work has begun to emphasize the role that emotion regulation plays in the temporal comorbidity between internalizing and externalizing conditions (e.g., Aldao & De Los Reyes, 2015; De Los Reyes & Aldao, 2015; Drabick & Kendall, 2010; Jarrett & Ollendick, 2008; Patrick & Hajcak, 2016). However, close inspection of this work reveals two very pertinent areas of growth: (a) this literature is characterized by mixed findings that are likely explained, in part, by methodological heterogeneity; and (b) emotion regulation tends to be studied in relatively narrow terms. To address these issues, we provide a series of recommendations for facilitating cross-study comparisons and leveraging multifaceted approaches to studying emotion regulation processes within a developmental psychopathology framework. We hope that our perspective can enhance the organization and growth of this very important area of inquiry, and ultimately result in more effective prevention and treatment programs.",2016.0,248.0,276.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '927 - 946', 'name': 'Development and Psychopathology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Aldao2016EmotionRA,\n author = {A.

One potential reason for this neglect is the lack of valid ER instruments developed specifically for adolescents. Further, the available ER instruments for adolescents usually require elaborate forms of cognitive reasoning about the internal sequences of cognitions and emotions. To address these limitations, we developed the Adolescents’ Emotion Regulation Strategies Questionnaire (AERSQ), a self-report instrument of adolescents’ commonly used ER strategies in daily life and examined its psychometric characteristics in a 10-year, three-wave cohort of Swedish youths (original N = 991, mean age = 13.7, 14.8, and 25.3 at waves 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Exploratory (wave 1 data) and confirmatory (wave 2 data) factor analyses revealed a five-factor structure for the AERSQ: rumination/negative thinking, positive reorientation, communication, distraction, and cultural activities. We observed gender differences for most ER strategies in adolescence. We also evaluated the associations between the AERSQ subscales and mental health (self-harm; psychological difficulties including hyperactivity, conduct problems, emotional problems, and peer problems; prosocial behavior; depression; anxiety; stress; flourishing; and life satisfaction) across the three time points. Rumination/negative thinking had the strongest relationships with these mental health indicators, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, in both genders. Distraction and cultural activities were less related to mental health, especially prospectively. Although the AERSQ showed good test–retest reliability and predictive validity over a 10-year period, the low internal consistency of two of its subscales (distraction and cultural activities) indicates that it may benefit from further development both in terms of the included items and psychometric testing.",2020.0,71.0,11.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhou2020AdolescentsER,\n author = {Ya Zhou and D.

409,20823d087e22a5cd7cbaada21139a18eb3d601eb,Self-esteem uncertainty and depression vulnerability,"Previous research has typically failed to show a difference between the self-esteem ratings of persons who are at-risk for depression and those who are not. Despite these null findings, it is possible that problems with self-esteem do precede depression but are masked by thought suppression. The present research investigated the possibility that at-risk individuals' relatively positive self-appraisals belie uncertainty about the self that is related to high levels of thought suppression and reassurance seeking. To test this idea, participants completed Rosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale and immediately reported certainty of their responses. Participants then completed measures of excessive-reassurance seeking and chronic thought suppression. Participants also reported past and present experiences with depression. The results indicated that at-risk individuals did not differ from never-depressed individuals in their reported levels of trait self-esteem. However, at-risk individuals were more uncertain about their beliefs than were never-depressed individuals. Moreover, this uncertainty was associated with high levels of thought suppression and excessive reassurance seeking.",2005.0,39.0,18.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '611 - 622', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Luxton2005SelfesteemUA,\n author = {D.

The pictures were selected from the Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expressions of Emotion set developed by D. Matsumoto and P. Ekman (1989). Sixty children between the ages of 5 and 10 years were presented with short stories and an array of facial expressions, and were asked to point to the expression that best depicted the specific emotion experienced by the characters. The results indicated that expressions of fear and surprise were better categorized from Asian faces, whereas expressions of disgust were better categorized from Caucasian faces. These differences originated in some specific confusions between expressions.",2000.0,45.0,54.0,"{'volume': '161', 'pages': '346 - 358', 'name': 'The Journal of Genetic Psychology'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Gosselin2000FacialMA,\n author = {P.

Although efficacious, many children (40%-50%) do not show a significant reduction in symptoms or full recovery from primary anxiety diagnoses. One possibility is that they are unwilling to learn and practice cognitive behavioral therapy skills beyond therapy sessions. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including a lack of motivation, forgetfulness, and a lack of cognitive behavioral therapy skills understanding. Mobile health (mHealth) gamification provides a potential solution to improve cognitive behavioral therapy efficacy by delivering more engaging and interactive strategies to facilitate cognitive behavioral therapy skills practice in everyday lives (in vivo). Objective The goal of this project was to redesign an existing mHealth system called SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment) so as to increase user engagement, retention, and learning facilitation by integrating gamification techniques and interactive features. Furthermore, this project assessed the effectiveness of gamification in improving user engagement and retention throughout posttreatment. Methods We redesigned and implemented the SmartCAT system consisting of a smartphone app for children and an integrated clinician portal. The gamified app contains (1) a series of interactive games and activities to reinforce skill understanding, (2) an in vivo skills coach that cues the participant to use cognitive behavioral therapy skills during real-world emotional experiences, (3) a home challenge module to encourage home-based exposure tasks, (4) a digital reward system that contains digital points and trophies, and (5) a therapist-patient messaging interface. Therapists used a secure Web-based portal connected to the app to set up required activities for each session, receive or send messages, manage participant rewards and challenges, and view data and figures summarizing the app usage. The system was implemented as an adjunctive component to brief cognitive behavioral therapy in an open clinical trial. To evaluate the effectiveness of gamification, we compared the app usage data at posttreatment with the earlier version of SmartCAT without gamification. Results Gamified SmartCAT was used frequently throughout treatment. On average, patients spent 35.59 min on the app (SD 64.18) completing 13.00 activities between each therapy session (SD 12.61). At the 0.10 significance level, the app usage of the gamified system (median 68.00) was higher than that of the earlier, nongamified SmartCAT version (median 37.00, U=76.00, P<.01). The amount of time spent on the gamified system (median 173.15) was significantly different from that of the earlier version (median 120.73, U=173.00, P=.06). Conclusions The gamified system showed good acceptability, usefulness, and engagement among anxious children receiving brief cognitive behavioral therapy treatment. Integrating an mHealth gamification platform within treatment for anxious children seems to increase involvement in shorter treatment. Further study is needed to evaluate increase in involvement in full-length treatment.",2018.0,51.0,57.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'JMIR Serious Games'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pramana2018UsingMH,\n author = {Gede Pramana and B.

Affective movie content analysis is challenging due to the great variety of movie contents and styles. To address this challenge, we first extract rich audio-visual features. Then, feature selection and affective modeling are carried out to select and map effective features into corresponding affective states. Finally, we propose novel Affective Visualization techniques which intuitively visualize affective states to achieve efficient and user-friendly movie browsing.

In this work, we focus on indoor rowing since it is a popular sport that's often done alone without extensive instructions. We compare a visual breathing indication with haptic guidance in order for athletes to maintain a correct, efficient, and healthy breathing-movement-synchronicity (BMS) while working out. Also, user experience and acceptance of the different modalities were measured. The results show a positive and statistically significant impact of purely verbal instructions and purely tactile feedback on BMS and no significant impact of visual feedback. Interestingly, the subjective ratings indicate a strong preference for the visual modality and even an aversion for the haptic feedback, although objectively the performance benefited most from using the latter.",2020.0,35.0,6.0,"{'pages': '1-6', 'name': '2020 Twelfth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Greinacher2020ImpactOT,\n author = {R.

427,2206ae1235905c533c98c72d720cdd65b13dc3db,How do artistic creative activities regulate our emotions? Validation of the Emotion Regulation Strategies for Artistic Creative Activities Scale (ERS-ACA),"There is a rich literature exploring emotional responses to engaging in artistic creative activities such as making music, writing, dancing and crafts. However, it remains unclear how such activities affect our emotions; specifically which mental processes (‘strategies’) are used to regulate our emotional responses. This paper therefore describes the design and validation of a novel instrument measuring types of emotional regulation strategies (ERSs) used when engaging in artistic creative activities: the Emotion Regulation Strategies for Artistic Creative Activities Scale (ERS-ACA). Using data from an initial pilot study (n = 740 adults, 80.4% female, median age 25–34) and a follow-up large internet sample (n = 47,924, 56.7% female, average age 47.3 ± 14.6 years), we followed a theory-driven iterative factor analysis process. Our analyses converged on a final 18-item scale comprising an overall ‘general’ factor of ERSs alongside three subscales: a 7-item factor comprising ‘avoidance strategies’ (such as distraction, suppression and detachment), a 6-item factor comprising ‘approach strategies’ (such as acceptance, reappraisal and problem solving), and a 5-item factor comprising ‘self-development strategies’ (such as enhanced self-identify, improved self-esteem and increased agency). All factors showed strong internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha: General Factor = 0.93, Factor 1 = 0.9, Factor 2 = 0.88, Factor 3 = 0.88). We confirmed strong convergent and divergent validity, construct validity, consistency of internal reliability and test-retest reliability of the scale in a third study (n = 165, 82.2% female, average age 46.3 ± 12.2 years). In conclusion, artistic creative activities appear to affect our emotions via a number of ERSs that can be broadly classified into three categories: avoidance, approach and self-development. The ERS-ACA scale presented and validated here should support further research into the use of ERSs when engaging in artistic creative activities and enhance our understanding about how these activities affect mental health.",2019.0,91.0,64.0,"{'volume': '14', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fancourt2019HowDA,\n author = {D.

428,2227cc1d33b967524ef98e9c15f28e4f11a8a79b,Toward a Personalized Science of Emotion Regulation.,"The ability to successfully regulate emotion plays a key role in healthy development and the maintenance of psychological well-being. Although great strides have been made in understanding the nature of regulatory processes and the consequences of deploying them, a comprehensive understanding of emotion regulation that can specify what strategies are most beneficial for a given person in a given situation is still a far-off goal. In this review, we argue that moving toward this goal represents a central challenge for the future of the field. As an initial step, we propose a concrete framework that (i) explicitly considers emotion regulation as an interaction of person, situation, and strategy, (ii) assumes that regulatory effects vary according to these factors, and (iii) sets as a primary scientific goal the identification of person-, situation-, and strategy-based contingencies for successful emotion regulation. Guided by this framework, we review current questions facing the field, discuss examples of contextual variation in emotion regulation success, and offer practical suggestions for continued progress in this area.",2016.0,100.0,116.0,"{'volume': '10 4', 'pages': '\n          171-187\n        ', 'name': 'Social and personality psychology compass'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Doré2016TowardAP,\n author = {B.

Negative affect is an important psychological factor in the promotion and maintenance of cigarette smoking, though the underlying factors that account for this relationship remain to be determined. One possible mechanism may be smokers' emotion regulation strategies. Preliminary research among adolescents and young adults suggests that greater utilization of expressive suppression versus cognitive reappraisal is associated with higher rates of smoking initiation. There is limited research, however, on the role of emotion regulation strategies in smoking maintenance in adult smokers.


METHODS
Data from participants in a laboratory study (N = 121) were used to examine whether utilization of cognitive reappraisal and/or expressive suppression were related to smoking characteristics and subjective (i.e., mood, urge to smoke ratings) and behavioral reactions (i.e., Emotional Stroop Task performance, smoking behavior) to a mood induction procedure. Data were evaluated for the full sample and subsample who endorsed current depressive symptoms (n = 46).


RESULTS
Frequent reappraisal was associated with weaker expectancies that smoking alleviates unpleasant feelings, greater positive mood, and fewer depressive symptoms. In contrast, frequent suppression was related to longer smoking history and greater attentional bias to smoking cues on an Emotional Stroop Task. Among the depressed subsample, reappraisal moderated the effect of mood condition on smoking duration, number of cigarette puffs, and carbon monoxide boost.


CONCLUSIONS
These results provide preliminary support that emotion regulation strategies may be associated with motivational correlates of smoking as well as actual smoking behavior among depressed smokers.",2010.0,44.0,73.0,"{'volume': '12 11', 'pages': '\n          1156-61\n        ', 'name': 'Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fucito2010CognitiveRA,\n author = {L.

The past two decades have seen dramatic progress in our ability to model brain signals recorded by electroencephalography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, etc., and to derive real-time estimates of user cognitive state, response, or intent for a variety of purposes: to restore communication by the severely disabled, to effect brain-actuated control and, more recently, to augment human–computer interaction. Continuing these advances, largely achieved through increases in computational power and methods, requires software tools to streamline the creation, testing, evaluation and deployment of new data analysis methods. Approach. Here we present BCILAB, an open-source MATLAB-based toolbox built to address the need for the development and testing of brain-computer interface (BCI) methods by providing an organized collection of over 100 pre-implemented methods and method variants, an easily extensible framework for the rapid prototyping of new methods, and a highly automated framework for systematic testing and evaluation of new implementations. Main results. To validate and illustrate the use of the framework, we present two sample analyses of publicly available data sets from recent BCI competitions and from a rapid serial visual presentation task. We demonstrate the straightforward use of BCILAB to obtain results compatible with the current BCI literature. Significance. The aim of the BCILAB toolbox is to provide the BCI community a powerful toolkit for methods research and evaluation, thereby helping to accelerate the pace of innovation in the field, while complementing the existing spectrum of tools for real-time BCI experimentation, deployment and use.",2013.0,79.0,282.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Journal of Neural Engineering'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kothe2013BCILABAP,\n author = {Christian Kothe and S.

A cross-cultural comparison between European Americans and Hong Kong Chinese.,"The habitual use of expressive suppression as an emotion regulation strategy has been consistently linked to adverse outcomes in a number of domains, including psychological functioning. The present study aimed to uncover whether the suppression-health relationship is dependent on cultural context, given differing cultural norms surrounding the value of suppressing emotional displays. We hypothesized that the negative associations between suppression and psychological functioning seen in European Americans would not be seen among members of East Asian cultures, in which emotional restraint is relatively encouraged over emotional expression. To test this hypothesis, we asked 71 European American students and 100 Chinese students from Hong Kong to report on their use of expressive suppression, life satisfaction, and depressed mood. A moderation analysis revealed that expressive suppression was associated with adverse psychological functioning for European Americans, but not for Chinese participants.

In this article we articulate an ecological valence theory in which color preferences arise from people’s average affective responses to color-associated objects. An empirical test provides strong support for this theory: People like colors strongly associated with objects they like (e.g., blues with clear skies and clean water) and dislike colors strongly associated with objects they dislike (e.g., browns with feces and rotten food).

However, further research is needed.For example, although powerful tests of the attributional diath-esis-stress component have been conducted, no one has exam-ined the cognitive diatheses of inferring negative consequencesor characteristics about the self or whether the cognitive stylediathesis-stress interaction predicts clinically significant de-pression. Moreover, it is crucial to determine if this interactionpredicts the development of the hypothesized symptoms ofhopelessness depression. More generally, an important short-coming of the prior work is that it has not focused on the symp-toms of hopelessness depression in particular and, instead, sim-ply has examined the symptoms of depression in general. Fu-ture investigators need to test more fine-grained predictionsabout the hypothesized symptoms of hopelessness depression.The issue of the stability of the cognitive diatheses has not beenresolved satisfactorily. We have only begun, in a preliminaryway, to investigate the issues of specific vulnerability and media-tional processes. Finally, further tests of the predictions aboutcourse, cure, and prevention are needed. We eagerly await thisresearch.Difficult methodological issues may arise in the search forhopelessness depression, however. For example, the hopeless-ness theory is silent about the time lag between formation ofhopelessness and onset of the symptoms of hopelessness depres-sion. If it is very short, then a major challenge will be to developmethods with sufficient temporal resolving power to determineif hopelessness indeed precedes the occurrence of the hypothe-sized symptoms of hopelessness depression (see Alloy, Hartlage,et al., 1988, for proposed methods for testing the hopelessnesstheory). The results of work to test the hopelessness theory willdetermine if the concept of hopelessness depression needs tobe revised. For example, perhaps the statement of the causalpathway is correc t bu culminate n a differen se f symp-toms than those currently hypothesized to compose hopeless-ness depression. In this case, the symptom—but not thecause—component of the hopelessness theory would need to bemodified.In discussing how to search for hopelessness depression, wenote the possibility that future work may not corroborate theexistence of hopelessness depression as a bona fide subtype withcharacteristic cause, symptoms, course, treatment, and preven-tion. Instead, the etiological chain featured in the hopelessnesstheory may be one of many pathways to a final common out-come of depression. In this case, it would be more compellingto speak of a hopelessness cause, as opposed to a hopelessnesssubtype, of depression.",1989.0,137.0,3406.0,"{'volume': '96', 'pages': '358-372', 'name': 'Psychological Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Abramson1989HopelessnessDA,\n author = {L.

Virtual reality (VR) integrates real-time computer graphics, body-tracking devices, visual displays, and other sensory input devices to immerse a participant in a computer-generated virtual environment that changes in a natural way with head and body motion. VR exposure (VRE) is proposed as an alternative to typical imaginal exposure treatment for Vietnam combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).


METHOD
This report presents the results of an open clinical trial using VRE to treat Vietnam combat veterans who have DSM-IV PTSD. In 8 to 16 sessions, 10 male patients were exposed to 2 virtual environments: a virtual Huey helicopter flying over a virtual Vietnam and a clearing surrounded by jungle.


RESULTS
Clinician-rated PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, the primary outcome measure, at 6-month follow-up indicated an overall statistically significant reduction from baseline (p = .0021) in symptoms associated with specific reported traumatic experiences. All 8 participants interviewed at the 6-month follow-up reported reductions in PTSD symptoms ranging from 15% to 67%. Significant decreases were seen in all 3 symptom clusters (p < .02). Patient self-reported intrusion symptoms as measured by the Impact of Event Scale were significantly lower (p < .05) at 3 months than at baseline but not at 6 months, although there was a clear trend toward fewer intrusive thoughts and somewhat less avoidance.

Virtual reality exposure therapy holds promise for treating PTSD in Vietnam veterans.",2001.0,0.0,508.0,"{'volume': '62 8', 'pages': '\n          617-22\n        ', 'name': 'The Journal of clinical psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rothbaum2001VirtualRE,\n author = {B.

Background: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes. Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r̄ = +0.26, with an experimental effect size of d̄ = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role. Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors. Application: The findings provide quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors influencing HRI trust. Specifically, the current summary provides effect size estimates that are useful in establishing design and training guidelines with reference to robot-related factors of HRI trust. Furthermore, results indicate that improper trust calibration may be mitigated by the manipulation of robot design. However, many future research needs are identified.",2011.0,67.0,1251.0,"{'volume': '53', 'pages': '517 - 527', 'name': 'Human Factors: The Journal of Human Factors and Ergonomics Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hancock2011AMO,\n author = {P.

To answer this question, a meta-review was conducted to assess the meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews published in this field in the last twenty-two months. Twenty-five different articles demonstrated the clinical potential of this technology in both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental health disorders: VR compares favorably to existing treatments in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management, with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. But why is VR so effective? Here, the following answer is suggested: VR shares with the brain the same basic mechanism: embodied simulations. According to neuroscience, to regulate and control the body in the world effectively, the brain creates an embodied simulation of the body in the world used to represent and predict actions, concepts, and emotions. VR works in a similar way: the VR experience tries to predict the sensory consequences of an individual's movements, providing to him/her the same scene he/she will see in the real world. To achieve this, the VR system, like the brain, maintains a model (simulation) of the body and the space around it. If the presence in the body is the outcome of different embodied simulations, concepts are embodied simulations, and VR is an embodied technology, this suggests a new clinical approach discussed in this article: the possibility of altering the experience of the body and facilitating cognitive modeling/change by designing targeted virtual environments able to simulate both the external and the internal world/body.",2019.0,169.0,249.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '82 - 96', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riva2019NeuroscienceOV,\n author = {G.

However, less research has considered the relationships between specific emotion regulation (ER) strategies, such as reappraisal and suppression, and social wellbeing in this age group. The current study investigated the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between 2 ER strategies (reappraisal and suppression) and social outcomes (peer victimization, friendship satisfaction, and family satisfaction) in young adolescents. Analyses also controlled for mental health (anxiety and depression). Given likely gender differences in these variables, key analyses were conducted in parallel for males and females. There were 232 Australian adolescents who completed measures in Grade 7 (Age Mean = 11.97, SD = .35; 64% female) and a year later in Grade 8. Zero-order correlations indicated an inverse relationship between suppression use and social wellbeing variables, although a number of these associations were no longer significant when controlling for mental health. There was limited evidence that reappraisal was uniquely related to social outcomes. However, interaction effects suggested that greater use of reappraisal might have provided some protection against the negative social effects of poorer mental health. Poorer mental and social wellbeing also appeared to be related to ER strategy use, particularly greater suppression use. The findings suggest that ER strategy use, mental health, and social outcomes all play important and interrelated roles in adolescent wellbeing.",2019.0,96.0,61.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '270–282', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chervonsky2019EmotionRM,\n author = {Elizabeth Chervonsky and C.

452,234d2b200697548ee4f34336f3d844f6ea299746,The impact of neurofeedback training on children with developmental trauma: A randomized controlled study.,"OBJECTIVE
Developmental trauma or chronic early childhood exposure to abuse and neglect by caregivers has been shown to have a long-lasting pervasive impact on mental and neural development, including problems with attention, impulse control, self-regulation, and executive functioning. Its long-term effects are arguably the costliest public health challenge in the United States. Children with developmental trauma rarely have a satisfactory response to currently available evidence-based psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments. Neurofeedback training (NFT) is a clinical application of brain computer interface technology, aiming to alter electrical brain activity associated with various mental dysfunctions. NFT has shown promise to improve posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.


METHOD
This randomized controlled study examined the effects of NFT on 37 children, aged 6-13 years with developmental trauma. Participants were randomly divided into active NFT (n = 20) or treatment-as-usual control (n = 17). Both groups underwent 4 assessments during equivalent timelines. The active group received 24 NFT sessions twice a week.


RESULTS
This pilot study demonstrated that 24 sessions of NFT significantly decreased PTSD symptoms, internalizing, externalizing, other behavioral and emotional symptoms, and significantly improved the executive functioning of children aged 6-13 years with severe histories of abuse and neglect who had not significantly benefited from any previous therapy.


CONCLUSIONS
NFT offers the possibility to improve learning, enhance self-efficacy, and develop better social relationships in this hitherto largely treatment-resistant population.

The papers in this special issue highlight context and dynamics as 2 important intersecting foci for future developmental research on emotion regulation. Ecological momentary assessment, passive sensing, and other ambulatory methods offer exciting new tools for capturing contextual features of the environment that may influence the selection of emotion regulation strategies and the effectiveness of specific strategies in different contexts. New interdisciplinary, methodological, and quantitative approaches also offer new tools for better characterizing the temporal dynamics of emotion regulation, including a focus on the coregulation of affect between parents and children. The next generation of emotion regulation researchers will require advanced interdisciplinary, quantitative, and technological skills to be able to leverage new tools that can better characterize the fine-grained dynamics of emotion regulation processes and the precise ways in which social contextual features modulate these processes.

461,23b5823919929e4a10beecf726d0cc0b3a8719f7,The stigma of childhood mental disorders: a conceptual framework.,"OBJECTIVE
To describe the state of the literature on stigma associated with children's mental disorders and highlight gaps in empirical work.


METHOD
We reviewed child mental illness stigma articles in (English only) peer-reviewed journals available through Medline and PsychInfo. We augmented these with adult-oriented stigma articles that focus on theory and measurement. A total of 145 articles in PsychInfo and 77 articles in MEDLINE met search criteria. The review process involved identifying and appraising literature convergence on the definition of critical dimensions of stigma, antecedents, and outcomes reported in empirical studies.


RESULTS
We found concurrence on three dimensions of stigma (negative stereotypes, devaluation, and discrimination), two contexts of stigma (self, general public), and two targets of stigma (self/individual, family). Theory and empirics on institutional and self-stigma in child populations were sparse. Literature reports few theoretic frameworks and conceptualizations of child mental illness stigma. One model of help seeking (the FINIS) explicitly acknowledges the role of stigma in children's access and use of mental health services.


CONCLUSIONS
Compared with adults, children are subject to unique stigmatizing contexts that have not been adequately studied. The field needs conceptual frameworks that get closer to stigma experiences that are causally linked to how parents/caregivers cope with children's emotional and behavioral problems, such as seeking professional help. To further research in child mental illness, we suggest an approach to adapting current theoretical frameworks and operationalizing stigma, highlighting three dimensions of stigma, three contexts of stigma (including institutions), and three targets of stigma (self/child, family, and services).",2010.0,86.0,211.0,"{'volume': '49 2', 'pages': '\n          92-103; quiz 198\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mukolo2010TheSO,\n author = {Abraham Mukolo and C.

The combination of new behavioral methods and computational methods has begun to unravel the interaction between processes related to strategic control and processes related to motor adaptation. These processes may operate on very different error signals. Strategy learning is sensitive to goal‐based performance error. In contrast, adaptation is sensitive to prediction errors between the desired and actual consequences of a planned movement. The former guides what the desired movement should be, whereas the latter guides how to implement the desired movement. Whereas traditional approaches have favored serial models in which an initial strategy‐based phase gives way to more automatized forms of control, it now seems that strategic and adaptive processes operate with considerable independence throughout learning, although the relative weight given the two processes will shift with changes in performance. As such, skill acquisition involves the synergistic engagement of strategic and adaptive processes.",2012.0,51.0,169.0,"{'volume': '1251', 'name': 'Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Taylor2012TheRO,\n author = {Jordan A.

467,24867aee6927e8798cf33eec7ac0aff9846f7bef,Development and Verification of an Alcohol Craving-Induction Tool Using Virtual Reality: Craving Characteristics in Social Pressure Situation,"Alcoholism is a disease that affects parts of the brain that control emotion, decisions, and behavior. Therapy for people with alcoholism must address coping skills for facing high-risk situations. Therefore, it is important to develop tools to mimic such conditions. Cue exposure therapy (CET) provides high-risk situations during treatment, which raises the individual's ability to recognize that alcohol craving is being induced. Using CET, it is hard to simulate situations that induce alcohol craving. By contrast, virtual reality (VR) approaches can present realistic situations that cannot be experienced directly in CET. Therefore, we hypothesized that is possible to model social pressure situations using VR. We developed a VR system for inducing alcohol craving under social pressure situations and measured both the induced alcohol craving and head gaze of participants. A 2 x 2 experimental model (alcohol-related locality vs. social pressure) was designed. In situations without an avatar (no social pressure), more alcohol craving was induced if alcohol was present than if it was not. And more alcohol craving was induced in situations with an avatar (social pressure) than in situations without an avatar (no social pressure). The difference of angle between the direction of head gazing and the direction of alcohol or avatar was smaller in situations with an avatar alone (social pressure) than in situations with alcohol alone. In situations with both alcohol and an avatar, the angle between the direction of head gaze and the direction of the avatar was smaller than between the direction of head gaze and the direction of the alcohol. Considering the results, this VR system induces alcohol craving using an avatar that can express various social pressure situations.",2008.0,16.0,48.0,"{'volume': '11 3', 'pages': '\n          302-9\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cho2008DevelopmentAV,\n author = {Sangwoo Cho and J.

In the current study, we compared a brief nature-based mindfulness VR experience to a resting control condition on anxious participants. Self-reported anxiety symptoms and resting-state EEG were recorded across intervals containing quiet rest or the VR intervention. EEG activity was analyzed as a function of global power shifts in Alpha and Beta activity, and with sLORETA current source density estimates of cingulate cortex regions of interest. Results demonstrated that both a quiet rest control condition and the VR meditation significantly reduced subjective reports of anxiety and increased Alpha power. However, the VR intervention uniquely resulted in shifting proportional power from higher Beta frequencies into lower Beta frequencies, and significantly reduced broadband Beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. These effects are consistent with a physiological reduction of anxiety.

The most commonly applied therapeutic intervention in cardiac rehabilitation is Schultz’s autogenic training, which has proven to be of little efficacy in reducing depression and anxiety disorders. At the same time, a growing number of scientific reports have been looking at the use of virtual reality (VR) to treat mental health problems. This study aimed at assessing the efficacy of virtual therapy in reducing levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in female CVD patients. Materials and Methods: The study included 43 women who were randomly divided into two groups: experimental group (N = 17), where eight-week cardiac rehabilitation was enhanced with VR-based therapeutic sessions, and control group (N = 26), where the VR therapy was replaced with Schultz’s autogenic training. Mental state parameters were measured using the Perception of Stress Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: In the experimental group, the sole parameter which failed to improve was HADS-Anxiety, which remained at the baseline level. In the control group, there was a deterioration in nearly all tested parameters except for HADS-Depression. Statistically significant differences in the efficacy of rehabilitation were recorded in relation to the level of stress in the sub-scales: emotional tension (p = 0.005), external stress (p = 0.012), intrapsychic stress (p = 0.023) and the generalized stress scale (p = 0.004).

The intensive care unit is a stressful environment for its staff, especially physicians and nurses. These stresses may have negative effects on the mental health and performance of the nurses and physicians. But the complications caused by this stress can be prevented by training emotional intelligence components. In this study, the impact of training emotional intelligence components on stress and anxiety in nurses and expert physicians is examined. Methodology: A cross-interventional, pre- to post-, case and control group design was used and inferential study design was implemented. Our study included 150 registered hospitals physicians and nurses, who were widely distributed. In the study, a ten-question demographic questionnaire, a 20-question situational anxiety Berger (overt) questionnaire, and a 133-question Bar-on emotional intelligence questionnaire were used. Results: Research results indicate that average score for the situational anxiety of the case group in nurses was 47.20 before the intervention and it was reduced to 42.00 after the intervention, and in physicians was 40.46 before the intervention and it decreased to 33.66 after implementation of training items of emotional intelligence, which indicates the impact of training of emotional intelligence components on reduction of situational anxiety. The average score of situational anxiety of control group nurses was 46.73 before the intervention and it decreased to 45.70. In physicians, it was 38.33 before the intervention and it increased to 39.40 during post-test. However, t-test did not confirmed a statistically significant difference between the average score of situational anxiety of both case and control groups before the intervention, and there was a statistically significant difference between the average score of both case and control groups after training components of emotional intelligence (P = 0.000). Conclusion: Training emotional intelligence components reduces situational anxiety of nurses and physicians working in intensive care units and their emotional intelligence score increased and situational anxiety score was significantly reduced.",2012.0,23.0,40.0,"{'volume': '5', 'pages': '5 - 10', 'name': 'International Journal of General Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nooryan2012ControllingAI,\n author = {K.

In the later 1800s, toward the end of his career, Fechner performed experiments to empirically evaluate the beauty of rectangles, hypothesizing that the preferred shape would closely match that of the so-called 'golden rectangle'. His findings confirmed his suspicions, but in the intervening decades there has been significant evidence pointing away from that finding. Regardless of the results of this one study, Fechner ushered in the notion of using a metric to evaluate beauty in a psychophysical way. In this paper, we recreate the experiment using more naturalistic stimuli. We evaluate subjects' preferences against models that use various types of object complexity as metrics. Our findings that subjects prefer either very simple or very complex objects runs contrary to the hypothesized results, but are systematic none the less. We conclude that there are likely to be useful measures of aesthetic preference but they are likely to be complicated by the difficulty in defining some of their constituent parts.",2010.0,21.0,35.0,"{'volume': '23 3', 'pages': '\n          263-71\n        ', 'name': 'Seeing and perceiving'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Norman2010FechnersAR,\n author = {J.

One such trait is positive urgency: the tendency to act rashly when experiencing extremely positive affect. This trait may be relevant for college student risky behavior, because it appears that a great deal of college student risky behavior is undertaken during periods of intensely positive mood states. To test this possibility, the authors conducted a longitudinal study designed to predict increases in risky sexual behavior and illegal drug use over the course of the first year of college (n=407). In a well-fitting structural model, positive urgency predicted increases in illegal drug use and risky sexual behavior, even after controlling for time 1 (T1) involvement in both risky behaviors, biological sex, and T1 scores on four other personality dispositions to rash action.

Hence computer analysis of heart rate variability might provide a quantitative index of that interaction. The power spectral density (PSD) estimate of heart rate variability was obtained in normal controls and in uncomplicated hypertensives, both at rest and during a non-hypotensive sympathetic stimulus (tilting). In normal controls PSD shows three major peaks of frequencies P1 = 0.07, P2 = 0.12, P3 = 0.25 cycles/beat. P1, which is associated with sympathetic activity, represents only a minor portion of total variability at rest, while becoming predominant with tilting. P2 and P3 are associated with vagal activity, and represent the major part of variability at rest, while they are reduced by tilting. In hypertensive patients PSD is altered, as P1 is already predominant at rest and increases only slightly with tilting. Thus PSD of heart rate variability is capable of detecting an early alteration in sympatho-vagal balance of cardiac control present in uncomplicated hypertension.",1984.0,0.0,144.0,"{'volume': '2 3', 'pages': '\n          S383-5\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of hypertension.

In particular we suggest that activations common to all subjects reflect aspects of functional anatomy that may be ""typical"" of the population from which that group was sampled. These commonalities can be identified by a conjunction analysis of the activation effects in which the contrasts, testing for an activation, are specified separately for each subject. A conjunction is the joint refutation of multiple null hypotheses, in this instance, of no activation in any subject. The motivation behind this use of conjunctions is that fixed-effect analyses are generally more ""sensitive"" than equivalent random-effect analyses. This is because fixed-effect analyses can harness the large degrees of freedom and small scan-to-scan variability (relative to the variability in responses from subject to subject) when assessing the significance of an estimated response. The price one pays for the apparent sensitivity of fixed-effect analyses is that the ensuing inferences pertain to, and only to, the subjects studied. However, a conjunction analysis, using a fixed-effect model, allows one to infer: (i) that every subject studied activated and (ii) that at least a certain proportion of the population would have shown this effect. The second inference depends upon a meta-analytic formulation in terms of a confidence region for this proportion. This approach retains the sensitivity of fixed-effect analyses when the inference that only a substantial proportion of the population activates is sufficient.",1999.0,15.0,1102.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '385-396', 'name': 'NeuroImage'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Friston1999MultisubjectFS,\n author = {Karl J.

Guided attention to self can alleviate this disconnect as in focused-attention meditation, in which breathing often constitutes the primary object on which to focus attention. In this context, sustained breath awareness plays a crucial role in the emergence of the meditation experience. We designed an immersive virtual environment (iVE) with a generative soundtrack that supports sustained attention on breathing by employing the users' breathing in interaction. Both sounds and visuals are directly mapped to the user's breathing patterns, thus bringing the awareness researched. We conducted micro-phenomenology interviews to unfold the process in which breath awareness can be induced and sustained in this environment. The findings revealed the mechanisms by which audio and visual cues in VR can elicit and foster breath-awareness, and unfolded the nuances of this process through subjective experiences of the study participants. Finally, the results emphasize the important role that a sense of agency and control have in shaping the overall quality of the experience. This can in turn inform the design specifications of future mindfulness-based designs focused on breath awareness.",2018.0,78.0,55.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2018 Designing Interactive Systems Conference'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Prpa2018AttendingTB,\n author = {Mirjana Prpa and Kıvanç Tatar and Jules Françoise and B.

Building on existing research concerning this everyday process, the authors describe the development of a theoretical classification scheme that distinguishes between the types of strategy used to achieve interpersonal affect regulation. To test the theoretical classification, the authors generated a corpus of 378 distinct strategies using self-report questionnaires and diaries completed by student and working samples. Twenty participants then performed a card-sort of the strategies. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to determine how well the theoretical classification represented spontaneous understandings of controlled interpersonal affect regulation. The final classification primarily distinguished between strategies used to improve versus those used to worsen others' affect, and between strategies that engaged the target in a situation or affective state versus relationship-oriented strategies.

Human Voice versus Synthetic Voice for Intelligent Virtual Agents,"The use of intelligent virtual agents (IVA) to support humans in social contexts will depend on their social acceptability. Acceptance will be related to the human’s perception of the IVAs as well as the IVAs’ ability to respond and adapt their conversation appropriately to the human. Adaptation implies computer-generated speech (synthetic speech), such as text-to-speech (TTS). In this paper, we present the results of a study to investigate the effect of voice type (human voice vs. synthetic voice) on two aspects: (1) the IVA’s likeability and voice impression in the light of co-presence, and (2) the interaction outcome, including human–agent trust and behavior change intention. The experiment included 118 participants who interacted with either the virtual advisor with TTS or the virtual advisor with human voice to gain tips for reducing their study stress. Participants in this study found the voice of the virtual advisor with TTS to be more eerie, but they rated both agents, with recorded voice and with TTS, similarly in terms of likeability. They further showed a similar attitude towards both agents in terms of co-presence and building trust. These results challenge previous studies that favor human voice over TTS, and suggest that even if human voice is preferred, TTS can deliver equivalent benefits.",2022.0,72.0,4.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '51', 'name': 'Multimodal Technol.

Totally 214 color samples were evaluated on 12 emotion variables by subjects from seven different region groups in the psychophysical experiment. By factor analysis, it was found that three factors were sufficient to represent 80 11 ""region-emotion"" variables. For each variable, there is no distinct difference among different region groups. The 12 emotion variables could be divided into four categories, namely, activity index, potency index, definition index, and temperature index. Factor scores were further calculated to study the determinants on each factor. The analysis showed that the three factors were mainly related to chroma, lightness, and hue, respectively. It was concluded that chroma and lightness were the most important factors on color emotion, whereas the influences of hue and cultural background were very limited.

Age-related differences in emotion-regulation choice.,"Does aging impact strategy choice with regard to regulating negative emotions? Based on the assumption that older adults are highly motivated to quickly defuse negative states, we predicted that older adults, relative to young adults, would show an increased preference for distraction (a cognitive disengagement strategy) over reappraisal (a cognitive engagement strategy) in the face of negative material. A stronger preference for distraction, in turn, should be associated with higher affective well-being at older ages, as it helps to avoid high physiological arousal. Young (19-28 years, n = 38) and older (65-75 years, n = 39) adults completed a laboratory task of emotion-regulation choice in which they viewed negative pictures of high and low intensity and chose between distraction and reappraisal to regulate their emotional response. Confirming predictions, age was associated with an increased preference to choose distraction over reappraisal. Among older but not young adults, the relative preference for distraction to reappraisal predicted higher state-affective well-being. In addition, across age groups, the preference for distraction over reappraisal was positively predicted by stimulus intensity and negatively by cognitive resources. Findings support the notion of an age-related shift toward disengagement strategies to regulate negative emotions, which maps onto older adults' prohedonic orientation and holds affective benefits.",2015.0,30.0,133.0,"{'volume': '15 6', 'pages': '\n          677-81\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Scheibe2015DistractOR,\n author = {S.

504,2879771bbe4d48f674419c1fbe0b6e2eda67c4d2,Transforming Experience: The Potential of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality for Enhancing Personal and Clinical Change,"During life, many personal changes occur. These include changing house, school, work, and even friends and partners. However, the daily experience shows clearly that, in some situations, subjects are unable to change even if they want to. The recent advances in psychology and neuroscience are now providing a better view of personal change, the change affecting our assumptive world: (a) the focus of personal change is reducing the distance between self and reality (conflict); (b) this reduction is achieved through (1) an intense focus on the particular experience creating the conflict or (2) an internal or external reorganization of this experience; (c) personal change requires a progression through a series of different stages that however happen in discontinuous and non-linear ways; and (d) clinical psychology is often used to facilitate personal change when subjects are unable to move forward. Starting from these premises, the aim of this paper is to review the potential of virtuality for enhancing the processes of personal and clinical change. First, the paper focuses on the two leading virtual technologies – augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) – exploring their current uses in behavioral health and the outcomes of the 28 available systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Then the paper discusses the added value provided by VR and AR in transforming our external experience by focusing on the high level of personal efficacy and self-reflectiveness generated by their sense of presence and emotional engagement. Finally, it outlines the potential future use of virtuality for transforming our inner experience by structuring, altering, and/or replacing our bodily self-consciousness. The final outcome may be a new generation of transformative experiences that provide knowledge that is epistemically inaccessible to the individual until he or she has that experience, while at the same time transforming the individual’s worldview.",2016.0,176.0,256.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riva2016TransformingET,\n author = {G.

In this paper we provide a more systematic approach to analyzing such risk criteria within a stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulation.

The conditions are derived from problem primitives, primarily focusing on the relation between the arm reward distributions and the (risk criteria) performance metric. Among other things, the work highlights some (possibly non-intuitive) subtleties that differentiate various criteria in conjunction with statistical properties of the arms.

For this reason, obesity treatment requires a more integrated approach than the standard behavioral treatment based on dietary and physical activity only. To test the long-term efficacy of an enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) of obesity, including a virtual reality (VR) module aimed at both unlocking the negative memory of the body and to modify its behavioral and emotional correlates, 163 female morbidly obese inpatients (body mass index >40) were randomly assigned to three conditions: a standard behavioral inpatient program (SBP), SBP plus standard CBT, and SBP plus VR-enhanced CBT. Patients' weight, eating behavior, and body dissatisfaction were measured at the start and upon completion of the inpatient program. Weight was assessed also at 1 year follow-up. All measures improved significantly at discharge from the inpatient program, and no significant difference was found among the conditions. However, odds ratios showed that patients in the VR condition had a greater probability of maintaining or improving weight loss at 1 year follow-up than SBP patients had (48% vs. 11%, p = 0.004) and, to a lesser extent, than CBT patients had (48% vs. 29%, p = 0.08). Indeed, only the VR-enhanced CBT was effective in further improving weight loss at 1 year follow-up. On the contrary, participants who received only the inpatient program regained back, on average, most of the weight they had lost. Findings support the hypothesis that a VR module addressing the locked negative memory of the body may enhance the long-term efficacy of standard CBT.",2016.0,52.0,76.0,"{'volume': '19 2', 'pages': '\n          134-40\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Manzoni2016VirtualRC,\n author = {G.

One approach to validate these concepts is to investigate the relationship between pathological brain markers and cognition in those individuals. Method We included 126 participants from the Consortium for the Early Identification of Alzheimer’s disease-Quebec (CIMA-Q) cohort (67 SCD, 29 MCI, and 30 cognitively healthy controls [CH]). All participants underwent a complete cognitive assessment and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Group comparisons were done using cognitive data, and then correlated with hippocampal volumes and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Results Significant differences were found between participants with MCI and CH on episodic and executive tasks, but no differences were found when comparing SCD and CH. Scores on episodic memory tests correlated with hippocampal volumes in both MCI and SCD, whereas performance on executive tests correlated with WMH in all of our groups. Discussion As expected, the SCD group was shown to be cognitively healthy on tasks where MCI participants showed impairment. However, SCD’s hippocampal volume related to episodic memory performances, and WMH to executive functions. Thus, SCD represents a valid research concept and should be used, alongside MCI, to better understand the preclinical/prodromal phase of AD.",2019.0,74.0,33.0,"{'volume': '75', 'pages': '1382 - 1392', 'name': 'The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Caillaud2019EvidenceOA,\n author = {Marie Caillaud and C.

This fact can be detrimental to the well-being and academic achievement of the students. In many developed countries, about 90% of the pupils in compulsory secondary education report witnessing assaults among peers. In this regard, recognizing, controlling and managing emotions is key to ensure a healthy and effective interaction with others. Negative emotions, such as anger, can trigger conflicts or even episodes of violence if not regulated properly. Interactive tools, such as specialized software’s, have shown high rates of efficacy for the training of different kinds of competences like the regulation of emotions. The aim of the present work is to describe the Happy Emotional Education Program and its effects over a sample of secondary school students. This software focuses in the training of emotional competences of the students with the objective of solving conflicts in a more assertive way. The design employed in the present work was a quasiexperimental design with pretest and posttest with a control group. Results show that Happy Emotional Education Program contributes to the management of emotions and the absence of negative affect or anxiety in a significant way. Additionally, the constant use of this interactive tool enhances motivation and the learning process of students. Results also indicate the importance of assessing the effects of the program in the long term.

We extend this research by exploring whether this effect of VRPT is driven by increased empathy and whether the effect extends to ostensibly real-stakes behavioral games. In a pre-registered laboratory experiment (N = 180), participants interacted with an ostensible partner (a student from the same university as them) on a series of real-stakes economic games after (a) taking the perspective of the partner in a virtual reality, “day-in-the-life” simulation, (b) taking the perspective of a different person in a “day-in-the-life” simulation, or (c) doing a neutral activity in a virtual environment. The VRPT experience successfully increased participants’ subsequent propensity to take the perspective of their partner (a facet of empathy), but only if the partner was the same person whose perspective participants assumed in the virtual reality simulation. Further, this effect of VRPT on perspective-taking was moderated by participants’ reported feeling of immersion in the virtual environment.

Subjects were 50 cancer patients ranging in age from 17 to 69. They were randomly selected and placed into the live or taped music categories. Each subject listened to 25 minutes of music. Pre- and post-music mood states were recorded on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. Additional post-music responses were recorded on the author’s Summary Questionnaire. The live and taped pre- and post-music scores were compared. The live music subjects reported significantly less (p < .05) TensionAnxiety and more Vigor than did the taped music subjects. In addition live music subjects reported significantly more changes in physical discomfort (p < .05), changes in mood (p < .01), and changes in mood for the better (p < .001); and recommended music sessions for others (p < .01). Results indicate the particular effectiveness of using live music to assist in relieving tension and promoting vigor.

With the advancement of technology our understanding of emotions are advancing, there is a growing need for automatic emotion recognition systems. One of the directions the research is heading is the use of Neural Networks which are adept at estimating complex functions that depend on a large number and diverse source of input data. In this paper we attempt to exploit this effectiveness of Neural networks to enable us to perform multimodal Emotion recognition on IEMOCAP dataset using data from Speech, Text, and Motion capture data from face expressions, rotation and hand movements.

It would strengthen the case for this hypothesis if a model for the internal clock were available from which predictions could be derived and tested, and if the basic parameter of such a model, the frequency at which the clock runs, could be estimated. A model for an internal temporal pacemaker is briefly described and its properties are explored by computer simulation. Results are obtained that provide a basis for predicting that, under appropriate conditions, interference between an imposed rhythm and the frequency of a temporal oscillator may cause perturbations in temporal judgment which are related to the characteristic frequency of that oscillator. Experimental data are reported which appear to demonstrate such an interference pattern.

However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter's effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6% parameters per task.

This model stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions, which posit that a discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion. We propose that basic emotion theories no longer explain adequately the vast number of empirical observations from studies in affective neuroscience, and we suggest that a conceptual shift is needed in the empirical approaches taken to the study of emotion and affective psychopathologies. The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect. Moreover, the model offers new theoretical and empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as well as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing within the central nervous system.This work was supported in part by NIMH Grants MH01232, MH59139, MH36197, MHK02-74677, and MH068318; a grant from the National Alliance for Research in Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders (NARSAD); NSF Grant BSC-0421702; and funding from the Thomas D.

The ability to rapidly switch between tasks is important in a variety of contexts. Training in task switching may be particularly valuable for children with intellectual disability (ID), specifically ID linked to genetic syndromes such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We have developed a cognitive training game for children with PWS and performed a pilot evaluation of the programme to inform future game development. Here, we describe and critically reflect on the development and pilot evaluation process. Methods. Several novel aspects of our approach are highlighted in this paper, including the involvement (in various roles) of children with a rare genetic syndrome (PWS) in the development and evaluation of the software (participatory design) and the development of a matched control, or placebo version of the game for use in the pilot evaluation. Results. Children with PWS were capable of contributing to the design and development of a cognitive training game in various roles. In the subsequent pilot evaluation, playing the active version of the game was associated with greater improvement in task switching performance than playing the matched control (placebo) version of the game. However, attrition was an issue during both the design phase and the pilot evaluation. Conclusions. The lessons learned from our work have relevance in a wide range of contexts, such as the development of future cognitive training games; the evaluation of serious games in general; and the involvement of end-users with cognitive disabilities and/or rare syndromes in the design and development of software.",2019.0,29.0,11.0,"{'volume': '50', 'pages': '160 - 179', 'name': 'Simulation & Gaming'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Robb2019DevelopingAT,\n author = {Nigel Robb and A.

However, metrics have relied on average values, not dynamic measures of emotional volatility. Objective The aim of this study was to report on the associations between depression severity and the variability (time-unstructured) and instability (time-structured) in emotion word expression on Facebook and Twitter across status updates. Methods Status updates and depression severity ratings of 29 Facebook users and 49 Twitter users were collected through the app MoodPrism. The average proportion of positive and negative emotion words used, within-person variability, and instability were computed. Results Negative emotion word instability was a significant predictor of greater depression severity on Facebook (rs(29)=.44, P=.02, 95% CI 0.09-0.69), even after controlling for the average proportion of negative emotion words used (partial rs(26)=.51, P=.006) and within-person variability (partial rs(26)=.49, P=.009). A different pattern emerged on Twitter where greater negative emotion word variability indicated lower depression severity (rs(49)=−.34, P=.01, 95% CI −0.58 to 0.09). Differences between Facebook and Twitter users in their emotion word patterns and psychological characteristics were also explored.

Making sense is the activity of fitting something puzzling into a coherent pattern of mental representations that include concepts, beliefs, goals, and actions. Paul Thagard proposes a general theory of coherence as the satisfaction of multiple interacting constraints, and discusses the theory's numerous psychological and philosophical applications. Much of human cognition can be understood in terms of coherence as constraint satisfaction, and many of the central problems of philosophy can be given coherence-based solutions. Thagard shows how coherence can help to unify psychology and philosophy, particularly when addressing questions of epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and aesthetics.

In order to provide clarity about the reliability and size of the Proteus effect, a meta-analysis was conducted with 46 quantitative experimental studies in which avatars with specific characteristics were randomly assigned to participants. Results indicate a relatively consistent effect size (between .22 and .26, depending on subset of studies examined) and nearly all variance explained. Unexplained variance differed between studies that used behavioral or attitudinal measures, while studies which examined potential moderators explained all variance. Overall, this research suggests that the Proteus effect is a reliable phenomenon, with a small-but-approaching-medium effect size according to a traditional rule of thumb, but is relatively large compared to other digital media effects examined in previous meta analyses.",2019.0,100.0,117.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '651 - 675', 'name': 'Media Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ratan2019AvatarCI,\n author = {R.

Perseverative cognition is not only implicated in psychological health, contributing to mood worsening and psychopathology but, due to its ability to elicit prolonged physiological activity, is also considered to play a role in somatic health. Although there is emerging evidence that such negative and persistent thoughts have consequences on the body, this association has not yet been quantified. The aim of this study was to meta-analyze available studies on the physiological concomitants of perseverative cognition in healthy subjects. Separate meta-analyses were performed on each examined physiological parameter. Sixty studies were eligible for the analyses. Associations emerged between perseverative cognition and higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) (g = .45) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (g = .51) in experimental studies, and higher heart rate (HR) (g = .28 and g = .20) and cortisol (g = .36 and g = .32), and lower heart rate variability (HRV) (g = .15 and g = .27) in experimental and correlational studies, respectively. Significant moderators were sex, ethnicity, type of induction used to elicit perseverative cognition, assessment of state versus trait perseverative cognition, focus on worry or rumination, duration of physiological assessment, and quality of the studies. With the exception of blood pressure, results were not influenced by publication bias. Results show that perseverative cognition affects cardiovascular, autonomic, and endocrine nervous system activity, suggesting a pathogenic pathway to long-term disease outcomes and clarifying the still unexplained relationship between chronic stress and health vulnerability.",2016.0,155.0,335.0,"{'volume': '142 3', 'pages': '\n          231-259\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ottaviani2016PhysiologicalCO,\n author = {C.

Self-Attachment is a recently introduced psychotherapeutic method in which the patient creates a compassionate and affectional bond with their childhood-self using their childhood photos. The underlying theory and the promising results of the Self-Attachment therapy, in combination with its self-administrable nature, motivate further research in technologies that can enhance the procedure of the therapy. Virtual reality is a technology that has experienced rapid evolution over the last years, yet its ability to replace existing psychotherapeutic techniques remains fairly unexplored. The aim of this thesis is to create a user-friendly and highly interactive virtual reality platform that delivers the Self-Attachment therapy in an efficient way by creating an avatar of the patient’s childhood-self based on a 2D childhood photo. For the fulfillment of this goal, the implemented platform has been equipped with the latest features of the head-mounted Oculus Quest device and interactable components. In addition, the virtual environment features a virtual agent who acts as an assistant and is able to predict the emotional state of the user. The aforementioned achievements have led to the creation of a complete virtual platform, capable of autonomously delivering the Self-Attachment therapy in a personalised experience for the user. During an impact evaluation trial, a version of the platform was tested by seven healthy individuals and the results were promising. The high levels of immersiveness of the platform and its ability to attract and maintain the user’s engagement played a crucial role in obtaining positive feedback from the participants. Furthermore, the platform was successful in triggering participants’ emotions, who in the end preferred the virtual experience over the original therapy which is based on the use of their childhood photo. Consequently, we believe that this project is the beginning of the creation of a tool that will be able to autonomously and effectively treat people with mental disorders in the near future.",2020.0,50.0,1.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Edalat2020VirtualRP,\n author = {A.

SettingThe study was conducted in a burn care unit at a regional trauma center. PatientsSeven patients aged 9–32 years (mean age of 21.9 years; average of 23.7% total body surface area burned [range, 3–60%]) performed range-of-motion exercises of their injured extremity under an occupational therapist's direction on at least 3 separate days each. InterventionFor each physical therapy session, each patient spent equal amounts of time in virtual reality and in the control condition (no distraction). The mean duration of physical therapy in virtual reality was 3.5, 4.9, and 6.4 minutes for the first, second, and third session, respectively. Condition order was randomized and counterbalanced. Outcome MeasuresFor each of the three physical therapy sessions, five visual analog pain scores for each treatment condition served as the dependent variables. ResultsPain ratings were statistically lower when patients were in virtual reality, and the magnitude of pain reduction did not diminish with repeated use of virtual reality. The results of this study may be examined in more detail at www.vrpain.com. ConclusionsAlthough the small sample size limits generalizability, results provide converging preliminary evidence that virtual reality can function as a strong nonpharmacological pain reduction technique for burn patients during physical therapy. Results suggest that virtual reality does not diminish in analgesic effectiveness with three (and possibly more) uses. Virtual reality may also have analgesic potential for other painful procedures or pain populations.

Therapeutic approaches have traditionally involved medication and physiotherapy but such approaches are limited over time by their cost and side effects. This review seeks to critically evaluate the evidence for and against IVR as an adjunctive therapy for acute clinical pain applications. Methods:A rapid evidence assessment (REA) strategy was used. CINAHL, Medline, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and the Cochrane Library databases were screened in from December 2012 to March 2013 to identify studies exploring IVR therapies as an intervention to assist in the management of pain. Main outcome measures were for acute pain and functional impairment. Results:Seventeen research studies were included in total including 5 RCTs, 6 randomized crossover studies, 2 case series studies, and 4 single-patient case studies. This included a total of 337 patients. Of these studies only 4 had a low risk of bias. There was strong overall evidence for immediate and short-term pain reduction, whereas moderate evidence was found for short-term effects on physical function. Little evidence exists for longer-term benefits. IVR was not associated with any serious adverse events. Discussion:This review found moderate evidence for the reduction of pain and functional impairment after IVR in patients with acute pain.

Objective The aim was to determine the effects of Plan-It Commander on daily life skills of children with ADHD in a multisite randomized controlled crossover open-label trial. Methods Participants (N=170) in this 20-week trial had a diagnosis of ADHD and ranged in age from 8 to 12 years (male: 80.6%, 137/170; female: 19.4%, 33/170). They were randomized to a serious game intervention group (group 1; n=88) or a treatment-as-usual crossover group (group 2; n=82). Participants randomized to group 1 received a serious game intervention in addition to treatment as usual for the first 10 weeks and then received treatment as usual for the next 10 weeks. Participants randomized to group 2 received treatment as usual for the first 10 weeks and crossed over to the serious game intervention in addition to treatment as usual for the subsequent 10 weeks. Primary (parent report) and secondary (parent, teacher, and child self-report) outcome measures were administered at baseline, 10 weeks, and 10-week follow-up. Results After 10 weeks, participants in group 1 compared to group 2 achieved significantly greater improvements on the primary outcome of time management skills (parent-reported; P=.004) and on secondary outcomes of the social skill of responsibility (parent-reported; P=.04), and working memory (parent-reported; P=.02). Parents and teachers reported that total social skills improved over time within groups, whereas effects on total social skills and teacher-reported planning/organizing skills were nonsignificant between groups. Within group 1, positive effects were maintained or further improved in the last 10 weeks of the study.

However, almost all previous studies of social avoidance were restricted to using self-reports for the study of intentional aspects of avoidance. In contrast, the current study used immersive virtual reality technology to measure interpersonal distance as an index of avoidance, an unintentional behavioural indicator. In a virtual supermarket, twenty-three female participants differing in social anxiety approached computer-generated persons (avatars) under the pretext of a cover story. During the task, different aspects of approach and avoidance were measured. The results confirmed the hypotheses: The more anxious participants were, the more slowly they approached the avatars, and the larger the distance they kept from the avatars.

Using event-related fMRI, we tested the hypothesis that voluntary modulation of negative emotion is associated with changes in neural activity within the amygdala. Negative and neutral pictures were presented with instructions to either maintain the emotional response or passively view the picture without regulating the emotion. Each picture presentation was followed by a delay, after which subjects indicated how they currently felt via a response keypad. Consistent with previous reports, greater signal change was observed in the amygdala during the presentation of negative compared to neutral pictures. No significant effect of instruction was found during the picture presentation component of the trial. However, a prolonged increase in signal change was observed in the amygdala when subjects maintained the negative emotional response during the delay following negative picture offset. This increase in amygdalar signal due to the active maintenance of negative emotion was significantly correlated with subjects' self-reported dispositional levels of negative affect. These results suggest that consciously evoked cognitive mechanisms that alter the emotional response of the subject operate, at least in part, by altering the degree of neural activity within the amygdala.",2002.0,55.0,310.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '913-921', 'name': 'Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schaefer2002ModulationOA,\n author = {S.

It has been used for assessments and training in social cognition with the use of virtual agents instead of face-to-face interactions – but its potential for the study of social emotion regulation has, perhaps surprisingly, largely remained untapped. The present study evaluates a novel immersive VR scenario designed to study the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent using a modified version of Cyberball, an established paradigm to induce the feeling of ostracism. Participants embodied a new pupil in a virtual school environment and played Cyberball, after which they either did or did not receive emotional support. Self-reports and psychophysiological markers demonstrated that the negative impact of social exclusion in Cyberball was successfully replicated, while participants also reported a significant improvement in emotional state after being supported by the virtual agent. These results indicate the potential of the developed scenario for research on social emotion regulation in immersive VR.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.

This suggested that the degree of arousal could modulate the interference effect. In Experiment 2, high- and low-arousing pictures with a positive or negative valence were used. In line with the arousal hypothesis, high-arousal pictures interfered more with responding and stopping than low-arousing pictures whereas the valence of the pictures had little or no effect.

 Antecedents
 Interpersonal emotional regulation (IER) is the deliberate attempt to influence others’ emotions. There is not enough research on IER in the context of romantic couples.
 
 
 Aim
 The aim of the present study was to develop and validate an instrument to assess couples’ IER and understanding its functioning at both an individual and dyadic level.
 
 
 Method
 Participants were 764 adults and 91 dyads. Three studies were carried out: first, to study the psychometric properties of the scale and its validity; second, to understand the functioning of the scale at a dyadic level; third, to analyse the predictive capacity of the instrument.
 
 
 Results
 Our 11-item scale has four factors: observe, ask, validate, and soothe feelings. These factors are doubly evaluated: as an agent (SIERC-A) and as a target (SIERC-B). The scale showed good psychometric properties and adequate internal consistency. It presents convergent validity with emotional competences, and divergent validity with emotional dysregulation and insecure attachment. At a dyadic level, there is an actor-partner effect of IER on couple adjustment. Finally, IER seems to predict relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and life satisfaction.
 
 
 Discussion
 This new instrument can be a useful tool for assessment and intervention in couple therapy and research.

The trait-pleasure scale was correlated positively with measures of social desirability, achieving tendency, extroversion, and affiliative tendency, and was correlated negatively with measures of trait-anxiety, neuroticism, and aggression. The trait-arousal scale was not related to the social desirability scale, and was correlated positively with measures of trait-anxiety, neuroticism, and aggression. The trait-dominance scale was also free of social desirability bias. It exhibited positive correlations with measures of dominance-submissiveness, autonomy, extroversion, achieving tendency, and aggression, and negative correlations with measures of trait-anxiety and neuroticism.",1978.0,22.0,71.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '1105 - 1117', 'name': 'Educational and Psychological Measurement'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mehrabian1978MeasuresOI,\n author = {A.

578,2f36a05985fa13ff2e555215a8049a4212eb5a34,Guidelines for Designing Computational Models of Emotions,"Rapid growth in computational modeling of emotion and cognitive-affective architectures occurred over the past 15 years. Emotion models and architectures are built to elucidate the mechanisms of emotions and enhance believability and effectiveness of synthetic agents and robots. Despite the many emotion models developed to date, a lack of consistency and clarity regarding what exactly it means to 'model emotions' persists. There are no systematic guidelines for development of computational models of emotions. This paper deconstructs the often vague term 'emotion modeling' by suggesting the view of emotion models in terms of two fundamental categories of processes: emotion generation and emotion effects. Computational tasks necessary to implement these processes are also identified. The paper addresses how computational building blocks provide a basis for the development of more systematic guidelines for affective model development. The paper concludes with a description of an affective requirements analysis and design process for developing affective computational models in agent architectures.",2011.0,92.0,131.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '26-79', 'name': 'Int.

Neurofeedback usually provides the audio and or video feedback. Positive or negative feedback is produced for desirable or undesirable brain activities, respectively. In this review, we provided clinical and technical information about the following issues: (1) Various neurofeedback treatment protocols i.e. alpha, beta, alpha/theta, delta, gamma, and theta; (2) Different EEG electrode placements i.e. standard recording channels in the frontal, temporal, central, and occipital lobes; (3) Electrode montages (unipolar, bipolar); (4) Types of neurofeedback i.e. frequency, power, slow cortical potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and so on; (5) Clinical applications of neurofeedback i.e. treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, drug addiction, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, dyslexia and dyscalculia, autistic spectrum disorders and so on as well as other applications such as pain management, and the improvement of musical and athletic performance; and (6) Neurofeedback softwares. To date, many studies have been conducted on the neurofeedback therapy and its effectiveness on the treatment of many diseases. Neurofeedback, like other treatments, has its own pros and cons. Although it is a non-invasive procedure, its validity has been questioned in terms of conclusive scientific evidence. For example, it is expensive, time-consuming and its benefits are not long-lasting. Also, it might take months to show the desired improvements. Nevertheless, neurofeedback is known as a complementary and alternative treatment of many brain dysfunctions.

The underlying ideas include findings and paradigms in developmental psychology and neuroscience, neuroplasticity and long term term potentiation, fMRI studies on human bond making and religious experience, and experiments in energy based artificial neural networks. The proposed self-attachment therapeutic technique is distinguished by its intervention to create an internal and passionate affectional bond within the individual between the “adult self”, representing the logical and cognitive faculty, and the “inner child”, representing the unregulated and undeveloped emotional circuits. The aim is to create more optimal circuits for emotional regulation. The proposed self-attachment protocols internally emulate within the individual the interactions of a good enough primary care-giver and child in order to moderate the child's arousal level, minimise its negative affects and maximize its positive affects. These interactions are assumed, in developmental neuroscience and in developmental psychology, to be the basis of secure attachment of children with their parents, which leads to an optimal regulation of neurotransmitters, hormones, and the emotional dynamics of the individual. We report on several case studies of this technique in recent years. Finally, we propose a simple mathematical model to capture the impact of self-attachment protocols using the notion of strong patterns in energy based neural networks and employ a recently developed mathematical model to examine the impact of self-attachment using emotional and cognitive neural pathways for decision making.",2015.0,71.0,18.0,"{'pages': '1-8', 'name': '2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Edalat2015IntroductionTS,\n author = {A.

We refer to this as the “person-based” approach to highlight the focus on understanding and accommodating the perspectives of the people who will use the intervention. While all intervention designers seek to elicit and incorporate the views of target users in a variety of ways, the person-based approach offers a distinctive and systematic means of addressing the user experience of intended behavior change techniques in particular and can enhance the use of theory-based and evidence-based approaches to intervention development. There are two key elements to the person-based approach. The first is a developmental process involving qualitative research with a wide range of people from the target user populations, carried out at every stage of intervention development, from planning to feasibility testing and implementation. This process goes beyond assessing acceptability, usability, and satisfaction, allowing the intervention designers to build a deep understanding of the psychosocial context of users and their views of the behavioral elements of the intervention. Insights from this process can be used to anticipate and interpret intervention usage and outcomes, and most importantly to modify the intervention to make it more persuasive, feasible, and relevant to users. The second element of the person-based approach is to identify “guiding principles” that can inspire and inform the intervention development by highlighting the distinctive ways that the intervention will address key context-specific behavioral issues. This paper describes how to implement the person-based approach, illustrating the process with examples of the insights gained from our experience of carrying out over a thousand interviews with users, while developing public health and illness management interventions that have proven effective in trials involving tens of thousands of users.",2015.0,85.0,857.0,"{'volume': '17', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yardley2015ThePA,\n author = {L.

Negative affect precedes binge eating and purging in bulimia nervosa (BN), but little is known about factors that precipitate negative affect in relation to these behaviors. We aimed to assess the temporal relation among stressful events, negative affect, and bulimic events in the natural environment using ecological momentary assessment.


METHOD
A total of 133 women with current BN recorded their mood, eating behavior, and the occurrence of stressful events every day for 2 weeks. Multilevel structural equation mediation models evaluated the relations among Time 1 stress measures (i.e., interpersonal stressors, work/environment stressors, general daily hassles, and stress appraisal), Time 2 negative affect, and Time 2 binge eating and purging, controlling for Time 1 negative affect.


RESULTS
Increases in negative affect from Time 1 to Time 2 significantly mediated the relations between Time 1 interpersonal stressors, work/environment stressors, general daily hassles, and stress appraisal and Time 2 binge eating and purging. When modeled simultaneously, confidence intervals for interpersonal stressors, general daily hassles, and stress appraisal did not overlap, suggesting that each had a distinct impact on negative affect in relation to binge eating and purging.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings indicate that stress precedes the occurrence of bulimic behaviors and that increases in negative affect following stressful events mediate this relation. Results suggest that stress and subsequent negative affect may function as maintenance factors for bulimic behaviors and should be targeted in treatment.",2014.0,65.0,122.0,"{'volume': '82 1', 'pages': '\n          30-9\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of consulting and clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Goldschmidt2014EcologicalMA,\n author = {Andrea B.

Because there is currently no vaccine or treatment for the underlying infection, current health efforts are focused on providing prevention and screening, maintaining continuity of treatment for other chronic conditions, and ensuring access to appropriately intensive services for those with the most severe symptoms.1 Disasters disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable populations, and patients with serious mental illness may be among the hardest hit. High rates of smoking in this population may raise the risk of infection and confer a worse prognosis among those who develop the illness.2 Residential instability and homelessness can raise the risk of infection and make it harder to identify, follow up, and treat those who are infected.3 Individuals with serious mental illnesses who are employed may have challenges taking time off from work and may lack sufficient insurance coverage to cover testing or treatment. Small social networks may limit opportunities to obtain support from friends and family members should individuals with serious mental illness become ill. Taken together, these factors may lead to elevated infection rates and worse prognoses in this population. What strategies are available to mitigate the outcome of this epidemic among patients with serious mental illness? Federal preparedness policies developed in the wake of complex disasters have increasingly embraced the notion of whole community preparedness, which supports building and supporting structures at multiple levels to prepare and respond, particularly for vulnerable populations.4 Within the public mental health care system, this includes engagement with mental health service users, clinicians, and federal and state policies.",2020.0,5.0,369.0,{'name': 'JAMA psychiatry'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Druss2020AddressingTC,\n author = {B.

Animal and human studies on neural pathways underlying social buffering typically examined physiological reactions or regional brain activations. However, direct links between emotional and social stimuli, distinct neural processes and behavioural outcomes are still missing. Using data of 27 female participants, the current study delineated a large-scale process model of social buffering’s neural underpinnings, connecting changes in neural activity to emotional behaviour by means of voxel-wise multilevel mediation analysis. Our results confirmed that three processes underlie human social buffering: (i) social support-related reduction of activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, anterior and mid-cingulate; (ii) downregulation of aversive emotion-induced brain activity in the superficial cortex-like amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus; and (iii) downregulation of reported aversive feelings. Results of the current study provide evidence for a distinct neural process model of aversive emotion regulation in humans by social buffering.",2020.0,57.0,8.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '561 - 570', 'name': 'Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bratec2020YourPS,\n author = {Satja Mulej Bratec and Teresa Bertram and G.

However, there is a substantial knowledge gap with regard to prevalence rates, neurobiological underpinnings, and effective treatments for apathy in pre-dementia states, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild behavioral impairment (MBI). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases to identify available research on apathy in prodromal dementia. Results: Apathy has consistently been detected in individuals with MCI with varying prevalence rates, and only recently has literature discussed the prevalence of apathy in MBI. Few pharmacological treatments have been utilized for apathy, with galantamine and risperidone showing mild reductions in apathetic behaviors. Non-pharmacological interventions in prodromal dementia are beginning to be explored and show promise, but few studies have replicated those results. Discussion: More comprehensive guidelines for diagnosing apathy and further research investigating neurobiological mechanisms of apathy in MCI and MBI are required in order to effectively treat apathetic patients in prodromal dementia.",2017.0,64.0,39.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '177 - 184', 'name': 'International Psychogeriatrics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sherman2017PrevalenceNA,\n author = {Chelsea Sherman and Celina S.

This contribution to boredom may shed light on its neural correlates, which are poorly characterized so far. A video game served as simulation of free interactive behavior without interruption of the game’s narrative. Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two independent coders performed the time-based analysis of the audio-visual game content. Boredom was operationalized as interaction of prolonged absence of goal-directed behavior with lowered affect in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). A decrease of positive affect (PA) correlated with response amplitudes in bilateral insular clusters extending into the amygdala to prolonged inactive phases in a game play and an increase in negative affect (NA) was associated with higher responses in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Precuneus and hippocampus responses were negatively correlated with changes in NA. We describe for the first time neural contributions to boredom, using a video game as complex virtual environment.

Despite its importance for successful social interactions, only a few studies have evaluated interpersonal emotion regulation in children. In detail, the study of developmental changes in the use of emotion regulation strategies overlooked age, gender and cultural differences across different emotions. To address this gap, the present study used the serious game Emodiscovery, a simulation game targeted at 8-10-year-olds, which measures the strategies selected by children to improve the emotions of anger, sadness, and fear displayed by 3D virtual characters. One-hundred British (M = 9.10 years; 39% girls) and 108 Spanish (M = 9.04, 44% girls) 8-10-year-olds played 3 different levels or scenarios of the game. In each level, the character displayed a negative emotion (i.e., sadness, anger, and fear, respectively) and children were first asked to indicate what emotion the character was feeling and afterward to interact three times with the character to improve his or her mood. In each interaction, 4 possible regulation strategies (2 adaptive and 2 maladaptive) were displayed for children to select. Results showed that in the scenario where the character was displaying sadness, 8-year-olds chose significantly less adaptive strategies than 10-years-olds. In the scenario where the character was angry, boys who accurately recognized the emotion of anger chose more adaptive strategies than those who did not recognize the emotion. For the scenario depicting fear, boys chose less adaptive strategies than girls. The obtained results highlight the importance of looking at specific emotions when researching interpersonal emotion regulation.

The authors' goal was to examine the efficacy of computer-generated (virtual reality) graded exposure in the treatment of acrophobia (fear of heights).


METHOD
Twenty college students with acrophobia were randomly assigned to virtual reality graded exposure treatment (N = 12) or to a waiting-list comparison group (N = 8). Seventeen students completed the study. Sessions were conducted individually over 8 weeks. Outcome was assessed by using measures of anxiety, avoidance, attitudes, and distress associated with exposure to heights before and after treatment.


RESULTS
Significant differences between the students who completed the virtual reality treatment (N = 10) and those on the waiting list (N = 7) were found on all measures. The treatment group was significantly improved after 8 weeks, but the comparison group was unchanged.

Methods: This study was cross-sectional from type of correlationa. The statistical population of the study was all nurses working in hospitals in Karaj in the last quarter of 1399, from which 400 people were selected by convenience sampling. In this study, coronary heart disease (CDAS), Cognitive Emotion Regulation (CERQ), Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory (ASI-R) and Psychological Hardness Scale (PHS) were used to collect data. The collected data were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient and multivariate regression analysis with enter model SPSS-19 software. Results: The results showed that there is a positive and significant relationship between cognitive regulation strategies of maladaptive emotion and anxiety sensitivity with coronary anxiety (P <0.01). There is a significant negative relationship between adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and psychological hardiness with coronary anxiety (P <0.01). Also, the results of multiple regression analysis revealed that 61.9% of the variance of coronary anxiety is explained by cognitive regulation of emotion, anxiety sensitivity and psychological hardiness. Conclusions: Adaptive cognitive regulation strategies and psychological hardiness had a negative role and maladaptive cognitive regulation strategies and anxiety sensitivity had a positive role in predicting Covid-19 disease anxiety in patients with type 2 diabetes.

625,32ad0b446bc14ccb98d07f09de76367de4fb0e64,Adolescent and sexual history factors influencing reproductive control among women aged 18-44.,"BACKGROUND
Reproductive control refers to the ability of a man or woman to control his or her own reproduction. Unintended pregnancy is a commonly used proxy measure for reproductive control.


METHODS
Using heterosexually active women participating in the National Survey of Family Growth Cycle 6 (n = 4521), we evaluated unintended pregnancy as a proxy measure for reproductive control. We identified four categories of women by self-reported pregnancy intention: (1) women reporting one unintended pregnancy, (2) women reporting two or more unintended pregnancies, (3) women reporting intentionally having no pregnancies and (4) women who reported that all pregnancies were intended (reference category). Polytomous logistic regression, weighted for the complex sampling design, provided estimates of odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS
Fifty-one percent of women who reported having one unintended pregnancy went on to experience at least one additional unintended pregnancy. Being black, Hispanic, born to a mother who was <18 years at first birth, having multiple partners and age of first sexual debut (consensual or non-consensual) were significant predictors of multiple unintended pregnancies. Relative to sexual debut after 18 years of age, women reporting a sexual debut at less than 15 years were at increased risk of multiple unintended pregnancies (adjusted OR (reported as consensual): 6.96; 95% CI: 4.26 to 11.39; adjusted OR (reported as non-consensual: 27.10; 95% CI: 11.03-66.57)).


CONCLUSIONS
Efforts to delay sexual debut and to protect girls from non-consensual sex are sorely needed to prevent a lifelong trajectory of lack of reproductive control.",2011.0,29.0,35.0,"{'volume': '8 1', 'pages': '\n          95-101\n        ', 'name': 'Sexual health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Magnusson2011AdolescentAS,\n author = {Brianna M.

627,32fc1d4acc6566f0930b4f51c783ab4fbb74eaf9,The neural basis of human social values: evidence from functional MRI.,"Social values are composed of social concepts (e.g., ""generosity"") and context-dependent moral sentiments (e.g., ""pride""). The neural basis of this intricate cognitive architecture has not been investigated thus far. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects imagined their own actions toward another person (self-agency) which either conformed or were counter to a social value and were associated with pride or guilt, respectively. Imagined actions of another person toward the subjects (other-agency) in accordance with or counter to a value were associated with gratitude or indignation/anger. As hypothesized, superior anterior temporal lobe (aTL) activity increased with conceptual detail in all conditions. During self-agency, activity in the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlated with pride and guilt, whereas activity in the subgenual cingulate solely correlated with guilt. In contrast, indignation/anger activated lateral orbitofrontal-insular cortices. Pride and gratitude additionally evoked mesolimbic and basal forebrain activations. Our results demonstrate that social values emerge from coactivation of stable abstract social conceptual representations in the superior aTL and context-dependent moral sentiments encoded in fronto-mesolimbic regions. This neural architecture may provide the basis of our ability to communicate about the meaning of social values across cultural contexts without limiting our flexibility to adapt their emotional interpretation.",2009.0,58.0,291.0,"{'volume': '19 2', 'pages': '\n          276-83\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zahn2009TheNB,\n author = {R.

The neurophysiology of subjective EA, among other mind-brain-body phenomena, can best be tested when subjects are stimulated in a natural fashion. Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables naturalistic experimental stimulation and thus promises to increase the ecological validity of research findings i.e., how well they generalize to real-life settings. In this study, 45 participants experienced virtual rollercoaster rides while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was then trained on the alpha-frequency (8-12 Hz) component of the EEG signal (input) and the retrospectively acquired continuous reports of subjective EA (target). With the LSTM-based model, subjective EA could be predicted significantly above chance level. This demonstrates a novel EEG-based decoding approach for subjective states of experience in naturalistic research designs using VR.",2018.0,28.0,21.0,"{'pages': '128-131', 'name': '2018 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality (AIVR)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hofmann2018DecodingSE,\n author = {Simon M.

629,3331a6d8daa55975dfab8e35f91b42157eb1a2e8,Illusion and well-being: a social psychological perspective on mental health.,"Many prominent theorists have argued that accurate perceptions of the self, the world, and the future are essential for mental health. Yet considerable research evidence suggests that overly positive selfevaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism are characteristic of normal human thought. Moreover, these illusions appear to promote other criteria of mental health, including the ability to care about others, the ability to be happy or contented, and the ability to engage in productive and creative work. These strategies may succeed, in large part, because both the social world and cognitive-processing mechanisms impose niters on incoming information that distort it in a positive direction; negative information may be isolated and represented in as unthreatening a manner as possible. These positive illusions may be especially useful when an individual receives negative feedback or is otherwise threatened and may be especially adaptive under these circumstances. Decades of psychological wisdom have established contact with reality as a hallmark of mental health. In this view, the well-adjusted person is thought to engage in accurate reality testing, whereas the individual whose vision is clouded by illusion is regarded as vulnerable to, if not already a victim of, mental illness. Despite its plausibility, this viewpoint is increasingly difficult to maintain (cf. Lazarus, 1983). A substantial amount of research testifies to the prevalence of illusion in normal human cognition (see Fiske& Taylor, 1984;Greenwald, 1980; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Sackeim, 1983; Taylor, 1983). Moreover, these illusions often involve central aspects of the self and the environment and, therefore, cannot be dismissed as inconsequential. In this article, we review research suggesting that certain illusions may be adaptive for mental health and well-being. In particular, we examine evidence that a set of interrelated positive illusions—namely, unrealistically positive self-evaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism—can serve a wide variety of cognitive, affective, and social functions.

Our algorithm is developed with the ultimate aim of automatically structuring sections of films that contain distinct shades of emotion related to horror themes for nonlinear media access and navigation. An average of 82% of the energy events, obtained from the analysis of the audio tracks of sections of four sample films corresponded correctly to the proposed affect.

One possibility is that the mechanisms are based on innate perceptual abilities (e.g., Helmholtz, 1885/1954). Another possibility is that the ability to associate various aspects of music with emotion is learned through exposure to one9s musical culture (e.g., Serafine, 1988). The current research examines the affective responses to major and minor ascending and descending melodies by 5-year-olds, 8-yearolds, and college students. Affective responses to modality did not appear until age eight and affective responses to contour appeared only in the college students. These results are consistent with previous developmental perception experiments on contour and modality (Imberty, 1969; Krumhansl & Keil, 1982; Morrongiello & Roes, 1990) and extend the understanding of the relation of perception, cognition, and culture in determining musical affect.",1995.0,24.0,148.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '279-290', 'name': 'Music Perception'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gerardi1995TheDO,\n author = {G.

651,36240b47b5da3b8d5cd09c8edb215a1e5b50d69e,A throughput maximization strategy for scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows on SwinDeW‐G,"With the rapid development of e‐business, workflow systems now have to deal with transaction‐intensive workflows whose main characteristic is the huge number of concurrent workflow instances. For such workflows, it is important to maximize the overall throughput to provide good quality of service. However, most of the existing scheduling algorithms are designed for scheduling of a single complex scientific workflow instance and are not efficient enough for scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows. To address this problem, we propose a throughput maximization strategy (TMS), which contains two specific algorithms for scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows at the instance and task levels, respectively. The first algorithm called Opposite Average Load tries to maximize the overall throughput by pursuing the overall load balance at the instance level, whereas the second algorithm called Extended Min–Min tries to further maximize the overall throughput at the task level by increasing the utilization rate of resources within each local autonomous group. The comparison and simulation performed on Swinburne Decentralized Workflow for Grid (SwinDeW‐G), a peer‐to‐peer‐based grid workflow environment, demonstrate that our strategy can improve the overall throughput significantly over existing scheduling algorithms when scheduling transaction‐intensive workflows.

652,3642b59776f0fa5d51a0cda428664108de88989b,First Person Experience of Body Transfer in Virtual Reality,"Background Altering the normal association between touch and its visual correlate can result in the illusory perception of a fake limb as part of our own body. Thus, when touch is seen to be applied to a rubber hand while felt synchronously on the corresponding hidden real hand, an illusion of ownership of the rubber hand usually occurs. The illusion has also been demonstrated using visuomotor correlation between the movements of the hidden real hand and the seen fake hand. This type of paradigm has been used with respect to the whole body generating out-of-the-body and body substitution illusions. However, such studies have only ever manipulated a single factor and although they used a form of virtual reality have not exploited the power of immersive virtual reality (IVR) to produce radical transformations in body ownership. Principal Findings Here we show that a first person perspective of a life-sized virtual human female body that appears to substitute the male subjects' own bodies was sufficient to generate a body transfer illusion. This was demonstrated subjectively by questionnaire and physiologically through heart-rate deceleration in response to a threat to the virtual body. This finding is in contrast to earlier experimental studies that assume visuotactile synchrony to be the critical contributory factor in ownership illusions. Our finding was possible because IVR allowed us to use a novel experimental design for this type of problem with three independent binary factors: (i) perspective position (first or third), (ii) synchronous or asynchronous mirror reflections and (iii) synchrony or asynchrony between felt and seen touch. Conclusions The results support the notion that bottom-up perceptual mechanisms can temporarily override top down knowledge resulting in a radical illusion of transfer of body ownership. The research also illustrates immersive virtual reality as a powerful tool in the study of body representation and experience, since it supports experimental manipulations that would otherwise be infeasible, with the technology being mature enough to represent human bodies and their motion.",2010.0,40.0,816.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2010FirstPE,\n author = {M.

This article addresses these questions by examining the interaction between representation and intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation covers at least three topics in this context: (1) how a computational system is represented in its user interface, (2) how the interface conveys its representations of information and the world to human users, and (3) how the system's internal representation affects the human user's interaction with the system. I argue that each of these kinds of representation (of the system, information and the world, the interaction) is key to how users make the kind of attributions of intelligence that facilitate their interactions with intelligent systems. In this vein, it makes sense to represent a systmem as a human in those cases where social collaborative behavior is key and for the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple ways on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by discussing issues of representation and intelligence in an embodied conversational agent -- an interface in which the system is represented as a person, information is conveyed to human users by multiple modalities such as voice and hand gestures, and the internal representation is modality independent and both propositional and nonpropositional.",2001.0,34.0,294.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '67-84', 'name': 'AI Mag.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cassell2001EmbodiedCA,\n author = {Justine Cassell},\n journal = {AI Mag.},\n pages = {67-84},\n title = {Embodied Conversational Agents: Representation and Intelligence in User Interfaces},\n volume = {22},\n year = {2001}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '145431806', 'name': 'Justine Cassell'}]"

We review the aspects of the response styles theory that have been well-supported, including evidence that rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of experimental studies show positive distractions relieve depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression, including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm. We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation strategies. Finally, we highlight recent research on the distinction between rumination and more adaptive forms of self-reflection, on basic cognitive deficits or biases in rumination, on its neural and genetic correlates, and on possible interventions to combat rumination.",2008.0,235.0,3388.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '400 - 424', 'name': 'Perspectives on Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nolen-Hoeksema2008RethinkingR,\n author = {S.

The concept itself requires a wider view of normativity than the narrow positivist one of law as command. It is certainly protean, ranging over many fundamental questions about the changing nature of the public sphere of politics and the state, and its interactions with the ‘private’ sphere of economic activity and social relations, as well as the mediation of these interactions, especially through law. This survey aims to outline and evaluate some of the main contours of the field as it has developed in this recent period, focusing on the regulation of economic activity. Regulation is seen as having emerged with the withdrawal by governments from direct provision of many economic and social services, to be replaced by corporatist bureaucracies and quasi-public agencies managing the complex public–private interactions of financialized capitalism. The arguments for ‘smart’ regulation have, in an era fixated on neo-liberalism, generally legitimized delegation of responsibility to big business. Its advocates, having been drawn into policy fields, have perhaps too often lost their critical edge, and allowed it to become instrumentalized, reflecting the technicist character of its practice.",2017.0,0.0,547.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '676 - 699', 'name': 'Social & Legal Studies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Picciotto2017Regulation,\n author = {S.

The work is motivated by the aim to provide technology with competences in perceiving and producing the emotional and nonverbal behaviors required to sustain a conversational dialogue. We present the Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) scenario as a setting which seems particularly suited for the study of emotional and nonverbal behavior since it requires only very limited verbal understanding on the part of the machine. This scenario allows us to concentrate on nonverbal capabilities without having to address at the same time the challenges of spoken language understanding, task modeling, etc. We first report on three prototype versions of the SAL scenario in which the behavior of the Sensitive Artificial Listener characters was determined by a human operator. These prototypes served the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of the SAL scenario and allowed us to collect data required for building system components for analyzing and synthesizing the respective behaviors. We then describe the fully autonomous integrated real-time system we created, which combines incremental analysis of user behavior, dialogue management, and synthesis of speaker and listener behavior of a SAL character displayed as a virtual agent. We discuss principles that should underlie the evaluation of SAL-type systems. Since the system is designed for modularity and reuse and since it is publicly available, the SAL system has potential as a joint research tool in the affective computing research community.",2012.0,143.0,203.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '165-183', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schröder2012BuildingAS,\n author = {M.

We used a daily diary methodology with multilevel modelling data analyses (n = 187) to examine the influence of three emotion regulation strategies (mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression) on the experience of daily negative and positive affect. Our results suggested that daily mindfulness was associated with lower negative and higher positive affect whereas the converse pattern was found for daily emotion suppression; cognitive reappraisal was related to daily positive, but not negative affect. When daily mindfulness, suppression and reappraisal were included in the same models, these strategies predicted unique variance in emotional well-being. Random slope analyses revealed substantial variability in the utility of these strategies. Indeed the presumably “adaptive” cognitive reappraisal strategy seemed to confer no benefit to the regulation of negative affect in approximately half the sample. Additional analyses revealed that age moderates the effect of cognitive reappraisal on daily negative affect: Higher use of reappraisal was associated with more negative affect for adolescents (aged 17 to 19) but became associated with less negative affect with increasing age. We interpret these results in line with a contextual view of emotion regulation where no strategy is inherently “good” or “bad”.",2017.0,41.0,230.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '113 - 91', 'name': 'Cognitive Behaviour Therapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brockman2017EmotionRS,\n author = {R.

Currently, most of the tools developed for EEG analysis focus mainly on offline processing. This study introduces and demonstrates the Real-time EEG Source-mapping Toolbox (REST), an extension to the widely distributed EEGLAB environment. REST allows blind source separation of EEG data in real-time using Online Recursive Independent Component Analysis (ORICA), plus near real-time localization of separated sources. Two source localization methods are available to fit equivalent current dipoles or estimate spatial source distributions of selected sources. Selected measures of raw EEG data or component activations (e.g. time series of the data, spectral changes over time, equivalent current dipoles, etc.) can be visualized in near real-time. Finally, this study demonstrates the accuracy and functionality of REST with data from two experiments and discusses some relevant applications.",2015.0,17.0,22.0,"{'pages': '4114-4117', 'name': '2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pion-Tonachini2015RealtimeES,\n author = {L.

However, it is difficult to conduct these types of studies. Therefore the literature is sparse on examples of the explicit effect of user experience on user satisfaction metrics in industry-standard survey instruments. During a development experience in 2009, we used a cross-sectional method to look at the effects of user profiles on ratings for commercial products that use one such instrument, the System Usability Scale or SUS. 
 
Recent research has reported finding that differences in user ratings could be based on the extent of a user's prior experience with the computer system, a Web site being visited or a desktop application like Microsoft's Office suite being used. Compared to off-the-shelf office products or personal Web applications, we were curious if we would find the same experience effect for domain specialists using geosciences products in the course of their daily professional job roles. In fact, from data collected with 262 end users across different geographic locations testing two related oilfield product releases, one Web-based and one desktop-based, we found results that were quite close to early assessment studies: Users having a more extensive experience with a product tended to provide higher, more favorable, SUS scores over users with either no or limited experience with a product---and by as much as 15-16%, regardless of the domain product type. This and other observations found during our product testing have led us to offer some practical how-to's to our internal product analysts responsible for managing product test cycles, administering instruments like the SUS to users, and reporting results to development teams.",2012.0,24.0,170.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '56-67', 'name': 'Journal of Usability Studies archive'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McLellan2012TheEO,\n author = {S.

Typically experienced in virtual worlds, mediated presence is generated by different technological, cognitive, and emotional factors. The aim of this study was to test how to optimise the virtual experience by manipulating some of these factors. Specifically, we tested if an immersive technology and/or a meaningful narrative context influence the users' sense of presence, providing a more compelling experience than a non-immersive and non-contextualized virtual space. Eighty-four students, randomly divided into four groups, were asked to find a blood container inside a virtual hospital in an immersive or non-immersive condition and with or without an emotionally related narrative. Two presence questionnaires and heart-rate variations were used to measure the effects of the four conditions on the users' sense of presence. Results showed a significant effect of narrative, F(8, 73) = 30.346, p < 0.001, and level of immersion, F (8, 73) = 10.913, p < 0.001, and a significant interaction between narrative and immersion, F(8, 73) = 2.062, p = 0.05, both on the presence questionnaires and on the heart-rate variations. Moreover, considering the factors immersion (I) and narrative (N) together, we found that the I-N condition generated the highest level of presence. We argue that both immersion and narrative are important in creating an effective virtual reality experience because they contribute differently to increasing the sense of presence. Immersion increases the place illusion, while the narrative contributes to generating an emotional response and strengthening the subjects' sense of inner presence.",2011.0,39.0,232.0,"{'volume': '14 3', 'pages': '\n          99-105\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gorini2011TheRO,\n author = {A.

Background: Research has revealed that the reliability of imperfect automation is frequently misperceived. We examined the manner in which the easiness and type of imperfect automation errors affect trust and dependence. Method: Participants performed a target detection task utilizing an automated aid. In Study 1, the aid missed targets either on easy trials (easy miss group) or on difficult trials (difficult miss group). In Study 2, we manipulated both easiness and type of error (miss vs. false alarm). The aid erred on either difficult trials alone (difficult errors group) or on difficult and easy trials (easy miss group; easy false alarm group). Results: In both experiments, easy errors led to participants mistrusting and disagreeing more with the aid on difficult trials, as compared with those using aids that generated only difficult errors. This resulted in a downward shift in decision criterion for the former, leading to poorer overall performance. Misses and false alarms led to similar effects.

The TTM is comprised of a number of core constructs that include the Stages of Change, Processes of Change, Decisional Balance, Self-Efficacy, and Temptation. The previously identified Stages of Change (or readiness to change) construct is an important dimension of the TTM, as it reflects the model’s critical assumption—behavior change occurs through a series of six stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination. The Processes of Change construct outlines the ten activities that individuals use to progress from stage to stage. Interventions that employ the TTM for behavior change should aim to accurately identify and match an individual’s specific processes of change to their stage of change to maximize efficacy. The Decisional Balance construct refers to an individual’s weighing of the pros and cons of their behavior change. Lastly, the Self-Efficacy construct outlines an individual’s confidence in their ability to not relapse when in high-risk situations that tempt them to engage in a specific behavior. Although the majority of the applications of TTM have focused on smoking cessation, the model has also been applied to other problem behaviors such as alcohol and substance abuse, eating disorders, and domestic violence. In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of the model, this article discusses the various applications of the TTM.

679,37dd3727cc356251569d89ccd881206bff88be56,Emotion regulation is motivated.,"Because emotion regulation is a motivated process, one must adopt a motivational perspective to understand it. We build on the distinction between goal setting (i.e., selecting end-states to achieve) and goal striving (i.e., engaging in behaviors to achieve desired end-states). First, we discuss how these concepts apply to regulation in the emotion domain. Second, we review existing research on setting emotion goals and striving for them. Third, we highlight how goal setting and goal striving can operate in tandem to shape emotion regulation. Finally, we highlight the importance of considering emotion regulation as a motivated process, and how doing so informs key topics explored in this special issue, including those pertaining to determinants (e.g., culture as setting emotion goals), consequences (e.g., monitoring emotion goal progress and mental health), and interventions (e.g., manipulating features of emotion goal setting and striving to promote adaptive emotion regulation).

The use of this model consists of two phases: In the preparation phase appraisal rules and personality profiles for characters must be specified with the help of AffectML - our XML based affect modeling language. In the runtime phase, the specified appraisal rules are used to compute real-time emotions and moods as results of a subjective appraisal of relevant input. The computed affective characteristics are represented in AffectML and can be processed by sub-sequent modules that control the cognitive processes and physical behavior of embodied conversational characters. ALMA is part of the VirtualHuman project which develops interactive virtual characters that serve as dialog partners with human-like conversational skills. ALMA provides our virtual humans with a personality profile and with real-time emotions and moods.

This paper serves as an introduction to a new approach which tries to warn alcoholics based on their psychophysiological responses, in order to prevent relapse. However, the first step is to determine the quality of the recorded data which is discussed in the present paper regarding the amount of data which is artifact-free and can be used for further analysis. An experiment was conducted with eight participants with a heavy drinking behavior over the period of one week. They wore the E4 wristband from Empatica which is capable of measuring EDA, HR, inter-beat interval (IBI) and blood volume pulse (BVP) among others. Several analyses were applied including standard analyses via Matlab, as well as self-programmed analysis-programs. The results state a high quality of the EDA data, with around 90% of the data detected as clean signal and is thus suitable for a further analysis including drawing reliable conclusions from it. Regarding the HR, only 2% of the data was determined as possible artifacts, in contrast to the IBI data where only 15% of the possible maximum values could be measured. This great difference can be explained by the BVP measurements which are used to compute the HR and the IBI, whereby the HR is always computed or estimated and the IBI only on the basis of sufficient measurements. However, it is still possible to use the HR data, but it is important only to use fractions of the data and never base a decision solely on the HR or IBI data.",2016.0,19.0,11.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Enewoldsen2016AnalysisOT,\n author = {N.

The current study investigated the effects of emotional content on working memory capacity (WMC), which involves both short term storage and executive attention control. We tested competing hypotheses in a preregistered experiment (N = 297). The emotional enhancement hypothesis predicts that emotional stimuli attract attention and additional processing resources relative to neutral stimuli, thereby making it easier to encode and store emotional information in WMC. The emotional impairment hypothesis, by contrast, predicts that emotional stimuli interfere with attention control and the active maintenance of information in working memory. Participants completed a common measure of WMC (the operation span task; Turner, M. L., & Engle, R. W. [1989]. Is working memory capacity task dependent?

In the recent years there are strong movement for shifting from ability and aptitude testing to competence testing. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to process emotion-laden information competently, and to use it to guide cognitive activities like problem solving and to focus energy on required behaviors. According to Mayer and Salovey model EI involves four main abilities: a) to perceive accurately, appraise, and express emotion, b) to access and/or generate feelings when they facilitate thought, and c) to understand emotions and emotional knowledge ; and d) the ability to regulate emotions to promote emotional and intellectual growth (Mayer & Salovey, 1997, p. 5). Using that model of emotional intelligence self-reported instrument ESCQ (Taksic, 2001) consists of three subscales with appropriate psychometric properties was constructed. The subscales are measure of co-called trait emotional intelligence and are labeled ability to: a) perceived and understands emotions (PU), b) express and label emotions (EL), and c) manage and regulate emotions (MR). The results of series of studies demonstrated that ESCQ could be mentioned as an indicator of emotional competence in various situations: a) the highest correlation was obtained between trait emotional intelligence of supervisors and followers rating of their quality of supervising (leadership ; r=0.61), b) correlation between ESCQ and self perceived (un)competence was r=-0.33, and the highest was with MR subscale (r=-0.41), c) significant correlation was between the ESCQ and a school achievement.

Meeting the complex needs of patients with chronic common mental health disorders (CMHDs) may be the greatest challenge facing organized medical practice. On the basis of a well-established and proven theoretical foundation for controlled respiration as a behavioral intervention for CMHDs, as well as preliminary evidence that gamification can improve health outcomes through increasing patient engagement, this randomized controlled pilot study evaluated the feasibility and clinical efficacy of a mobile health game called ""Flowy"" ( www.flowygame.com ) that digitally delivered breathing retraining exercises for anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptom management.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We designed an unblinded, Web-based, parallel-group randomized controlled trial focusing on feasibility, clinical efficacy, and design proof of concept. In the intervention condition (n = 31), participants received free access to ""Flowy"" for 4 weeks. In the control condition (n = 32), participants were placed on a waitlist for 4 weeks before being offered free access to ""Flowy."" Online measurements using psychological self-report questionnaires were made at 2 and 4 weeks post-baseline.


RESULTS
At trial conclusion, participants found ""Flowy"" acceptable as an anxiety management intervention. ""Flowy"" engaged participants sufficiently to endorse proactive gameplay. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed a reduction in anxiety, panic, and self-report hyperventilation scores in both trial arms, with the intervention arm experiencing greater quality of life. Participants perceived ""Flowy"" as a fun and useful intervention, proactively used ""Flowy"" as part of their care, and would recommend ""Flowy"" to family and friends.

Our results suggest that a digital delivery of breathing retraining exercises through a mobile health game can manage anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptoms associated with CMHDs.",2016.0,0.0,47.0,"{'volume': '5 1', 'pages': '\n          50-67\n        ', 'name': 'Games for health journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pham2016FeasibilityAE,\n author = {Quynh Pham and Y.

In light of these interesting but mixed findings, our research applies the motivation theory to investigate the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators on system-use behavior in utilitarian, hedonic, and dual-purposed contexts. We then construct associated hypotheses and empirically test them by analyzing data collected from the literature. The results generally confirm our prediction that, in the context of utilitarian systems, extrinsic motivators are more important than intrinsic motivators, whereas, in the context of hedonic systems, intrinsic motivators play a more critical role than extrinsic motivators. The results thus substantiate our contention that, when information systems vary from utilitarian to hedonic, the most important determinants shift from extrinsic to intrinsic motivators. This paper contributes not only to a new application of the motivation theory to IT adoption, but also to an integrated and in-depth analysis of motivators, which may reorient IS scholars toward potentially more fruitful avenues for studying user behavior.",2013.0,59.0,252.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '1', 'name': 'J.

Although scholars assume an inherent understanding of social media based on extant technology, there is no commonly accepted definition of what social media are, both functionally and theoretically, within communication studies. Given this lack of understanding, cogent theorizing regarding the uses and effects of social media has been limited. This work first draws on extant definitions of social media and subcategories (e.g., social network sites) from public relations, information technology, and management scholarship, as well as the popular press, to develop a definition of social media precise enough to embody these technologies yet robust enough to remain applicable in 2035. It then broadly explores emerging developments in the features, uses, and users of social media for which future theories will need to account. Finally, it divines and prioritizes challenges that may not yet be apparent to theorizing communication processes with and in mercurial social media. We address how social media may uniquely isolate and test communicative principles to advance our understanding of human–human and human–computer interaction.

These faces can be used as well-controlled, realistic and dynamic stimuli in emotion research. However, the validity of virtual facial expressions in comparison to natural emotion displays still needs to be shown for the different emotions and different age groups. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty-two healthy volunteers between the age of 20 and 60 rated pictures of natural human faces and faces of virtual characters (avatars) with respect to the expressed emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and neutral. Results indicate that virtual emotions were recognized comparable to natural ones. Recognition differences in virtual and natural faces depended on specific emotions: whereas disgust was difficult to convey with the current avatar technology, virtual sadness and fear achieved better recognition results than natural faces. Furthermore, emotion recognition rates decreased for virtual but not natural faces in participants over the age of 40. This specific age effect suggests that media exposure has an influence on emotion recognition. Conclusions/Significance Virtual and natural facial displays of emotion may be equally effective. Improved technology (e.g. better modelling of the naso-labial area) may lead to even better results as compared to trained actors. Due to the ease with which virtual human faces can be animated and manipulated, validated artificial emotional expressions will be of major relevance in future research and therapeutic applications.",2008.0,46.0,106.0,"{'volume': '3', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dyck2008RecognitionPO,\n author = {M.

We show how the organised forms of attachment (secure, avoidant and ambivalent) might arise in (Bayesian) infants. Specifically, we show that these distinct forms of attachment emerge from a minimisation of free energy—over interoceptive states relating to internal stress levels—when seeking proximity to caregivers who have a varying impact on these interoceptive states. In line with empirical findings in disrupted patterns of affective communication, we then demonstrate how exteroceptive cues (in the form of caregiver-mediated AMBIANCE affective communication errors, ACE) can result in disorganised forms of attachment in infants of caregivers who consistently increase stress when the infant seeks proximity, but can have an organising (towards ambivalence) effect in infants of inconsistent caregivers. In particular, we differentiate disorganised attachment from avoidance in terms of the high epistemic value of proximity seeking behaviours (resulting from the caregiver’s misleading exteroceptive cues) that preclude the emergence of coherent and organised behavioural policies. Our work, the first to formulate infant attachment in terms of active inference, makes a new testable prediction with regards to the types of affective communication errors that engender ambivalent attachment.",2018.0,124.0,10.0,"{'volume': '13', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cittern2018IntrinsicAE,\n author = {David Cittern and T.

We argue that the dual-processing distinction is supported by much recent evidence in cognitive science.

721,3aeabb11b1da51a1b269ce9dda2fe17b7d37d18f,Ethnic density of neighborhoods and incidence of psychotic disorders among immigrants.,"OBJECTIVE
A high incidence of psychotic disorders has been reported in immigrant ethnic groups in Western Europe. Some studies suggest that ethnic density may influence the incidence of schizophrenia. The authors investigated whether this increased incidence among immigrants depends on the ethnic density of the neighborhoods in which they live.


METHOD
This was a prospective first-contact incidence study of psychotic disorders in The Hague, by ethnicity and neighborhood of residence. Over a 7-year period, individuals who made contact with a physician for a suspected psychotic disorder underwent diagnostic interviews and received DSM-IV diagnoses. A comprehensive municipal registration system provided the denominator for incidence rates. Data were sufficient to examine incidence rates in native Dutch and in first- and second-generation immigrants from Morocco, Suriname, and Turkey. The ethnic density of a neighborhood was computed for each immigrant group as the proportion of residents belonging to that group. Multilevel regression analyses predicted the incidence of psychotic disorders as a function of individual ethnicity and neighborhood ethnic density. Models were fitted for all immigrants together and for each immigrant group separately.


RESULTS
A total of 226 native Dutch and 240 immigrants were diagnosed as having a psychotic disorder. Compared with native Dutch, the adjusted incidence rate ratio for immigrants was significantly increased in low-ethnic-density neighborhoods (2.36) but not in high-ethnic-density neighborhoods (1.25). There was a strong interaction between individual ethnicity and neighborhood ethnic density as predictors of incidence of illness. These findings were consistent across all immigrant groups.


CONCLUSIONS
The incidence of psychotic disorders was elevated most significantly among immigrants living in neighborhoods where their own ethnic group comprised a small proportion of the population.",2008.0,31.0,332.0,"{'volume': '165 1', 'pages': '\n          66-73\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Veling2008EthnicDO,\n author = {W.

The existing therapeutic interventions (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT; attention bias modification, ABM) have proven to have clinically measurable benefits in reducing anxiety, but their efficacy is often compromised by social and practical barriers. The growing discrepancy between demand for, and access to, clinical interventions for anxiety has led to the development of a range of eHealth (health care practice supported by electronic processes and communication) and mHealth (versions of eHealth using mobile devices) interventions. One such protocol is therapeutic games, which aim to provide clinical frameworks in dynamic, adaptable, and personalized virtual environments. Although some evidence exists to suggest therapeutic games are associated with reductions in subjective anxiety and observed stress reactivity, there is currently, to our knowledge, no systematic review of the adherence to, and effectiveness of, therapeutic games for adolescent anxiety. Objective The aim of this review was to establish the effectiveness of therapeutic games in making clinically measurable reductions in anxiety symptoms in adolescent samples. Methods A systematic search of the existing academic literature published between 1990 and July 2017 was conducted using the databases Journal of Medical Internet Research, Journal Storage, Psychology Articles, Psychology Info, ScienceDIRECT, and Scopus. Records linked to empirical papers on therapeutic games for anxiety using adolescent samples were evaluated. Results A total of 5 studies (N=410 participants) met the inclusion criteria, and 3 gamified anxiety interventions for adolescents were identified. The papers included a mixture of randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and usability studies comprising quantitative and qualitative measures, with varying degrees of mixed methods. Extant evidence shows potential for therapeutic games to create clinically measurable reductions in symptoms of anxiety in adolescent samples, though findings are complicated in some cases by a low sample size, and in other cases by research design and methodological complications, including anxiety reductions in control groups caused by a control-game selection. Conclusions Although research in this field appears to be extremely limited, as demonstrated by the small number of papers meeting the inclusion criteria for this review, early findings suggest that therapeutic games have potential in helping to engage adolescents with anxiety and lead to clinically measurable reductions in symptoms.",2018.0,62.0,42.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'JMIR Serious Games'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Barnes2018EmpiricalEF,\n author = {Steven Barnes and J.

We first define game-based learning and gamification, and then discuss theoretical models that describe learning with games, arguing that playfulness is orthogonal to learning theory. We then review design elements of games that facilitate learning by fostering learners' cognitive, behavioral, affective, and sociocultural engagement with the subject matter. Finally, we discuss the basis of these design elements in cognitive, motivational, affective, and sociocultural foundations by reviewing key theories from education and psychology that are the most pertinent to game-based learning and by describing empirical research on learning with games that has been or should be conducted. We conclude that a combination of cognitive, motivational, affective, and sociocultural perspectives is necessary for both game design and game research to fully capture what games have to offer for learning.",2015.0,215.0,653.0,"{'volume': '50', 'pages': '258 - 283', 'name': 'Educational Psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Plass2015FoundationsOG,\n author = {J.

726,3b3a2281d097cc0c60e93d42d570bd2dfadb6492,Evaluating non-randomised intervention studies.,"OBJECTIVES
To consider methods and related evidence for evaluating bias in non-randomised intervention studies.


DATA SOURCES
Systematic reviews and methodological papers were identified from a search of electronic databases; handsearches of key medical journals and contact with experts working in the field. New empirical studies were conducted using data from two large randomised clinical trials.


METHODS
Three systematic reviews and new empirical investigations were conducted. The reviews considered, in regard to non-randomised studies, (1) the existing evidence of bias, (2) the content of quality assessment tools, (3) the ways that study quality has been assessed and addressed. (4) The empirical investigations were conducted generating non-randomised studies from two large, multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and selectively resampling trial participants according to allocated treatment, centre and period.


RESULTS
In the systematic reviews, eight studies compared results of randomised and non-randomised studies across multiple interventions using meta-epidemiological techniques. A total of 194 tools were identified that could be or had been used to assess non-randomised studies. Sixty tools covered at least five of six pre-specified internal validity domains. Fourteen tools covered three of four core items of particular importance for non-randomised studies. Six tools were thought suitable for use in systematic reviews. Of 511 systematic reviews that included non-randomised studies, only 169 (33%) assessed study quality. Sixty-nine reviews investigated the impact of quality on study results in a quantitative manner. The new empirical studies estimated the bias associated with non-random allocation and found that the bias could lead to consistent over- or underestimations of treatment effects, also the bias increased variation in results for both historical and concurrent controls, owing to haphazard differences in case-mix between groups. The biases were large enough to lead studies falsely to conclude significant findings of benefit or harm. Four strategies for case-mix adjustment were evaluated: none adequately adjusted for bias in historically and concurrently controlled studies. Logistic regression on average increased bias. Propensity score methods performed better, but were not satisfactory in most situations. Detailed investigation revealed that adequate adjustment can only be achieved in the unrealistic situation when selection depends on a single factor.


CONCLUSIONS
Results of non-randomised studies sometimes, but not always, differ from results of randomised studies of the same intervention. Non-randomised studies may still give seriously misleading results when treated and control groups appear similar in key prognostic factors. Standard methods of case-mix adjustment do not guarantee removal of bias. Residual confounding may be high even when good prognostic data are available, and in some situations adjusted results may appear more biased than unadjusted results. Although many quality assessment tools exist and have been used for appraising non-randomised studies, most omit key quality domains. Healthcare policies based upon non-randomised studies or systematic reviews of non-randomised studies may need re-evaluation if the uncertainty in the true evidence base was not fully appreciated when policies were made. The inability of case-mix adjustment methods to compensate for selection bias and our inability to identify non-randomised studies that are free of selection bias indicate that non-randomised studies should only be undertaken when RCTs are infeasible or unethical. Recommendations for further research include: applying the resampling methodology in other clinical areas to ascertain whether the biases described are typical; developing or refining existing quality assessment tools for non-randomised studies; investigating how quality assessments of non-randomised studies can be incorporated into reviews and the implications of individual quality features for interpretation of a review's results; examination of the reasons for the apparent failure of case-mix adjustment methods; and further evaluation of the role of the propensity score.",2003.0,330.0,2610.0,"{'volume': '7 27', 'pages': '\n          iii-x, 1-173\n        ', 'name': 'Health technology assessment'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Deeks2003EvaluatingNI,\n author = {J.

There is a growing consensus that leadership development training and assessment methods should adopt more holistic methodologies, including those associated with the emotional and neuroendocrine aspects of learning. Recent research into the assessment of leadership competencies has proposed the use of objective methods and measurements based on neuroscience. One of the challenges to be faced in the development of a performance-based methodology to measure leadership skills is how to generate real-life situations with triggers that allow us to study management competencies under controlled laboratory conditions. A way to address this question is to take advantage of virtual environments to recreate real-life situations that might arise in performance-based assessments. We propose virtual reality (VR) as a very promising tool to observe various leadership related behavioral patterns during dynamic, complex and realistic situations. By seamlessly embedding assessment methods into virtual learning environments, VR can provide objective assessment methods with high ecological validity. VR also holds unlimited opportunities for leadership training providing subjects with intelligent tutoring systems that adapts situations in real time according to the observed behaviors.",2018.0,73.0,31.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Alcañiz2018VirtualRA,\n author = {M.

Among the factors that could be weakened by academic stress, attention has been paid to expectations of self-efficacy, which are considered one of the most important determinants for student engagement, persistence, and academic success. From a proactive perspective, research on academic stress has emphasized the importance of coping strategies in preventing harmful consequences. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in discovering the extent to which individuals are able to combine different coping strategies and the adaptive consequences this flexibility entails. However, studies using this person-centered approach are still scarce in the academic context. On that basis, this current study had two objectives: (a) to examine the existence of different profiles of university students based on how they combined different approach coping strategies (positive reappraisal, support seeking, and planning) and (b) to determine the existence of differences in general expectations of self-efficacy between those coping profiles. A total of 1,072 university students participated in the study. The coping profiles were determined by latent profile analysis (LPA). The differences in the self-efficacy variable were determined using ANCOVA, with gender, university year, and degree type as covariates. Four approach coping profiles were identified: (a) low generalized use of approach coping strategies; (b) predominance of social approach coping approaches; (c) predominance of cognitive approach coping approaches; and (d) high generalized use of approach coping strategies. The profile showed that a greater combination of the three strategies was related to higher general self-efficacy expectations and vice versa. These results suggest that encouraging flexibility in coping strategies would help to improve university students’ self-efficacy.",2020.0,100.0,82.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Freire2020CopingSA,\n author = {Carlos Freire and María-del-Mar Ferradás and Bibiana Regueiro and Susana Rodríguez and A.

Alienating for some, yet most intimate and real for others, emerging communications technologies are creating a varied array of cyberspace experiences. Nowhere are the new and old more intertwined, as familiar narratives of the past and radical visions of the future inform our attempts to assess the impact of cyberspace on self and society. Amid the dizzying pace of technological innovation, Annette N. Markham embarks on a unique, ethnographic approach to understanding Internet users by immersing herself in online reality. The result is an engrossing narrative as well as a theoretically engaging journey. A cast of characters, the self-reflexive author among them, emerge from Markham's interviews and research to depict the complexity and diversity of Internet realities. 
While cyberspace is hyped as a disembodied cultural arena where physical reality can be transcended, Markham finds that to understand how people experience the Internet, she must learn how to be embodied there--a process of acculturation and immersion which is not so different from other anthropological projects of cross-cultural understanding. Both new and not-so-new, cyberspace provides a context in which we can ask new sorts of questions about all cultural experience.",1998.0,0.0,515.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Markham1998LifeOR,\n author = {Annette N.

It is proposed that strong attractors can be used to model attachment types in developmental psychology as well as behavioural patterns in psychology and psychotherapy. We study the stability and basins of attraction of strong attractors in the presence of other simple attractors and show that they are indeed more stable with a larger basin of attraction compared with simple attractors. We also show that the perturbation of a strong attractor by random noise results in a cluster of attractors near the original strong attractor measured by the Hamming distance. We investigate the stability and basins of attraction of such clusters as the noise increases and establish that the unfolding of the strong attractor, leading to its breakup, goes through three different stages. Finally the relation between strong attractors of different multiplicity and their influence on each other are studied and we show how the impact of a strong attractor can be replaced with that of a new strong attractor.

Recent years have witnessed growing attention towards the concept and measurement of well-being, both within academic disciplines, intergovernmental organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as in many governments across Europe, including the Nordic countries. Economic indicators have commonly been regarded as proxies of societal progress of nations, but indicators of well-being have increasingly been applied in order to complement or replace these measures. Methods: Well-being indicators of the WHO “Health 2020” framework are critically examined with particular attention given to the subjective aspects of well-being. Literature discussing the rationale for subjective indicators is reviewed. As a background, central theoretical and measurement perspectives on well-being are outlined, including hedonic, eudaimonic and objective list approaches. Results: The WHO refers to well-being in definitions of health and mental health, but has primarily reported on disease. The “Health 2020” framework marked a shift in this concern. One of the main targets of “Health 2020” concerns well-being, involving six core indicators. Only one indicator refers to well-being as subjective experience. Literature supports more extensive use of subjective indicators in combination with objective measures. Conclusions: Although consensus on definitions and instruments is lacking, subjective and objective measures of national well-being may jointly contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of societal progress, as well as a broader conception of health. Further research is required, particularly with regard to eudaimonic indicators.",2018.0,66.0,24.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '279 - 286', 'name': 'Scandinavian Journal of Public Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vik2018MeasuringSW,\n author = {Mari Hagtvedt Vik and E.

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is an instrument that factors a number of aspects of real-life decision-making. Although most SDIs are impaired on the IGT, there is a subgroup of them who perform normally on this task. One possible explanation for this differential performance is that impairment in decision-making is largely detected on the IGT when the use of drugs escalates in the face of rising adverse consequences. The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis, by examining if several real-life indices associated with escalation of addiction severity (as measured by the Addiction Severity Index -ASI-) are predictive of risky decisions, as revealed by impaired performance on different versions of the IGT. We administered the ASI and different versions of the IGT (the main IGT version, a variant IGT version, and two parallel versions of each) to a large sample of SDI. We used regression models to examine the predictive effects of the seven real-life domains assessed by the ASI on decision-making performance as measured by the IGT. We included in regression models both ASI-derived objective and subjective measures of each problem domain. Results showed (i) that several aspects of real-life functioning associated with addiction severity were moderate predictors of IGT decision-making performance; (ii) that the combined assessment of decision-making using different versions of the IGT yielded better predictive measures than assessment using isolated versions of the IGT; and (iii) that objective measures of real-life functioning were better predictors of decision-making performance on the IGT than subjective measures based on SDI's insight about their problems. These results support the notion that decision-making deficits as measured by the IGT are associated with a rise in real-life adverse consequences of addiction.",2006.0,39.0,53.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '55-78', 'name': 'Psychologica Belgica'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Verdéjo-Garcia2006DecisionMakingAT,\n author = {A.

We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE. The paper considers single and multiparticipant shared environments, and draws on the experience of ComputerSupported Cooperative Working (CSCW) research as a guide to understanding presence in shared environments.

Although evidence-based interventions are readily available, their outcomes are often disappointing and variable. In particular, existing interventions are not effective long-term nor tailored to differences in individual responsiveness. We therefore need a new approach to the prevention and treatment of anxiety in children and a commensurate scientific methodology to uncover individual profiles of change. We argue that applied games have a great deal of potential for both. The current paper presents results from a recent pilot study using a biofeedback virtual reality game (DEEP).

744,3ca90ef040253c2c04240e4ed1f19dd42d6ba2bc,Reply: On assessing neurofeedback effects: should double-blind replace neurophysiological mechanisms?,"Sir, We highly appreciate an open discussion regarding the effects of neurofeedback training (NFT), wherefore we are happy to respond to the letter by Fovet and colleagues, 2017. We agree that, strictly speaking, the results of our study (Schabus et al., 2017) do not allow generalizing the negative findings reported in primary insomnia to other NFT applications. Yet, what is disturbing is the fact that even misperception insomniacs (i.e. participants without any objectively quantifiable sleep problems) show unaltered EEG activity [in the same 12–15 Hz range; sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)] minutes after NFT sessions ended. At least we would have expected a sustained effect in this subgroup because they should not suffer from severe learning impairments. Surprisingly, these findings contradicted earlier reports from our own laboratory (Hoedlmoser et al., 2008; Schabus et al., 2014), where we added a healthy and younger control group and verified that participants achieved similar SMR enhancements during NFT training blocks (14–28%) as found earlier (15–25%; Schabus et al., 2014). Fovet and colleagues question how exactly these discrepancies between earlier (positive) results of our group in healthy participants (Hoedlmoser et al., 2008) and insomniacs (Schabus et al., 2017) are explained. First of all, it is important to note that in all three studies, we used exactly the same NFT methodology. The only exception was that we extended the NFT from 8 3 min to 8 5 min blocks (including two ‘transfer blocks’ with no immediate feedback) in the last double-blind study (Schabus et al., 2017). This was specifically done because we expected participants to have shallower learning curves due to the higher age [mean = 38.59, standard deviation (SD) = 11.18 in Schabus et al. (2017); mean = 34.83, SD = 10.60 in Schabus et al. (2014); mean = 23.63, SD = 2.69 in Hoedlmoser et al. (2008)] and the higher severity of insomnia [e.g. polysomnography (PSG)-derived wake after sleep onset 64.56 min in Schabus et al. (2017) versus 37.01 min in Schabus et al. (2014)]. So first of all, the slightly higher age may have rendered the observed effects in the latest study smaller than in the earlier two NFT studies. Second, we clearly highlight the non-optimal study design in our first insomnia study (2014), which was intended to serve as a comprehensive pilot test for the present and much more controlled double-blind study. Not only was that earlier study only single-blind but it also compared 10 blocks of NFT to five blocks of placebo-feedback (i.e. likewise randomized-frequency feedback). In an earlier study (cf. Fig. 6; Schabus et al., 2014), we reported a placebo effect on subjective quality of life across the sessions, i.e. an effect that was independent of whether participants received placebo or real neurofeedback; reanalysing the subjective data, we indeed found evidence that patients may have felt more social support in that earlier single-blind study in the NFT condition. This should be alarming for any neurofeedback study not adopting a double-blind design (cf. Fig. 1) as this effect is unlikely limited to our NFT study. Also, note that in this earlier study, we were unable to find an increase in sleep spindles or memory performance following NFT, contrary to what we had found in healthy doi:10.1093/brain/awx212 BRAIN 2017: 140; 1–5 | e64",2017.0,22.0,20.0,"{'volume': '140', 'pages': 'e64 - e64', 'name': 'Brain'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schabus2017ReplyOA,\n author = {Manuel Schabus},\n journal = {Brain},\n pages = {e64 - e64},\n title = {Reply: On assessing neurofeedback effects: should double-blind replace neurophysiological mechanisms?},\n volume = {140},\n year = {2017}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2726954', 'name': 'Manuel Schabus'}]"

We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine 3 potential moderators: age, measure quality, and single versus multiple informants. Finally, we separately consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology.

Influence of verbal and textual presentation on adherence,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With the rise of autonomous e-mental health applications, virtual agents can play a major role in improving trustworthiness, therapy outcome and adherence. In these applications, it is important that patients adhere in the sense that they perform the tasks, but also that they adhere to the specific recommendations on how to do them well. One important construct in improving adherence is psychoeducation, information on the why and how of therapeutic interventions. In an e-mental health context, this can be delivered in two different ways: verbally by a (virtual) embodied conversational agent or just via text on the screen. The aim of this research is to study which presentation mode is preferable for improving adherence. METHODS : This study takes the approach of evaluating a specific part of a therapy, namely psychoeducation. This was done in a non-clinical sample, to first test the general constructs of the human-computer interaction. We performed an experimental study on the effect of presentation mode of psychoeducation on adherence. In this study, we took into account the moderating effects of attitude towards the virtual agent and recollection of the information. Within the paradigm of expressive writing, we asked participants (n= 46) to pick one of their worst memories to describe in a digital diary after receiving verbal or textual psychoeducation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that both the attitude towards the virtual agent and how well the psychoeducation was recollected were positively related to adherence in the form of task execution. Moreover, after controlling for the attitude to the agent and recollection, presentation of psychoeducation via text resulted in higher adherence than verbal presentation by the virtual agent did.",2017.0,84.0,38.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '1081 - 1096', 'name': 'Technology and Health Care'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tielman2017HowSA,\n author = {M.

While pharmacologic interventions have shown promise for enhancing empathic accuracy, little is known about the effects of behavioral interventions on empathic accuracy and related brain activity. This study employed a randomized, controlled and longitudinal design to investigate the effect of a secularized analytical compassion meditation program, cognitive-based compassion training (CBCT), on empathic accuracy. Twenty-one healthy participants received functional MRI scans while completing an empathic accuracy task, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), both prior to and after completion of either CBCT or a health discussion control group. Upon completion of the study interventions, participants randomized to CBCT and were significantly more likely than control subjects to have increased scores on the RMET and increased neural activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Moreover, changes in dmPFC and IFG activity from baseline to the post-intervention assessment were associated with changes in empathic accuracy. These findings suggest that CBCT may hold promise as a behavioral intervention for enhancing empathic accuracy and the neurobiology supporting it.",2013.0,59.0,206.0,"{'volume': '8 1', 'pages': '\n          48-55\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mascaro2013CompassionME,\n author = {Jennifer S.

Life Tree is a virtual reality (VR) game in which a player controls the growth of a tree by practicing pursed-lip breathing. We selected VR head-mounted display technology because it allows players to focus and limit external distractions, which is beneficial for breathing exercises. 32 participants played Life Tree and analysis of the collected data identified four key themes: 1) Designing Breathing Feedback; 2) Increasing Self-Awareness of Breathing and Body; 3) Facilitating Focused Immersion; and, 4) Engagement with Breathing Hardware.

Affective control refers to the application of cognitive control to affective contexts, that is, the capacity to attend and respond to goal-relevant affective information, while inhibiting attention and responses toward distracting affective information. The evidence suggests that affective control develops throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, the developmental trajectory appears not to be uniform across different facets of affective control. In particular, the capacity to inhibit attention and responses to distracting affective information may be reduced during adolescence relative to childhood and adulthood. Focusing on the association between affective control and emotion regulation development in adolescence, the research reviewed supports the notion of affective control as a cognitive building block of successful emotion regulation. Good affective control appears related to fewer ruminative tendencies in adolescence as well as more frequent and successful reappraisal in older adolescents. Lower use of habitual suppression, itself a type of affective inhibition, shows an association with updating capacity. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for mental health and the potential mental health benefits associated with improving affective control.",2019.0,48.0,74.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '80 - 86', 'name': 'Emotion (Washington, D.C.)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schweizer2019TheRO,\n author = {S.

However, there is mixed evidence on the implementation of emotion regulation strategies across the life span. To clarify the discrepancies in the literature, we examined the modulating influence of contextual factors in understanding emotion regulation strategy use in older and young adults. Forty-eight older adults and forty-nine young adults completed a retrospective survey inquiring about the use of emotion regulation strategies in emotion-eliciting situations experienced over the preceding 2 weeks. We used factor analysis to establish clusters of emotion regulation strategies, resulting in cognitive strategies, acceptance, and maladaptive strategies. Overall, we found context-dependent age-related differences in emotion regulation strategy use. Specifically, older adults reported greater use of acceptance than young adults in situations of moderate intensity and in situations that evoke anxiety and sadness. In addition, older adults reported using maladaptive strategies to a lesser extent in high- and moderate-intensity situations and in situations that elicit anxiety and sadness when compared with young adults. There were no age-related differences in the use of cognitive strategies across contexts. Older adults, compared to young adults, reported less use of maladaptive strategies and greater use of acceptance than young adults, which suggests that the enhanced emotional functioning observed later in life may be due to a shift in strategy implementation.

It was premised on the basis of proxemics theory that the closer the approach of the virtual characters to the participant, the greater the level of physiological arousal. Physiological arousal was measured by the number of skin conductance responses within a short time period after the approach, and the maximum change in skin conductance level 5 s after the approach. The virtual characters were each either female or a cylinder of human size, and one or four characters approached each subject a total of 12 times. Twelve male subjects were recruited for the experiment. The results suggest that the number of skin conductance responses after the approach and the change in skin conductance level increased the closer the virtual characters approached toward the participants. Moreover, these response variables were inversely correlated with the number of visits, showing a typical adaptation effect. There was some evidence to suggest that the number of characters who simultaneously approached (one or four) was positively associated with the responses. Surprisingly there was no evidence of a difference in response between the humanoid characters and cylinders on the basis of this physiological data. It is suggested that the similarity in this quantitative arousal response to virtual characters and virtual objects might mask a profound difference in qualitative response, an interpretation supported by questionnaire and interview results. Overall the experiment supported the premise that people exhibit heightened physiological arousal the closer they are approached by virtual characters.",2010.0,32.0,127.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '3:1-3:12', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

773,3f35fea5a7bdeb427a83e392181b5e11df78ddc3,Featured Article: Adolescent Condom Use and Connectivity in the Social–Planful Brain,"Objective
To reduce rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancy among adolescents, it is critical to investigate brain connectivity that may underlie adolescents' sexual health decision-making in the context of intercourse. This study explored relationships between adolescent condom use frequency and the brain's resting-state functional connectivity, to identify differential patterns of social-affective processing among sexually active youth.


Methods
In this study, N = 143 sexually active adolescents (68.5% male, Mage = 16.2 years, SD = 1.06) completed magnetic resonance imaging and reported past 3-month frequency of condom use. Resting-state connectivity, seeded on a social region of the brain, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), was assessed to determine its correspondence with protected sex (condom use).


Results
Condom use was associated with positive connectivity between the left TPJ and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This relationship was observed in adolescent males only; no connectivity differences were observed with adolescent females.


Conclusions
This study reflects functional synchrony between nodes of the ""social brain,"" including the TPJ, and a region of planfulness and control, the IFG. The relationship between these regions suggests that adolescents who have more coordinated systems of communication between these critical components of the brain are more likely to be successful in planning and engaging in safer sexual decision-making; for young males, this differentiated more frequent from less frequent condom use. In turn, interventions designed to reduce STIs/human immunodeficiency virus may benefit from targeting social-planfulness dimensions to help youth implement safer sex behaviors.",2018.0,41.0,9.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '821–830', 'name': 'Journal of Pediatric Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Caouette2018FeaturedAA,\n author = {Justin D.

In the golden years of cognitivism, during the 1960s and '70s, emotion theory focused on the cognitive antecedents of emotion, the so-called "" appraisal processes. "" Some saw bodily events largely as by-products of cognition, and as too unspeci c to contribute to the variety of emotion experience. Cognition was conceptualized as an abstract, intellectual, "" heady "" process separate from bodily events. Although current emotion theory has moved beyond this disembodied stance by conceiving of emotions as involving both cognitive processes (e.g., perception, attention, and evaluation) and bodily events (e.g., arousal, behavior, and facial expressions), the legacy of cognitivism persists in the tendency to treat cognitive and bodily events as separate constituents of emotion. us, the cognitive aspects of emotion are supposedly distinct and separate from the bodily ones. is separation indicates that cognitivism's disembodied conception of",2007.0,68.0,125.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '61-84', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Colombetti2007TheFB,\n author = {G.

ER repertoire has been operationalized by a quantitative index (sum of ER strategies across situations) or by applying a person-centered approach to global self-reports of dispositional ER. We aimed to assess ER repertoire in daily life by using an experience sampling methodology (ESM) and a person-centered approach that could account for nested data. We used multilevel latent profile analyses of ESM data (N = 179, 9-10 prompts per day over 21 days) to (a) group the occasions into latent profiles of momentary ER strategies, (b) group individuals whose distributions of ER profiles differed across occasions into latent classes, and (c) examine well-being correlates of class membership at the person level. At the occasion level, we identified nine ER profiles that differed in degree of use (e.g., no use of any vs. strong use of all strategies) and in specific combinations of strategies (e.g., situation selection and acceptance vs. suppression and ignoring). At the person level, we identified 5 classes of individuals differing in the degree to which they used various momentary ER profiles versus one predominant profile across situations. Well-being was highest for individuals who used multiple ER profiles of active strategies and lowest for individuals who used ER profiles focused on suppression. Hence, both ER repertoire width and the specific make-up of the ER repertoire were relevant for the relation between ER repertoire and well-being.

Virtual reality (VR) treatment is a promising intervention option for SAD. Objective The purpose of this study was to create a participatory and interactive VR intervention for SAD. Treatment progress, including the severity of symptoms and the cognitive and emotional aspects of SAD, was analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Methods In total, 32 individuals with SAD and 34 healthy control participants were enrolled in the study through advertisements for online bulletin boards at universities. A VR intervention was designed consisting of three stages (introduction, core, and finishing) and three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) that could be selected by the participants. The core stage was the exposure intervention in which participants engaged in social situations. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed through Beck Anxiety inventory (BAI), State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Internalized Shame Scale (ISS), Post-Event Rumination Scale (PERS), Social Phobia Scale (SPS), Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), Brief-Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE), and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Results In the SAD group, scores on the BAI (F=4.616, P=.009), STAI-Trait (F=4.670, P=.004), ISS (F=6.924, P=.001), PERS-negative (F=1.008, P<.001), SPS (F=8.456, P<.001), BFNE (F=6.117, P=.004), KSAD (F=13.259, P<.001), and LSAS (F=4.103, P=.009) significantly improved over the treatment process. Compared with the healthy control group before treatment, the SAD group showed significantly higher scores on all scales (P<.001), and these significant differences persisted even after treatment (P<.001). In the comparison between the VR treatment responder and nonresponder subgroups, there was no significant difference across the course of the VR session. Conclusions These findings indicated that a participatory and interactive VR intervention had a significant effect on alleviation of the clinical symptoms of SAD, confirming the usefulness of VR for the treatment of SAD. VR treatment is expected to be one of various beneficial therapeutic approaches in the future.

However, coding patient language is a resource-intensive exercise and difficult to perform at scale. Our aim was to develop a deep learning model to automatically identify patient utterances during text-based internet-enabled Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and to determine the association between utterances and clinical outcomes. Method: Using 340 manually annotated transcripts we trained a deep learning model to categorize patient utterances into one or more of five categories. The model was used to automatically code patient utterances from our entire data set of transcripts (∼34,000 patients), and logistic regression analyses used to determine the association between both reliable improvement and engagement, and patient responses. Results: Our model reached human-level agreement on three of the five patient categories. Regression analyses revealed that increased counter change-talk (movement away from change) was associated with lower odds of both reliable improvement and engagement, while increased change-talk (movement towards change or self-exploration) was associated with increased odds of improvement and engagement. Conclusions: Deep learning provides an effective means of automatically coding patient utterances at scale. This approach enables the development of a data-driven understanding of the relationship between therapist and patient during therapy.",2020.0,36.0,19.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '300 - 312', 'name': 'Psychotherapy Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ewbank2020UnderstandingTR,\n author = {M.

The fears can arise, for example, from paranoia, hallucinations, social anxiety or negative-self beliefs. The fears lead patients to withdraw from activities, and this isolation leads to a cycle of worsening physical and mental health. Breaking this cycle requires highly active treatment directly in the troubling situations so that patients learn that they can safely and confidently enter them. However patients with psychosis seldom receive such life-changing interventions. To solve this problem we have developed an automated psychological treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR). It allows patients to experience computer simulations of the situations that they find anxiety-provoking. A virtual coach guides patients, using cognitive techniques, in how to overcome their fears. Patients are willing to enter VR simulations of anxiety-provoking situations because they know the simulations are not real, but the learning made transfers to the real world. Methods and analysis 432 patients with psychosis and anxious avoidance of social situations will be recruited from National Health Service (NHS) secondary care services. In the gameChange trial, they will be randomised (1:1) to the six-session VR cognitive treatment added to treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 6 (post-treatment) and 26 weeks by a researcher blind to allocation. The primary outcome is avoidance and distress in real-life situations, using a behavioural assessment task, at 6 weeks. The secondary outcomes are psychiatric symptoms, activity levels and quality of life. All main analyses will be intention-to-treat. Moderation and mediation will be tested. An economic evaluation will be conducted. Ethics and dissemination The trial has received ethical approval from the NHS South Central - Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (19/SC/0075).

Coexistence in schools inevitably implies conflicts among peers, which can have a negative impact inboth the students’ well-being and their academic achievement. In this sense, the main objective of the present article is to introduce and describe the evaluation of the Training Program in Emotional Management Happy 8-12 . This software focuses on the education of the pupils’ emotional competences in order to solve conflicts in an assertive way. The program consists of 25 conflicts which students need to solve according to the management program of emotions developed by the Psychopedagogic Orientation Group (GROP). Method. The sample of the study consisted of 574 students of 5th and 6th grade of primary education. 301 of the participants were boys (52.4%) and 273 were girls (47.6%). Average age was 10.53, with a standard deviation of .662. The design employed in the present work was a quasi experimental design with pretest and posttest with a control group. The instru-ments and techniques used for the evaluation were: QDE, STAIC, CES, playground climate, anecdotic registration of conflict behaviours and academic performance. Results. Our results indicated that Happy 8-12 significantly improved the emotional competences of the students, reduced anxiety levels, and ameliorated the atmosphere in both the playground and in the class, noticeably augmenting the academic success. Conclusión. The results of this study show that training the management of emotions improves students' well-being at the same time that it acts as a preventive strategy for more se-vere disruptive behaviours, such as bullying. It also optimises the coexistence in the educative centres.

With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions.

Emotion regulation (ER) is a potential contributing factor, but there has been limited research on ER and its role in comorbid psychopathology in ASD. In this study, we compared self‐reported ER with self‐ and parent reports of psychopathology in 25 high‐functioning adolescents with ASD and 23 age‐ and Intelligence Quotient (IQ)‐matched typically developing controls. Contrary to expectations, both groups reported similar levels of adaptive, voluntary forms of ER (problem solving, acceptance, etc.). However, the ASD group reported significantly greater use of involuntary forms of ER that are typically maladaptive, including remaining focused on the stressor (e.g. rumination and emotional arousal) and shutting down (e.g. emotional numbing and being unable to think or act). Associations between ER and psychopathology were generally more robust using self‐report rather than parent report. For both groups, greater endorsement of involuntary ER strategies was associated with higher ratings of psychopathology, whereas voluntary ER strategies focused on changing or adapting to the situation were significantly associated with lower levels of psychopathology. The magnitude and direction of association between ER types and psychopathology were similar for measures of depression and anxiety. These findings can help guide the development of psychosocial treatments targeting dysfunctional ER in adolescents with ASD. Interventions focused on ER as a transdiagnostic process may be a more robust method to improve emotional control and decrease emotional distress in ASD than disorder‐specific interventions.

This visual aspect of speech aids understanding and helps communicating additional information, such as the speaker's mood. We analyze quantitatively head and facial movements that accompany speech and investigate how they relate to the text's prosodic structure. We recorded several hours of speech and measured the locations of the speakers' main facial features as well as their head poses. The text was evaluated with a prosody prediction tool, identifying phrase boundaries and pitch accents. Characteristic for most speakers are simple motion patterns that are repeatedly applied in synchrony with the main prosodic events. Direction and strength of head movements vary widely from one speaker to another, yet their timing is typically well synchronized with the spoken text. Understanding quantitatively the correlations between head movements and spoken text is important for synthesizing photo-realistic talking heads.

First, this paper describes the psycho-educational potential of the horror-themed biofeedback game Nevermind. In Nevermind, players' heart rate is continuously read into the game which in turn adapts to the player's momentary levels of negative affective arousal. Greater negative arousal causes the game and its horror-themed settings to become more disturbing. As a result, Nevermind challenges players to improve their emotion regulation skills by encouraging them to healthily down-regulate their negative affective states in the face of stressful situations. Second, Nevermind implements valuable design practices, practices which we share here. Finally, we describe a recent study conducted on 47 players.

799,431ab34b3b8d5e4b2ef40588b957baa852eb886a,Emotion Regulation Effectiveness: What Works When,"We open this chapter by defining emotion and describing how emotions are generated in a series of temporal stages. We then define emotion regulation, consider precursors to the contemporary study of emotion regulation, and review the process model of emotion regulation, which holds that different emotion regulation strategies can be differentiated according to where they intervene in the emotion generation process. According to this model, emotion regulation strategies that intervene early on are likely to be more effective than strategies that intervene later on, after emotional response tendencies are activated. A growing corpus of evidence supports this account. Drawing on new data and theory, we elaborate on the process model with the aim of further specifying the effectiveness of different regulation strategies. On this expanded account, the success of any particular emotion regulation attempt is thought to be a joint function of the underlying operation of different regulation strategies, levels of emotional intensity, and regulation goals. We conclude by discussing implications and future research directions.

From a life-span perspective, normative age changes in emotion regulation may be more salient applying the same methodological approach on a broad age range examining both growth and decline during development. In addition, emotion-specific developmental patterns might show differential developmental trends. The present study examined age differences in seven emotion regulation strategies from early adolescence (age 11) to middle adulthood (age 50) for the three emotions of sadness, fear, and anger. The results showed specific developmental changes in the use of emotion regulation strategies for each of the three emotions. In addition, results suggest age-specific increases and decreases in many emotion regulation strategies, with a general trend to increasing adaptive emotion regulation. Specifically, middle adolescence shows the smallest emotion regulation strategy repertoire. Gender differences appeared for most emotion regulation strategies.

The current study examines the effectiveness of a VR-assisted treatment protocol for public speaking anxiety with demonstrated efficacy, this time in routine care, using affordable VR hardware. Participants (n = 23) were recruited via a private clinic and treated by one of four psychologists with only minimal VR-training. Using a single-subject design and dual-slope modeling (adjusting the treatment-onset slope for treatment effects), we found a significant, large decrease in self-rated public speaking anxiety following the primary three-hour session, similar in magnitude to the previous efficacy trial. Multilevel modeling of in-session process measures suggests that the protocol works as intended, by decreasing catastrophic belief expectancy and distress, and increasing perceived performance quality. Adherence to the online transition program that followed—encouraging in-vivo exposure—was relatively poor, yet symptoms decrease continued. No change was observed over the three-month follow-up period.

Yet, in daily life, pernicious stressors are often internally generated--recalling an upsetting experience reliably increases negative affect, rumination, and susceptibility to physical and psychological health problems. The present research provides the first systematic examination of whether activating the mental representation of an attachment figure enhances the regulation of affect triggered by thinking about upsetting memories. Using 2 different techniques for priming attachment figure representations and 2 types of negative affect measures (explicit and implicit), activating the mental representation of an attachment figure (vs. an acquaintance or stranger) after recalling an upsetting memory enhanced recovery--eliminating the negative effects of the memory recall (Studies 1-3). In contrast, activating the mental representation of an attachment figure before recalling an upsetting memory had no such effect (Studies 1 and 2). Furthermore, activating the mental representation of an attachment figure after thinking about upsetting memories reduced negative thinking in a stream of consciousness task, and the magnitude of the attachment-induced affective recovery effects as assessed with explicit affect measures predicted mental and physical health in daily life (Study 3). Finally, a meta-analysis of the 3 studies (Study 4) showed that the regulatory benefits conferred by the mental representation of an attachment figure were weaker for individuals high on attachment avoidance. The implications of these findings for attachment, emotion regulation, and mental and physical health are discussed.",2012.0,103.0,139.0,"{'volume': '103 2', 'pages': '\n          362-78\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Selcuk2012MentalRO,\n author = {Emre Selcuk and Vivian Zayas and Gül Günaydin and C.

Subjects are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response. This suggests that though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, they will sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate reports will occur when influential stimuli are salient and are plausible causes of the responses they produce, and will not occur when stimuli are not salient or are not plausible causes.",1977.0,97.0,10318.0,"{'volume': '84', 'pages': '231-259', 'name': 'Psychological Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nisbett1977TellingMT,\n author = {R.

819,443136202ddf2b5a8fc95ba8eacfa2dc1274c22d,Emotion regulation in autism spectrum disorder: evidence from parent interviews and children's daily diaries.,"BACKGROUND
Although emotion dysregulation is not a defining feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), there is a growing consensus that emotional problems play a prominent role in this disorder.


METHODS
The present study examined a wide range of emotion regulation (ER) strategies in 32 individuals with ASD compared to 31 group-matched typically developing (TD) participants in three emotional domains (anger, anxiety, and amusement). Parents of individuals with ASD and TD individuals were interviewed about their child's emotional experience and the use and efficacy of 10 ER strategies. In addition, participants filled out daily diaries on experience and regulation in the same emotional domains.


RESULTS
Compared to TD individuals, parents reported that individuals with ASD experienced more anger and anxiety and less amusement, made less frequent use of a variety of adaptive ER strategies (e.g. problem solving, cognitive reappraisal), and made more frequent use of maladaptive strategies (e.g. repetitive behavior). Moreover, individuals with ASD were less effective at utilizing adaptive ER strategies. Self-reports showed differences in experience of amusement and in ER strategies for anger and anxiety, but not in experience of anger and anxiety.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides evidence that individuals with ASD less frequently use adaptive - but more frequently use maladaptive - ER strategies. Implications for ASD treatments that focus on increasing the use of adaptive strategies are discussed.",2015.0,45.0,83.0,"{'volume': '56 8', 'pages': '\n          903-13\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Samson2015EmotionRI,\n author = {Andrea C.

The author argues that all 3 are associated with health outcomes, that these variables each influence health through different mechanisms, and that associations between these variables and health are not spurious findings attributable to our personalities. This argument suggests a broader view of how to intervene in social networks to improve health. This includes facilitating both social integration and social support by creating and nurturing both close (strong) and peripheral (weak) ties within natural social networks and reducing opportunities for negative social interaction.

832,450106c6c960424b365249f2a301ce0abe24e346,PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR): Checklist and Explanation,"Scoping reviews can be conducted to meet various objectives. They may examine the extent (that is, size), range (variety), and nature (characteristics) of the evidence on a topic or question; determine the value of undertaking a systematic review; summarize findings from a body of knowledge that is heterogeneous in methods or discipline; or identify gaps in the literature to aid the planning and commissioning of future research (1, 2). A recent scoping review by members of our team suggested that although the number of scoping reviews in the literature is increasing steadily, methodological and reporting quality needs to improve in order to facilitate complete and transparent reporting (1). Results from a survey on scoping review terminology, definitions, and methods showed a lack of consensus on how to conduct and report scoping reviews (3). The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) published a guidance document for the conduct of scoping reviews (4) (updated in 2017 [5]) based on earlier work by Arksey and O'Malley (6) and Levac and colleagues (7). However, a reporting guideline for scoping reviews currently does not exist. Reporting guidelines outline a minimum set of items to include in research reports and have been shown to increase methodological transparency and uptake of research findings (8, 9). Although a reporting guideline exists for systematic reviewsthe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement (10)scoping reviews serve a different purpose (11). Systematic reviews are useful for answering clearly defined questions (for example, Does this intervention improve specified outcomes when compared with a given comparator in this population?), whereas scoping reviews are useful for answering much broader questions (such as What is the nature of the evidence for this intervention? or What is known about this concept?). Given the difference in objectives, and therefore in the methodological approach (such as presence vs. absence of a risk-of-bias assessment or meta-analysis), scoping reviews should have different essential reporting items from systematic reviews. Consequently, some PRISMA items may not be appropriate, whereas other important considerations may be missing (1214). It was decided that a PRISMA extension for scoping reviews was needed to provide reporting guidance for this specific type of knowledge synthesis. This extension is also intended to apply to evidence maps (15, 16), which share similarities with scoping reviews and involve a systematic search of a body of literature to identify knowledge gaps, with a visual representation of results (such as a figure or graph). Methods The PRISMA-ScR (PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews) was developed according to published guidance by the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network for the development of reporting guidelines (9). The St. Michael's Hospital Research Ethics Board granted research ethics approval for this study on 15 August 2016. Protocol, Advisory Board, and Expert Panel Our protocol was drafted by the research team and revised as necessary by the advisory board before being listed as a reporting guideline on the EQUATOR (17) and PRISMA (18) Web sites. The research team included 2 leads (A.C.T. and S.E.S.) and 2 research coordinators (E.L. and W.Z.), none of whom participated in the scoring exercises, and a 4-member advisory board (K.K.O., H.C., D.L., and D.M.) with extensive experience doing scoping reviews or developing reporting guidelines. We aimed to form an expert panel of approximately 30 members that would be representative of different geography and stakeholder types and research experiences, including persons with experience in the conduct, dissemination, or uptake of scoping reviews. Survey Development and Round 1 of Delphi The initial step in developing the Delphi survey via Qualtrics (an online survey platform) (19) involved identifying potential modifications to the original 27-item PRISMA checklist. The modifications were based on a research program carried out by members of the advisory board to better understand scoping review practices (1, 3, 20) and included a broader research question and literature search strategy, optional risk-of-bias assessment and consultation exercise (whereby relevant stakeholders contribute to the work, as described by Arksey and O'Malley [6]), and a qualitative analysis. For round 1 of scoring, we prepared a draft of the PRISMA-ScR (Supplement) and asked expert panel members to rate their agreement with each of the proposed reporting items using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = entirely disagree, 2 = mostly disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 = neutral, 5 = somewhat agree, 6 = mostly agree, and 7 = entirely agree). Each survey item included an optional text box where respondents could provide comments. The research team calibrated the survey for content and clarity before administering it and sent biweekly reminders to optimize participation. Supplement. PRISMA-ScR Round 1 Survey (With Information Sheet) Survey Analysis To be conservative, a threshold for 85% agreement was established a priori for each of the reporting items to indicate consensus among the expert panel. This rule required that at least 85% of the panel mostly or entirely agreed (values of 6 or 7 on the Likert scale) with the inclusion of the item in the PRISMA-ScR. If agreement was less than 85%, it was considered to be discrepant. This standard was used for all 3 rounds of scoring to inform the final checklist. For ease and consistency with how the survey questions were worded, we did not include a provision for agreement on exclusion (that is, 85% of answers corresponding to values of 1 or 2 on the Likert scale). All comments were summarized to help explain the scorings and identify any issues. For the analysis, the results were stratified by group (in-person meeting vs. online, hereafter e-Delphi) because discrepant items could differ between groups. In-Person Group (Round 2 of Delphi) The Chatham House rule (21) was established at the beginning of the meeting, whereby participants were free to use information that is shared but were not permitted to reveal the identity or affiliation of the speaker. Expert panel members were given their individual results; the overall group distribution, median, and interquartile range; a summary of the JBI methodological guidance (4); and preliminary feedback from the e-Delphi group. These data were used to generate and inform the discussion about each discrepant item from round 1. Two researchers (A.C.T. and S.E.S.) facilitated the discussion using a modified nominal group technique (22) to reach consensus. Panel members were subsequently asked to rescore the discrepant items using sli.do (23), a live audience-response system in a format that resembled the round 1 survey. For items that failed to meet the threshold for consensus, working groups were assembled. The meeting was audio-recorded and transcribed using TranscribeMe (24), and 3 note-takers independently documented the main discussion points. The transcript was annotated to complement a master summary of the discussion points, which was compiled using the 3 note-takers' files. E-Delphi Group (Round 2 of Delphi) Those who could not attend the in-person meeting participated via an online discussion exercise using Conceptboard (25), a visual collaboration platform that allows users to provide feedback on whiteboards in real time. The discrepant items from round 1 were presented as a single whiteboard, and questions (for example, After reviewing your survey results with respect to this item, please share why you rated this item the way you did) were assigned to participants as tasks to facilitate the discussion. E-Delphi panel members received the same materials as in-person participants and were encouraged to respond to others' comments and interact through a chat feature. The second round of scoring was done in Qualtrics using a similar format as in round 1. A summary of the Conceptboard discussion, as well as the annotated meeting transcript and master summary document, were shared so that participants could learn about the perspectives of the in-person group before rescoring. Working Groups and Round 3 of Delphi To enable panel-wide dialogue and refine the checklist items before the final round of scoring, working groups were created and collaborated by teleconference and e-mail. Their task was to discuss the discrepant items in terms of the key issues and considerations (relating to both concepts and wording) that had been raised in earlier stages across both groups. To harmonize the data from the 2 groups, a third round of scoring exercise was administered using Qualtrics (19). In this step, suggested modifications (in terms of both concepts and wording) from all previous stages were incorporated into the items that had failed to reach consensus in the first 2 rounds across both groups, and the full panel scored this updated list. Interactive Workshop (Testing) A workshop led by the lead investigator (A.C.T.) and facilitated by members of the advisory board and expert panel (S.E.S., C.M.G., C.G., T.H., M.T.M., and M.D.J.P.) was held as part of the Global Evidence Summit in Cape Town, South Africa, in September 2017. Participants (researchers, scientists, policymakers, managers, and students) tested the checklist by applying the PRISMA-ScR to a scoping review on a health-related topic (26). Role of the Funding Source This work was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The funding source had no role in designing the study; collecting, analyzing, or interpreting the data; writing the manuscript; or deciding to submit it for publication. Results Expert Panel A total of 37 persons were invited to participate, of whom 31 completed round 1 and 24 completed all 3 rounds of scoring.

Furthermore, at a psychological and behavioral level, slot machine gambling, video lottery terminal (VLT) gambling and video game playing share many of the same features. Despite the similarities between video game playing and gambling there have been very few studies that have specifically examined video game playing in relation to gambling behavior. This study inquired about the nature of adolescent video game playing, gambling activities, and associated factors. A questionnaire was completed by 996 (549 females, 441 males, 6 unspecified) participants from grades 7–11, who ranged in age from 10–17 years. Overall, the results of the study found a clear relationship between video game playing and gambling in adolescents, with problem gamblers being significantly more likely than non-problem gamblers or non-gamblers to spend excessive amounts of time playing video games. Problem gamblers were also significantly more likely than non-problem gamblers or non-gamblers to rate themselves as very good or excellent video game players. Furthermore, problem gamblers were more likely to report that they found video games, similar to electronic machine gambling, to promote dissociation and to be arousing and/or relaxing.",2004.0,33.0,136.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '100 - 77', 'name': 'Journal of Child & Adolescent Substance Abuse'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wood2004VideoGP,\n author = {Richard T.

It tests the hypothesis that gender will influence the exhibition of stress outcomes resulting from exposure to high-density living environments, with women displaying internalized responses and men responding with externalized styles. Expanding on the types of gender-appropriate disorders examined in this area of research, I selected depression, aggression, and withdrawal as gender-specific disorders based on theory and prior research. Multilevel analyses of data from a survey of Toronto residents indicate that, while the effects of household density are conditioned by gender, support for the existence of gender-equivalent outcomes is mixed. While women living in crowded homes are more likely to be depressed, men exposed to high-density living environments do not report increased aggression. However, men report higher levels of withdrawal, and some males respond with both aggression and withdrawal.",2008.0,92.0,74.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '254 - 268', 'name': 'Journal of Health and Social Behavior'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Regoeczi2008CrowdingIC,\n author = {Wendy C.

The possibility to construct agents that can engage in meaningful social interaction with humans presents new challenges for engineers. In general, social robotics has been inspired primarily by psychologists with the aim of building human-like robots. Only a small subcategory of “companion robots” (also referred to as robotic pets) was built to mimic animals. In this opinion essay we argue that all social robots should be seen as companions and more conceptual emphasis should be put on the inter-specific interaction between humans and social robots. This view is underlined by the means of an ethological analysis and critical evaluation of present day companion robots. We suggest that human–animal interaction provides a rich source of knowledge for designing social robots that are able to interact with humans under a wide range of conditions.",2012.0,67.0,81.0,"{'volume': '3', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Miklósi2012OnTU,\n author = {Á.

However, the processes performed in these cycles come at a cost. Such costs force the agent to evaluate a tradeoff between the optimality of the decision making and the time and computational effort required to make it. Several cognitive mechanisms that play critical roles in managing this tradeoff have been identified. These mechanisms include adaptation, learning, memory, attention, and planning. One of the often overlooked outcomes of these cognitive mechanisms, in spite of the critical effect that they may have on the perception-action cycle of organisms, is “emotion.” In this study, we hold that emotion can be considered as an emergent phenomenon of a plausible neurocomputational energy regulation mechanism, which generates an internal reward signal to minimize the neural energy consumption of a sequence of actions (decisions), where each action triggers a visual memory recall process. To realize an optimal action selection over a sequence of actions in a visual recalling task, we adopted a model-free reinforcement learning framework, in which the reward signal—that is, the cost—was based on the iteration steps of the convergence state of an associative memory network. The proposed mechanism has been implemented in simulation and on a robotic platform: the iCub humanoid robot. The results show that the computational energy regulation mechanism enables the agent to modulate its behavior to minimize the required neurocomputational energy in performing the visual recalling task.",2019.0,57.0,9.0,"{'name': 'Adaptive Behavior', 'pages': '55 - 71', 'volume': '29'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kirtay2019EmotionAA,\n author = {M.

The purpose of this study was to examine the interactions of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with an adult and their typically-developing peers in the presence of animals (two guinea pigs) compared to toys. Methods Ninety-nine children from 15 classrooms in 4 schools met the inclusion criteria and participated in groups of three (1 child with ASD and 2 typically-developing peers). Each group was video-recorded during three 10-minute, free-play sessions with toys and three 10-minute, free-play sessions with two guinea pigs. Two blinded observers coded the behavior of children with ASD and their peers. To account for the nested study design, data were analyzed using hierarchical generalized linear modeling. Results Participants with ASD demonstrated more social approach behaviors (including talking, looking at faces, and making tactile contact) and received more social approaches from their peers in the presence of animals compared to toys. They also displayed more prosocial behaviors and positive affect (i.e., smiling and laughing) as well as less self-focused behaviors and negative affect (i.e., frowning, crying, and whining) in the presence of animals compared to toys.

To this end, the Uncanny Valley theory contradicts the common assumption that increased humanization of characters leads to better acceptance. Rather, it shows that anthropomorphic behavior may trigger feelings of eeriness and rejection in people. The work presented in this paper explores whether four different autonomous ECAs, specifically build for a European research project, are affected by this effect, and how they compare to two slightly more realistically looking human-controlled, i.e. face-tracked, ECAs with respect to perceived humanness, eeriness, and attractiveness. Short videos of the ECAs in combination with a validated questionnaire were used to investigate potential differences. Results support existing theories highlighting that increased perceived humanness correlates with increased perceived eeriness. Furthermore, it was found, that neither the gender of survey participants, their age, nor the sex of the ECA influences this effect, and that female ECAs are perceived to be significantly more attractive than their male counterparts.",2020.0,36.0,10.0,"{'pages': '1-6', 'name': '2020 IEEE International Conference on Human-Machine Systems (ICHMS)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Thaler2020AgentVA,\n author = {Markus Thaler and Stephan Schlögl and Aleksander Groth},\n journal = {2020 IEEE International Conference on Human-Machine Systems (ICHMS)},\n pages = {1-6},\n title = {Agent vs. Avatar: Comparing Embodied Conversational Agents Concerning Characteristics of the Uncanny Valley},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1978833000', 'name': 'Markus Thaler'}, {'authorId': '3020596', 'name': 'Stephan Schlögl'}, {'authorId': '50094818', 'name': 'Aleksander Groth'}]"

Are there activities that computers can engage in that actively draw people into relationships with them? What are the potential benefits to the people who participate in these human-computer relationships? To address these questions this work introduces a theory of Relational Agents, which are computational artifacts designed to build and maintain long-term, social-emotional relationships with their users. These can be purely software humanoid animated agents--as developed in this work--but they can also be non-humanoid or embodied in various physical forms, from robots, to pets, to jewelry, clothing, hand-helds, and other interactive devices. Central to the notion of relationship is that it is a persistent construct, spanning multiple interactions; thus, Relational Agents are explicitly designed to remember past history and manage future expectations in their interactions with users. Finally, relationships are fundamentally social and emotional, and detailed knowledge of human social psychology--with a particular emphasis on the role of affect--must be incorporated into these agents if they are to effectively leverage the mechanisms of human social cognition in order to build relationships in the most natural manner possible. People build relationships primarily through the use of language, and primarily within the context of face-to-face conversation. Embodied Conversational Agents--anthropomorphic computer characters that emulate the experience of face-to-face conversation--thus provide the substrate for this work, and so the relational activities provided by the theory will primarily be specific types of verbal and nonverbal conversational behaviors used by people to negotiate and maintain relationships. This work also provides an analysis of the types of applications in which having a human-computer relationship is advantageous to the human participant. In addition to applications in which the relationship is an end in itself (e.g., in entertainment systems), human-computer relationships are important in tasks in which the human is attempting to undergo some change in behavior or cognitive or emotional state. One such application is explored here: a system for assisting the user through a month-long health behavior change program in the area of exercise adoption. This application involves the research, design and implementation of relational agents as well as empirical evaluation of their ability to build relationships and effect change over a series of interactions with users.

The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar's behavior to the observer's neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar's face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. This innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in various populations, notably individuals suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders.",2015.0,68.0,28.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jackson2015EEVEETE,\n author = {P.

Based on clinical and empirical data, social isolation is found to be prevalent among elderly people, and it has negative consequences on the elderly’s psychological and physical health. Targeting social isolation has become a focus area for policy and practice. Evidence indicates that contemporary information and communication technologies (ICT) have the potential to prevent or reduce the social isolation of elderly people via various mechanisms. Objective This systematic review explored the effects of ICT interventions on reducing social isolation of the elderly. Methods Relevant electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, SSCI, Communication Studies: a SAGE Full-Text Collection, Communication & Mass Media Complete, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore) were systematically searched using a unified strategy to identify quantitative and qualitative studies on the effectiveness of ICT-mediated social isolation interventions for elderly people published in English between 2002 and 2015. Narrative synthesis was performed to interpret the results of the identified studies, and their quality was also appraised. Results Twenty-five publications were included in the review. Four of them were evaluated as rigorous research. Most studies measured the effectiveness of ICT by measuring specific dimensions rather than social isolation in general. ICT use was consistently found to affect social support, social connectedness, and social isolation in general positively. The results for loneliness were inconclusive. Even though most were positive, some studies found a nonsignificant or negative impact. More importantly, the positive effect of ICT use on social connectedness and social support seemed to be short-term and did not last for more than six months after the intervention. The results for self-esteem and control over one’s life were consistent but generally nonsignificant. ICT was found to alleviate the elderly’s social isolation through four mechanisms: connecting to the outside world, gaining social support, engaging in activities of interests, and boosting self-confidence. Conclusions More well-designed studies that contain a minimum risk of research bias are needed to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of ICT interventions for elderly people in reducing their perceived social isolation as a multidimensional concept. The results of this review suggest that ICT could be an effective tool to tackle social isolation among the elderly. However, it is not suitable for every senior alike. Future research should identify who among elderly people can most benefit from ICT use in reducing social isolation. Research on other types of ICT (eg, mobile phone–based instant messaging apps) should be conducted to promote understanding and practice of ICT-based social-isolation interventions for elderly people.",2016.0,70.0,502.0,"{'volume': '18', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chen2016TheEO,\n author = {Yi-Ru Regina Chen and P.

In this work, we compare results from a legacy hardware dial mechanism for measuring media preference to those from automated facial analysis on two television programs, a sitcom and a drama series. We present an automated system for facial action detection as well as a continuous measure of valence. The results demonstrate that automated facial analysis provides similar as well as additional insights on moment-to-moment affective response in a way that is unobtrusive, scalable and practical. Specifically, highly significant correlations are found between the dial and facial expression data. For specific moments where the two methods disagree, facial expression data provides additional traceable insights that cannot be obtained from dial data. Furthermore, this data can be obtained at a fraction of the cost; in this work, the facial expression data panel size is only about 5% of the sample size needed to obtain reliable dial data. Results have substantial implications for the future of media research and audience measurement.",2013.0,24.0,20.0,"{'pages': '1-6', 'name': '2013 10th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kodra2013FromDT,\n author = {E.

Pick-A-Mood consists of three characters that each express eight mood states, representing four main categories: excited and cheerful (for energised-pleasant), irritated and tense (for energised-unpleasant), relaxed and calm (for calm-pleasant), and bored and sad (for calm-unpleasant). Using Pick-A-Mood requires little effort on the part of respondents, making it suitable for design research applications in which people often have little time or motivation to report their moods. Contrary to what is often assumed, mood and emotion are distinct phenomena with different measurable manifestations. These differences are discussed, and a review of existing methods is provided, indicating to what extent current methods that measure emotion are suitable for measuring mood. The development and validation of Pick-A-Mood is reported, and application examples and research opportunities are discussed.",2016.0,155.0,80.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '241-279', 'name': 'J. of Design Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Desmet2016MoodMW,\n author = {P.

This chapter analyzes why experts in the field are looking for an alternative to the currently dominant cognitive approach. The basic principles of activity theory are presented and their implications for human-computer interaction are discussed. The chapter concludes with an outline of the potential impact of activity theory on studies and design of computer use in real-life settings. It is generally accepted that the lack of an adequate theory of human-computer interaction (HCI) is one of the most important reasons that progress in the field of HCI is relatively modest, compared with the rate of technological development. People coming to the field of HCI from different disciplines—psychology, computer science, graphics design, and others—have serious problems in coordinating and combining their efforts. For example, typical HCI curricula for undergraduate and graduate students present a mixture of knowledge from various disciplines rather than an integrated perspective. Traditional conceptual approaches cannot provide an appropriate basis for addressing many important aspects of HCI, including computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and cross-cultural aspects of computer use. Consequently the impact of HCI studies on current design practice is limited, with user interface design being based mainly on intuition and expensive trial and error. The form of a suitable HCI theory has been subjected to much debate recently (Carroll, Kellogg, and Rosson 1991). A major trend in the debate has been the growing dissatisfaction with the dominant cognitive approach (Bannon 1991; Wood 1992; Monk et al. 1993). In contrast to the general agreement that current attempts to apply cognitive psychology to HCI are not very successful, there is little agreement on the most promising theoretical alternatives. Proposals vary from an enrichment of the traditional cognitive scheme (Barnard 1991) to a radical shift in paradigms, for example, from scientific experimental studies to ethnographic methodology (see Monk et al. 1993). In this period of theoretical uncertainty there has been a growing interest in activity theory, greatly stimulated by Bødker's works (1989, 1991). She was the first Western researcher who presented the basic ideas and potential benefits of activity theory to the HCI community. Recently, a number of papers discussing the activity theory approach to HCI have appeared in major international journals and The aim of the present chapter is to summarize current work in activity theory and its implications for …",,31.0,439.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n author = {V.

Studies of motivation and attention.,"Emotions are action dispositions--states of vigilant readiness that vary widely in reported affect, physiology, and behavior. They are driven, however, by only 2 opponent motivational systems, appetitive and aversive--subcortical circuits that mediate reactions to primary reinforcers. Using a large emotional picture library, reliable affective psychophysiologies are shown, defined by the judged valence (appetitive/pleasant or aversive/unpleasant) and arousal of picture percepts. Picture-evoked affects also modulate responses to independently presented startle probe stimuli. In other words, they potentiate startle reflexes during unpleasant pictures and inhibit them during pleasant pictures, and both effects are augmented by high picture arousal. Implications are elucidated for research in basic emotions, psychopathology, and theories of orienting and defense.

Most theories of motivation propose that our daily choices of activities aim to maximize positive affective states but fail to explain when people decide to engage in unpleasant yet necessary activities. We tracked the activities and moods of over 28,000 people in real time and demonstrated that people seek mood-enhancing activities when they feel bad and unpleasant activities when they feel good. These findings clarify how emotions shape behavior and may explain how humans trade off short-term happiness for long-term welfare. Overcoming such trade-offs might be critical for our personal well-being and our survival as a species. Most theories of motivation have highlighted that human behavior is guided by the hedonic principle, according to which our choices of daily activities aim to minimize negative affect and maximize positive affect. However, it is not clear how to reconcile this idea with the fact that people routinely engage in unpleasant yet necessary activities. To address this issue, we monitored in real time the activities and moods of over 28,000 people across an average of 27 d using a multiplatform smartphone application. We found that people’s choices of activities followed a hedonic flexibility principle. Specifically, people were more likely to engage in mood-increasing activities (e.g., play sports) when they felt bad, and to engage in useful but mood-decreasing activities (e.g., housework) when they felt good. These findings clarify how hedonic considerations shape human behavior. They may explain how humans overcome the allure of short-term gains in happiness to maximize long-term welfare.",2016.0,30.0,51.0,"{'volume': '113', 'pages': '9769 - 9773', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Taquet2016HedonismAT,\n author = {M.

Additionally, both rumination and co-rumination are related to the occurrence of depressive symptoms during adolescence. Method: The current study utilized an ecological momentary design to examine the temporal relationship between daily co-rumination and rumination in response to negative events within a sample of young adolescents (N = 150). Results: Hierarchical linear models indicated that co-rumination in response to a negative event significantly, positively predicted the use of rumination the following day, whereas use of rumination did not predict engagement in co-rumination the following day.

Less is known about specific emotion regulation strategies that promote learning. Six- to 13-year-olds (N = 126) viewed a sad film and were instructed to reappraise the importance, reappraise the outcome, or ruminate about the sad events; another group received no regulation instructions. Children viewed an educational film, and memory for this was later assessed. As predicted, reappraisal strategies more effectively attenuated children's self-reported emotional processing. Reappraisal enhanced memory for educational details relative to no instructions. Rumination did not lead to differences in memory from the other instructions. Memory benefits of effective instructions were pronounced for children with poorer emotion regulation skill, suggesting the utility of reappraisal in learning contexts.",2013.0,49.0,99.0,"{'volume': '84 1', 'pages': '\n          361-74\n        ', 'name': 'Child development'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Davis2013EmotionRS,\n author = {E.

Method: We recruited 936 Japanese participants. They comprised six age groups ranging from 20 to 70 years old, with 156 participants in each age group and equal numbers of men and women. Results: Structural equation model analysis showed that older participants were more likely to use cognitive reappraisal, further enhancing positive mood and reducing negative mood, whereas, age did not affect expressive suppression. Moreover, expressive suppression had a smaller impact on mood than cognitive reappraisal. A multi-group analysis showed significant gender differences.

891,4a191bb8c04538cae794379502ce552a0b7adf15,Resilience in the face of stress: emotion regulation as a protective factor,"Introduction Everyone experiences stress at one time or another – from major events such as the death of a loved one, to more minor stressors such as financial difficulties. Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.",2011.0,94.0,264.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '30-44', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Troy2011ResilienceIT,\n author = {Allison S.

Although seminal research in this area was performed in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, more recently it has attracted the attention of optimization theorists because of several noteworthy success stories from operations management. It is on large-scale and complex problems of dynamic optimization, in particular the Markov decision problem (MDP) and its variants, that the power of RL becomes more obvious. It has been known for many years that on large-scale MDPs, the curse of dimensionality and the curse of modeling render classical dynamic programming (DP) ineffective. The excitement in RL stems from its direct attack on these curses, which allows it to solve problems that were considered intractable via classical DP in the past. The success of RL is due to its strong mathematical roots in the principles of DP, Monte Carlo simulation, function approximation, and AI. Topics treated in some detail in this survey are temporal differences, Q-learning, semi-MDPs, and stochastic games. Several recent advances in RL, e.g., policy gradients and hierarchical RL, are covered along with references. Pointers to numerous examples of applications are provided. This overview is aimed at uncovering the mathematical roots of this science so that readers gain a clear understanding of the core concepts and are able to use them in their own research.

Materials and methods Primary studies published between 2007 and 2017 that explored the use of technologies for community-dwelling people with MCI/D were identified through five databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, AMED, and CINAHL. Twenty-nine out of 359 papers met the criteria for eligibility. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool for quality assessment. Results A wide range of technologies was presented in the 29 studies, sorted into four domains: 1) safe walking indoors and outdoors; 2) safe living; 3) independent living; and 4) entertainment and social communication. The current state of knowledge regarding usability and acceptability reveals that even if researchers are aware of these concepts and intend to measure usability and acceptability, they seem difficult to assess. Terms such as “user friendliness” and “acceptance” were used frequently. User participation in the 29 studies was high. Persons with MCI/D, FCs, and staff/other older adults were involved in focus groups, workshops, and interviews as part of the preimplementation process. Conclusion Research regarding technologies to support people with MCI/D seems optimistic, and a wide range of technologies has been evaluated in homes with people with MCI/D and their FCs. A major finding was the importance of including people with MCI/D and their FCs in research, in order to learn about required design features to enhance usability and acceptability.

It has, of course, been a central concept within symbolic interactionism since the seminal writings of Mead ( 1934), Cooley (1902), and James ( 1890). However, even within this sociological tradition there has been a revitalization of interest in the self-concept: with developments in role theory (Turner 1978; Gordon 1976), with the increasing focus on the concept of identity (McCall & Simmons 1978; Stryker 1980; Gordon 1968; Guiot 1977; Burke 1980), with the reemergence of interest in social structure and person­ ality (House 198 1 ; Turner 1976; Kohn 1969, 198 1 ; Rosenberg 1979), and with the reconceptualization of small group experimental situations (Alexander and colleagues 197 1 , 1 98 1 ; Webster & Sobieszek 1974). The reemergence of the self-concept is even more dramatic within psycho­ logical social psychology. Much of this revitalization of interest in self­ phenomena (e.g. self-awareness, self-esteem, self-image, self-evaluation) is due to the ""cognitive revolution"" in psychology (Dember 1974; Manis 1977), generally at the expense of behaviorism. As a result, the self-concept has become conspicuous in areas and traditions that were previously considered alien terrain: within behaviorism via Bern's ( 1972) theory of self-attribution; within social learning theory via Bandura's ( 1977) focus on self-efficacy; and within cognitive dissonance theory via Aronson's ( 1968) and Bramel's ( 1968) reformulations.

Several studies have been conducted comprising of classical human human interaction and human computer interaction. They concluded that for intelligent interaction, emotions play an important role. By embedding the emotions in the interaction of human with machine, machine would be in a position to sense the mood of the user and change its interaction accordingly. Hence the system will be friendlier to the user and its responses will be more similar to human behaviour. In general, human beings make use of emotions through speech, facial expression and gestures for conveying the crucial information. This paper presents an attempt to recognize selected emotion categories from keyboard stroke pattern. The emotional categories considered for our analysis are neutral, positive and negative. We have used various classifiers like Simple Logistics, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Tree, J48 and BF Tree, which is a part of WEKA tool, to analyse the selected features from keyboard stroke pattern.",2010.0,16.0,91.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '24-28', 'name': 'International Journal of Computer Applications'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Khanna2010RecognisingEF,\n author = {Preeti Khanna},\n journal = {International Journal of Computer Applications},\n pages = {24-28},\n title = {Recognising Emotions from Keyboard Stroke Pattern},\n volume = {11},\n year = {2010}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2264213824', 'name': 'Preeti Khanna'}]"

Yet, the neural mechanisms implicated in approach‐avoidance tendencies to distinct emotional expressions have not been fully described. Here, we investigated the neural systems implicated in regulating the distance to different emotions, and how they vary as a function of empathy. Twenty‐three healthy participants assessed for psychopathic traits underwent fMRI scanning while they viewed approaching and withdrawing angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral faces. Participants were also asked to set the distance to those faces on a computer screen, and to adjust the physical distance from the experimenter outside the scanner. Participants kept the greatest distances from angry faces, and shortest from happy expressions. This was accompanied by increased activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, inferior frontal gyrus, and temporoparietal junction for angry and happy expressions relative to the other emotions. Irrespective of emotion, longer distances were kept from approaching faces, which was associated with increased activation in the amygdala and insula, as well as parietal and prefrontal regions. Amygdala activation was positively correlated with greater preferred distances to angry, fearful and sad expressions. Moreover, participants scoring higher on coldhearted psychopathic traits (lower empathy) showed reduced amygdala activation to sad expressions. These findings elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying social approach‐avoidance, and how they are related to variations in empathy.

Specifically, the process of decision-making is implemented in a multi-stage and collaborative fashion: Given a classifier for single modality, the classifier is regarded as a virtual expert since classification methods can make emotion recognition in accordance with certain expertise. Then, in the reputation equalization, the expert's classification capability is then quantitatively equalized to assure the reputation and/or confidence for each expert. To compromise decisions among experts, the final decision is obtained by calculating the weighted-sum of all the equalized reputation quantities, in such a way that the decision of one expert can be made in collaboration with that of the others. Moreover, to learn the proposed model parameters, the genetic algorithm is tailored and applied to alleviate the local minima problem during the process of finding an optimal solution. The experimental results have shown that the proposed collaborative decision-making model is effective in multimodal emotion recognition.",2013.0,25.0,17.0,"{'pages': '1-6', 'name': '2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2013LearningCD,\n author = {Kuan-Chieh Huang and Hsueh-Yi Sean Lin and Jyh-Chian Chan and Y.

Nonverbal gestures such as facial expressions are important to human communication and should be considered by speech-driven face animation systems. In this paper, we present a framework that systematically addresses facial deformation modeling, automatic facial motion analysis, and real-time speech-driven face animation with expression using neural networks. Based on this framework, we learn a quantitative visual representation of the facial deformations, called the motion units (MUs). A facial deformation can be approximated by a linear combination of the MUs weighted by MU parameters (MUPs). We develop an MU-based facial motion tracking algorithm which is used to collect an audio-visual training database. Then, we construct a real-time audio-to-MUP mapping by training a set of neural networks using the collected audio-visual training database. The quantitative evaluation of the mapping shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Using the proposed method, we develop the functionality of real-time speech-driven face animation with expressions for the iFACE system. Experimental results show that the synthetic expressive talking face of the iFACE system is comparable with a real face in terms of the effectiveness of their influences on bimodal human emotion perception.",2002.0,58.0,106.0,"{'volume': '13 4', 'pages': '\n          916-27\n        ', 'name': 'IEEE transactions on neural networks'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hong2002RealtimeSF,\n author = {P.

907,4b4b466be21c0113548876865a940478a32ef344,A New Approach to Modeling Emotions and Their Use on a Decision-Making System for Artificial Agents,"In this paper, a new approach to the generation and the role of artificial emotions in the decision-making process of autonomous agents (physical and virtual) is presented. The proposed decision-making system is biologically inspired and it is based on drives, motivations, and emotions. The agent has certain needs or drives that must be within a certain range, and motivations are understood as what moves the agent to satisfy a drive. Considering that the well-being of the agent is a function of its drives, the goal of the agent is to optimize it. Currently, the implemented artificial emotions are happiness, sadness, and fear. The novelties of our approach are, on one hand, that the generation method and the role of each of the artificial emotions are not defined as a whole, as most authors do. Each artificial emotion is treated separately. On the other hand, in the proposed system it is not mandatory to predefine either the situations that must release any artificial emotion or the actions that must be executed in each case. Both the emotional releaser and the actions can be learned by the agent, as happens on some occasions in nature, based on its own experience. In order to test the decision-making process, it has been implemented on virtual agents (software entities) living in a simple virtual environment. The results presented in this paper correspond to the implementation of the decision-making system on an agent whose main goal is to learn from scratch how to behave in order to maximize its well-being by satisfying its drives or needs. The learning process, as shown by the experiments, produces very natural results. The usefulness of the artificial emotions in the decision-making system is proven by making the same experiments with and without artificial emotions, and then comparing the performance of the agent.",2012.0,60.0,60.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '56-68', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Salichs2012ANA,\n author = {M.

It has recreational settings built with 2D graphic interface to keep the children’s attention and an access control and a register mechanism to allow the monitoring of the child’s progress. The data collection of the functional, nonfunctional, psychological, and educational requirements, as well as the evaluation of its consistency and usability, was made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of five experts in each of the following expertises: pedagogy, psychology, psychopedagogy, and game development. The effectiveness test of the game was performed by 10 children with ASD and 28 children with neurotypical development, which were separated into control and experimental groups, respectively. All experts and children with neurotypical development answered the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire after playing the game. The results were positive, between experts and volunteers regarding their acceptance.

These regions included the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and right medial frontopolar cortex (MFPC). Together with the LA, these six prefrontal regions thus formed the functional neuroanatomical network engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure. Here we perform a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis of the effective connectivity for this network. The SVAR analysis demonstrates that the left rACC plays an important role during the rtfMRI-nf training, modulating the LA and the other network regions. According to the analysis, the rtfMRI-nf training leads to a significant enhancement in the time-lagged effect of the left rACC on the LA, potentially consistent with the ipsilateral distribution of the monosynaptic projections between these regions. The training is also accompanied by significant increases in the instantaneous (contemporaneous) effects of the left rACC on four other regions – the bilateral DMPFC, the right MFPC, and the left SFG. The instantaneous effects of the LA on the bilateral DMPFC are also significantly enhanced. Our results are consistent with a broad literature supporting the role of the rACC in emotion processing and regulation. Our exploratory analysis provides, for the first time, insights into the causal relationships within the network of regions engaged during the rtfMRI-nf procedure targeting the amygdala. It suggests that the rACC may constitute a promising target for rtfMRI-nf training along with the amygdala in patients with affective disorders, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",2013.0,61.0,128.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zotev2013PrefrontalCO,\n author = {V.

In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in an effort to document the existence of psi. If psi exists, it occurs in the brain, and hence, assessing the brain directly should be more sensitive than using indirect behavioral methods (as have been used previously). To increase sensitivity, this experiment was designed to produce positive results if telepathy, clairvoyance (i.e., direct sensing of remote events), or precognition (i.e., knowing future events) exist. Moreover, the study included biologically or emotionally related participants (e.g., twins) and emotional stimuli in an effort to maximize experimental conditions that are purportedly conducive to psi. In spite of these characteristics of the study, psi stimuli and non-psi stimuli evoked indistinguishable neuronal responsesalthough differences in stimulus arousal values of the same stimuli had the expected effects on patterns of brain activation.

922,4c736dec7ccf989b868b799ff8c4dec73b2d4e43,Changes in physiological reactivity in response to the trauma memory during prolonged exposure and virtual reality exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder.,"OBJECTIVE
A key symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is hyperreactivity to trauma-relevant stimuli. Though physiological arousal is reliably elevated in PTSD, the question remains whether this arousal responds to treatment. Virtual reality (VR) has been posited to increase emotional engagement during prolonged exposure therapy (PE) for PTSD by augmenting imaginal exposures with trauma-relevant sensory information. However, the comparative effects of VR exposure therapy (VRE) have received limited empirical inquiry.


METHOD
Ninety active-duty soldiers with combat-related PTSD participating in a randomized-controlled trial to receive PE, VRE, or a waitlist-control (WL) condition had their physiological reactivity, indexed by galvanic skin response (GSR), to their trauma memories assessed at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment.


RESULTS
Although both VRE and PE conditions showed reduced GSR reactivity to trauma memories from pre- to posttreatment, only the VRE group differed significantly from WL. Across the sample, reductions in GSR were significantly correlated with reductions in self-reported PTSD and anxiety symptoms.


CONCLUSIONS
This was the first study comparing effects of VRE and PE on psychophysiological variables. Given previous research finding limited differences between VRE and PE in PTSD symptom reduction, these findings lend support to the rationale for including VR in exposure therapy protocols while raising important questions about the potential benefits of VRE.

MMORPGs can be applied to enhancing language learning, which is drawing researchers’ attention from different fields and many studies have validated MMORPGs’ positive effect on language learning. However, there are few studies on the underlying behavioral or neural mechanism of such effect. This paper reviews the educational application of the MMORPGs based on relevant macroscopic and microscopic studies, showing that gamers’ overall language proficiency or some specific language skills can be enhanced by real-time online interaction with peers and game narratives or instructions embedded in the MMORPGs. Mechanisms underlying the educational assistant role of MMORPGs in second language learning are discussed from both behavioral and neural perspectives. We suggest that attentional bias makes gamers/learners allocate more cognitive resources toward task-related stimuli in a controlled or an automatic way. Moreover, with a moderating role played by activation of reward circuit, playing the MMORPGs may strengthen or increase functional connectivity from seed regions such as left anterior insular/frontal operculum (AI/FO) and visual word form area to other language-related brain areas.",2017.0,89.0,24.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2017LanguageLE,\n author = {Yongjun Zhang and Hongwen Song and Xiaoming Liu and D.

In the contamination subtype, individuals are scared of germs and bacteria, are excessively concerned with cleaning, fear contamination and the spread of disease, and may have a very strong aversion to bodily secretions. A few studies on virtual reality have been conducted with people suffering from OCD, but they all focus on the subtype characterized by checking rituals. The goal of this study is to confirm the potential of a “contaminated” virtual environment in inducing anxiety in 12 adults suffering from contamination-subtype OCD compared to 20 adults without OCD (N = 32) using a within-between protocol. Subjective (questionnaire) and objective (heart rate) measurements were compiled. Participants were immersed in a control virtual environment (empty and clean room) and a “contaminated” virtual environment (filthy public restroom) designed for the treatment of OCD. Immersions were conducted in a 6-wall CAVE-like system. As hypothesized, the results of repeated-measures ANCOVAs revealed the significant impact of immersion in a filthy public restroom for participants suffering from OCD on both measures. Presence was correlated with anxiety in OCD participants and no difference in presence was observed between groups. Unwanted negative side effects induced by immersions in virtual reality were higher in the OCD group.

Sensory realism is subsumed within this broader perspective, as one of the means that contributes to the experience of presence. The effectiveness of the illusion of presence created by a virtual world can be partially assessed by studying visitors to virtual worlds' subjective experience ofhow much they feel like they are there and what makes them feel that way.

Recent studies have suggested that depression can result fromfailed emotion regulation under limited cognitive resources. In this work, we demonstrate how reappraisal can fail under high levels of stress and limited cognitive resources using an agent-based simulation. Further, we explored the effectiveness of reappraisal under different conditions. Our experiments suggest that for people who are more likely to recall positive memories, it is more beneficial to think about the recalled events from multiple perspectives.

Dyadic latent growth curve modeling showed that anger behavior predicted increases in cardiovascular symptoms and stonewalling behavior predicted increases in musculoskeletal symptoms. Both associations were found for husbands (although cross-lagged path models also showed some support for wives) and were controlled for sociodemographic characteristics (age, education) and behaviors (i.e., exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption) known to influence health. Both associations did not exist at the start of the study, but only emerged over the ensuing 20 years. There was some support for the specificity of these relationships (i.e., stonewalling behavior did not predict cardiovascular symptoms; anger behavior did not predict musculoskeletal symptoms; neither symptom was predicted by fear nor sadness behavior), with the anger-cardiovascular relationship emerging as most robust. Using cross-lagged path models to probe directionality of these associations, emotional behaviors predicted physical health symptoms over time (with some reverse associations found as well). These findings illuminate longstanding theoretical and applied issues concerning the association between interpersonal emotional behaviors and physical health and suggest opportunities for preventive interventions focused on specific emotions to help address major public health problems.

950,4e3fbf9d06210b556b27b6ae720266113dac4092,Measuring friendship quality in late adolescents and young adults: McGill Friendship Questionnaires.,"Two studies established the psychometric properties of two friendship questionnaires; one taps respondents' feelings for a friend and satisfaction with the friendship, the other, respondents' assessments of the degree to which a friend fulfills six friendship functions (stimulating companionship, help, intimacy, reliable alliance, self-validation, and emotional security). Factor analysis confirmed the subscale structure of each questionnaire. The subscales showed high internal consistency, distinguished best from casual friends, and did not covary with social desirability. They did covary with the duration of being a best friend and with a self-esteem subscale regarding close friends, but not with other self-esteem measures. Women reported higher positive feelings for their friend than did men, and evaluated the friend higher on friendship functions. Finally, positive feelings and satisfaction covaried with each friendship function subscale. The research here concerns the development and validation of two multi-scale friendship questionnaires-one concerning a respondent's feelings for a friend and friendship, the other concerning the respondent's assessment of the degree to which the friend fulfills six friendship functions. The studies grew out of work on friendship quality in children and young adolescents (Aboud & Mendelson, 1996; Mendelson, Aboud, & Lanthier, 1994). The goal here was to design measures, based on a similar model of friendship, suitable for late adolescents and young adults. Friendships, like other relationships, vary in quality. Although it is difficult to judge friendship quality in behavioral terms, length of the relationship and reciprocated versus nonreciprocated nominations are gross criterion measures of friendship quality. Furthermore, individuals can specify types of friendships, distinguishing, for example, between best friends, good friends, casual friends, and acquaintances (i.e., nonfriends); and such distinctions are also gross criterion measures of quality. Gender also provides a criterion for validating friendship measures, because there is ample evidence that gender differences do exist, with women's friendships characterized by better overall quality, closeness, enjoyment, intimacy, and nurturance (e.g., Bell, 1991; Jones, 1991; Sapadin, 1988; Wright & Scanlon, 1991). Thus, any friendship measure should be sensitive enough to differentiate women's and men's friendships. At the most general level, relationships can be assessed as positive or negative. In these terms, friendship scales have been developed to assess attachment to the friend and conflict.2 Attachment refers to the special 1This paper was completed in 1997; we subsequently published a brief version (Mendelson & Aboud, 1999). Part of the research was presented as a poster (Measuring Friendship Quality in Late Adolescents and Young Adults) at the American Psychological Association, Toronto, ON, August, 1996. We heartily thank the following: Jocelyne Andrews, Sophie Beugnot, Lisa Seidel, and Tsafrir Vanounou collected data reported here as part of their undergraduate theses. Rhonda Amsel offered excellent statistical advice. Finally, Barry Corenblum, Richard Koestner, and Debbie Moskowitz constructively criticized a draft of the manuscript.

Send correspondence to Morton J. Mendelson (morton.mendelson@mcgill.ca). 2Conflict, which might be considered the opposite of attachment, can certainly be an important aspect of any relationship. Indeed, friends often have conflicts, but may nonetheless be able to resolve them equitably and without bad feelings (Hartup, Laursen, Stewart & Eastenson, 1988). Thus, numerous friendship measures have subscales related to conflict or conflict resolution (Bukowski et al., 1994; Furman & Adler, 1982; Furman McGill Friendship Questionnaires 2 feelings that individuals have for a friend. Mutual liking has often been used as a criterion to identify a friend, but a separate subscale may be used to assess liking in greater depth (cf. Bukowski, Hoza, & Boivin, 1994; Sharabany, 1974; Wright, 1991). One of the measures reported here, taps positive feelings for the friend and satisfaction with the friendship, which will be viewed as criterion measures of undifferentiated friendship quality. Although the two measures are conceptually distinct, they should covary highly because they are both assumed to reflect overall friendship quality. However, an important assumption guiding research on friendship is that it is possible to assess specific qualities of friendships. Consideration of the theoretical foundations of various scales suggested that a framework based on friendship functions (Furman & Buhrmester, 1985; Parker & Asher, 1989)--rather than specific behaviors (Bukowski, et al. 1994; Sharabany, Gershoni, & Hofman, 1981) or motives (Wright, 1991)-is preferable for a number of reasons: It provides a broader scope, yields a better ideal for a mature relationship, and makes it possible to develop analogous, if not identical, measures for different developmental stages. Within a functional approach, a friend is seen as a source of certain social, emotional and instrumental resources that a person seeks (Asher & Parker, 1989; Weiss, 1974). In a review of existing measures (Aboud & Mendelson, 1992), we sought to define friendship functions that were theoretically distinct, that distinguished between friends and nonfriends, and that were associated with affection/satisfaction. We identified six relevant functions (stimulating companionship, help, intimacy, reliable alliance, self-validation and, emotional security). It is assumed that individual friends fulfill some, if not all, of these functions, so measures of the different functions should covary. Nonetheless, the following definitions describe what are clearly six conceptually distinguishable functions of friendship: Stimulating Companionship refers to doing things together that arouse enjoyment, amusement, and excitement. This quality seems to be an important expectation of friends at all ages. Some measures have focused mainly on doing things together (Buhrmester, 1990; Bukowski et al., 1994; Parker & Asher, 1989; Sharabany, 1974), but it seems important to stress the fun and excitement in common activities (Jones, 1991; Wright, 1991). Help refers to providing guidance, assistance, information, advice, and other forms of tangible aid necessary to meet needs or goals. Thus, it need not be reciprocal (Jones, 1991). Help has been assessed in specific subscales (Bukowski et al., 1994; Parker & Asher, 1989; Wright, 1991) and it has also been combined with support (Bukowski et al., 1994; Sharabany, 1974). However, the instrumental aspect of support tapped by help is distinguishable from other aspects of support tapped by Emotional Security and Self-Validation. Intimacy refers to sensitivity to the other's needs and states, providing an accepting context in which personal thoughts and feelings can be openly and honestly expressed, and openly and honestly disclosing personal information about oneself. A number of researchers have Intimacy subscales (e.g., Buhrmester & Furman, 1987), although Mannarino (1976) and Buhrmester (1990) assess it as a composite along with companionship. Sharabany's (1974) Sensitivity and Knowing subscale stresses the importance of knowing without any explicit disclosure. Wright (1991) does not include such a subscale except as it pertains to selfaffirmation or the expression of true feelings. Reliable Alliance refers to being able to count on the continuing availability and loyalty of the friend. This was an important dimension underlying Selman's (1980) distinction between a fair-weather friend who would end the relationship if conflict or strains arose and a more durable friend. It is assessed in a specific Conflict and Betrayal subscale (Parker & Asher, 1989) and in a Trust and Loyalty subscale (Sharabany, 1974). Bukowski and colleagues' (1994) Reliable Alliance subscale concerns self-disclosure, which is referred to here & Buhrmester, 1985; Parker and Asher, 1989; Wright, 1991). However, these constructs are not theoretically analogous to the six friendship functions considered here. Therefore, we are currently developing separate instruments to tap negative feelings for a friend and the incidence of conflict and conflict resolution in a friendship. McGill Friendship Questionnaires 3 as Intimacy; but they combine it with a Transcending Problems subscale that is closer to the definition of Reliable Alliance. Self-Validation refers to perceiving the other as reassuring, agreeing, encouraging, listening, and otherwise helping to maintain one's self-image as a competent and worthwhile person. This is often achieved through social comparison and consensual validation of one's attributes and beliefs. Similar items have been referred to as Attachment (Sharabany, 1974), as Ego Support and Self-Affirmation (Wright, 1991), and as Reflected Appraisal (Bukowski et al., 1994), although that was combined with an Affective Bond subscale as part of Closeness. Emotional Security refers to the comfort and confidence provided by the friend in novel or threatening situations. Although the emotional support provided by a friend is considered to be important, only Wright (1991) includes items in a Security subscale to assess perception of the friend as safe and unthreatening because he or she does not betray one's trust or draw attention to one's weaknesses. Besides assessing the respondent's feelings for the friend and satisfaction with the friendship, it seems important to choose between assessing the functions that the friend is perceived to fulfill and the functions that the respondent reportedly fulfills.

A theory of socioemotional selectivity.,"Socioemotional selectivity theory claims that the perception of time plays a fundamental role in the selection and pursuit of social goals. According to the theory, social motives fall into 1 of 2 general categories--those related to the acquisition of knowledge and those related to the regulation of emotion. When time is perceived as open-ended, knowledge-related goals are prioritized. In contrast, when time is perceived as limited, emotional goals assume primacy. The inextricable association between time left in life and chronological age ensures age-related differences in social goals. Nonetheless, the authors show that the perception of time is malleable, and social goals change in both younger and older people when time constraints are imposed. The authors argue that time perception is integral to human motivation and suggest potential implications for multiple subdisciplines and research interests in social, developmental, cultural, cognitive, and clinical psychology.",1999.0,117.0,3995.0,"{'volume': '54 3', 'pages': '\n          165-81\n        ', 'name': 'The American psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Carstensen1999TakingTS,\n author = {L.

One key advantage of VR is that sharing of virtual content can lead to more robust replication and representative sampling. A database of standardized content will help fulfill this vision. There are two objectives to this study. First, we seek to establish and allow public access to a database of immersive VR video clips that can act as a potential resource for studies on emotion induction using virtual reality. Second, given the large sample size of participants needed to get reliable valence and arousal ratings for our video, we were able to explore the possible links between the head movements of the observer and the emotions he or she feels while viewing immersive VR. To accomplish our goals, we sourced for and tested 73 immersive VR clips which participants rated on valence and arousal dimensions using self-assessment manikins. We also tracked participants' rotational head movements as they watched the clips, allowing us to correlate head movements and affect. Based on past research, we predicted relationships between the standard deviation of head yaw and valence and arousal ratings. Results showed that the stimuli varied reasonably well along the dimensions of valence and arousal, with a slight underrepresentation of clips that are of negative valence and highly arousing. The standard deviation of yaw positively correlated with valence, while a significant positive relationship was found between head pitch and arousal.

The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering [22] and to language modeling.

959,4f118d8cfd9e4eb3df249e97844af338fc171b4f,A Virtual Reprise of the Stanley Milgram Obedience Experiments,"Background Stanley Milgram's 1960s experimental findings that people would administer apparently lethal electric shocks to a stranger at the behest of an authority figure remain critical for understanding obedience. Yet, due to the ethical controversy that his experiments ignited, it is nowadays impossible to carry out direct experimental studies in this area. In the study reported in this paper, we have used a similar paradigm to the one used by Milgram within an immersive virtual environment. Our objective has not been the study of obedience in itself, but of the extent to which participants would respond to such an extreme social situation as if it were real in spite of their knowledge that no real events were taking place. Methodology Following the style of the original experiments, the participants were invited to administer a series of word association memory tests to the (female) virtual human representing the stranger. When she gave an incorrect answer, the participants were instructed to administer an ‘electric shock’ to her, increasing the voltage each time. She responded with increasing discomfort and protests, eventually demanding termination of the experiment. Of the 34 participants, 23 saw and heard the virtual human, and 11 communicated with her only through a text interface. Conclusions Our results show that in spite of the fact that all participants knew for sure that neither the stranger nor the shocks were real, the participants who saw and heard her tended to respond to the situation at the subjective, behavioural and physiological levels as if it were real. This result reopens the door to direct empirical studies of obedience and related extreme social situations, an area of research that is otherwise not open to experimental study for ethical reasons, through the employment of virtual environments.",2006.0,34.0,557.0,"{'volume': '1', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Slater2006AVR,\n author = {M.

We propose that activating emotion goals and implementing means can independently affect emotion regulation. People are not always motivated to regulate emotions or to regulate them in a prohedonic manner. Therefore, activating prohedonic emotion goals is consequential. Furthermore, merely activating an emotion goal may trigger accessible means, leading to emotional changes. We tested these ideas by disentangling effects of pursuing prohedonic emotion goals and implementing cognitive reappraisal. First, we show that individuals perceive measures and manipulations of cognitive reappraisal as signaling the activation of specific emotion goals (i.e., decrease unpleasant or increase pleasant emotions) and the implementation of specific means (i.e., think differently about emotion-eliciting events). Second, we decomposed a classic measure of cognitive reappraisal to show that previously documented benefits of reappraisal might be because of the frequency of either pursuing prohedonic goals or using cognitive reappraisal. Third, in 2 empirical studies, we separately manipulated prohedonic goals (without specifying the means), cognitive reappraisal (without specifying the goal), and gave classic reappraisal instructions (specifying both the goal and the means). In both studies, activating prohedonic goals was as effective in decreasing negative emotions as was activating prohedonic goals with reappraisal instructions. Thus, activating emotion goals is essential, and sometimes even sufficient, for successful regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that the confound between goals and means is pervasive in the cognitive reappraisal literature, and offer recommendations for avoiding it.",2019.0,50.0,39.0,"{'volume': '116', 'pages': '795–816', 'name': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tamir2019WhenTA,\n author = {Maya Tamir and E.

It was hypothesized that the training, which encourages adaptive self-reflection on stressor events and the effectiveness of coping strategies and resources, would exert a positive effect on mental health outcomes via increased reflection and decreased brooding. The trial was conducted during a significant stressor period with a final sample of 204 second-class Officer Cadets from the Royal Military College, Australia. Platoons of Cadets were randomly allocated to either Self-Reflection Resilience Training (SRT; n = 96) or an exposure-matched active control group that received training as usual (i.e., cognitive-behavioral skill development training) and communication skills seminars (n = 108). Compared to the active control group, SRT was more effective at preventing the onset of depression symptoms and promoting stable levels of perceived stress during a period of increased exposure to training stressors, consistent with a resilient trajectory. The Self-Reflection group unexpectedly demonstrated higher anxiety symptoms than the Control group at immediate follow-up, but these symptoms returned to baseline levels at longer term follow-up. In contrast, the Control group experienced increasing anxiety symptoms between immediate and longer term follow-up. Mediation analyses supported an indirect effect of SRT on all three outcome measures via brooding, but not via reflection. This study provides support for the capacity of a practical, sustainable, and scalable intervention based on self-reflection to strengthen resilience in the military training setting.

The main goal of this study was to analyze the possible use of VR as an affective medium. Within this general goal, the study also analyzed the relationship between presence and emotions. The results confirmed the efficacy of VR as affective medium: the interaction with ""anxious"" and ""relaxing"" virtual environments produced anxiety and relaxation. The data also showed a circular interaction between presence and emotions: on one side, the feeling of presence was greater in the ""emotional"" environments; on the other side, the emotional state was influenced by the level of presence.

An electronic search was performed using PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLE to identify studies that examined the factors of adherence to lifestyle modification programs with explicit definition of adherence indicators. We identified 19 studies published between 2004 and 2016. The most commonly used indicator of adherence was attrition, followed by attendance, self-monitoring and dietary adherence. A broad array of factors has been studied but only few studies exploring each factor. Limited evidence suggested older age, higher education, healthier eating and physical activity behaviours, higher stage of change at baseline and higher initial weight loss may predict better adherence. On the other hand, having depression, stress, strong body shape concern, more previous weight loss attempts and being unemployed may predict poor adherence. Inconsistent findings were obtained for self-efficacy, motivation and male gender. This review highlights the need for more rigorous studies to enhance our knowledge on factors related to adherence.

It compares the behavior of people with that of computer agents deploying a variety of decision-making strategies. The results align with behavioral economics studies in showing that people cooperate when they play and that factors of social dependency influence their levels of cooperation. Preliminary results indicate that people design agents to play strategies closer to game-theory predictions, yielding lower utility. Additional experiments show that such agents perform worse than agents designed to make choices that resemble human cooperative behavior.

Objective: This study investigates the potential for adaptive systematic self-reflection to support the development of situation resilience via stressor exposure. Design: An experimental randomized controlled design was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to either the Systematic Self-reflection intervention (n = 61) or disengagement control group (n = 60). Method: Participants were 121 university students (female = 68%) ranging in age from 18 to 56 years. Participants experienced two psychosocial stressors and completed a baseline survey, a second survey occurred post-stressor 1, and a third post-stressor 2. Salivary cortisol was taken pre stressor 2, immediately post stressor 2, and at 10 min intervals until 30 min. Results: The intervention was associated with greater reductions in negative affect, than a disengagement control task, and prevented the continued reduction in positive affect observed in the disengagement control condition. Moreover, the intervention promoted a steeper cortisol recovery trajectory, than the control condition for those with higher pre-stressor cortisol. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence that certain self-reflective practices may be involved in the development of resilience from stressor exposure.",2020.0,62.0,19.0,"{'volume': '33', 'pages': '231 - 247', 'name': 'Anxiety, Stress, & Coping'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Crane2020LeveragingTE,\n author = {M.

However, it is unknown which physical eye features convey mental states and how that came about. In the current experiments, we tested the hypothesis that the receiver’s perception of mental states is grounded in expressive eye appearance that serves an optical function for the sender. Specifically, opposing features of eye widening versus eye narrowing that regulate sensitivity versus discrimination not only conveyed their associated basic emotions (e.g., fear vs. disgust, respectively) but also conveyed opposing clusters of complex mental states that communicate sensitivity versus discrimination (e.g., awe vs. suspicion). This sensitivity-discrimination dimension accounted for the majority of variance in perceived mental states (61.7%). Further, these eye features remained diagnostic of these complex mental states even in the context of competing information from the lower face. These results demonstrate that how humans read complex mental states may be derived from a basic optical principle of how people see.",2017.0,42.0,54.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '494 - 503', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lee2017ReadingWT,\n author = {D.

In contrast to pNHST, Bayes factors allow researchers to quantify evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. Also, Bayes factors do not require adjustment for the intention with which the data were collected. The use of Bayes factors is demonstrated through an extended example for hierarchical regression based on the design of an experiment recently published in the Journal of Management.

For example, it is critical to designing virtual humans, human-like autonomous agents that interact with people in virtual worlds. A key factor in human social interaction is our beliefs about others, in particular a theory of mind. Whether we believe a message depends not only on its content but also on our model of the communicator. The actions we take are influenced by how we believe others will react. However, theory of mind is usually ignored in computational models of social interaction. In this paper, we present PsychSim, an implemented multiagent-based simulation tool for modeling interactions and influence among groups or individuals. Each agent has its own decision-theoretic model of the world, including beliefs about its environment and recursive models of other agents. Having thus given the agents a theory of mind, PsychSim also provides them with a psychologically motivated mechanism for updating their beliefs in response to actions and messages of other agents.

The error variance and the variance of the random effects are usually considered to be homogeneous. These variance terms characterize the within‐subjects (i.e., error variance) and between‐subjects (i.e., random‐effects variance) variation in the data. In studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), up to 30 or 40 observations are often obtained for each subject, and interest frequently centers around changes in the variances, both within and between subjects. In this article, we focus on an adolescent smoking study using EMA where interest is on characterizing changes in mood variation. We describe how covariates can influence the mood variances, and also extend the standard mixed model by adding a subject‐level random effect to the within‐subject variance specification. This permits subjects to have influence on the mean, or location, and variability, or (square of the) scale, of their mood responses. Additionally, we allow the location and scale random effects to be correlated. These mixed‐effects location scale models have useful applications in many research areas where interest centers on the joint modeling of the mean and variance structure.",2008.0,34.0,219.0,"{'volume': '64', 'name': 'Biometrics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hedeker2008AnAO,\n author = {D.

1000,532ce26200b801b8ab6f7332f92dfc7213bb00b8,Emotion and the autonomic nervous system: A prospectus for research on autonomic specificity.,"The question of whether there are different patterns of autonomic nervous system responses for different emotions is examined. Relevant conceptual issues concerning both the nature of emotion and the structure of the autonomic nervous system are discussed in the context of the development of research methods appropriate for studying this question. Are different emotional states associated with distinct patterns of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity? This is an old question that is currently enjoying a modest revival in psychology. In the 1950s autonomic specificity was a key item on the agenda of the newly emerging discipline of psychophysiology, which saw as its mission the scientific exploration of the mind-body relationship using the tools of electrophysiological measurement. But the field of psychophysiology had the misfortune of coming of age during a period in which psychology drifted away from its physiological roots, a period in which psychology was dominated by learning, behaviourism, personality theory and later by cognition. Psychophysiology in the period between 1960 and 1980 reflected these broader trends in psychology by focusing on such issues as autonomic markers of perceptual states (e.g. orienting, stimulus processing), the interplay between personality factors and ANS responsivity, operant conditioning of autonomic functions, and finally, electrophysiological markers of cognitive states. Research on autonomic specificity in emotion became increasingly rare. Perhaps as a result of these historical trends in psychology, or perhaps because research on emotion and physiology is so difficult to do well, there 18 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION exists only a small body of studies on ANS specificity. Although almost all of these studies report some evidence for the existence of specificity, the prevailing zeitgeist has been that specificity has not been empirically established. At this point in time a review of the existing literature would not be very informative, for it would inevitably dissolve into a critique of methods. Instead, what I hope to accomplish in this chapter is to provide a new framework for thinking about ANS specificity, and to propose guidelines for carrying out research on this issue that will be cognizant of the recent methodological and theoretical advances that have been made both in psychophysiology and in research on emotion. Emotion as organization From the outset, the definition of emotion that underlies this chapter should be made explicit. For me the essential function of emotion is organization. The selection of emotion for preservation across time and species is based on the need for an efficient mechanism than can mobilize and organize disparate response systems to deal with environmental events that pose a threat to survival. In this view the prototypical context for human emotions is those situations in which a multi-system response must be organized quickly, where time is not available for the lengthy processes of deliberation, reformulation, planning and rehearsal; where a fine degree of co-ordination is required among systems as disparate as the muscles of the face and the organs of the viscera; and where adaptive behaviours that normally reside near the bottom of behavioural hierarchies must be instantaneously shifted to the top. Specificity versus undifferentiated arousal In this model of emotion as organization it is assumed that each component system is capable of a number of different responses, and that the emotion will guide the selection of responses from each system. Component systems differ in terms of the number of response possibilities. Thus, in the facial expressive system a selection must be made among a limited set of prototypic emotional expressions (which are but a subset of the enormous number of expressions the face is capable of assuming). A motor behaviour must also be selected from a similarly reduced set of responses consisting of fighting, fleeing, freezing, hiding, etc. All major theories of emotion would accept the proposition that activation of the ANS is one of the changes that occur during emotion. But theories differ as to how many different ANS patterns constitute the set of selection possibilities. At one extreme are those who would argue that there are only two ANS patterns: 'off' and 'on'. The 'on' ANS pattern, according to this view, consists EMOTION AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 19 of a high-level, global, diffuse ANS activation, mediated primarily by the sympathetic branch of the ANS. The manifestations of this pattern rapid and forcefulcontractions of the heart, rapid and deep breathing, increased systolic blood pressure, sweating, dry mouth, redirection of blood flow to large skeletal muscles, peripheral vasoconstriction, release of large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, and the resultant release of glucose from the liver are well known. Cannon (1927) described this pattern in some detail, arguing that this kind of high-intensity, undifferentiated arousal accompanied all emotions .. Among contemporary theories the notion of undifferentiated arousal is most clearly found in Mandler's theory (Mandler, 1975). However, undifferentiated arousal also played a major role in the extraordinarily influential cognitive/physiological theory of Schachter and Singer (1962). According to this theory, undifferentiated arousal is a necessary precondition for emotionan extremely plastic medium to be moulded by cognitive processes working in concert with the available cues from the social environment. At the other extreme are those who argue that there are a large number of patterns of ANS activation, each associated with a different emotion (or subset of emotions). This is the traditional specificity position. Its classic statement is often attributed to James (1884), although Alexander (1950) provided an even more radical version. The specificity position fuelled a number of experimental studies in the 1950s and 1960s, all attempting to identify some of these autonomic patterns (e.g. Averill, 1969; Ax, 1953; Funkenstein, King and Drolette, 1954; Schachter, 1957; Sternbach, 1962). Despite these studies, all of which reported support for ANS specificity, the undifferentiated arousal theory, especially as formulated by Schachter and Singer (1962) and their followers, has been dominant for a great many years. Is the ANS capable of specific action No matter how appealing the notion of ANS specificity might be in the abstract, there would be little reason to pursue it in the laboratory if the ANS were only capable of producing one pattern of arousal. There is no question that the pattern of high-level sympathetic arousal described earlier is one pattern that the ANS can produce. Cannon's arguments notwithstanding, I believe there now is quite ample evidence that the ANS is capable of a number of different patterns of activation. Whether these patterns are reliably associated with different emotions remains an empirical question, but the potential is surely there. A case in support of this potential for specificity can be based on: (a) the neural structure of the ANS; (b) the stimulation neurochemistry of the ANS; and (c) empirical findings. 20 SOCIAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND EMOTION",1988.0,28.0,301.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Levenson1988EmotionAT,\n author = {R.

Mobile health (mHealth) technology has the potential to intervene at various points in the emotion regulation process of adolescent mothers to provide them support for more adaptive emotional and behavioral regulation in the course of their daily life. Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the acceptability, feasibility, use patterns, and mechanisms by which a mobile technology used as an adjunct to in-person, provider-delivered sessions fostered adolescent mothers’ adaptive emotion regulation strategies under real-life conditions. Methods: Participants (N=49) were enrolled in the intervention condition of a larger pilot study of homeless adolescent mothers living in group-based shelters. The mHealth technology. Calm Mom, consisted of a mobile app and a wrist-worn sensorband for the ambulatory measurement and alerting of increased electrodermal activity (EDA), a physiological measurement of stress. We examined logs of mobile app activity and conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with a subsample (N=10) of participants. Qualitative data analysis was guided by the theoretical frames of the intervention and a technology acceptance model and included an analysis of emerging themes and concepts. Results: Overall, participants indicated that one or more of the elements of Calm Mom supported their ability to effectively regulate their emotions in the course of their daily life in ways that were consonant with the intervention’s theoretical model. For many adolescent mothers, the app became an integral tool for managing stress. Due to technical challenges, fewer participants received sensorband alerts; however, those who received alerts reported high levels of acceptability as the technology helped them to identify their emotions and supported them in engaging in more adaptive behaviors during real-life stressful situations with their children, peers, and family members. Conclusions: Calm Mom is a promising technology for providing theoretically driven behavioral intervention strategies during real-life stressful moments among a highly vulnerable population. Future research efforts will involve addressing technology challenges and refining tailoring algorithms for implementation in larger-scale studies.",2018.0,72.0,24.0,"{'volume': '1', 'name': 'JMIR pediatrics and parenting'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Leonard2018TheoreticallyBasedER,\n author = {N.

This paper aims to investigate the phenomenon of active escapism – a unique form of experiential consumption that engages fantasy and role-play as a means of coping. In contrast with passive forms of escapism, whereby consumers act as observers (e.g. watching a movie), active escapism provides consumers with the opportunity to directly interact with mediated realities, whether constructed in a virtual space (e.g. a video game) or the real world. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Within the context of video game consumption, a conceptual framework for active escapism comprised antecedents, processes and consequences is established through literature review, depth interviews and naturalistic inquiry. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The findings suggest that active escapism functions as a coping mechanism when consumers are confronted with external stressors that threaten either their sense of identity or control. While other forms of emotion-focused coping relieve stress through psychological avoidance (i.e. refocusing of attention away from stressors), active escapism provides the benefits of affirmation and empowerment through projective fantasy (i.e. role-play) and presence (i.e. immersion into a mediated reality).

This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize the human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of sequential floating forward search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.",2001.0,61.0,2215.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '1175-1191', 'name': 'IEEE Trans.

While the use of VR in psychotherapy has been widely discussed, little attention has been given to the potential of this new medium for art therapy. Artistic expression in VR is a novel medium which offers unique possibilities, extending beyond classical expressive art mediums. Creation in VR includes options such as three-dimensional painting, an immersive creative experience, dynamic scaling, and embodied expression. In this perspective paper, we present the potentials and challenges of VR for art therapy and outline basic principles for its implementation.

However, it has remained unknown to what extent social touch would maintain and establish social bonds. We asked a total of 1,368 people from five countries to reveal, using an Internet-based topographical self-reporting tool, those parts of their body that they would allow relatives, friends, and strangers to touch. These body regions formed relationship-specific maps in which the total area was directly related to the strength of the emotional bond between the participant and the touching person. Cultural influences were minor. We suggest that these relation-specific bodily patterns of social touch constitute an important mechanism supporting the maintenance of human social bonds. Nonhuman primates use social touch for maintenance and reinforcement of social structures, yet the role of social touch in human bonding in different reproductive, affiliative, and kinship-based relationships remains unresolved. Here we reveal quantified, relationship-specific maps of bodily regions where social touch is allowed in a large cross-cultural dataset (N = 1,368 from Finland, France, Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom). Participants were shown front and back silhouettes of human bodies with a word denoting one member of their social network. They were asked to color, on separate trials, the bodily regions where each individual in their social network would be allowed to touch them. Across all tested cultures, the total bodily area where touching was allowed was linearly dependent (mean r2 = 0.54) on the emotional bond with the toucher, but independent of when that person was last encountered. Close acquaintances and family members were touched for more reasons than less familiar individuals. The bodily area others are allowed to touch thus represented, in a parametric fashion, the strength of the relationship-specific emotional bond. We propose that the spatial patterns of human social touch reflect an important mechanism supporting the maintenance of social bonds.",2015.0,42.0,264.0,"{'volume': '112', 'pages': '13811 - 13816', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Suvilehto2015TopographyOS,\n author = {Juulia T.

This systematic review was carried out to investigate the use of virtual reality in the assessment and the treatment of psychosis. Web of Science, PsychInfo, EMBASE, Scopus, ProQuest and PubMed databases were searched, resulting in the identification of 638 articles potentially eligible for inclusion; of these, 50 studies were included in the review. The main fields of research in virtual reality and psychosis are: safety and acceptability of the technology; neurocognitive evaluation; functional capacity and performance evaluation; assessment of paranoid ideation and auditory hallucinations; and interventions. The studies reviewed indicate that virtual reality offers a valuable method of assessing the presence of symptoms in ecologically valid environments, with the potential to facilitate learning new emotional and behavioural responses. Virtual reality is a promising method to be used in the assessment of neurocognitive deficits and the study of relevant clinical symptoms. Furthermore, preliminary findings suggest that it can be applied to the delivery of cognitive rehabilitation, social skills training interventions and virtual reality-assisted therapies for psychosis. The potential benefits for enhancing treatment are highlighted.

A total of 116 participants were asked to estimate prospectively or retrospectively a video game session lasting 12, 35 or 58 minutes. The results indicate that time is perceived as longer in the prospective paradigm than in the retrospective one, although the variability of estimates is the same. Moreover, the 12-minute session was perceived as longer, proportionally, than the 35- and 58-minute sessions. The study also revealed that the number of hours participants spent playing video games per week was a significant predictor of time estimates. To account for the main findings, the differences between prospective and retrospective timing are discussed in quantitative terms using a proposed theoretical framework, which states that both paradigms use the same cognitive processes, but in different proportions. Finally, the hypothesis that gamers play more because they underestimate time is also discussed.",2010.0,58.0,90.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tobin2010AnEA,\n author = {S.

Methods: A systematic literature search in June 2018 was conducted in PubMed, EmBase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included that involved a chatbot in a mental health setting focusing on populations with or at high risk of developing depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, and substance abuse disorders. Results: From the selected databases, 1466 records were retrieved and 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were included from reference list screening for a total of 10 included studies. Overall, potential for conversational agents in psychiatric use was reported to be high across all studies. In particular, conversational agents showed potential for benefit in psychoeducation and self-adherence. In addition, satisfaction rating of chatbots was high across all studies, suggesting that they would be an effective and enjoyable tool in psychiatric treatment. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence for psychiatric use of chatbots is favourable. However, given the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies, further research with standardized outcomes reporting is required to more thoroughly examine the effectiveness of conversational agents. Regardless, early evidence shows that with the proper approach and research, the mental health field could use conversational agents in psychiatric treatment.",2019.0,38.0,378.0,"{'volume': '64', 'pages': '456 - 464', 'name': 'The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vaidyam2019ChatbotsAC,\n author = {A.

While this may sound like a truism, emotion research does not always directly theorize, manipulate, or measure emotion with context in mind. To facilitate this process, we present a framework of contextual features that shape emotion‐related processes, and highlight several key factors that have been shown to matter in emotion research. We make four recommendations which we believe will help to better integrate context in emotion science. We argue that a deeper collective understanding, interrogation, and integration of context will propel the field forward theoretically and methodologically, and enhance researchers' ability to probe the mechanisms of human psychological experience. While our focus is on emotion research, we believe that the context framework and associated recommendations will also be useful to other fields of social psychological and personality science.",2018.0,130.0,81.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Social and Personality Psychology Compass'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Greenaway2018ContextIE,\n author = {Katharine H.

Humans experience social exclusion as defeating. An animal model for defeat is the resident-intruder paradigm. The defeated animal shows evidence of an increased sensitivity to amphetamine, increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex, and increased firing of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area. As for humans, one study showed that amphetamine-induced striatal dopamine release was significantly greater among nonpsychotic young adults with severe hearing impairment than among normal hearing controls. Two other studies reported an association between childhood trauma and increased dopamine function in striatal subregions. Several studies have suggested that the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) may play a role in the processing of social stress. Importantly, the pgACC regulates the activity of the ventral striatum through bidirectional interconnections. We are not aware of studies in humans that examined whether (proxies for) social exclusion contributes to the structural brain changes present at psychosis onset. Animal studies, however, reported that long-term isolation may lead to reductions in volume of the total brain, hippocampus, or medial prefrontal cortex. Other animal studies reported that social defeat can reduce neurogenesis. In conclusion, the answer to the question as to whether there are plausible mechanisms whereby social exclusion can contribute to the pathogenesis of psychosis is cautiously affirmative.",2017.0,45.0,60.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '287–292', 'name': 'Schizophrenia Bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Selten2017BiologicalMW,\n author = {J.

Drawing from developmental, affective, and health psychological frameworks, the present 2 studies investigated SES as a moderator of reappraisal and anxiety using performance-based (Study 1) and self-report (Study 1 and 2) measures of reappraisal; analyzing nonclinical (Study 1) and clinical (Study 2) symptoms of anxiety; and utilizing a small, laboratory-based study (Study 1) and a large-scale 9-year longitudinal study (Study 2). Across studies, findings showed that reappraisal predicted lower anxiety at low levels of SES but did not or less so at high levels of SES. These results were found for self-report measures of reappraisal; generalized across nonclinical and clinical symptoms of anxiety; and emerged both concurrently and prospectively across 9 years. Findings remained stable when controlling for a number of covariates, including age, gender, and race; were more robust for income than education; largely generalized across gender (except for a men-specific moderation effect for education in Study 2); and were directional such that SES did not moderate associations between anxiety and changes in reappraisal.

1035,55ee33f5d4c83b02a9354f9080899340ea12a668,Moving from Virtual Reality Exposure-Based Therapy to Augmented Reality Exposure-Based Therapy: A Review,"This paper reviews the move from virtual reality exposure-based therapy to augmented reality exposure-based therapy (ARET). Unlike virtual reality (VR), which entails a complete virtual environment (VE), augmented reality (AR) limits itself to producing certain virtual elements to then merge them into the view of the physical world. Although, the general public may only have become aware of AR in the last few years, AR type applications have been around since beginning of the twentieth century. Since, then, technological developments have enabled an ever increasing level of seamless integration of virtual and physical elements into one view. Like VR, AR allows the exposure to stimuli which, due to various reasons, may not be suitable for real-life scenarios. As such, AR has proven itself to be a medium through which individuals suffering from specific phobia can be exposed “safely” to the object(s) of their fear, without the costs associated with programing complete VEs. Thus, ARET can offer an efficacious alternative to some less advantageous exposure-based therapies. Above and beyond presenting what has been accomplished in ARET, this paper covers some less well-known aspects of the history of AR, raises some ARET related issues, and proposes potential avenues to be followed. These include the type of measures to be used to qualify the user’s experience in an augmented reality environment, the exclusion of certain AR-type functionalities from the definition of AR, as well as the potential use of ARET to treat non-small animal phobias, such as social phobia.",2014.0,142.0,181.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Baus2014MovingFV,\n author = {Oliver Baus and S.

A nationally representative sample of 9,844 respondents aged 18-26 years was tested for chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis in wave 3 (2001-2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The authors used multiple logistic regression to assess the relation between age at first sexual intercourse and these STIs and to examine variation by current age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Younger ages at first intercourse were associated with higher odds of STI in comparison with older ages, but the effect diminished with increasing current age. For example, the odds of having an STI for an 18-year-old who first had intercourse at age 13 were more than twice those of an 18-year-old who first had intercourse at age 17 (prevalence odds ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.42, 3.59). In contrast, the odds of having an STI among 24-year-olds with first intercourse at age 13 versus those with first intercourse at age 17 were the same (prevalence odds ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 0.88, 1.39).

1041,56a8d3c77c77cb6610d34ceff46f7c604ffc5934,Age similarities and differences in spontaneous use of emotion regulation tactics across five laboratory tasks.,"Theories of emotional aging have proposed that age differences in emotion regulation may partly explain why older adults report high levels of emotional well-being despite declines in other domains. The current research examined age differences and similarities in emotion regulatory tactic preferences across 5 laboratory tasks designed to measure the strategies within the process model of emotion regulation (situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation). An adult life span sample (ages 20-78, N = 225) completed tasks offering opportunities to use tactics that decrease negative, increase positive, or engage with negative aspects of the situation. Overall, age similarity in tactic preferences (supported by Bayes factors) was much more common than age differences. Across the sample, participants favored avoiding negative aspects in situation selection and modification and seeking or introducing positive aspects in attentional deployment and cognitive change. Self-reports of affect suggest that older adults were more responsive to positive aspects of the situation, although they did not seek them out more than other age groups. These results cast some doubt on the assumption that spontaneous emotion regulation is more likely in older age, but rather show that both younger and older adults show similar preferences in the absence of other strong goals. This novel approach of examining strategies across the process model highlights benefits of comparing multiple tactics within strategies not only when examining possible age differences, but also when studying patterns of emotion regulation in general.

The therapist-patient therapeutic alliance is regarded as a successful intervention and a good predictor of treatment adherence. Similar to the human scenario, embodied conversational agents (ECAs) showed evidence of their ability to build an agent-patient therapeutic alliance, which motivates the effort to advance ECAs as a potential solution to improve treatment adherence and consequently the health outcome. Building therapeutic alliance implies the need for a positive environment where the ECA and the patient can share their knowledge and discuss their goals, preferences and tasks towards building a shared plan, which is commonly done using explanations. However, explainable agents commonly rely on their own knowledge and goals in providing explanations, rather than the beliefs, plans or goals of the user. It is not clear whether such explanations, in individual-specific contexts such as personal health assistance, are perceived by the user as relevant in decision-making towards their own behavior change. Therefore, in this research, we are developing a user-aware explainable ECA by embedding the cognitive agent architecture with a user model, explanation engine and modified planner to implement the concept of SharedPlans.

The adults’ responses to crying involve embraces, stroking, and patting. Haptic soothing is managed by calibrating the bodily proximity and postural orientations between the participants, including haptic—embracing or face-to-face—formations that are coordinated with particular forms of talk. Haptic formations configure specific affordances for embodied participation by actualizing the availability of tactile, aural, and visual modalities. The interactional organization of soothing in an embracing formation involves: an initiation/invitation and response, submergence of two bodies into a close haptic contact, and coordinated withdrawal from haptic contact. The embracing formation temporarily suspends the requirements for the distressed person to act like a responsive listener and speaker. The caregiver uses the face-to-face formation to reestablish conditions for the child’s interactional co-presence.

1053,57d70eab93820153eefc5c6115322c8fcdfd9b72,Schizophrenia and migration: a meta-analysis and review.,"OBJECTIVE
The authors synthesize findings of previous studies implicating migration as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia and provide a quantitative index of the associated effect size.


METHOD
MEDLINE was searched for population-based incidence studies concerning migrants in English-language publications appearing between the years 1977 and 2003. Article bibliographies and an Australian database were cross-referenced. Studies were included if incidence reports provided numerators and denominators and if age correction was performed or could be performed by the authors. Relative risks for migrant groups were extracted or calculated for each study. Significant heterogeneity across studies indicated the need for a mixed-effects meta-analytic model.


RESULTS
The mean weighted relative risk for developing schizophrenia among first-generation migrants (40 effect sizes) was 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]=2.3-3.2). A separate analysis performed for second-generation migrants (seven effect sizes) yielded a relative risk of 4.5 (95% CI=1.5-13.1). An analysis performed for studies concerning both first- and second-generation migrants and studies that did not distinguish between generations (50 effect sizes) yielded a relative risk of 2.9 (95% CI=2.5-3.4). Subgroup comparisons yielded significantly greater effect sizes for migrants from developing versus developed countries (relative risk=3.3, 95% CI=2.8-3.9) and for migrants from areas where the majority of the population is black (relative risk=4.8, 95% CI=3.7-6.2) versus white and neither black nor white.


CONCLUSIONS
A personal or family history of migration is an important risk factor for schizophrenia. The differential risk pattern across subgroups suggests a role for psychosocial adversity in the etiology of schizophrenia.",2005.0,85.0,1145.0,"{'volume': '162 1', 'pages': '\n          12-24\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cantor-Graae2005SchizophreniaAM,\n author = {E.

Contra-hedonic orientation and working-memory capacity in everyday life.,"Hedonism, or wanting to feel good, is central to human motivation. At times, however, people also seek to maintain or enhance negative affect or to dampen positive affect, and this can be instrumental for the later attainment of their goals. Here, we investigate the assumption that such contra-hedonic orientation is cognitively more demanding than prohedonic orientation, above and beyond the effects of momentary affective experience. We provided 378 participants with mobile phones that they carried with them for 3 weeks while pursuing their daily routines. The phones prompted participants at least 54 times to report their current affect-regulation orientation and to work on two trials of a cognitively demanding working memory task. As expected, contra-hedonic orientation was substantially less prevalent than prohedonic orientation. It was reported in 15% of the measurement occasions. Participants who reported on average more contra-hedonic orientation showed lower average working memory performance throughout the study interval. Further, controlling for the effects of accompanying affective experiences, momentary occurrences of contra-hedonic orientation were associated with temporary declines in working memory performance within individuals, and this could neither be explained by lacking task compliance nor by other characteristics of the individual or the situation. Prohedonic orientation showed a considerably smaller association with working memory performance. These findings are consistent with the view that contra-hedonic orientation is accompanied by momentarily more diminished cognitive resources than is prohedonic orientation.",2011.0,47.0,61.0,"{'volume': '11 3', 'pages': '\n          656-665\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riediger2011IsSB,\n author = {M.

Financial risks have to be limited and managed from a bank wide portfolio perspective. Risk management requirements have to be met from an internal as well as from a regulatory point of view. Banks need to maximize their expected returns under these constraints. This leads to a generalized portfolio optimization problem under different capital restrictions. We pursue a two-step Risk-/Return Management Approach (“RRM-Approach”) [3]. At first we formulate an optimization model that maximizes the expected returns of the bank portfolio to the planning horizon under internal and regulatory loss risk limitations. The restriction on the internal economic capital is based on the risk measure of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), that has been proved to be appropriate for measuring bank wide loss risk [1]. The regulatory capital restrictions represent the actual Basle Rules of risk limitation. The optimization model of step 1 of the RRM-Approach is solved by an application of the CVaR-optimization approach by Rockafellar/Uryasev [1]. In the second step, we derive a consistent risk-/return key ratio system from the optimum portfolio of step 1. We estimate the risk and return contributions of each single asset in the portfolio and achieve additive, linear representations of the expected returns and the regulatory and internal risk contributions. The latter we obtain by an application of Euler’s Formula on CVaR [2]. We sum up the risk and return contributions of the single assets on the business line level. In this way we deduce consistent return targets and capital limits of the economic and the internal capital for each business line. These quantities represent basic planning information ensuring maximum return targets and an efficient capital allocation of the economic and the regulatory capital. The impact of the RRM-Approach is shown by a brief application example.",2000.0,49.0,5714.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '21-41', 'name': 'Journal of Risk'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rockafellar2000OptimizationOC,\n author = {R.

No interaction effects emerged among ethnic groups, but there were significant ethnic main effects for appraisal and coping. Compared with the Caucasian Americans, both Asian American groups appraised stressors as more challenging, and the Korean Americans appraised them also as greater losses. Both Asian American groups reported using more strategies of accepting responsibility, religious coping, distancing, and escape-avoidance than the Caucasian Americans did; the Filipino Americans also reported more problem-solving strategies than the Caucasian Americans. For all participants, challenge appraisals predicted adaptive coping (problem solving and positive reappraisal) and less distress. Problem solving, seeking social support, and positive reappraisal predicted less distress; self-control, accepting responsibility, and escape-avoidance predicted greater distress.

Yet in the absence of personal relationships or the expectation of direct reciprocity, help from weak ties might not be forthcoming or could be of low quality. We examined the practice of distant employees (strangers) exchanging technical advice through a large organizational computer network. A survey of advice seekers and those who replied was conducted to test hypotheses about the viability and usefulness of such electronic weak tie exchanges.Theories of organizational motivation suggest that positive regard for the larger organization can substitute for direct incentives or personal relationships in motivating people to help others. Theories of weak ties suggest that the usefulness of this help may depend on the number of ties, the diversity of ties, or the resources of help providers. We hypothesized that, in an organizational context, the firm-specific resources and organizational motivation of people who provide advice will predict the usefulness of advice.We investigated these theories in a study of employees of a global computer manufacturer. We collected survey and observational data on the relationships between information seekers and information providers; the number, diversity, resources, and motivations of information providers, and subjective ratings of the usefulness of the advice (from both parties in the exchange) and whether or not the advice solved information seekers' problems.We found that information providers gave useful advice and solved the problems of information seekers, despite their lack of a personal connection with the seekers.

Yet despite their proclaimed importance, research on their long-term effectiveness is surprisingly scarce. Furthermore, comparative research acknowledging the concepts' different theoretical roots and illuminating the differences in their long-term effectiveness is lacking. In addition, little is known about how competitive actions affect the long-term effectiveness of both concepts. This study makes a first attempt to address these research gaps and offers a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of customer satisfaction and customer–company identification in driving important customer outcomes over time. Latent growth analyses of rich longitudinal data from customers over nine measurement points spanning 43 weeks (n = 6,930) show that customer satisfaction and customer–company identification have positive initial effects on customers' loyalty and willingness to pay but differ in their ability to maintain these positive effects over time. Whereas the positive effects of customer satisfaction decrease more rapidly, the effects of customer–company identification are significantly more persistent. Analysis of the moderating effects of relative competitive advertising suggests that customer–company identification is more effective at immunizing customers against competitive actions.",2014.0,122.0,143.0,"{'volume': '78', 'pages': '102 - 78', 'name': 'Journal of Marketing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Haumann2014FootprintsIT,\n author = {Till Haumann and Benjamin Quaiser and J.

Apps, computerized therapy, and other digital tools can be effective, highly scalable treatments for anxiety and depression. Co-design processes are often used to foster engagement with end users, but this does not always lead to high levels of engagement. Objective We aimed to carry out preliminary scoping to understand adolescents’ current internet use and diversity of preferences to inform a planned co-design process for creating digital mental health tools for teenagers. Methods Interactive workshops and focus groups were held with young people. Data were analyzed using a general inductive approach. Results Participants (N=58) engaged in 2 whānau (extended family) focus groups (n=4 and n=5), 2 school- or community-based focus groups (n=9 each), and 2 workshops (n=11 and n=20). The authors identified 3 overarching themes: (1) Digital mental health tools are unlikely to be successful if they rely solely on youth help-seeking. (2) A single approach is unlikely to appeal to all. Participants had diverse, noncompatible preferences in terms of look or feel of an app or digital tool. The authors identified 4 user groups players or gamers, engagers, sceptics, and straight-talkers. These groups differed by age and degree of current mental health need and preferred gamified or fun approaches, were open to a range of approaches, were generally disinterested, or preferred direct-to-the-point, serious approaches, respectively. (3) Digital mental health tools should provide an immediate response to a range of different issues and challenges that a young person may face. Conclusions Defining the preferences of different groups of users may be important for increasing engagement with digital therapies even within specific population and mental health–need groups.

Unfortunately, few providers or patients have had access to the costly and technical equipment previously required. Recent technological advances in the form of consumer Virtual Reality (VR) systems (e.g. Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear), however, now make widespread use of VRET in clinical settings and as self-help applications possible. In this literature review, we detail the current state of VR technology and discuss important therapeutic considerations in designing self-help and clinician-led VRETs, such as platform choice, exposure progression design, inhibitory learning strategies, stimuli tailoring, gamification, virtual social learning and more. We illustrate how these therapeutic components can be incorporated and utilized in VRET applications, taking full advantage of the unique capabilities of virtual environments, and showcase some of these features by describing the development of a consumer-ready, gamified self-help VRET application for low-cost commercially available VR hardware. We also raise and discuss challenges in the planning, development, evaluation, and dissemination of VRET applications, including the need for more high-quality research. We conclude by discussing how new technology (e.g. eye-tracking) can be incorporated into future VRETs and how widespread use of VRET self-help applications will enable collection of naturalistic “Big Data” that promises to inform learning theory and behavioral therapy in general.",2017.0,60.0,122.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '404 - 420', 'name': 'Cognitive Behaviour Therapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lindner2017CreatingSO,\n author = {P.

For example, the context can represent the mental view of the world that an expert agent has formed through past interactions with this world. We assume that this context is not accessible to a learner agent who can only observe the expert data. Then, our goal is to use the context-aware expert data to learn an optimal context-unaware policy for the learner using only a few new data samples. Such problems are typically solved using imitation learning that assumes that both the expert and learner agents have access to the same information. However, if the learner does not know the expert context, using the expert data alone will result in a biased learner policy and will require many new data samples to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, we formulate the learning problem as a causal bound-constrained Multi-Armed-Bandit (MAB) problem. The arms of this MAB correspond to a set of basis policy functions that can be initialized in an unsupervised way using the expert data and represent the different expert behaviors affected by the unobserved context. On the other hand, the MAB constraints correspond to causal bounds on the accumulated rewards of these basis policy functions that we also compute from the expert data. The solution to this MAB allows the learner agent to select the best basis policy and improve it online. And the use of causal bounds reduces the exploration variance and, therefore, improves the learning rate. We provide numerical experiments on an autonomous driving example that show that our proposed transfer RL method improves the learner's policy faster compared to existing imitation learning methods and enjoys much lower variance during training.",2021.0,28.0,4.0,{'pages': '791-802'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Liu2021LearningWK,\n author = {Chenyu Liu and Yan Zhang and Yi Shen and M.

1077,5a518c21ad9efb79318c7eb0530d8baa7f64dd44,Virtual reality therapy: an effective treatment for psychological disorders.,"Behavioral therapy techniques for treating phobias often includes graded exposure of the patient to anxiety-producing stimuli (Systematic Desensitization). However, in utilizing systematic desensitization, research reviews demonstrate that many patients appear to have difficulty imaging the prescribed anxiety-evoking scene. They also express strong aversion to experiencing real situations. This chapter describes the Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT), a new therapeutical approach that can be used to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in the traditional treatment of phobias. VRT, like current imaginal and in vivo modalities, can generate stimuli that could be utilized in desensitization therapy. Like systematic desensitization therapy, VRT can provide stimuli for patients who have difficulty in imagining scenes and/or are too phobic to experience real situations. Unlike in vivo systematic desensitization, VRT can be performed within the privacy of a room, thus avoiding public embarrassment and violation of patient confidentiality. VRT can generate stimuli of much greater magnitude than standard in vivo techniques. Since VRT is under patient control, it appears safer than in vivo desensitization and at the same time more realistic than imaginal desensitization. Finally, VRT adds the advantage of greater efficiency and economy in delivering the equivalent of in vivo systematic desensitization within the therapist's office. The chapter also describes how to use virtual reality in the treatment of specific phobias: fear of flying, fear of heights, fear of being in certain situations (such as a dark barn, an enclosed bridge over a river, and in the presence of an animal [a black cat] in a dark room), and fear of public speaking.",1997.0,26.0,125.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '\n          59-70\n        ', 'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{North1997VirtualRT,\n author = {M.

Study 1 reports the development of scale items.

We investigate children's (age 1 - 5) transitions to and from screen-based activities to understand the boundaries families have set and their experiences living within them. We report on interviews with 27 parents and a diary study with a separate 28 families examining these transitions. These families turn on screens primarily to facilitate parents' independent activities. Parents feel this is appropriate but self-audit and express hesitation, as they feel they are benefiting from an activity that can be detrimental to their child's well-being. We found that families turn off screens when parents are ready to give their child their full attention and technology presents a natural stopping point. Transitioning away from screens is often painful, and predictive factors determine the pain of a transition. Technology-mediated transitions are significantly more successful than parent-mediated transitions, suggesting that the design community has the power to make this experience better for parents and children by creating technologies that facilitate boundary-setting and respect families' self-defined limits.",2016.0,57.0,99.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Hiniker2016ScreenTT,\n author = {Alexis Hiniker and Hye-Ji Suh and Sabina Cao and J.

Our new identification strategy combines two steps -- first, deriving bounds over the arm's distribution based on structural knowledge; second, incorporating these bounds in a novel bandit algorithm, B-kl-UCB.

Emotion regulation refers to processes influencing emotion, experiences, and expresses. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the role of emotion regulation to predict depressive symptoms among Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences students. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 305 students at Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Iran, who were randomly selected by convenient sampling method. The informed consent forms were signed by the participants. Then the Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II) and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Scale (CERQ-18) were completed in a virtual/face-to-face manner due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were analyzed with SPSS software version 26. A total of 296 participants were analyzed, of whom 198 (66.9%) were female, and 98 (33.1%) were male. Results: The self-blame strategies (β = 0.31, P ≤ 0.001), positive reassessment (β = -0.26, P ≤ 0.001), catastrophic (β = 0.26, P ≤ 0.001), numerical importance (β = -0.12, P ≤ 0.001) and positive refocus (β = -0.10, P ≤ 0.001) predict 40% of the variance of depression in five steps. Inconsistent strategies such as self-blame and catastrophe directly predict depression. Further, depression is inversely related to positive reassessment, insignificance, and positive refocus. Conclusions: According to the results, there was a significant direct relationship between self-blame and catastrophic thinking as maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies with depression. In addition, positive refocusing and positive reassessment had a significant negative correlation with depression among adaptive emotion regulation strategies.",2022.0,20.0,0.0,{'name': 'Journal of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Darvishi2022TheEO,\n author = {Niloufar Darvishi and M.

1096,5c15d6234ac87e69a1cf42c3eba92f566ee4ce30,Effectiveness and Safety of Using Chatbots to Improve Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background The global shortage of mental health workers has prompted the utilization of technological advancements, such as chatbots, to meet the needs of people with mental health conditions. Chatbots are systems that are able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual language. While numerous studies have assessed the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots in mental health, no reviews have pooled the results of those studies. Objective This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots to improve mental health through summarizing and pooling the results of previous studies. Methods A systematic review was carried out to achieve this objective. The search sources were 7 bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO), the search engine “Google Scholar,” and backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using narrative and statistical methods, as appropriate. Results Of 1048 citations retrieved, we identified 12 studies examining the effect of using chatbots on 8 outcomes. Weak evidence demonstrated that chatbots were effective in improving depression, distress, stress, and acrophobia. In contrast, according to similar evidence, there was no statistically significant effect of using chatbots on subjective psychological wellbeing. Results were conflicting regarding the effect of chatbots on the severity of anxiety and positive and negative affect. Only two studies assessed the safety of chatbots and concluded that they are safe in mental health, as no adverse events or harms were reported. Conclusions Chatbots have the potential to improve mental health. However, the evidence in this review was not sufficient to definitely conclude this due to lack of evidence that their effect is clinically important, a lack of studies assessing each outcome, high risk of bias in those studies, and conflicting results for some outcomes. Further studies are required to draw solid conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of chatbots.

Students were taught that they could modify their emotions, get better at modifying their emotions with practice, and use strategies to improve their well-being. One month later, we found that students assigned to the intervention condition (compared to an active control condition) reported more adaptive theories of emotion and greater emotional well-being in school, although well-being outside of school was unchanged.

Twenty healthy participants (10 males) underwent fMRI while regulating their own or another person's emotions. Intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulation tasks recruited an overlapping network of brain regions including bilateral lateral frontal cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, and left temporo-parietal junction. Activations unique to the interpersonal condition suggest that both affective (emotional simulation) and cognitive (mentalizing) aspects of empathy may be involved in the process of interpersonal emotion regulation.

Through use of the backward-masking technique, the subjects were prevented from consciously perceiving 30-ms exposures of happy, neutral, and angry target faces, which immediately were followed and masked by neutral faces. Despite the fact that exposure to happy and angry faces was unconscious, the subjects reacted with distinct facial muscle reactions that corresponded to the happy and angry stimulus faces.

Self-Attachment is an alternative form of therapy intended to assist individuals so they can regulate their emotional state through developing and maintaining a bond with their childhood self. In this project, we create a chatbot to suggest Self-Attachment protocols based on a user’s emotion and description of recent events leading to that emotion. The chatbot will assist in the scaling of the delivery of Self-Attachment protocols. We utilise a rule-based model within this chatbot to determine which suggestions should be presented to users and ensure that dialogue presented to users is safe and fully controllable to avoid the possibility of harming the user through potentially harmful dialogue being presented by the model. We discuss a trial of the chatbot we performed with 9 participants from the non-clinical population with prior knowledge of Self-Attachment protocols, which shows the chatbot can provide suitable suggestions for Self-Attachment protocols.

However, current findings are lacking as to whether the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and cortical regions are involved in the learning effect when subjects retrieve associative memory, and whether their activations differentially change over time due to learning experience. To address these issues, we designed an fMRI experiment in which face-scene pairs were learned once (L1) or six times (L6). Subjects learned the pairs at four retention intervals, 30-min, 1-day, 1-week and 1-month, after which they finished an associative recognition task in the scanner. The results showed that compared to learning once, learning six times led to stronger activation in the hippocampus, but weaker activation in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as well as anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC). In addition, the hippocampal activation was positively correlated with that of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and negatively correlated with that of the vLPFC when the L6 group was compared to the L1 group. The hippocampal activation decreased over time after L1 but remained stable after L6.

Presence is often defined as the sense of being there in a VE. There has been much debate about the best way to measure presence, and presence researchers need, and have sought, a measure that is reliable, valid, sensitive, and objective.We hypothesized that to the degree that a VE seems real, it would evoke physiological responses similar to those evoked by the corresponding real environment, and that greater presence would evoke a greater response. To examine this, we conducted three experiments, the results of which support the use of physiological reaction as a reliable, valid, sensitive, and objective presence measure. The experiments compared participants' physiological reactions to a non-threatening virtual room and their reactions to a stressful virtual height situation. We found that change in heart rate satisfied our requirements for a measure of presence, change in skin conductance did to a lesser extent, and that change in skin temperature did not. Moreover, the results showed that inclusion of a passive haptic element in the VE significantly increased presence and that for presence evoked: 30FPS > 20FPS > 15FPS.",2002.0,31.0,629.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 29th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Meehan2002PhysiologicalMO,\n author = {M.

1115,5e5a095ab60d6fe2f37eb44c1fc9ded5fe70c239,Digital Interventions for Emotion Regulation in Children and Early Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (Preprint),"
 BACKGROUND
 Difficulties in emotion regulation are common in adolescence and associated with poor social and mental health outcomes. However, psychological therapies that promote adaptive emotion regulation may be inaccessible and unattractive to youth. Digital interventions may help address this need.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 In this systematic review and meta-analysis, evidence on the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of emotion regulation digital interventions in children and early adolescents aged 8-14 years was synthesised.
 
 
 METHODS
 Systematic searches of Web of Science, Medline, PsychINFO, EMBASE, Education Resources Information Centre, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore up to July 2020 identified 39 studies, 11 of which were included in the meta-analyses. A bespoke tool was used to assess risk of bias across the diverse methodologies in the included studies.
 
 
 RESULTS
 Studies evaluated digital games (n = 27), biofeedback (n = 4), virtual/augmented reality (n = 4) and programme/multimedia (n = 4) digital interventions in diagnosed, at-risk, healthy and universal samples. The most consistent evidence came from digital games, which reduced negative emotional experience with a small significant effect, largely in youth at-risk of anxiety (g = -0.19, [-0.34, -0.04]). In general, digital interventions tended to improve emotion regulation, but this effect was not significant (g = 0.19, [-0.16, 0.54]). Most feasibility issues were identified in diagnosed youth and acceptability was generally high across intervention types/samples.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 Although there is cause to be optimistic about digital interventions supporting the difficulties youth experience in emotion regulation, the predominance of early stage development studies highlights the need for more work in this area.

To date, evidence regarding the effectiveness of online communities as a marketing tool has been primarily anecdotal. Yet, industry practice suggests that online communities add value in several ways by: 1) building brand awareness and image, 2) providing access to the voice of loyal customers, 3) increasing supplier commitment, and 4) generating revenue from new and existing customers. Relying on social identity theory and reciprocal action theory, we develop a framework that explores the process of how a firm's online community enhances consumers' brand commitment. We empirically examine how online communities influence brand commitment and subsequent customer behaviour in a field study of over 1,500 members of an existing online community for herbal products. In our analysis, we confirm that online community commitment is a key influence on brand commitment. We also find that online community participants possess stronger brand commitment than consumers who are not members of the community. Finally, our results reveal that among online community members, brand commitment is enhanced for both active brand users and non-users of the targeted brand.",2008.0,56.0,315.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '409 - 431', 'name': 'Journal of Marketing Management'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kim2008ItTA,\n author = {J.

Self-efficacy is a construct that can measure the likelihood preventive behaviors will be performed, and thus could be applied to identify specific areas where AIDS education should be augmented. In this study, pregnant, mostly black, teens (N = 58) attending an alternative school in a large, midwestern city completed a self-efficacy scale to identify self-perceived areas of vulnerability to participating in preventive behaviors and avoiding high-risk behaviors concerning AIDS. The AIDS Self-efficacy Scale identified four areas of greatest vulnerability: using condoms, discussing previous homosexual activity, discussing previous bisexual activity, and telling a partner about an experience with a bisexual. The last three situations result from an inability to discuss a partner's past sexual history, indicating a need to be very specific in these areas. School health interventions should recognize and deal with issues sexually active teens have identified as most difficult, particularly specific aspects of sexual histories, and provide these adolescents with prevention skills necessary to reduce high-risk behaviors.",1990.0,11.0,50.0,"{'volume': '60 1', 'pages': '\n          19-24\n        ', 'name': 'The Journal of school health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lawrance1990SelfefficacyAA,\n author = {L.

If effective, this would be a valuable tool for the monitoring of personal QoE during video streaming services without asking the user to provide feedback, with great advantages for service management. Additionally, this would eliminate the bias of subjective tests and would avoid bothering the viewers with questions to collect opinions and feedback. The performed analysis relies on two different experiments: i) a crowdsourcing test, where the videos are subject to impairments caused by long initial delays and re-buffering events; ii) a laboratory test, where the videos are affected by blurring effects. The facial Action Units (AU) that represent the contractions of specific facial muscles together with the position of the eyes’ pupils are extracted to identify the correlation between perceived quality and facial expressions. An SVM with a quadratic kernel and a k-NN classifier have been tested to predict the QoE from these features. These have also been combined with measured application-level parameters to improve the quality prediction. From the performed experiments, it results that the best performance is obtained with the k-NN classifier by combining all the described features and after training it with both the datasets, with a prediction accuracy as high as 93.9% outperforming the state of the art achievements.",2020.0,63.0,14.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '2702-2716', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Porcu2020EstimationOT,\n author = {Simone Porcu and Alessandro Floris and Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons and L.

On the other hand, this monitoring and analysis should be as unobtrusive as possible, since in our era the digital world has been smoothly adopted in everyday life activities. In this framework and within the domain of assessing humans’ affective state during their educational training, the most popular way to go is to use sensory equipment that would allow their observing without involving any kind of direct contact. Thus, in this work, we focus on human emotion recognition from audio stimuli (i.e., human speech) using a novel approach based on a computer vision inspired methodology, namely the bag-of-visual words method, applied on several audio segment spectrograms. The latter are considered to be the visual representation of the considered audio segment and may be analyzed by exploiting well-known traditional computer vision techniques, such as construction of a visual vocabulary, extraction of speeded-up robust features (SURF) features, quantization into a set of visual words, and image histogram construction. As a last step, support vector machines (SVM) classifiers are trained based on the aforementioned information.

The majority of studies on emotional intelligence have relied on self-ratings. In spite of the critics of self-report scales, there are a large number of self-report measures of EI present in recent literature. The main aim of this paper is to present the constructing procedure, together with the basic psychometric properties of Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire (ESCQ) as a self-report measure of EI. Originally, this measure was developed in Croatian settings, using the theoretical framework from the Mayer-Salovey emotional intelligence model. The ESCQ instrument has been translated into several languages. The results have showed that ESCQ has three subscales with decent reliability.

Little research, however, has explored cross-cultural differences in emotion regulation in everyday interactions. Using a daily social interaction method, we examined whether people from collectivistic backgrounds (Chinese exchange students and immigrants from the Moluccas, Indonesia) living in the Netherlands differed from those from individualistic backgrounds (Dutch natives) in emotion suppression during everyday interactions. We also examined whether this depended on their relationship with the interaction partner(s). We found that Chinese participants suppressed positive and negative emotions more than Dutch and Moluccan participants and that this was related to differences in interdependent and independent self-construal across the samples. We also found that Chinese participants suppressed positive emotions less in interactions with close others, whereas Dutch participants suppressed negative emotions more with non-close others. No such differences were found for Moluccans. Our findings support the idea that people from collectivistic cultures suppress emotions more than those from individualistic cultures, but they also suggest that this depends on who the interaction partner is. Furthermore, they suggest that emotion suppression may change when people with collectivistic backgrounds have been raised in individualistic cultures.",2018.0,15.0,19.0,"{'volume': '53', 'pages': '176–183', 'name': 'International Journal of Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huwaë2018CrossculturalDI,\n author = {Sylvia Huwaë and J.

Stress is linked to both the causes and consequences of NCDs and it has been shown that biofeedback-based breathing trainings (BBTs) are effective in coping with stress. Here, diaphragmatic breathing, i.e. deep abdominal breathing, belongs to the most distinguished breathing techniques. However, high costs and low scalability of state-of-the-art BBTs that require expensive medical hardware and health professionals, represent a significant barrier for their widespread adoption. Health information technology has the potential to address this important practical problem. Particularly, it has been shown that a smartphone microphone has the ability to record audio signals from exhalation in a quality that can be compared to professional respiratory devices. As this finding is highly relevant for low-cost and scalable smartphone-based BBTs (SBBT) and – to the best of our knowledge - because it has not been investigated so far, we aim to design and evaluate the efficacy of such a SBBT. As a very first step, we apply design-science research and investigate in this research-in-progress the relationship of diaphragmatic breathing and its acoustic components by just using a smartphone’s microphone. For that purpose, we review related work and develop our hypotheses based on justificatory knowledge from physiology, physics and acoustics.

Lesion and neuroimaging studies concur with the importance of these regions for attachment and the experience of affiliation in humans as well. Yet it remains obscure whether the neural bases of affiliative experiences can be differentiated from the emotional valence with which they are inextricably associated at the experiential level. Here we show, using functional MRI, that kinship-related social scenarios evocative of affiliative emotion induce septal–preoptic–anterior hypothalamic activity that cannot be explained by positive or negative emotional valence alone. Our findings suggest that a phylogenetically conserved ensemble of basal forebrain structures, especially the septohypothalamic area, may play a key role in enabling human affiliative emotion.

The children I will present all have in common a fundamental disturbance which manifests itself in their physical appearance, expressive functions and, indeed, their whole behaviour. This disturbance results in severe and characteristic difficulties of social integration. In many cases the social problems are so profound that they overshadow everything else. In some cases, however, the problems are compensated by a high level of original thought and experience. This can often lead to exceptional achievements in later life. With the type of personality disorder presented here we can demonstrate the truth of the claim that exceptional human beings must be given exceptional educational treatment, treatment which takes account of their special difficulties. Further, we can show that despite abnormality human beings can fulfil their social role within the community, especially if they find understanding, love and guidance. There are many reasons for describing in detail this type of abnormally developing child. Not the least of them is that these children raise questions of central importance to psychology and education. Name and Concept I have chosen the label autism in an effort to define the basic disorder that generates the abnormal personality structure of the children we are concerned with here.

Epidemiological studies indicate that experimentation with addictive drugs and onset of addictive disorders is primarily concentrated in adolescence and young adulthood. The authors describe basic and clinical data supporting adolescent neurodevelopment as a biologically critical period of greater vulnerability for experimentation with substances and acquisition of substance use disorders.


METHOD
The authors reviewed recent literature regarding neurocircuitry underlying motivation, impulsivity, and addiction, with a focus on studies investigating adolescent neurodevelopment.


RESULTS
Adolescent neurodevelopment occurs in brain regions associated with motivation, impulsivity, and addiction. Adolescent impulsivity and/or novelty seeking as a transitional trait behavior can be explained in part by maturational changes in frontal cortical and subcortical monoaminergic systems. These developmental processes may advantageously promote learning drives for adaptation to adult roles but may also confer greater vulnerability to the addictive actions of drugs.

An exploration of developmental changes in neurocircuitry involved in impulse control has significant implications for understanding adolescent behavior, addiction vulnerability, and the prevention of addiction in adolescence and adulthood.",2003.0,140.0,1562.0,"{'volume': '160 6', 'pages': '\n          1041-52\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chambers2003DevelopmentalNO,\n author = {R.

Based on an a priori theoretical model, we hypothesized that negative cognition and depressed mood play a direct causal role in maintaining paranoia in people with psychosis and that the effect of mood is mediated by negative cognition. We used data from the 301 patients in the Prevention of Relapse in Psychosis Trial of cognitive behavior therapy. They were recruited from consecutive Community Mental Health Team clients presenting with a recent relapse of psychosis. The teams were located in inner and outer London and the rural county of Norfolk, England. The study followed a longitudinal cohort design, with initial measures repeated at 3 and 12 months. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the direction of effect between negative cognition, depressed mood, and paranoia. Overall fit was ambiguous in some analyses and confounding by unidentified variables cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the most plausible models were those incorporating pathways from negative cognition and depressed mood to paranoid symptoms: There was no evidence whatsoever for pathways in the reverse direction. The link between depressed mood and paranoia appeared to be mediated by negative cognition. Our hypotheses were thus corroborated.

Sensory information is delivered through a head-mounted display and specialized interface devices. These devices track head movements so that the movements and images change in a natural way with head motion, allowing for a sense of immersion. VR, which allows for controlled delivery of sensory stimulation via the therapist, is a convenient and cost-effective treatment. This review focuses on the available literature regarding the effectiveness of incorporating VR within the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, with particular attention to exposure-based intervention for anxiety disorders. A systematic literature search was conducted in order to identify studies implementing VR-based treatment for anxiety or other psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the history of the development of VR-based technology and its use within psychiatric treatment, the empirical evidence for VR-based treatment, and the benefits for using VR for psychiatric research and treatment.

Methods We selected the 10 apps from the Apple iTunes store and the US Android Google Play store on 20 July 2018 from six disease states: depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction, diabetes and hypertension. Each app was downloaded by two authors who provided information on the apps’ attributes, functionality, interventions, popularity, scientific backing and WHO app classification rating. Results A total of 120 apps were examined. Although none of these apps had Food and Drug Administration marketing approval, nearly 50% made claims that appeared medical. Most apps offered a similar type of services with 87.5% assigned WHO classification 1.4.2 ‘self-monitoring of health or diagnostic data by a client’ or 1.6.1 ‘client look-up of health information’. The ‘last updated’ attribute was highly correlated with a quality rating of the app although no apps features (eg, uses Global Positioning System, reminders and so on) were. Conclusion Due to the heterogeneity of the apps, we were unable to define a core set of features that would accurately assess app quality. The number of apps making unsupported claims combined with the number of apps offering questionable content warrants a cautious approach by both patients and clinicians in selecting safe and effective ones.

Discussion is organized around processes of reward and memory formation that occur during approach and consummatory phases of affiliation. Appetitive and consummatory reward processes are mediated independently by the activity of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA)-nucleus accumbens shell (NAS) pathway and the central corticolimbic projections of the u-opiate system of the medial basal arcuate nucleus, respectively, although these two projection systems functionally interact across time. We next explicate the manner in which DA and glutamate interact in both the VTA and NAS to form incentive-encoded contextual memory ensembles that are predictive of reward derived from affiliative objects. Affiliative stimuli, in particular, are incorporated within contextual ensembles predictive of affiliative reward via: (a) the binding of affiliative stimuli in the rostral circuit of the medial extended amygdala and subsequent transmission to the NAS shell; (b) affiliative stimulus-induced opiate potentiation of DA processes in the VTA and NAS; and (c) permissive or facilitatory effects of gonadal steroids, oxytocin (in interaction with DA), and vasopressin on (i) sensory, perceptual, and attentional processing of affiliative stimuli and (ii) formation of social memories. Among these various processes, we propose that the capacity to experience affiliative reward via opiate functioning has a disproportionate weight in determining individual differences in affiliation. We delineate sources of these individual differences, and provide the first human data that support an association between opiate functioning and variation in trait affiliation.",2005.0,766.0,814.0,"{'volume': '28 3', 'pages': '\n          313-50; discussion 350-95\n        ', 'name': 'The Behavioral and brain sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Depue2005ANM,\n author = {R.

1160,632afe17608c32e8318ba8c1a2e42b617671012d,Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth,"Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth Background: In the last ten years, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has seen a rise in research on how features of interactive technologies can be designed to enhance emotion regulation training [1]–a response in part due to the increase of mental health issues. Youth are a vulnerable population at risk for mental health issues with long wait times to get help [2]. Emotion regulation, the ability to modulate the intensity and duration of emotional states, has been explored as a trans-diagnostic intervention to improve mental health [3]. Youth aged 12-15 use less adaptive or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., suppression) that can contribute to depression or anxiety disorders. Thus, training adaptive emotion regulation skills is crucial for this age group [4]. One of the most effective emotion regulation strategies for youth is cognitive reappraisal–changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact [5]. However, learning is difficult because it requires: (1) generation of meaningful emotionally laden social situations; (2) real-time feedback of internal psychological and physiological states; and (3) practice modifying the interpretation of multiple situations [6]. Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated 3D environment that allows the user to experience a simulated world through stereoscopic 360 visuals, stereo audio, and 3D interaction with tracking sensors. The affordances of VR have been shown to strongly affect human emotional responses and interpretations of social situations when used in other intervention contexts [7]. As such, VR may provide unique opportunities for cognitive reappraisal skills development through three mechanisms: Mechanism #1: virtual environment–a simulated world that evokes the visceral experience of a realistic emotional response; Mechanism #2: interaction & feedback–possibilities to control and modify emotionally evocative aspects of the virtual environment; Mechanism #3: taking multiple perspectives–the ability to put the user in another’s shoes. As an example, you put on a VR headset and find yourself walking down the halls on the first day of high school; there are lots of new faces and you hope to make a good first impression (Mech #1). You hear the sound of your heart beating and your breathing getting heavier and uneven, and other kids laughing–are they laughing at you (Mech #2)? Luckily, you have a super power that allows you to embody other peoples’ perspectives (Mech #3). You take the VR controller, point it at the older kid who was laughing, and teleport into their virtual body (Mech #2). Suddenly, you can see yourself from their perspective and hear their thoughts–“look at all these new kids. I remember my first day I tripped down the stairs and broke a tooth. So embarrassing!” (Mech #3). You teleport back to your body and hear your heart rate drop to indicate that you have regulated the anxiety response (Mech #2). They weren’t laughing at you, but empathizing with your experience. Seeing and understanding this new perspective is cognitively reappraising the event. In this scenario, VR offers youth a way to practice cognitive reappraisal in a safe, meaningful, and emotionally laden environment with real-time feedback; thus meeting the reappraisal requirements (1-3) listed above, which are normally difficult to meet. Objectives & Research Questions: There is a rise in VR’s accessibility and popularity among youth (e.g., Oculus Quest 2 VR headset does not require a computer, costs $400 CAD, and has sold over 5 million units). My expertise in technology development of VR systems and content, design for mental health, and field evaluation skills make me well positioned to take this unique opportunity to investigate the overarching research question: can the above three VR mechanisms (Mechanisms #1-3) address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development in youth aged 12-15? Methodology: I will conduct research that investigates the following research questions that derive from my objectives above: (1) Requirements: What are the minimum technical and design requirements for a VR platform to help youth learn and practice emotion regulation? (2) Usability: What are the system and interface usability factors that youth suggest for the VR prototypes? (3) Feasibility: What is the feasibility of using VR’s three mechanisms to address the three learning requirements of cognitive reappraisal skill development during a six-week deployment with youth in their homes? (4) Efficacy: What are the subjective indicators of effects on cognitive reappraisal skills development (whether positive or negative) reported by youth? I will answer these research questions in three phases.",2022.0,9.0,0.0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2212.00002'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kitson2022InvestigatingTF,\n author = {Alexandra Kitson},\n booktitle = {arXiv.org},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation with Youth},\n volume = {abs/2212.00002},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '11189596', 'name': 'Alexandra Kitson'}]"

Using Monte Carlo simulation, we compared the performance of 2 methods for meta‐regression with dependent effect sizes—robust variance estimation (RVE) and 3‐level modeling—with the standard meta‐analytic method for independent effect sizes. We further compared bias‐reduced linearization and jackknife estimators as small‐sample adjustments for RVE and Wald‐type and likelihood ratio tests for 3‐level models. The bias in the slope estimates, width of the confidence intervals around those estimates, and empirical type I error and statistical power rates of the hypothesis tests from these different methods were compared for mixed‐effects meta‐regression analysis with one moderator either at the study or at the effect size level. All methods yielded nearly unbiased slope estimates under most scenarios, but as expected, the standard method ignoring dependency provided inflated type I error rates when testing the significance of the moderators. Robust variance estimation methods yielded not only the best results in terms of type I error rate but also the widest confidence intervals and the lowest power rates, especially when using the jackknife adjustments. Three‐level models showed a promising performance with a moderate to large number of studies, especially with the likelihood ratio test, and yielded narrower confidence intervals around the slope and higher power rates than those obtained with the RVE approach. All methods performed better when the moderator was at the effect size level, the number of studies was moderate to large, and the between‐studies variance was small.

RESULTS
Relative to children in the wait-list group, program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention, as indicated by parent-report measures. Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention, whereas control participants were not. However, there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures. Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention.

However, the history of VR technology is longer than it may seem: the concept of VR was formulated in the 1960s and the first commercial VR tools appeared in the late 1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of researchers explored the processes, effects, and applications of this technology producing 1000s of scientific papers. What is the outcome of this significant research work? This paper wants to provide an answer to this question by exploring, using advanced scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the field. We collected all the existent articles about VR in the Web of Science Core Collection scientific database, and the resultant dataset contained 21,667 records for VR and 9,944 for augmented reality (AR). The bibliographic record contained various fields, such as author, title, abstract, country, and all the references (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster analysis of the literature showed a composite panorama characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed, whether until 5 years ago, the main publication media on VR concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently journals constitute the main medium of communication. Similarly, if at first computer science was the leading research field, nowadays clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of countries involved in VR research. The present work discusses the evolution and changes over the time of the use of VR in the main areas of application with an emphasis on the future expected VR’s capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the disruptive contribution that VR/AR/MRITF will be able to get in scientific fields, as well in human communication and interaction, as already happened with the advent of mobile phones by increasing the use and the development of scientific applications (e.g., in clinical areas) and by modifying the social communication and interaction among people.",2018.0,108.0,506.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cipresso2018ThePP,\n author = {P.

1169,63e41e37edfb092ae223bb17aa0b94eb34cbaabc,Beyond Bipolar Conceptualizations and Measures: The Case of Attitudes and Evaluative Space,"All organisms must be capable of differentiating hostile from hospitable stimuli to survive. Typically, this evaluative discrimination is conceptualized as being bipolar (hostile-hospitable). This conceptualization is certainly evident in the area of attitudes, where the ubiquitous bipolar attitude measure, by gauging the net affective predisposition toward a stimulus, treats positive and negative evaluative processes as equivalent, reciprocally activated, and interchangeable. Contrary to conceptualizations of this evaluative process as bipolar, recent evidence suggests that distinguishable motivational systems underlie assessments of the positive and negative significance of a stimulus. Thus, a stimulus may vary in terms of the strength of positive evaluative activation and the strength of negative evaluative activation it evokes. Low activation of positive and negative evaluative processes by a stimulus reflects attitude neutrality or indifference, whereas high activation of positive and negative evaluative processes reflects attitude ambivalence. As such, attitudes can be represented more completely within a bivariate space than along a bipolar continuum. Evidence is reviewed showing that the positive and negative evaluative processes underlying many attitudes are distinguishable (stochastically and functionally independent), are characterized by distinct activation functions (positivity offset and negativity bias principles), are related differentially to attitude ambivalence (corollary of ambivalence asymmetries), have distinguishable antecedents (heteroscedacity principle), and tend to gravitate from a bivariate toward a bipolar structure when the underlying beliefs are the target of deliberation or a guide for behavior (principle of motivational certainty).

For a sample of 214 ethnically diverse adolescents, this research used direct observation to investigate the frequency, content, and timing of texting with parents, peers, and romantic partners through grades 9-12. Analyses showed that texting frequency follows a curvilinear trajectory, peaking in eleventh grade. Adolescents discussed a range of topics, predominantly with peers. Communication with parents was less frequent, but consistent over time. Approximately 45-65% of adolescents communicated with romantic partners, texting heavily and about topics similar to those discussed with peers. Texting may help adolescents navigate key developmental challenges of adolescence-the establishment of autonomy, intimate peer relationships, romantic relationships, and self-identity.",2019.0,102.0,25.0,{'name': 'Journal of research on adolescence : the official journal of the Society for Research on Adolescence'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Ehrenreich2019HowAU,\n author = {Samuel E.

The evaluation includes both, a subject-matter expert interview and an experiment with 71 participants. In the experiment, we compared our novel stress management training to a stress management training using stress diaries. The results indicate that our social agent-based stress management training using biofeedback significantly decreased the self-assessed stress levels immediately after the training, as well as in a socially stressful task. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between stress level and the assessment of one’s performance in a socially stressful task. Participants that received our training assessed their performance higher than participants getting stress diaries.

However, studies have indicated a resilience-strengthening role for stressors. Objectives: This paper introduces a unifying model, including five testable hypotheses regarding how resilience can be strengthened progressively via exposure to life-stressors. Methods: We review and synthesize relevant scholarship that underpins the Systematic Self-Reflection model of resilience-strengthening. Results: The model highlights the importance of a specific meta-cognitive skill (self-reflection on one’s initial stressor response) as a mechanism for strengthening resilience. The Systematic Self-Reflection model uniquely proposes five self-reflective practices critical in the on-going adaptation of three resilient capacities: (1) coping resources, (2) usage of coping and emotional regulatory repertoire, and (3) resilient beliefs. The self-reflective process is proposed to strengthen a person’s resilience by developing insight into their already-present capacities, the limitations of these capacities, and by stimulating the search for person-driven alternative approaches. Conclusion: This model extends the existing scholarship by proposing how the experience of stressors and adversity may have resilience-strengthening opportunities. The implication of this model is that engaging with stressors can have positive consequences for longer-term healthy emotional development if scaffolded in adaptive reflective practices.",2018.0,80.0,94.0,"{'volume': '32', 'pages': '1 - 17', 'name': 'Anxiety, Stress, & Coping'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Crane2018HowRI,\n author = {M.

1178,65060bf7cbd709d68613019b36778635d1820d89,Predicting psychosis: meta-analysis of transition outcomes in individuals at high clinical risk.,"CONTEXT
A substantial proportion of people at clinical high risk of psychosis will develop a psychotic disorder over time. However, the risk of transition to psychosis varies between centers, and some recent work suggests that the risk of transition may be declining.


OBJECTIVE
To quantitatively examine the literature to date reporting the transition risk to psychosis in subjects at clinical high risk.


DATA SOURCES
The electronic databases were searched until January 2011. All studies reporting transition risks in patients at clinical high risk were retrieved.


STUDY SELECTION
Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 2502 patients.


DATA EXTRACTION
Transition risks, as well as demographic, clinical, and methodologic variables, were extracted from each publication or obtained directly from its authors.


DATA SYNTHESIS
There was a consistent transition risk, independent of the psychometric instruments used, of 18% after 6 months of follow-up, 22% after 1 year, 29% after 2 years, and 36% after 3 years. Significant moderators accounting for heterogeneity across studies and influencing the transition risks were the age of participants, publication year, treatments received, and diagnostic criteria used. There was no publication bias, and a sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the core findings.


CONCLUSIONS
The state of clinical high risk is associated with a very high risk of developing psychosis within the first 3 years of clinical presentation, and the risk progressively increases across this period. The transition risk varies with the age of the patient, the nature of the treatment provided, and the way the syndrome and transition to psychosis are defined.",2012.0,90.0,788.0,"{'volume': '69 3', 'pages': '\n          220-9\n        ', 'name': 'Archives of general psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fusar-Poli2012PredictingPM,\n author = {P.

However, qualitative research approaches to investigate the phenomenon are rarely used. We employed content analysis to investigate disturbances of time experience in Major Depressive Disorder. Our analysis from 25 participants showed that individuals with Major Depressive Disorder subjectively seem to have lost the ability to influence or change the present, resulting in an impersonal and blocked future. The present is rendered meaningless, the past unchangeably negative, and the passage of time turned into a dragging, inexorable, and viscous continuance. The overall,—possibly intersubjective—concept of time experience, remains largely intact, causing or adding to depressive mood and suffering.

Capturing and diagnosing arrhythmias and conduction system disease may lead to a change in diagnosis, clinical management and patient outcomes. Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitors and event recorders have served as useful diagnostic tools over the last few decades. However, their shortcomings are only recently being addressed by emerging technologies. With advances in device miniaturization and wireless technologies, and changing consumer expectations, wearable “on-body” ECG patch devices have evolved to meet contemporary needs. These devices are unobtrusive and easy to use, leading to increased device wear time and diagnostic yield.

The aim of this study was to determine the psychological predictors of resilience in parents of insulin-dependent children and adolescents. Methods: This was a descriptive correlational study performed in 2016. One hundred and thirteen parents of children and adolescents with diabetes who referred to a diabetes clinic in Shiraz participated in this study. Convenience sampling was used. Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) (25 items) were also used. The data were analyzed by SPSS software version 20 using t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficients, and linear regression analysis. P<0.05 was considered as significant. Results: The findings showed that the mean±SD score of resilience was 65.33±23.81 in parents of children and adolescents with diabetes. Indeed, 45.1% of the parents had mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Besides, 58.4% and 71.4% of them reported mild to extremely severe depression and anxiety, respectively. The lowest mean±SD scores of resilience were reported in parents with extremely severe levels of depression (37.57±16.26), anxiety (44.89±23.53), and stress (37.84±17.90). Moreover, 49% of changes in resilience was explained by such factors as stress, anxiety, depression, and life and health satisfaction. Among these variables, the association between resilience and depression (t=-6.97, P<0.001) and life satisfaction (t=-3.18, P=0.002) were statistically significant. Conclusion: Since nearly half of the parents experienced stress, depression, and anxiety, and there was an association between resilience and these psychological variables, parents’ psychological problems, especially depression, might be reduced by improving their resilience.",2018.0,37.0,15.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '239 - 249', 'name': 'International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Edraki2018PsychologicalPO,\n author = {M.

The present study used resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to parcellate the human insular lobe based on clustering of functional connectivity patterns. Connectivity maps were computed for each voxel in the insula based on resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data and segregated using cluster analysis. We identified 3 insular subregions with distinct patterns of connectivity: a posterior region, functionally connected with primary and secondary somatomotor cortices; a dorsal anterior to middle region, connected with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, along with other regions of a previously described control network; and a ventral anterior region, primarily connected with pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Applying these regions to a separate task data set, we found that dorsal and ventral anterior insula responded selectively to disgusting images, while posterior insula did not. These results demonstrate that clustering of connectivity patterns can be used to subdivide cerebral cortex into anatomically and functionally meaningful subregions; the insular regions identified here should be useful in future investigations on the function of the insula.",2010.0,84.0,598.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '1498 - 1506', 'name': 'Cerebral Cortex (New York, NY)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Deen2010ThreeSO,\n author = {Ben Deen and Naomi B.

Virtual reality therapy (VRT) uses multimodal stimulation that includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of VRT in treating subjects with alcohol dependence (AD) by evaluating changes in brain metabolism.


METHOD
The VRT protocol consisted of three steps: relaxation, presentation of a high-risk situation, and presentation of an aversive situation. Twelve alcohol-dependent subjects underwent 10 sessions of VRT. The alcohol-dependent subjects were assessed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images before and after VRT, whereas the control group underwent imaging according to the same protocol only at baseline.


RESULTS
Compared with the healthy control group, AD subjects showed higher metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus and right temporal lobe (BA20) at baseline (P(FDR < .05) = .026). In addition, the metabolism in the left anterior cingulate was lower in subjects with AD (P(uncorr) = .001). After VRT, alcohol-dependent subjects showed decreased brain metabolism in the right lentiform nucleus (P(FDR < .05) = .026) and right temporal lobe (BA38, P(FDR < .05) = .032) relative to that at baseline.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest a neurobiological imbalance, notably, a high sensitivity to stimuli, in the limbic system in subjects with AD. Furthermore, we determined that metabolism decreased in the basal ganglia after VRT, which may explain the limbic-regulated responses of reward and regulation. Therefore, we tentatively recommend VRT to treat AD through its regulating effect on limbic circuits.",2015.0,0.0,45.0,"{'volume': '76 4', 'pages': '\n          620-7\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Son2015VirtualRT,\n author = {J.

In the present paper, we investigate whether attempting to improve others’ feelings helps people to make connections in new networks. In Study 1, a social network study following new networks of people for a 12-week period indicated that use of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER) strategies predicted growth in popularity, as indicated by other network members’ reports of spending time with the person, in work and non-work interactions. In Study 2, linguistic analysis of the tweets from over 8000 Twitter users from formation of their accounts revealed that use of IER predicted greater popularity in terms of the number of followers gained. However, not all types of IER had positive effects. Behavioral IER strategies (which use behavior to reassure or comfort in order to regulate affect) were associated with greater popularity, while cognitive strategies (which change a person’s thoughts about his or her situation or feelings in order to regulate affect) were negatively associated with popularity.

Given the emergence of new VR technology, and the growing body of research surrounding VR and pain management, an updated systematic review is warranted. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of VR in reducing acute and chronic pain in adults. Data Sources: A search was conducted in three databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Trip) using standardized search terms. Study Selection: Twenty experimental and quasi-experimental trials published between January 2007 and December 2018 were included based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pain intensity was the primary outcome. Data Extraction: We extracted data and appraised the quality of articles using either the PEDro or Modified Downs and Black risk of bias tools. Data Synthesis: The majority of studies supported the use of VR to reduce acute pain both during the procedure and immediately after. Numerous studies found VR reduced chronic pain during VR exposure but there is insufficient evidence to support lasting analgesia. There was considerable variability in patient population, pain condition and dosage of VR exposure. Limitations: Due to heterogeneity, we were unable to perform meta-analyses for all study populations and pain conditions. Conclusions: VR is an effective treatment for reducing acute pain.

We not only extend Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) for reasoning about the properties of emotional states based on POMDPs but also illustrate how four reactive (primary) emotions and nine deliberate (secondary) emotions can be derived by combining PCTL with the belief-desire theory of emotion.

The purpose of the present study was to address this gap in the literature. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we asked male and female participants to use a cognitive emotion regulation strategy (reappraisal) to down-regulate their emotional responses to negatively valenced pictures. Behaviorally, men and women evidenced comparable decreases in negative emotion experience. Neurally, however, gender differences emerged. Compared with women, men showed (a) lesser increases in prefrontal regions that are associated with reappraisal, (b) greater decreases in the amygdala, which is associated with emotional responding, and (c) lesser engagement of ventral striatal regions, which are associated with reward processing. We consider two non-competing explanations for these differences. First, men may expend less effort when using cognitive regulation, perhaps due to greater use of automatic emotion regulation. Second, women may use positive emotions in the service of reappraising negative emotions to a greater degree. We then consider the implications of gender differences in emotion regulation for understanding gender differences in emotional processing in general, and gender differences in affective disorders.",2008.0,98.0,762.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '143 - 162', 'name': 'Group Processes & Intergroup Relations'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McRae2008GenderDI,\n author = {Kateri McRae and K.

A systematic search, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, was therefore carried out to explore the state of the art in emotion regulation interventions for wellbeing using virtual reality. The literature on this topic was queried, 414 papers were screened, and 11 studies were included, covering adults and older adults. Our findings offer an overview of the current use of VR technologies for the enhancement of emotion regulation (ER) and wellbeing. The results are promising and suggest that VR-based emotion regulation training can facilitate the promotion of wellbeing.

This study examines the moment-to-moment dynamics between negative affect (NA) and paranoia prospectively in daily life. A female general population sample (n = 515) participated in an experience sampling study. Time-lagged analyses between increases in momentary NA and subsequent momentary paranoia were examined. The impact of childhood adversity, stress sensitivity (impact of momentary stress on momentary NA), and depressive symptoms on these time-lagged associations, as well as associations with follow-up self-reported psychotic symptoms (Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised) were investigated. Moments of NA increase resulted in a significant increase in paranoia over 180 subsequent minutes. Both stress sensitivity and depressive symptoms impacted on the transfer of NA to paranoia. Stress sensitivity moderated the level of increase in paranoia during the initial NA increase, while depressive symptoms increased persistence of paranoid feelings from moment to moment. Momentary paranoia responses to NA increases were associated with follow-up psychotic symptoms. Examination of microlevel momentary experience may thus yield new insights into the mechanism underlying co-occurrence of altered mood states and psychosis.

The meteoric rise in popularity of video games highlights the need for research approaches that can deepen our scientific understanding of video game engagement. This article advances a theory-based motivational model for examining and evaluating the ways by which video game engagement shapes psychological processes and influences well-being. Rooted in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2000a), our approach suggests that both the appeal and well-being effects of video games are based in their potential to satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We review recent empirical evidence applying this perspective to a number of topics including need satisfaction in games and short-term well-being, the motivational appeal of violent game content, motivational sources of postplay aggression, the antecedents and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement, and the determinants and effects of immersion. Implications of this model for the future study of game motivation and the use of video games in interventions are discussed.",2010.0,63.0,1082.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '154 - 166', 'name': 'Review of General Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Przybylski2010AMM,\n author = {Andrew K.

Adolescence is a developmental period which brings along changes at multiple levels, such as hormonal changes, improvements in socio-emotional processing, as well as ongoing brain maturation and functioning. It has been suggested that these changes increase the risk for the individual. For example, early, difficulties with emotion regulation have been linked to a range of mental health problems, such as anxiety. Here we successfully trained participants to modulate the functional coupling of the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala towards a more negative connectivity pattern, which resembles the connectivity pattern found in the mature brain. These brain-based changes were related to changes at the behavioural level. We also found that the modulation largely depends on the specific neurofeedback implementation, which provides important insights for future NF training approaches.",2018.0,80.0,5.0,{'name': 'bioRxiv'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Zich2018ModulatoryEO,\n author = {C.

However, these interventions are often characterised by poor adherence. One way to address this problem is to mimic therapy support by a conversational agent. The objectives of this study were to assess the e ﬀ ectiveness and adherence of a smartphone app, delivering strategies used in positive psychology and CBT interventions via an automated chatbot (Shim) for a non-clinical population — as well as to explore participants' views and experiences of interacting with this chatbot. A total of 28 participants were randomized to either receive the chatbot intervention ( n = 14) or to a wait-list control group ( n = 14). Findings revealed that participants who adhered to the intervention ( n = 13) showed signi ﬁ cant interaction e ﬀ ects of group and time on psychological well-being (FS) and perceived stress (PSS-10) compared to the wait-list control group, with small to large between e ﬀ ect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.14 – 1.06). Also, the participants showed high engagement during the 2-week long intervention, with an average open app ratio of 17.71 times for the whole period. This is higher compared to other studies on fully automated interventions claiming to be highly engaging, such as Woebot and the Panoply app. The qualitative data revealed sub-themes which, to our knowledge, have not been found previously, such as the moderating format of the chatbot. The results of this study, in particular the good adherence rate, validated the usefulness of replicating this study in the future with a larger sample size and an active control group.

A large body of research has shown that alterations in ER are related to psychological disorders across different diagnostic categories. Because of the apparent ubiquity of ER difficulties in psychopathology, several authors have proposed that ER should be regarded as a transdiagnostic process. This article critically examines evidence regarding alterations in the use of cognitive ER strategies as a transdiagnostic process. Cognitive ER strategies are examined as 1 example of several possible ER-related processes that could be involved in psychopathology. There is consistent evidence showing that a reduced use of cognitive reappraisal and an increased use of negative rumination are present across a number of disorders, whereas increased levels of positive rumination appear to be confined to bipolar disorder. However, there is only preliminary evidence from prospective and/or experimental studies on the causal nature of altered ER strategy use in the development or maintenance of psychopathology. The article concludes by discussing future directions, including methodological and design issues, as well as implications for assessment and treatment when studying alterations in ER from a transdiagnostic perspective.

The underlying processes of this link and the couple interplay between attachment and well‐being are notably less explored. Using a dyadic framework, this study examines both couple members' emotion regulation strategies as potential mediators of this link. Method One hundred and nineteen heterosexual couples completed self‐report measures on attachment style, psychological well‐being, tendency to suppress emotions, and emotion expression. Analyses were performed using the actor–partner interdependence mediation model that distinguishes between intrapersonal and interpersonal influences. Results Results showed that controlling for relationship length, there was an intrapersonal indirect effect of attachment avoidance on psychological well‐being through emotion suppression. Moreover, interpersonal indirect effects were found (a) with individual attachment avoidance being associated with partner's psychological well‐being through own emotion expression and (b) individual's attachment anxiety being associated with partner's psychological well‐being through both own's emotion expression and partner's emotion suppression. Conclusions These findings highlight the complex associations among attachment, emotion regulation, and well‐being and point out the role of emotion regulation as a potential underlying pathway explaining these associations.

Cross-sectionally, we found that the relationship between adaptive strategies and psychopathology symptoms was moderated by levels of maladaptive strategies: adaptive strategies had a negative association with psychopathology symptoms only at high levels of maladaptive strategies. In contrast, adaptive strategies showed no prospective relationship to psychopathology symptoms either alone or in interaction with maladaptive strategies. We discuss the implications of this investigation for future work on the contextual factors surrounding the deployment of emotion regulation strategies.",2012.0,44.0,421.0,"{'volume': '121 1', 'pages': '\n          276-81\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of abnormal psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Aldao2012WhenAA,\n author = {A.

These processes enable the individual to compensate for states of shortage, to adapt to changed circumstances, finish with past events and reconnect with the present. Examples of such resynchronizing processes are regeneration, sleep, dreaming, forgetting, remorse or grief. Melancholia is then interpreted as the result of a desynchronization, i.e. an uncoupling in the temporal relation of organism and environment, or of individual and society. With the processes of resynchronization failing, the person falls out of common environmental time. This conception allows a parallel to be drawn between chronobiological and psychosocial results of research. Moreover, it offers the possibility to understand not only the psychopathology, but also the triggering of melancholic episodes on the basis of a disturbance of time. Consequences for a ‘resynchronizing therapy’ are outlined.",2001.0,27.0,156.0,"{'volume': '34', 'pages': '179 - 186', 'name': 'Psychopathology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fuchs2001MelancholiaAA,\n author = {T.

Theoretical elaboration and measurement.,"Interpersonal forgiving was conceptualized in the context of a 2-factor motivational system that governs people's responses to interpersonal offenses. Four studies were conducted to examine the extent to which forgiving could be predicted with relationship-level variables such as satisfaction, commitment, and closeness; offense-level variables such as apology and impact of the offense; and social-cognitive variables such as offender-focused empathy and rumination about the offense. Also described is the development of the transgression-related interpersonal motivations inventory--a self-report measure designed to assess the 2-component motivational system (Avoidance and Revenge) posited to underlie forgiving. The measure demonstrated a variety of desirable psychometric properties, commending its use for future research. As predicted, empathy, apology, rumination, and several indexes of relationship closeness were associated with self-reported forgiving.",1998.0,88.0,1622.0,"{'volume': '75 6', 'pages': '\n          1586-603\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McCullough1998InterpersonalFI,\n author = {Michael E.

We investigated the feasibility of training healthy humans to self-regulate the hemodynamic activity of the amygdala, which plays major roles in emotional processing. Participants in the experimental group were provided with ongoing information about the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity in the left amygdala (LA) and were instructed to raise the BOLD rtfMRI signal by contemplating positive autobiographical memories. A control group was assigned the same task but was instead provided with sham feedback from the left horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS) region. In the LA, we found a significant BOLD signal increase due to rtfMRI neurofeedback training in the experimental group versus the control group. This effect persisted during the Transfer run without neurofeedback. For the individual subjects in the experimental group the training effect on the LA BOLD activity correlated inversely with scores on the Difficulty Identifying Feelings subscale of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. The whole brain data analysis revealed significant differences for Happy Memories versus Rest condition between the experimental and control groups. Functional connectivity analysis of the amygdala network revealed significant widespread correlations in a fronto-temporo-limbic network. Additionally, we identified six regions — right medial frontal polar cortex, bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral superior frontal gyrus — where the functional connectivity with the LA increased significantly across the rtfMRI neurofeedback runs and the Transfer run. The findings demonstrate that healthy subjects can learn to regulate their amygdala activation using rtfMRI neurofeedback, suggesting possible applications of rtfMRI neurofeedback training in the treatment of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.",2011.0,76.0,287.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zotev2011SelfRegulationOA,\n author = {V.

By contrast, there has been less work on modeling observers’ understanding of emotional states. We propose an intuitive theory framework to studying affective cognition—how humans reason about emotions—and derive a taxonomy of inferences within affective cognition. Using this taxonomy, we review formal computational modeling work on such inferences, including causal reasoning about how others react to events, reasoning about unseen causes of emotions, reasoning with multiple cues, as well as reasoning from emotions to other mental states. In addition, we provide a roadmap for future research by charting out inferences—such as hypothetical and counterfactual reasoning about emotions—that are ripe for future computational modeling work. This framework proposes unifying these various types of reasoning as Bayesian inference within a common “intuitive Theory of Emotion.” Finally, we end with a discussion of important theoretical and methodological challenges that lie ahead in modeling affective cognition.",2018.0,117.0,75.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '338 - 357', 'name': 'Topics in Cognitive Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ong2018ComputationalMO,\n author = {Desmond C.

As the complexity of robots increases, traditional methods for robotic control fail, as the problem of finding the appropriate kinematic functions can easily become intractable. For this reason the use of neuro-controllers, controllers based on machine learning methods, has risen at a rapid pace. This kind of controllers are especially useful in the field of humanoid robotics, where it is common for the robot to perform hard tasks in a complex environment. A basic task for a humanoid robot is to visually pursue a target using eye-head coordination. In this work we present an adaptive model based on a neuro-controller for visual pursuit. This model allows the robot to follow a moving target with no delay (zero phase lag) using a predictor of the target motion. The results show that the new controller can reach a target posed at a starting distance of 1.2 meters in less than 100 control steps (1 second) and it can follow a moving target at low to medium frequencies (0.3 to 0.5 Hz) with zero-lag and small position error (less then 4 cm along the main motion axis). The controller also has adaptive capabilities, being able to reach and follow a target even when some joints of the robot are clamped.",2014.0,19.0,20.0,"{'pages': '541-546', 'name': '2014 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vannucci2014AdaptiveVP,\n author = {Lorenzo Vannucci and Nino Cauli and E.

The management of perioperative anxiety and pain remains challenging in children and is inadequate, which negatively impacts the physical, psychosocial, and economic outcomes. Existing nonpharmacological interventions are costly, time consuming, vary in availability, and lack benefits. Therefore, there is a need for an evidence-based, accessible, nonpharmacological intervention as an adjunct to existing pharmacological alternatives to reduce perioperative anxiety and pain in children undergoing ambulatory surgery. Technology-enabled interventions have been proposed as a method to address the unmet need in this setting. In particular, serious games hold a unique potential to change health beliefs and behaviors in children. Objective The objective of this research was to describe the rationale, scientific evidence, design aspects, and features of CliniPup, a serious game aimed at reducing perioperative anxiety and pain in children undergoing ambulatory surgery. Methods The SERES Framework for serious game development was used to create the serious game, CliniPup. In particular, we used a mixed methods approach that consisted of a structured literature review supplemented with ethnographic research, such as expert interviews and a time-motion exercise. The resulting scientific evidence base was leveraged to ensure that the resulting serious game was relevant, realistic, and theory driven. A participatory design approach was applied, wherein clinical experts qualitatively reviewed several versions of the serious game, and an iterative creative process was used to integrate the applicable feedback. Results CliniPup, a serious game, was developed to incorporate a scientific evidence base from a structured literature review, realistic content collected during ethnographic research such as expert interviews, explicit pedagogical objectives from scientific literature, and game mechanics and user interface design that address key aspects of the evidence. Conclusions This report details the systematic development of CliniPup, a serious game aimed at reducing perioperative anxiety and pain in children undergoing ambulatory surgery. Clinical experts validated CliniPup’s underlying scientific evidence base and design foundations, suggesting that it was well designed for preliminary evaluation in the target population.

1240,6b84e730bfc174f7a02b15c0c16f2a75f609a1bb,Computational models of emotion,"Recent years have seen a significant expansion in research on computational models of human emotional processes, driven both by their potential for basic research on emotion and cognition as well as their promise for an ever-increasing range of applications. This has led to a truly interdisciplinary, mutually beneficial partnership between emotion research in psychology and in computational science, of which this volume is an exemplar. To understand this partnership and its potential for transforming existing practices in emotion research across disciplines and for disclosing important novel areas of research, we explore in this chapter the history of work in computational models of emotion including the various uses to which they have been put, the theoretical traditions that have shaped their development, and how these uses and traditions are reflected in their underlying architectures. For an outsider to the field, the last 15 years have seen the development of a seemingly bewildering array of competing and complementary computational models. Figure 1.2.1 lists a ‘family tree’ of a few of the significant models and the theoretical traditions from which they stem. Although there has been a proliferation of work, the field is far from mature: the goals that a model is designed to achieve are not always clearly articulated; research is rarely incremental, more often returning to motivating theories rather than extending prior computational approaches; and rarely are models contrasted with each other in terms of their ability to achieve their set goals. Contributing to potential confusion is the reality that computational models are complex systems embodying a number of, sometimes unarticulated, design decisions and assumptions inherited from the psychological and computational traditions from which they emerged, a circumstance made worse by the lack of a commonly accepted lexicon even for designating these distinctions. In this chapter, we lay out the work on computational models of emotion in an attempt to reveal the common uses to which they may be put and the underlying techniques and assumptions from which the models are built. Our aim is to present conceptual distinctions and common terminology that can aid in discussion and comparison of competing models. Our hope is that this will not only facilitate an understanding of the field for outside researchers but work towards a lexicon that can help foster the maturity of the field towards more incremental research. In characterizing different computational models of emotion, we begin by describing interdisciplinary uses to which computational models may be put, including their uses in improving human–computer interaction, in enhancing general models of intelligence, and as methodological tools for furthering our understanding of human behaviour. We next discuss how models have been built, including the underlying theoretical traditions that have shaped their development. These differing theoretical perspectives often conceptualize emotion in quite different ways, emphasizing different scenarios and proposed functions, different component processes, and different linkages between these components. It should then come as no surprise that such",2010.0,113.0,382.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Marsella2010ComputationalMO,\n author = {S. Marsella and J. Gratch and P.

1244,6be77f85bb4ce0565b3add7d6c374c9b7f561a7a,Cognitive reappraisal of emotion: a meta-analysis of human neuroimaging studies.,"In recent years, an explosion of neuroimaging studies has examined cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing the way one thinks about a stimulus in order to change its affective impact. Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala, but they offer competing visions of how this is accomplished. One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala, whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC, and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions. This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus, and these altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala.",2014.0,133.0,1401.0,"{'volume': '24 11', 'pages': '\n          2981-90\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Buhle2014CognitiveRO,\n author = {J.

Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar to words forming an already seen sentence.

Hence, we aimed to determine the relationship of psychological hardiness and quality of life with death anxiety in nurses. Material and Methods: This correlational study was conducted on 273 nurses selected via simple random sampling in both state and private hospitals of Gorgan, Iran, in 2013. The instruments were psychological hardiness, quality of life and death anxiety questionnaires. To analyze data, we used Pierson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regressions. Results: There was significant relationship between psychological hardiness and death anxiety (r=-0.220, p<0.001); between quality of life and death anxiety (r=-0.227, p<0.001). Based on concurrent multiple linear regression, only psychological hardiness and social performance (one of the sub-scales of quality of life) had a meaningful relationship with the death anxiety.

1257,6d7b9e6bc69df0b0a3602015e766616b2dab59f1,Predicting Depression Based on Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies,"Introduction: In recent years, many studies focused on emotion regulation in conceptualization, explanation, and treatment of mental disorders. Problematic patterns of emotional reactivity and regulation are prominent factors in various mental disorders, specially internalizing disorders. The present study aimed to identify the role of emotion regulation strategies in predicting depression. 
Method: This descriptive –correlational research was conducted on 650 students of Yazd University selected by cluster sampling. They completed the Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies Questionnaire (CERQ.) Research data were analyzed in SPSS-22 by Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise regression. 
Results: A significant positive correlation was found between maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing, other-blame) and depression. Adaptive emotion regulation strategies (acceptance, reorientation, plan-focus, perspective taking) were negatively correlated with depression. Results of Stepwise regression showed that self-blame, reorientation, catastrophizing, plan-focus, and other blame could explain 34% of depression variance significantly. 
Conclusion: According to the results, emotion regulation strategies can be a significant factor in predicting depression; so, strengthening the adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies should be considered in the development and modification of treatments for depression.

Because reappraisal is thought to be supported by linearly developing prefrontal regions, one prediction is that reappraisal ability develops linearly. However, recent investigations into socio-emotional development suggest that there are non-linear patterns that uniquely affect adolescents. We compared older children (10-13), adolescents (14-17) and young adults (18-22) on a task that distinguishes negative emotional reactivity from reappraisal ability. Behaviorally, we observed no age differences in self-reported emotional reactivity, but linear and quadratic relationships between reappraisal ability and age. Neurally, we observed linear age-related increases in activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, previously identified in adult reappraisal. We observed a quadratic pattern of activation with age in regions associated with social cognitive processes like mental state attribution (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior temporal cortex). In these regions, we observed relatively lower reactivity-related activation in adolescents, but higher reappraisal-related activation. This suggests that (i) engagement of the cognitive control components of reappraisal increases linearly with age and (ii) adolescents may not normally recruit regions associated with mental state attribution, but (iii) this can be reversed with reappraisal instructions.",2012.0,71.0,539.0,"{'volume': '7 1', 'pages': '\n          11-22\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McRae2012TheDO,\n author = {Kateri McRae and J.

1264,6dd1c68a4816907164e7bdea24fae2faf4e61301,Developing Usability Guidelines for mHealth Applications (UGmHA),"Mobile health (mHealth) is a branch of electronic health (eHealth) technology that provides healthcare services using smartphones and wearable devices. However, most mHealth applications were developed without applying mHealth specialized usability guidelines. Although many researchers have used various guidelines to design and evaluate mHealth applications, these guidelines have certain limitations. First, some of them are general guidelines. Second, others are specified for mHealth applications; however, they only cover a few features of mHealth applications. Third, some of them did not consider accessibility needs for the elderly and people with special needs. Therefore, this paper proposes a new set of usability guidelines for mHealth applications (UGmHA) based on Quinones et al.’s formal methodology, which consists of seven stages starting from the Exploratory stage and ending with the Refining stage. What distinguishes these proposed guidelines is that they are easy to follow, consider the feature of accessibility for the elderly and people with special needs and cover different features of mHealth applications. In order to validate UGmHA, an experiment was conducted on two applications in Saudi Arabia using UGmHA versus other well-known usability guidelines to discover usability issues. The experimental results show that the UGmHA discovered more usability issues than did the other guidelines.",2023.0,26.0,1.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '26', 'name': 'Multimodal Technol.

Developmental Changes in Mental Performance. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (3, Serial No. 150). A distinction was made between the general level of a person's IQ (i.e., the average of his scores across age) and his profile contour (i.e., the developmental pattern of inflections in performance). Most research has focused on the general level of IQ and its correlates; this project systematically investigated patterns of IQ change with data from the Fels Longitudinal Study. Normal middle-class children changed an average of 28.5 IQ points between 21/2 and 17 years of age, and one in seven displayed shifts of more than 40 points. While siblings were more similar in their general level of IQ than unrelated children matched or unmatched for social class, the pattern of developmental changes in childhood IQs or infant DQs was not more similar among siblings than among unrelated children. Twins and triplets scored lower in general level and were less variable in IQ over age than singletons, thus potentially qualifying attempts to generalize IQ change results based upon multiple-birth samples to singletons. Parent-child IQ correlations were higher when the parent was assessed as an adult than if both parent and child were tested at the same chronological ages. A sample of 80 subjects who had relatively complete IQ data (maximum of 17 tests) between 2/2 and 17 years were clustered into five groups which represented different patterns of IQ change over age. These profiles were relatively simple linear or quadratic trends and not random fluctuations about a constant value. Major inflection points occurred at 6 and 10 years of age. It was not obvious that these patterns were simple products of repeated testing or the changing nature of the IQ test. The children in the five IQ profile clusters had parents who were different in the extent to which they attempted to accelerate their child's development and the severity of punishments they administered. These parental correlates appeared to hold up even when parental education and IQ as well as the general level of the child's IQ were statistically controlled. Given the assumptions prompted by these data, the changing nature of environmental circumstances across the childhood years for a given individual may be as potent in changing IQ as the differences between family environments.

THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN IQ Several reviews of the literature on the development of mental performance are available (Bayley 1970; Bloom 1964; Pinneau 1961). However, most of the research surveyed involves correlations between mental test performance at several different ages and correlations between personality and social variables with IQ at one age versus another. Such research strategies are valuable and have yielded important results, but they are ""developmental"" only in the sense that data are available at several ages on the same subjects and correlational relationships are derived within and across age periods. Because the correlation coefficient is independent of the means of the distributions, it is possible to obtain high correlational stability of IQ across age but marked fluctuations in the group mean. In short, cross-age correlations reveal little about the nature of absolute changes in level of performance, and they provide only partial information about individual differences in developmental pattern. This project focuses on developmental patterns of change in the level of mental performance as assessed by traditional intelligence tests.",2016.0,97.0,6663.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mccall2016MONOGRAPHSOT,\n author = {R.

1269,6f16c14daf0a4dba125707c8578f853f53d5e02c,Towards causality in parent-child emotion regulation dynamics,"Summary This study will test transactional interactions between primary caregiver and child emotions, emotion regulation (ER), and behaviors in early childhood. Through dynamic ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measurement, we aim to clarify how caregiver regulation of their own and their child’s emotions influence subsequent dyadic interactions. These situation-spe-cific insights are essential for developing family interven-tions that are sensitive to individual child, caregiver and environmental differences. Summary Flexibly adjusting emotion regulation (ER) strategy use to situational affordances is assumed to be beneficial and individuals are thought to become better at flexible ER as they age. We test these ideas in individuals 25-85 years old by assessing their ER strategies, location, activity, social context and situational appraisals 5x/7days. We will use multivariate mixed effect location scale models to assess flexibility and its associations with well-being and age. Summary People commonly regulate both negative and positive emotions, however, few measures have been available to assess emotion regulation ability across both valence domains. The Perth Emotion Regulation Competency Inventory (PERCI) was recently developed for this purpose. Here we present the first psychometric study of the PERCI in the United States. The PERCI demonstrated strong factorial validity, internal consistency, and concurrent validity. The relationships we observed between the PERCI and various regulation strategies may serve to establish a profile of what strategy patterns characterize poor or strong emotion regulation ability. The PERCI’s capacity to assess both valence domains should enable more comprehensive as-sessments of emotion regulation ability. In powerful and often volatile social media climates, an influential force emerges: digital firestorms. Digital firestorms are social media hot zones which capture attention and perpetuate outrage with significant consequences for virtual and physical worlds. This qualitative study aims to explore what role emotion regulation plays in propagating these diffu-sions of emotion. The present research aimed to identify theatre actors ’ emotional labour strategies and its outcomes. The data was gathered over one-to-one qualitative interviews with 7 theatre actors. Five themes describing emotional labour strategies were identified, i.e. (1) Consulting self, (2) Bringing the character to life, (3) Pushing to extremes, (4) Triggering required emotions, (5) Others and acting. Outcomes of emotional labour clustered around four themes: (1) Work invades life, (2) Simulation becomes reality, (3) Detrimental emotional effects, and (4) Constructive outcomes. The study findings demonstrated that actors employ strategies which may result in difficulty detaching from the role, loss of emotion regulation control, loss of sense of reality, and work-family conflict. On the other hand, emotional labour may help achieving a better performance and developing emotional intelligence. Summary Positive reappraisal is a powerful strategy for regulating one’s emotional response to negative events. In this study we demonstrate that the generation of positive reappraisals is distinguish-able from the implementation of those reappraisals to change one’s emotion. These results suggest that generating reappraisals is an effective way to regulate emotions, but implementing them results in signiﬁcantly greater emotion changes. Summary Interoception, the sense of the body’s internal state, is closely related to emotion and well-being. Many mindfulness trainings cultivate interoceptive awareness to promote well-being. In this study, we apply machine learning techniques to fMRI signals in the brain to examine whether interoceptive training improves sustained attention on the body and/or promotes the use of such attention to regulate emotions in stressful situations. Situation selection is the approach or avoidance of situations depending on their perceived emotional outcome. Studies of situation selection during adolescence are lacking, despite rapid developmental changes in emotional functioning during this period. This multi-method, longitudinal study assessed situation selection using a trait survey, daily reports, and a behavioral task, and measured anxiety and depressive symptoms both cross-sectionally and one year later. Se-lecting more negative stimuli during the behavioral task and greater daily avoidance of negative situations were associated with greater anxiety and depressive symptoms. Greater daily avoidance of negative situations was also associated with increased anxiety one year later. Results suggest that adolescents use situation selection as an emotion regulation strategy, which has implications for mental health symptoms. Summary This study tested the effectiveness of three cognitive strategies for increasing sexual desire for a long-term partner. Sexual imagery increased sexual desire for and infatuation with the partner. Positive reappraisal of the partner and reappraisal of sexual desire decline were not effective. Individuals who are in a long-term relationship could use sexual imagery to increase sexual desire for their partner.",2021.0,35.0,0.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Preece2021TowardsCI,\n author = {D.

It has been suggested that a greater biological salience of approaching auditory sources may account for these effects. In addition, these effects may hold only for those sources critical for our survival. In the present study, we bring support to these hypotheses by quantifying the emotional responses to different sounds with changing intensity patterns. In 2 experiments, participants were exposed to artificial and natural sounds simulating approaching or receding sources. The auditory-induced emotional effect was reflected in the performance of participants in an emotion-related behavioral task, their self-reported emotional experience, and their physiology (electrodermal activity and facial electromyography). The results of this study suggest that approaching unpleasant sound sources evoke more intense emotional responses in listeners than receding ones, whereas such an effect of perceived sound motion does not exist for pleasant or neutral sound sources. The emotional significance attributed to the sound source itself, the loudness of the sound, and loudness change duration seem to be relevant factors in this disparity.",2010.0,62.0,99.0,"{'volume': '10 2', 'pages': '\n          216-29\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tajadura-Jiménez2010EmbodiedAP,\n author = {A.

After briefly meeting and ranking 12 animated characters, participants interacted with their top-ranked character. We measured the level of rapport established and general attitude to using virtual humans for support. About half of the participants said gender or ethnic appearance did not matter and preferred a peer-aged character that played the role of a friend.

High empathy participants rapidly reacted with larger zygomatic muscle activity to happy as compared with angry faces as early as after 500 ms after stimulus onset, and with larger corrugator muscle activity to angry than to happy faces after 500 ms. Accordingly, this group also reacted with a corresponding experience of emotion. The low empathy participants, in contrast, did not differentiate between the happy and angry stimuli with either facial muscles or in their self experience of emotion.

The input sketches are first employed to construct a base mesh model by using a hybrid sketch-based method. The model is then deformed for each key viewpoint, yielding a set of models that closely match the corresponding sketches. We introduce a view-dependent facial expression space defined by the key viewpoints and the basic emotions to generate various facial expressions viewed from arbitrary angles. The output facial animation conforms to the input sketches and maintains frame-to-frame correspondence. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through an easy-to-use system, where the animating of cartoon faces is automated once the user accomplishes sketching and configuration.

A view-dependent facial expression space defined by the key viewpoints and the basic emotions is introduced to generate various facial expressions (c) viewed from arbitrary angles.",2010.0,641.0,126.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '193-201', 'name': 'Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2010AnimatingCF,\n author = {Xiang Li and Jun Xu and Yangchun Ren and Weidong Geng},\n journal = {Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds},\n pages = {193-201},\n title = {Animating cartoon faces by multi-view drawings},\n volume = {21},\n year = {2010}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2144440849', 'name': 'Xiang Li'}, {'authorId': '2150637563', 'name': 'Jun Xu'}, {'authorId': '1690266', 'name': 'Yangchun Ren'}, {'authorId': '2257808072', 'name': 'Weidong Geng'}]"

Semi-structured interviews with three participants, diagnosed with ASD between the ages of 16–21 years, yielded four themes that illustrated the social experiences of participants in this study. Emerging themes and participant comments identified in this study parallel those identified in the most recent research literature that has also sought to identify experiences and attributes that may lead to successful interpersonal relationships for individuals identified with ASD. Participants in this study articulated the desire to socialize, interact, and frequently communicate in a virtual environment; challenges with being misunderstood; issues with identification and perceptions of friends; and awareness of rules specific to face-to-face and virtual environments. A review of the current research literature related to adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) revealed a focus on adolescent social challenges and language development as well as strategies to increase the acquisition of functional social skills. However, there was a notable absence of research on the social and relational impact of the use of virtual environments and online gaming for individuals with ASD. The focus of this study was the examination of the social interactions of adolescents with ASD as they engaged in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG). This article begins by providing context for the development of the study rationale through a review of the extant literature on individuals with ASD and participation in virtual environments and online gaming. Next the study’s purpose is connected to the documented social and relational needs of individuals with ASD and the potential of virtual environments and online gaming to meet those needs. A description of the research study and methodology follows along with a summary of results and implications for individuals with ASD. Concluding remarks address the potential implications of an expanded research effort in this area on the postsecondary outcomes of adolescents and young adults with ASD. Autism Spectrum Disorder A defining characteristic of ASD is the lack of appropriate social skills, lack of appropriate responses during a conversation, limited social interactions, low to no maintained friendships or interactions outside of school or work that include phone calls or face-to-face interactions (Cihak, 2011; Seltzer, Greenberg, Floyd, & Hong, 2004). An increasing number of individuals are being diagnosed with ASD. Current estimates indicate that 1:68 individuals have some form of ASD (Center for Disease Control, 2014). This increase in prevalence has lead to revision and refinement in Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Jennifer Gallup, 749 Jefferson Ave., Pocatello, ID 83201. E-mail: jgallup321@gmail.com Education and Training in Autism and Developmental Disabilities, 2016, 51(3), 223–237 © Division on Autism and Developmental Disabilities Adolescents with Autism Engaged in Online Gaming / 223 definitions of ASD including these that describe the disorder as: ● A developmental disorder of the human nervous system, (Mintz, Branch, March, & Lerman, 2012) that currently affects 1% of the global population (Charman & Gotham, 2013). ● A developmental disorder categorized by deficits in social interactions and communication skills as well as the presence of stereotypic and repetitive behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). ● A complex disorder (Schafer et al., 2013) with the degree of challenge individualized and specific to each person – with severity ranging from mild to severe impairment (National Institute of Mental Health, 2012). In addition to social challenges, individuals with ASD also experience challenges with awareness and emotional recognition that leads to debility of self (Duff & Flattery, 2014). Unaware of how others think and perceive them, individuals with ASD have ever-present difficulties with socialization that often result in social rejection, that follows them throughout their lives, resulting in barriers and challenges in education, postsecondary education, and other aspects of daily living (Carrington, Papinczak, & Templeton, 2003). The purpose of this study was to (1) describe the social interactions of adolescents with ASD in the context of a virtual environment, (2) identify if they are socializing, and (3) describe how they socialized and related information pertaining to their daily living. Absence of Interventions for Adolescents and Young Adults with ASD As early as elementary school, educators and other practitioners attempt to remediate social skill difficulties in individuals with ASD. Much of the current research focuses on the impact of early intervention, through techniques such as Discrete Trial Training, for basic communication skills. The National Professional Development Center (2014) and National Research Council have identified 27 evidence-based practices used to support social and behavioral challenges for individuals with ASD. Of the 27, 19 have been evidence based for adolescents and 11 for young adults with ASD up to the age of 22 years. However, these strategies have not proven to be as successful in helping adolescents and young adults with high functioning ASD engage with peers, learn complex communication, and achieve transition post-high school (Schall & McDonough, 2010). Although childhood research is valuable, research on social skill and communication development beyond this period has been neglected (Schall & McDonough, 2010). Few studies discuss the need to reach adolescents; and even fewer studies have targeted those with high functioning autism as defined by the DSM-V (2014) who would require level one support. Social and Relational Deficits Adolescents with ASD have social and relational deficits that differ dramatically from students with other disabilities. Adolescents with ASD are significantly more likely to never see friends outside of school (43.3%), never get called by friends (54.4%), and never be invited to activities (50.4%) “when compared to those with other disabilities such as intellectual disabilities, speech and language impairment, or learning disabilities” (Shattuck, Orsmond, Wagner, & Cooper, 2011, p. 5). In addition, adolescents with ASD are less likely to participate in social activities with friends, or community activities with peers than those in other disability categories (Shattuck et al., 2011). Social challenges remain problematic through adulthood affecting their postsecondary transitions to college and careers (Church, Alisanski, & Amanullah, 2000). For example, nearly 85% of individuals with ASD live with a family member (NLTS-2 W-5, 2009), only 54% graduate high school (Shattuck et al., 2011) and as a result only 13% go onto postsecondary education, which contributes to having the lowest average wage amongst all other disability categories at $8.70/hr (Wei et al., 2013). Transition to Adulthood A large population of individuals with ASD is maturing into adolescence and adulthood; however, there exists a paucity of research on 224 / Education and Training in Autism and Developmental Disabilities-September 2016 postsecondary supports and interventions to support success in postsecondary settings (Shattuck et al., 2011). Due to their unique characteristics, individuals with ASD often possess strengths in the area of complex problem solving, attention to detail, the ability to hyper focus on a given task, conceptualization of solutions to often complex problems, and are often high achieving in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Burtenshaw, & Hobson, 2007; Fessenden, 2013; Shattuck et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2013). Adolescents and young adults with ASD choose majors in STEM at a much higher rate than their typically developing peers, yet fail to achieve commensurate with their peers (Wei et al., 2013). As a result of the persistent deficit in social communication and interactions within a group, individuals with ASD hold the third lowest matriculation rate to college and are the lowest of all diverse populations in the area of STEM. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Predisposed to experience persistent challenges in social skill and soft skill development, individuals with ASD possess a high level of interest and hold the potential to contribute to future science breakthroughs in STEM (Grandin, 2012). However, reports on postsecondary outcomes for individuals with ASD indicate these students have the third lowest matriculation rate (into college) and as a result, are chronically underrepresented in STEM careers (Wei et al., 2013). Many of the characteristics of ASD that often present challenges in social situations can benefits students with ASD in STEM areas. For example, their ability to hyper focus on a specific analytical task and critically and systematically conceptualize solutions to complex problems (Wei et al., 2013) all can enhance their acquisition of STEM knowledge. Despite their demonstrated aptitude for STEM fields, individuals with ASD are not being assimilated into STEM professions (Grandin, 2012). Postsecondary outcomes for individuals with ASD remain grim (Shattuck et al., 2012). One contributing factor in poor postsecondary outcomes is a persistent deficit in social skills that impedes the ability of adolescents with ASD to socially connect and develop supportive friendships; a highly desirable soft skill that predicates success in securing and maintaining employment (Alpern & Zager, 2007; Baron-Cohen et al., 2007; Fessenden, 2013; Wei et al., 2013).

1283,701e5b46a36dcd3089dceddf7b9e1f3a1ca9d640,The Relevance of Emotion Regulation in Explaining Why Social Exclusion Triggers Paranoia in Individuals at Clinical High Risk of Psychosis,"Background
Vulnerability-stress models postulate that social stress triggers psychotic episodes in vulnerable individuals. However, experimental evidence for the proposed causal pathway is scarce and the translating mechanisms are insufficiently understood. The study assessed the impact of social exclusion on paranoid beliefs in a quasi-experimental design and investigated the role of emotion regulation (ER) as a vulnerability indicator and emotional responses as a putative translating mechanism.


Methods
Participants fulfilling criteria for clinical high risk of psychosis (CHR, n = 25), controls with anxiety disorders (AC, n = 40), and healthy controls (HC, n = 40) were assessed for dysfunctional (eg, rumination, catastrophizing, blaming) and functional ER-strategies (eg, reappraising, accepting, refocusing). They were then exposed to social exclusion during a virtual ball game (Cyberball) and assessed for changes in self-reported emotions and paranoid beliefs.


Results
The CHR sample showed a significantly stronger increase in paranoid beliefs from before to after the social exclusion than both control groups. This was accounted for by lower levels of functional and higher levels of dysfunctional ER (compared to HC) and by a stronger increase in self-reported negative emotion in the CHR group (compared to AC and HC).


Conclusions
The results confirm the role of negative emotion on the pathway from social stressors to psychotic symptoms and indicate that both the use of dysfunctional ER strategies and difficulties in employing functional strategies add to explaining why people at risk of psychosis respond to a social stressor with increased paranoia.",2018.0,76.0,46.0,"{'name': 'Schizophrenia Bulletin', 'pages': '757–767', 'volume': '44'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lincoln2018TheRO,\n author = {T.

Methods: Participants included 48 children from 6 years old to 17 years of age with >10% TBSA burn injuries reporting moderate or higher worst pain during no VR on Day 1. Forty-four of the 48 children were from developing Latin American countries. Patients played adjunctive SnowWorld, an interactive 3D snowy canyon in virtual reality during some portions of wound care, vs. No VR during comparable portions of the same wound care session (initial treatment condition randomized). Using Graphic Rating scales, children's worst pain ratings during “No VR” (treatment as usual pain medications) vs. their worst pain during “Yes VR” was measured during at least 1 day of wound care, and was measured for up to 10 study days the patient used VR. Results: VR significantly reduced children's “worst pain” ratings during burn wound cleaning procedures in the ICU on Day 1. Worst pain during No VR = 8.52 (SD = 1.75) vs. during Yes VR = 5.10 (SD = 3.27), t(47) = 7.11, p < 0.001, SD = 3.33, CI = 2.45–4.38, Cohen's d = 1.03 (indicating large effect size).

A conceptual framework for defining user engagement with technology,"The purpose of this article is to critically deconstruct the term engagement as it applies to peoples' experiences with technology. Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement—a term not defined consistently in past work—as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety-novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2008.0,66.0,1353.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '938-955', 'name': 'J.

In this two-phase study, we aimed to recruit a general population sample to investigate the association between trait paranoia and cognitive, emotional, and behavioral components of social performance. In phase 1, a general population online survey (N = 609) investigated how trait paranoia related to fear of negative evaluation (FNE), interpersonal sensitivity, social avoidance and distress (SAD), mood, and demographic characteristics. In phase 2, we piloted a new VR social situation paradigm (a party in a bar) with a subsample of participants who scored high or low in trait paranoia. Eighty-nine participants entered the VR party in a bar scenario to evaluate the acceptability of the task and the relationship between paranoid ideation and social performance. As hypothesized, in phase 1, trait paranoia was associated with FNE, SAD, interpersonal sensitivity, mood, and demographics (all small-to-medium effects); in phase 2, participants found the VR environment acceptable and immersive; exposure to the VR environment elicited a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral components of social performance; and high trait paranoia participants reported higher state paranoia and greater negative components of social performance (all medium effects). The study tests a novel sample recruited predominantly online and validates the virtual environment for psychological assessment and treatment.

However, peeling them off can be difficult and sometimes painful especially when these skin‐mounted devices are applied on sensitive or wounded regions of skin due to their strong adhesion. A set of biocompatible and water‐decomposable “skin‐friendly” epidermal electronic devices fabricated on flexible, stretchable, and degradable protein‐based substrates are reported.

In this paper, we show how a simple anticipatory mechanism can be used to control the behaviour of a synthetic character implemented as a software agent, without disrupting the user's suspension of disbelief. We describe the emotivector, an anticipatory mechanism coupled with a sensor, that: (1) uses the history of the sensor to anticipate the next sensor state; (2) interprets the mismatch between the prediction and the sensed value, by computing its attention grabbing potential and associating a basic qualitative sensation with the signal; (3) sends its interpretation along with the signal. When a signal from the sensor reaches the processing module of the agent, it carries recommendations such as: ""you should seriously take this signal into consideration, as it is much better than we had expected"" or ""Just forget about this one, it is as bad as we predicted"". We delineate several strategies to manage several emotivectors at once and show how one of these strategies (meta-anticipation) transparently introduces the concept of uncertainty. Finally, we describe an experiment in which an emotivector-controlled synthetic character interacts with the user in the context of a word-puzzle game and present the evaluation supporting the adequacy of our approach.",2006.0,16.0,51.0,{'pages': '175-180'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Martinho2006UsingAT,\n author = {C.

A Within-Subjects Pilot Examination of Temporally Sensitive Markers of Suicide Risk,"Objective tools to assess suicide risk are needed to determine when someone is at imminent risk. In this pilot laboratory investigation, we used a within-subjects design to identify patterns in text messaging (short message service) unique to high-risk periods preceding suicide attempts. Individuals reporting a history of suicide attempt (N = 33) retrospectively identified past attempts and periods of lower risk (e.g., suicide ideation). Language analysis software scored 189,478 text messages to capture three psychological constructs: self-focus, sentiment, and social engagement. Mixed-effects models tested whether these constructs differed in general (means) and over time (slopes) 2 weeks before a suicide attempt relative to lower-risk periods. Regarding mean differences, no language features uniquely differentiated suicide attempts from other episodes. However, when examining patterns over time, anger increased and positive emotion decreased to a greater extent as participants approached a suicide attempt.

Recent research identifying adolescents and young adults at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis allows for prospective evaluation of the impact of trauma and adverse life events on psychosis onset and other outcomes, addressing etiological questions that cannot be answered in studies of fully psychotic or non-clinical populations. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current emerging literature on trauma and adverse life events in the CHR population. Up to 80% of CHR youth endorse a lifetime history of childhood traumatic events and victimization (e.g., bullying). Several studies have shown that the experience of CT predicts psychosis onset among CHR individuals, while the literature on the influence of recent SLEs (e.g., death of a loved one) remains inconclusive. Multiple models have been proposed to explain the link between trauma and psychosis, including the stress-vulnerability and stress-sensitivity hypotheses, with emphases on both cognitive processes and neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis). Despite the preponderance of CHR individuals who endorse either CT or SLEs, no clinical trials have been conducted evaluating interventions for trauma in CHR youth to date. Furthermore, the current process of formal identification and assessment of trauma, SLEs, and their impact on CHR youth is inconsistent in research and clinical practice.

1306,728e1adf786a3639fef94977ef1258fd42cb9b3f,Virtual Reality for the Enhancement of Emotion Regulation.,"In recent decades, a growing body of literature has focused on emotion regulation (ER), which refers to the ability to implement strategies in order to modulate emotional responses and reach desirable goals. To date, impaired ER (i.e., emotion dysregulation) has been identified as a transdiagnostic factor across a wide range of psychopathological conditions, which shows the importance of improving patients' ability to regulate negative and positive emotions in clinical practice. In addition to the increasing evidence showing its efficacy in the treatment of several clinical conditions, virtual reality (VR) has recently emerged as a potentially powerful tool for enhancing ER, thus breaking new ground in the development of cutting-edge transdiagnostic interventions. In the present narrative review, we will provide an overview of the existing evidence about VR-based interventions in the field of ER, emphasizing the promising findings and the barriers that still have to be addressed. To this aim, the available VR-based literature will be analysed in relation to four categories of ER strategies: Situational strategies, attentional strategies, cognitive strategies and response modulation strategies. Furthermore, new emerging fields of research targeting innovative aspects of ER will be highlighted, including the use of VR to promote positive emotions and interpersonal ER skills. Besides, its cost-effectiveness will be discussed, taking into account the costs for both developers (e.g., clinicians and researchers) and end-users. Finally, future directions in this promising field of research will be outlined.",2021.0,61.0,15.0,{'name': 'Clinical psychology & psychotherapy'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Colombo2021VirtualRF,\n author = {D.

To characterise the effect of reappraisal on risk taking, we systematically varied both the goal of regulation and the value of the decision options. Participants engaged in two reappraisal strategies with opposite goals, to increase (“emphasise”) or decrease (“de-emphasise”) the importance of an upcoming decision, during the presentation of cues signalling monetary decisions. The expected value of taking a risk was systematically varied across decisions such that a risky choice could be beneficial or disadvantageous. Reappraisal strategies increased or decreased risk taking in accordance both with regulation goals and expected value information.

1314,733761e62fa31ddbccc29dcee16bb15bfb2eaf1a,Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.,"BACKGROUND
A previous Cochrane review (James 2005) showed that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders; however, questions remain regarding (1) the relative efficacy of CBT versus non-CBT active treatments; (2) the relative efficacy of CBT versus medication and the combination of CBT and medication versus placebo; and (3) the long-term effects of CBT. 


OBJECTIVES
To examine (1) whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison with (a) wait-list controls; (b) active non-CBT treatments (i.e. psychological placebo, bibliotherapy and treatment as usual (TAU)); and (c) medication and the combination of medication and CBT versus placebo; and (2) the long-term effects of CBT.


SEARCH METHODS
Searches for this review included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which consists of relevant randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases－The Cochrane Library (1970 to July 2012), EMBASE, (1970 to July 2012) MEDLINE (1970 to July 2012) and PsycINFO (1970 to July 2012).


SELECTION CRITERIA
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT versus waiting list, active control conditions, TAU or medication were reviewed. All participants must have met the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for an anxiety diagnosis, excluding simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and elective mutism.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by three reviewers independently. For the dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis, the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random-effects model, with pooling of data via the inverse variance method of weighting, was used. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Continuous data on each child's anxiety symptoms were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD).


MAIN RESULTS
Forty-one studies consisting of 1806 participants were included in the analyses. The studies involved children and adolescents with anxiety of mild to moderate severity in university and community clinics and school settings. For the primary outcome of remission of any anxiety diagnosis for CBT versus waiting list controls, intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses with 26 studies and 1350 participants showed an OR of 0.13 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.19, Z = 10.26, P < 0.0001), but with evidence of moderate heterogeneity (P = 0.04, I² = 33%). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 6.0 (95% CI 7.5 to 4.6). No difference in outcome was noted between individual, group and family/parental formats. ITT analyses revealed that CBT was no more effective than non-CBT active control treatments (six studies, 426 participants) or TAU in reducing anxiety diagnoses (two studies, 88 participants). The few controlled follow-up studies (n = 4) indicate that treatment gains in the remission of anxiety diagnosis are not statistically significant.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Cognitive behavioural therapy is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders; however, the evidence suggesting that CBT is more effective than active controls or TAU or medication at follow-up, is limited and inconclusive.",2013.0,67.0,684.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '\n          CD004690\n        ', 'name': 'The Cochrane database of systematic reviews'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{James2013CognitiveBT,\n author = {A.

Control over the endogenous pain modulatory system is a particularly important target because it could enable a unique mechanism for clinical control over pain. Here, we found that by using real-time functional MRI (rtfMRI) to guide training, subjects were able to learn to control activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a region putatively involved in pain perception and regulation. When subjects deliberately induced increases or decreases in rACC fMRI activation, there was a corresponding change in the perception of pain caused by an applied noxious thermal stimulus. Control experiments demonstrated that this effect was not observed after similar training conducted without rtfMRI information, or using rtfMRI information derived from a different brain region, or sham rtfMRI information derived previously from a different subject. Chronic pain patients were also trained to control activation in rACC and reported decreases in the ongoing level of chronic pain after training. These findings show that individuals can gain voluntary control over activation in a specific brain region given appropriate training, that voluntary control over activation in rACC leads to control over pain perception, and that these effects were powerful enough to impact severe, chronic clinical pain.",2005.0,124.0,821.0,"{'volume': '102 51', 'pages': '\n          18626-31\n        ', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{DeCharms2005ControlOB,\n author = {R.

Using data from four independent samples of adolescents and college students (n = 1,268), we estimated the association between trait negative urgency and emotion regulation strategies that reflect either reflexive responses or disengagement. We verified these effects in two ecological momentary assessment samples (EMA; n = 198). In retrospective data, negative urgency was correlated with using more disengagement or reflexive emotion regulation strategies relative to engagement strategies, r = .39, .38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.30, 0.49], [0.18, 0.57].

Emotion regulation (ER) supports multiple individual functions and promotes mental health and wellbeing. Among the tools that may be used to help people in managing their affective states, videogames are reaching attention and are showing positive effects. Yet, little is known about their effectiveness.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to assess the amount and quality of studies investigating the effects and modalities of the use of videogames for ER.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A systematic literature search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Subsequently, according to expert advice other few studies have been added.


RESULTS
Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; they can be categorized into three groups, namely (1) cross-sectional and qualitative studies, (2) experimental studies investigating the effects of videogame experience on ER and (3) ER intervention with serious games.


DISCUSSION
Discussion of the reviewed studies highlights that frequent gaming with commercial games offers more opportunities for ER improvement (related to gameplay and enjoyment of fictional properties) than limited-time experiences, such as those supported by bespoke serious games. This research area is still in its infancy and findings need to be interpreted with caution; furthermore, future reviews are encouraged to include clinical populations.


CONCLUSION
Videogames offer several opportunities for ER and a challenge for educational and psychological interventions.",2018.0,84.0,149.0,"{'volume': '7 2', 'pages': '\n          85-99\n        ', 'name': 'Games for health journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Villani2018VideogamesFE,\n author = {D.

The hypothesis posits that SD (ie, the negative experience of being excluded from the majority group) is the common denominator of 5 major schizophrenia risk factors: urban upbringing, migration, childhood trauma, low intelligence, and drug abuse. The purpose of this update of the literature since 2005 is to answer 2 questions: (1) What is the evidence that SD explains the association between schizophrenia and these risk factors? (2) What is the evidence that SD leads to sensitization of the mesolimbic DA system? The evidence for SD as the mechanism underlying the increased risk was found to be strongest for migration and childhood trauma, while the evidence for urban upbringing, low intelligence, and drug abuse is suggestive, but insufficient. Some other findings that may support the hypothesis are the association between risk for schizophrenia and African American ethnicity, unemployment, single status, hearing impairment, autism, illiteracy, short stature, Klinefelter syndrome, and, possibly, sexual minority status. While the evidence that SD in humans leads to sensitization of the mesolimbic DA system is not sufficient, due to lack of studies, the evidence for this in animals is strong. The authors argue that the SD hypothesis provides a parsimonious and plausible explanation for a number of epidemiological findings that cannot be explained solely by genetic confounding.",2013.0,69.0,337.0,"{'volume': '39 6', 'pages': '\n          1180-6\n        ', 'name': 'Schizophrenia bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Selten2013TheSD,\n author = {J.

It has been hypothesized that a mismatch in the timing of maturation between subcortical regions (involved in affect and reward processing) and prefrontal regions (involved in cognitive control) underlies the increase in risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors observed during adolescence. Most support for this ‘dual systems' hypothesis relies on cross-sectional data, and it is not known whether this pattern is present at an individual level. The current study utilizes longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to describe the developmental trajectories of regions associated with risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors, namely, the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Structural trajectories of gray matter volumes were analyzed using FreeSurfer in 33 participants aged 7-30 years, each of whom had at least three high-quality MRI scans spanning three developmental periods: late childhood, adolescence and early adulthood (total 152 scans). The majority of individuals in our sample showed relatively earlier maturation in the amygdala and/or NAcc compared to the PFC, providing evidence for a mismatch in the timing of structural maturation between these structures. We then related individual developmental trajectories to retrospectively assessed self-reported risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence in a subsample of 24 participants. Analysis of this smaller sample failed to find a relationship between the presence of a mismatch in brain maturation and risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors during adolescence. Taken together, it appears that the developmental mismatch in structural brain maturation is present in neurotypically developing individuals. This pattern of development did not directly relate to self-reported behaviors at an individual level in our sample, highlighting the need for prospective studies combining anatomical and behavioral measures.",2014.0,51.0,292.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '147 - 160', 'name': 'Developmental Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mills2014TheDM,\n author = {K.

Thus, the impact of such interventions is minimized by a misalignment between intervention design and user behavior. Digital micro interventions are highly focused interventions delivered in the context of a person’s daily life with little burden on the individual. We propose that these interventions have the potential to disruptively expand the reach of beneficial therapeutics by lowering the bar for entry to an intervention and the effort needed for purposeful engagement. This paper provides a conceptualization of digital micro interventions, their component parts, and principles guiding their use as building blocks of a larger therapeutic process (ie, digital micro intervention care).

Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that each one depends upon interactions between pFC, interpreted as implementing cognitive control, and limbic regions, interpreted as mediating emotional responses. However, no study has directly compared distraction with reappraisal, and it remains unclear whether they draw upon different neural mechanisms and have different emotional consequences. The present fMRI study compared distraction and reappraisal and found both similarities and differences between the two forms of emotion regulation. Both resulted in decreased negative affect, decreased activation in the amygdala, and increased activation in prefrontal and cingulate regions. Relative to distraction, reappraisal led to greater decreases in negative affect and to greater increases in a network of regions associated with processing affective meaning (medial prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices). Relative to reappraisal, distraction led to greater decreases in amygdala activation and to greater increases in activation in prefrontal and parietal regions. Taken together, these data suggest that distraction and reappraisal differentially engage neural systems involved in attentional deployment and cognitive reframing and have different emotional consequences.",2010.0,116.0,553.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '248-262', 'name': 'Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McRae2010TheNB,\n author = {Kateri McRae and Brent L.

Effective emotion regulation involves the ability to accurately detect and evaluate cues related to physiological reactions to stressful events, accompanied by appropriate regulation strategies that temper and influence the emotional response. There is compelling evidence demonstrating links between poor or disrupted awareness of sensory information, or interoceptive awareness, and difficulties with emotion regulation. This paper presents a framework, based on psychological and neurobiological research, for understanding how interoceptive awareness facilitates regulation and an integrated sense of self, and thus contributes to health and well-being. A mind-body therapeutic approach called mindful awareness in body-oriented therapy (MABT), uniquely designed to teach fundamental skills of interoceptive awareness, is described. MABT develops the distinct interoceptive awareness capacities of identifying, accessing, and appraising internal bodily signals that are identified in physiological models as the critical components of interoception for emotion regulation. The explanatory model is that the development of these key interoceptive capacities improves sensory (physical and emotional) awareness, reduces distress, and improves regulation. Strategies for teaching and learning interoceptive awareness are not well-developed in mindfulness or psychotherapeutic approaches, particularly important for people who may have difficulty attending to interoceptive awareness due to stress, chronic pain or trauma. To address this issue, MABT provides an individualized protocol for scaffolding interoceptive awareness through a combination of psychoeducation and somatic approaches explicitly addressing difficulties with interoceptive processing. Clinical vignettes are included to provide exemplars of this approach and to highlight key components of the therapeutic process. Results from research are also included to highlight the acceptability, safety, health outcomes, and possible mechanisms underlying the MABT approach.",2018.0,63.0,183.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Price2018InteroceptiveAS,\n author = {C.

Emotion Regulation (ER) may be an important protective resource for these adolescents. The present study tested the links between ER and internalizing and externalizing problems in 131 first- and second-generation Chinese American adolescents.

The author develops this idea so as to yield a Humean conception of practical rationality. Nevertheless, one of the crucial features of the approach is not distinctively Humean and sets it apart from the most familiar neo-Humean approaches: an agent’s practical rationality has to do with the presence and form of his cognitive activity, as well as with how it engages his emotional and motivational states, rather than with the impact that his actions have on his utility or with how his actions relate to his expected utility. The approach also contrasts with full-information accounts of rationality. The paper ends with a discussion of our interest in operating with the conception of practical rationality that emerges from this approach, even if it is so demanding that it would be humanly impossible to be perfectly practically rational.",2008.0,0.0,17.0,"{'volume': '77', 'pages': '1-33', 'name': 'Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Svavarsdóttir2008TheVO,\n author = {S.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes.",2002.0,83.0,3649.0,"{'volume': '39 3', 'pages': '\n          281-91\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gross2002EmotionRA,\n author = {J.

1353,76c5bea02f6d6d6a7acd8bbb09425606edd213f1,Wearable and automotive systems for affect recognition from physiology,"Novel systems and algorithms have been designed and built to recognize affective patterns in physiological signals. Experiments were conducted for evaluation of the new systems and algorithms in three types of settings: a highly constrained laboratory setting, a largely unconstrained ambulatory environment, and a less unconstrained automotive environment. The laboratory experiment was designed to test for the presence of unique physiological patterns given a relatively motionless seated subject, intentionally expressing one of eight different emotions. This experiment generated a large dataset of physiological signals containing many day-today variations, and the proposed features contributed to a success rate of 81% for discriminating all eight emotions and up to 100% for subsets of emotion based on similar emotion qualities. For experiments in a largely unconstrained ambulatory setting, new wearable computer systems and sensors were developed and tested on subjects who walked, jogged, talked, and otherwise went about daily activities. Although physical motion often overwhelmed affective signals in this context, the systems developed in this thesis are currently useful as activity monitors, providing an image diary correlated with physiological signals. A third experiment was conducted in the natural but physically constrained environment of an automobile, generating a large database of physiological signals covering over 40 hours of driving data. This experiment was designed to induce varying amounts of stress in three conditions: rest, city diving and highway driving. Algorithms for detecting driver stress achieved a recognition rates of 96% for stress ratings based on task conditions and 89% accuracy using ratings of perceived stress from driver questionnaires. The results of second by second video coding of stressors by independent coders showed highly significant correlations with physiological features (up to r = .77 for over 4000 samples). Together, these three experiments show a range of success in recognizing affect from physiology, highlighting the need for more automatic context sensing in unconstrained conditions, and showing high recognition rates given somewhat constrained conditions. The recognition rates obtained thus far lend support to the hypothesis that many emotional differences can be automatically discriminated in patterns of physiological changes.

Effects of APAs' personality types and emotional feedback strategies on learning experiences and performance were assessed experimentally using a virtual Tai Chi training system. Fifty six participants completed the experiment. Results showed that positive emotional feedback strategy led to better learning experiences and performance than negative feedback strategy. Moreover, personality type had significant effect on learning. Choleric APAs led to better performance than Phlegmatic APAs. Personality types moderated the effect of emotional feedback on learning satisfaction.

In this study, we hypothesized that emotion expression alters behavior in morally charged negotiation. We investigated the impact of facial displays of discrete emotions, specifically anger and sadness, in a morally charged multi-issue negotiation task. Our results indicate that if a negotiator associated moral significance to the object of the negotiation, displays of anger resulted in reduced concession making whereas displays of sadness increased concession making. Moral significance of the issues fostered an emotional matching mechanism of sorrow, where a sorrow expression from one party elicited a sorrow expression from the other.

Methods: To address this deficit, employing PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review aimed to summarize empirical evidence regarding a range of interpersonal and intrapersonal MMO well-being outcomes for those older than 13. Results: Three databases identified 18 relevant English language studies, 13 quantitative, 4 qualitative and 1 mixed method published between January 2012 and August 2020. A narrative synthesis methodology was employed, whilst validated tools appraised risk of bias and study quality. Conclusions: A significant positive relationship between playing MMOs and social well-being was concluded, irrespective of one's age and/or their casual or immersed gaming patterns. This finding should be considered in the light of the limited: (a) game platforms investigated; (b) well-being constructs identified; and (c) research quality (i.e., modest).

When people are fearful of something, they tend to avoid the feared objects, activities, or situations. Although this avoidance might help reduce feelings of fear in the short term, over the long term it can make the fear become even worse. In such situations, a psychologist might recommend a program of exposure therapy in order to help break the pattern of avoidance and fear. In this form of therapy, psychologists create a safe environment in which to ""expose"" individuals to the things they fear and avoid.

In character-based storytelling, plot generation is based on the behaviour of autonomous characters. In this paper, we describe user interaction in a fully-implemented prototype of an interactive storytelling system. We describe the planning techniques used to control autonomous characters, which derive from HTN planning. The hierarchical task network representing a characters' potential behaviour constitute a target for user intervention, both in terms of narrative goals and in terms of physical actions carried out on stage. We introduce two different mechanisms for user interaction: direct physical interaction with virtual objects and interaction with synthetic characters through speech understanding. Physical intervention exists for the user in on-stage interaction through an invisible avatar: this enables him to remove or displace objects of narrative significance that are resources for character's actions, thus causing these actions to fail. Through linguistic intervention, the user can influence the autonomous characters in various ways, by providing them with information that will solve some of their narrative goals, instructing them to take direct action, or giving advice on the most appropriate behaviour. We illustrate these functionalities with examples of system-generated behaviour and conclude with a discussion of scalability issues.",2002.0,34.0,202.0,{'pages': '318-325'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cavazza2002InteractingWV,\n author = {M.

Laird ({rmarinie,laird}@umich.edu) Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, 2260 Hayward Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA augmented Soar with a new module, our emotion system, described below. Abstract Existing computational models of emotion are primarily concerned with creating more realistic agents, with recent efforts looking into matching human data, including qualitative emotional responses and dynamics. In this paper, our work focuses on the functional benefits of emotion in a cognitive system where emotional feedback helps drive reinforcement learning. Our system is an integration of our emotion theory with Soar, an independently-motivated cognitive architecture. Integrating Appraisal Theories and Cognition Our work is grounded in appraisal theories (Roseman & Smith, 2001, for an overview) and Newell’s (1990) PEACTIDM (pronounced PEE-ACK-TEH-DIM). Appraisal theories hypothesize that an emotional reaction to a stimulus is the result of an evaluation of that stimulus along a number of dimensions, most of which relate it to current goals. The particular appraisals that our system uses is a subset of the appraisals described by Scherer (2001) (see Table 1). The subset our system uses can be split into two main groups: appraisals that help the agent decide which stimulus attend to (Suddenness, Unpredictability, Intrinsic Pleasantness, Relevance) and those appraisals that help the agent decide what do in response to an attended stimulus (causal agent and motive, outcome probability, discrepancy from expectation, conduciveness, control, power). Appraisal theories generally do not give much detail about how appraisals are generated or why. That is, the details of the process are left unspecified. Thus, computational models must fill in those details, but with little or no direction from appraisal theory, the details are often arbitrary. PEACTIDM, on the other hand, describes necessary and sufficient processes for immediate behavior (see Table 2). The PEACTIDM hypothesis is that stimuli are Perceived and Encoded so cognition can work with them. Then Attend focuses cognition on one stimulus to process, which is then Comprehended. Tasking is managing tasks and goals (e.g., in response to a change in the situation), whereas Intend is determining what actions to take. Decode and Motor are translating cognitive choices into physical actions. PEACTIDM, however, does not describe the data upon which these processes operate. The basis of our theory is that appraisals are the information upon which the PEACTIDM theory operates (Marinier & Laird, 2006) (see Table 3). For example, the attend process determines what to process next based on appraisal information generated by the perceive and encode processes (i.e., suddenness, unpredictability, intrinsic pleasantness, and relevance). Thus, appraisals not only determine the information that PEACTIDM processes, PEACTIDM also imposes dependencies between the appraisals (e.g., the appraisals for Comprehend cannot occur until after appraisals for Attend have been generated). Keywords: Emotion, reinforcement learning, intrinsic reward, cognitive architecture, appraisal theories. Introduction Folk psychology often casts emotions in a negative light. For example, in Star Trek, Vulcans are portrayed as superior to humans because they are not distracted by emotions, and thus can make purely logical decisions. As far back as Phineas Gage, however, it has been clear that emotions play a critical role in proper functioning in humans, and over the last several decades psychological research has explored how emotions influence behavior. We are interested in exploring how some of the functional capabilities of emotion can be utilized in computational agents; that is, we want to bring the functionality of emotions to artificial intelligence. This is in contrast to most existing computational models of emotion, which focused primarily on creating believable agents (Gratch & Marsella, 2004; Hudlicka, 2004), modeling human data (Marsella & Gratch 2006; Gratch, Marsella, and Mao, 2006), or entertainment (Loyall, Neal Reilly, Bates, and Weyhrauch, 2004). In this paper, we present work in which reinforcement learning is driven by emotion. Intuitively, feelings serve as a reward signal. The agent learns to behave in a way that makes it feel good while avoiding feeling bad. Coupled with a task that the agent wants to complete, the agent learns that completing the task makes it feel good. This work contributes not only to research on emotion in providing a functional computational grounding for feelings, but it also contributes to research in reinforcement learning by providing a detailed theory of the origin and basis of intrinsically-motivated reward.

However, a filter bank that is designed from perceptual evidence is not always guaranteed to be the best in a statistical modelling framework where the end goal is for example emotion classification. This has fuelled the emerging trend of learning representations from raw speech especially using deep learning neural networks. In particular, a combination of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have gained great traction for the intrinsic property of LSTM in learning contextual information crucial for emotion recognition; and CNNs been used for its ability to overcome the scalability problem of regular neural networks. In this paper, we show that there are still opportunities to improve the performance of emotion recognition from the raw speech by exploiting the properties of CNN in modelling contextual information. We propose the use of parallel convolutional layers to harness multiple temporal resolutions in the feature extraction block that is jointly trained with the LSTM based classification network for the emotion recognition task.

We sought to characterize 24-h momentary affective antecedents of alcohol and marijuana use in depressed youth. Thirty-eight participants (84% females, 15–22 years old), all clinically depressed and substance users, completed four to six daily momentary reports for two weeks using a hand-held device. The reports included participants' momentary positive and negative affect (PA and NA) and their recent consumption of alcohol and/or marijuana. Statistical models compared affect characteristics during 24-h periods preceding substance use with affect at other times. Because most participants were females, we also examined data for girls alone. Participants reported 394 total substance use events.

Sixty-nine students aged 7–12 took part in one of two different 10-week versions of the program (structured versus unstructured) to determine their relative effectiveness. Results suggested that both program variants led to improvements in emotion regulation abilities, social skills, and behavior at school and home, maintained at 6-week follow-up. However, the structured intervention generally led to superior treatment outcomes. These results suggest that improvements in social–emotional functioning can be achieved for students with HFASD through time-limited school-based interventions.

The theory holds that an attempt to control the mind introduces 2 processes: (a) an operating process that promotes the intended change by searching for mental contents consistent with the intended state and (b) a monitoring process that tests whether the operating process is needed by searching for mental contents inconsistent with the intended state. The operating process requires greater cognitive capacity and normally has more pronounced cognitive effects than the monitoring process, and the 2 working together thus promote whatever degree of mental control is enjoyed. Under conditions that reduce capacity, however, the monitoring process may supersede the operating process and thus enhance the person's sensitivity to mental contents that are the ironic opposite of those that are intended.",1994.0,117.0,2330.0,"{'volume': '101 1', 'pages': '\n          34-52\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wegner1994IronicPO,\n author = {D.

However, the traditional recommendation algorithms cannot meet user's fast and accurate recommended requirements in the IoT environment. In the face of a large-volume data, the method of finding neighborhood by comparing whole user information will result in a low recommendation efficiency. In addition, the traditional recommendation system ignores the inherent connection between user's preference and time. In reality, the interest of the user varies over time. Recommendation system should provide users accurate and fast with the change of time. To address this, we propose a novel recommendation model based on time correlation coefficient and an improved K-means with cuckoo search (CSK-means), called TCCF. The clustering method can cluster similar users together for further quick and accurate recommendation. Moreover, an effective and personalized recommendation model based on preference pattern (PTCCF) is designed to improve the quality of TCCF. It can provide a higher quality recommendation by analyzing the user's behaviors. The extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets of MovieLens and Douban, and the precision of our model have improved about 5.2 percent compared with the MCoC model.

Recent studies suggest the involvement of frontal cortical regions in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotion regulation. However, within-subject inter-regional connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the context of affect regulation is unknown. Here, using psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that activity in specific areas of the frontal cortex (dorsolateral, dorsal medial, anterior cingulate, orbital) covaries with amygdala activity and that this functional connectivity is dependent on the reappraisal task. Moreover, strength of amygdala coupling with orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex predicts the extent of attenuation of negative affect following reappraisal.

1409,7bc0ee95aa6ea393b4378983b614817b15cfdec6,A dual-process model of early substance use: tests in two diverse populations of adolescents.,"OBJECTIVE
We tested a dual-process model based on behavioral and emotional regulation constructs, which posits that good self-control and poor regulation make independent contributions and have different types of pathways to outcomes. The utility of the model for predicting substance use was tested in two diverse populations of younger adolescents.


METHOD
A survey was administered in classrooms to middle-school students in Westchester County, New York (N = 601) and Honolulu, Hawaii (N = 881). The New York sample was 8% African American, 5% Asian American, 47% Caucasian, 31% Hispanic, and 9% other ethnicity. The Hawaii sample was 21% Asian American, 8% Caucasian, 26% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 34% Filipino, and 10% other ethnicity. Structural equation modeling analyses tested pathways from the four regulation variables through six hypothesized mediators to a criterion construct of substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana).


RESULTS
Results were replicated across samples and were consistent with prediction. Unique contributions were found for good self-control and poor regulation, including both behavioral and emotional aspects. Good self-control had an inverse effect on substance use primarily through relations to higher levels of protective factors (e.g., academic competence). Poor regulation independently had a risk-promoting effect on substance use through relations to higher levels of risk factors (e.g., negative life events).


CONCLUSIONS
Two field studies showed the dual-process model is robust across different populations. Substance prevention programs should consider approaches for enhancing good self-control as well as procedures for reducing poor regulation and minimizing its impact.

1413,7c286956bb3fb15cea109be7ccfeae6807db4a61,Annual Research Review: Digital health interventions for children and young people with mental health problems – a systematic and meta‐review,"BACKGROUND
Digital health interventions (DHIs), including computer-assisted therapy, smartphone apps and wearable technologies, are heralded as having enormous potential to improve uptake and accessibility, efficiency, clinical effectiveness and personalisation of mental health interventions. It is generally assumed that DHIs will be preferred by children and young people (CYP) given their ubiquitous digital activity. However, it remains uncertain whether: DHIs for CYP are clinically and cost-effective, CYP prefer DHIs to traditional services, DHIs widen access and how they should be evaluated and adopted by mental health services. This review evaluates the evidence-base for DHIs and considers the key research questions and approaches to evaluation and implementation.


METHODS
We conducted a meta-review of scoping, narrative, systematic or meta-analytical reviews investigating the effectiveness of DHIs for mental health problems in CYP. We also updated a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of DHIs for CYP published in the last 3 years.


RESULTS
Twenty-one reviews were included in the meta-review. The findings provide some support for the clinical benefit of DHIs, particularly computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT), for depression and anxiety in adolescents and young adults. The systematic review identified 30 new RCTs evaluating DHIs for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, anxiety, depression, psychosis, eating disorders and PTSD. The benefits of DHIs in managing ADHD, autism, psychosis and eating disorders are uncertain, and evidence is lacking regarding the cost-effectiveness of DHIs.


CONCLUSIONS
Key methodological limitations make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from existing clinical trials of DHIs. Issues include variable uptake and engagement with DHIs, lack of an agreed typology/taxonomy for DHIs, small sample sizes, lack of blinded outcome assessment, combining different comparators, short-term follow-up and poor specification of the level of human support. Research and practice recommendations are presented that address the key research questions and methodological issues for the evaluation and clinical implementation of DHIs for CYP.",2017.0,143.0,458.0,"{'volume': '58', 'pages': '474–503', 'name': 'Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hollis2017AnnualRR,\n author = {C.

Little is known about lifetime prevalence or age of onset of DSM-IV disorders.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication.


DESIGN AND SETTING
Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 using the fully structured World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.


PARTICIPANTS
Nine thousand two hundred eighty-two English-speaking respondents aged 18 years and older.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse-control, and substance use disorders.


RESULTS
Lifetime prevalence estimates are as follows: anxiety disorders, 28.8%; mood disorders, 20.8%; impulse-control disorders, 24.8%; substance use disorders, 14.6%; any disorder, 46.4%. Median age of onset is much earlier for anxiety (11 years) and impulse-control (11 years) disorders than for substance use (20 years) and mood (30 years) disorders. Half of all lifetime cases start by age 14 years and three fourths by age 24 years. Later onsets are mostly of comorbid conditions, with estimated lifetime risk of any disorder at age 75 years (50.8%) only slightly higher than observed lifetime prevalence (46.4%). Lifetime prevalence estimates are higher in recent cohorts than in earlier cohorts and have fairly stable intercohort differences across the life course that vary in substantively plausible ways among sociodemographic subgroups.


CONCLUSIONS
About half of Americans will meet the criteria for a DSM-IV disorder sometime in their life, with first onset usually in childhood or adolescence. Interventions aimed at prevention or early treatment need to focus on youth.",2005.0,58.0,17310.0,"{'volume': '62 6', 'pages': '\n          593-602\n        ', 'name': 'Archives of general psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kessler2005LifetimePA,\n author = {R.

There are both genetic and environmental contributions to the structure and function of this circuitry. We posit that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of faulty emotion regulation. Indeed, the prefrontal cortex receives a major serotonergic projection, which is dysfunctional in individuals who show impulsive violence. Individuals vulnerable to faulty regulation of negative emotion are at risk for violence and aggression. Research on the neural circuitry of emotion regulation suggests new avenues of intervention for such at-risk populations.",2000.0,70.0,1810.0,"{'volume': '289 5479', 'pages': '\n          591-4\n        ', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Davidson2000DysfunctionIT,\n author = {R.

Respondents were 12-13 years old in 1994 and 16-17 in 1998. Controlling for demographic and contextual factors, self-regulation--but not risk proneness--was significantly (modestly) associated with overall sexual risk taking 4 years later. Analyses of individual sexual behaviors indicated that self-regulation may affect choices made after becoming sexually active (e.g., number of partners) rather than the initiation of sexual activity. Measures of parent and peer influence had independent effects on sexual risk taking but did not moderate the effects of self-regulation and risk proneness.

Multi-modal social signal classification is insufficient for understanding emotional expressions. Mainly, because many communicative, emotional expressions are not directly related to internal emotional states. Moreover, the recognition of the expression's direction is neglected so far. Even if social signals reveal emotional aspects, the recognition with signal classifiers cannot explain internal appraisal or regulation processes. Using that information is one approach for building cognitive empathic agents with the ability to address observations and motives in an empathic dialogue. In this paper, we introduce a computational model of user emotions for empathic agents. It combines a simulation of appraisal and regulation processes with a social signal interpretation taking directions of expressions into account. Our evaluation shows that social signal sequences can be related to emotion regulation processes. Their recognition and using appraisal and regulation knowledge enables our agent to react empathically.",2018.0,80.0,21.0,{'pages': '497-506'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Gebhard2018MARSSIMO,\n author = {Patrick Gebhard and T.

Behavioural activation has attracted increased interest in recent years. It has been over 5 years since our meta-analyses summarised the evidence supporting and this systematic review updates those findings and examines moderators of treatment effect. Method Randomised trials of behavioural activation for depression versus controls or anti-depressant medication were identified using electronic database searches, previous reviews and reference lists. Data on symptom level and study level moderators were extracted and analysed using meta-analysis, sub-group analysis and meta-regression respectively. Results Twenty six randomised controlled trials including 1524 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. A random effects meta-analysis of symptom level post treatment showed behavioural activation to be superior to controls (SMD −0.74 CI −0.91 to −0.56, k = 25, N = 1088) and medication (SMD −0.42 CI −0.83 to-0.00, k = 4, N = 283). Study quality was low in the majority of studies and follow- up time periods short. There was no indication of publication bias and subgroup analysis showed limited association between moderators and effect size. Conclusions The results in this meta-analysis support and strengthen the evidence base indicating Behavioural Activation is an effective treatment for depression.

These characters, known as pedagogical agents, can take on different roles, such as tutors or companions. Research has highlighted the importance of various characteristics of virtual agents, including their voice or non-verbal behaviors. Little attention has been paid to the gender-specific design of pedagogical agents, although gender has an important influence on the educational process. In this article, we perform an extensive review of the literature regarding the impact of the gender of pedagogical agents on academic outcomes. Based on a detailed review of 59 articles, we analyze the influence of pedagogical agents' gender on students' academic self-evaluations and achievements to answer the following questions: (1) Do students perceive virtual agents differently depending on their own gender and the gender of the agent? (2) Does the gender of pedagogical agents influence students' academic performance and self-evaluations? (3) Are there tasks or academic situations to which a male virtual agent is better suited than a female virtual agent, and vice versa, according to empirical evidence? (4) How do a virtual agent's pedagogical roles impact these results? (5) How do a virtual agent's appearance and interactive capacities impact these results? (6) Are androgynous virtual agents a potential solution to combatting gender stereotypes? This review provides important insight to researchers on how to approach gender when designing pedagogical agents in virtual learning environments.",2022.0,103.0,4.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Armando2022TheIO,\n author = {Marjorie Armando and M.

In this article, we demonstrate how the science of emotion regulation can be translated into practical steps for educating teachers and students in schools. We begin with the crucial role of supporting educators in developing their own emotion regulation skills. We also discuss concrete and accessible tools that can be used to support both educators' own skill development and that of their students. We demonstrate how educators can integrate the teaching of emotion regulation through direct instruction, its integration into existing curricula, and daily practices and routines. The examples we provide are part of RULER, an evidence-based, whole school approach to social and emotional learning (SEL) that was developed at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. RULER is grounded in the theory of emotional intelligence, which emphasizes the critical role of emotion regulation in healthy development.

The task of empathetic dialogue generation is proposed to address this problem. However, lacking external knowledge makes it difficult to perceive implicit emotions from limited dialogue history. To address the above challenges, we propose to leverage multi-type knowledge, i.e, the commonsense knowledge and emotional lexicon, to explicitly understand and express emotions in empathetic dialogue generation. We first enrich the dialogue history by jointly interacting with two-type knowledge and construct an emotional context graph. Then we introduce a multi-type knowledge-aware context encoder to learn emotional context representations and distill emotional signals, which are the prerequisites to predicate emotions expressed in responses. Finally, we propose an emotional cross-attention mechanism to exploit the emotional dependencies between the emotional context graph and the target empathetic response. Conducted on a benchmark dataset, extensive experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of automatic metrics and human evaluations.",2020.0,55.0,15.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': 'arXiv: Computation and Language'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2020TowardsED,\n author = {Qintong Li and Piji Li and Zhumin Chen and Z.

A developmental framework was used to organize 58 studies of coping involving over 250 age comparisons or correlations with age. The framework was based on (1) conceptualizations of coping as regulation to suggest ages at which coping should show developmental shifts (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2009), and (2) notions of hierarchical families to clarify which coping categories should be distinguished at each age (Skinner, Edge, Altman, & Sherwood, 2003). Developmental patterns in coping (e.g., problem-solving, distraction, support-seeking, escape) were scrutinized with a focus on common age shifts. Two kinds of age trends were discerned, one reflecting increases in coping capacities, as seen in support-seeking (from reliance on adults to more self-reliance), problem-solving (from instrumental action to planful problem-solving), and distraction (adding cognitive to behavioural strategies); and one reflecting improvements in the deployment of different coping strategies according to which ones are most effective in dealing with specific kinds of stressors.

A systematic search has been conducted for required articles which have been published between 1990 and 2015. Only those studies have been included in the review which reported either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression in their findings. Review indicates that individualistic cultures prefer emotional expression to regulate emotions while collectivistic cultures, such as in Pakistan, focus more on expressive suppression. Emotional suppression can cause mental disease, physiological illness, and poor social and psychological adjustment. To sum up, culture predicts whether individuals are motivated to express or suppress their emotions. Collectivist culture encourages greatest control on emotion expression while interacting with family and friends with more emphasis on maintaining social harmony. On the other hand, individualistic culture endorses comparatively less expression of negative emotions especially towards strangers.

Furthermore, this cross-cultural work has failed to differentiate between support from friends and from families, and between global perceptions of available support and the support received after an event. In this study, 140 respondents from UK (N = 72) and Spain (N = 68) completed scales assessing cultural collectivism (Bierbrauer, Meyer, & Wolfradt, 1994), measures of perceived global support (Cohen & Hoberman, 1983), and received social support, as well as additional indices of self-esteem (Rosenberg, 1965) and life satisfaction (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985). Path analytic analyses found that Spanish respondents were, as expected, more collectivist than their British counterparts, and that collectivism predicted reported family support after an event and global perceptions of available support. Global perceived support and support from friends after an event were significant correlates of self- esteem, which, along with global support and support from family members, was a significant correlate of life satisfaction.

Manuel Castells is one of the world's leading thinkers on the new information age, hailed by The Economist as ""the first significant philosopher of cyberspace,"" and by Christian Science Monitor as ""a pioneer who has hacked out a logical, well-documented, and coherent picture of early 21st century civilization, even as it rockets forward largely in a blur."" Now, in The Internet Galaxy, this brilliantly insightful writer speculates on how the Internet will change our lives. 
Castells believes that we are ""entering, full speed, the Internet Galaxy, in the midst of informed bewilderment."" His aim in this exciting and profound work is to help us to understand how the Internet came into being, and how it is affecting every area of human life--from work, politics, planning and development, media, and privacy, to our social interaction and life in the home. We are at ground zero of the new network society. In this book, its major commentator reveals the Internet's huge capacity to liberate, but also its ability to marginalize and exclude those who do not have access to it. Castells provides no glib solutions, but asks us all to take responsibility for the future of this new information age.

1450,7ea961c9ac8fa9b7ea74044ac722ec7b92936392,Real-time neuroimaging and cognitive monitoring using wearable dry EEG,"Goal: We present and evaluate a wearable high-density dry-electrode EEG system and an open-source software framework for online neuroimaging and state classification. Methods: The system integrates a 64-channel dry EEG form factor with wireless data streaming for online analysis. A real-time software framework is applied, including adaptive artifact rejection, cortical source localization, multivariate effective connectivity inference, data visualization, and cognitive state classification from connectivity features using a constrained logistic regression approach (ProxConn). We evaluate the system identification methods on simulated 64-channel EEG data. Then, we evaluate system performance, using ProxConn and a benchmark ERP method, in classifying response errors in nine subjects using the dry EEG system. Results: Simulations yielded high accuracy (AUC = 0.97 ± 0.021) for real-time cortical connectivity estimation. Response error classification using cortical effective connectivity [short-time directdirected transfer function (sdDTF)] was significantly above chance with similar performance (AUC) for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.09) and LCMV (0.72 ± 0.08) source localization. Cortical ERPbased classification was equivalent to ProxConn for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.16) butsignificantlybetterforLCMV (0.82 ± 0.12). Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility for real-time cortical connectivity analysis and cognitive state classification from highdensity wearable dry EEG. Significance: This paper is the first validated application of these methods to 64-channel dry EEG. This study addresses a need for robust real-time measurement and interpretation of complex brain activity in the dynamic environment of the wearable setting. Such advances can have broad impact in research, medicine, and brain-computer interfaces.

Among the theories explaining the mechanisms of the formation of the above cited symptoms, an important role is attributed to the theory of the mind, or the ability to draw conclusions about the state of mind of other people, assigning mental states to others and interpreting their behaviors. According to guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on the therapeutic procedures in autism spectrum disorders, the proceedings include various methods, adjusted to the level of functioning and presented difficulties. In the most widely used behavioral social skills trainings, the goal is to practice behaviors using modelling and role-playing techniques. Less attention is devoted to the issue of social understanding, theory of mind or the cognitive aspects of therapeutic interventions. There are studies demonstrating the possibility of developing competence in the theory of mind in people with ASD, as well as generalizing the acquired skills. The article reviews the literature on the use of therapeutic programs aimed at developing the theory of mind in patients with ASD and their effectiveness.

In this paper we propose an immersive virtual reality mobile platform for Self-Attachment psychotherapy. Under the SelfAttachment therapeutic framework, the causes of disorders such as chronic anxiety and depression are traced back to the quality of the individual’s attachment with their primary caregiver during childhood. Our proposed platform aims to assist the user in enhancing their capacities for self-regulation of emotion, by means of earning secure attachment through the experience of positive attachment interactions, missed in their childhood. In the virtual environment provided by the platform, the adult-self of the user learns to create and strengthen an affectional and supportive bond with the inner-child. It is hypothesised that by long term potentiation and neuroplasticity, the user gradually develops new neural pathways and matures into an effective secure attachment object for the inner-child, thereby enabling the self-regulation of emotions.",2017.0,31.0,5.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cittern2017AnIV,\n author = {David Cittern and A.

Previous correlational evidence suggests that subjective time loss occurs during playing videogames. This study examined experiences of time loss among a relatively large group of gamers (n = 280). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through an online survey. Results showed that time loss occurred irrespective of gender, age, or frequency of play, but was associated with particular structural characteristics of games such as their complexity, the presence of multi-levels, missions and/or high scores, multiplayer interactions, and plot. Results also demonstrated that time loss could have both positive and negative outcomes for players. Positive aspects of time loss included helping players to relax and temporarily escape from reality. Negative aspects included the sacrificing of other things in their lives, guilty feelings about wasted time, and social conflict. It is concluded that for many gamers, losing track of time is a positive experience and is one of the main reasons for playing videogames.",2007.0,15.0,185.0,"{'volume': '10 1', 'pages': '\n          38-44\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wood2007ExperiencesOT,\n author = {Richard T.

1461,7f302166c9c7ff8fbfea32d592c26cd265b26e6b,The regulation of negative and positive affect in response to daily stressors.,"Experimental investigations of emotion regulation have shown that reappraisal (changing interpretations to change emotions) and distraction (directing attention to change emotions) are effective for regulating the experience of both negative and positive affect, while suppression (changing the outward expression of emotion) has been consistently shown to be ineffective. It is unknown, however, whether this pattern of effects generalizes to the context of daily stressors-a common part of daily life in which effective emotion regulation should be particularly beneficial. In addition, little is known about how frequently different strategies are deployed in response to daily stressors. The present investigation used daily diary methodology in two separate samples of adults (N = 174) to examine the use of these three emotion regulation strategies and their relationships with both negative and positive affect in response to daily stressors. Results revealed that reappraisal was negatively associated with negative affect and positively associated with positive affect, although the effect sizes for positive affect were larger than those for negative affect, suggesting that reappraisal may be particularly important for increasing positive affect in response to daily stressors. Distraction was consistently positively associated with negative affect, while suppression was not consistently associated with either negative or positive affect, suggesting that these two strategies may not be associated with emotional relief in the face of stressors. In terms of frequency of use, suppression was endorsed at higher rates than reappraisal and distraction, suggesting that individuals' use of emotion regulation strategies may not align with their effectiveness.

CMH serves seriously emotionally disturbed youths, many of whom have been separated from their parents for a prolonged period or have been vulnerable without the consistent presence of their caregivers. In this study, the HRV pattern was calculated as high coherence, medium coherence, or low coherence. According to Thurber et al, heart rhythm coherence “is experienced as a calm, balanced, yet energized and responsive state that is conducive to everyday functioning and interaction, including the performance of tasks requiring mental acuity, focus, problem solving and decision making, as well as physical activity and coordination.”1(p39) In the HeartMath program, there was a game in which high coherence was rewarded with a rainbow that dropped coins into a vessel. When coherence was low, the rainbow and coins disappeared until coherence was reached again. We measured HRV using a finger or ear sensor in individual sessions using a computer-based program from HeartMath Institute, Boulder Creek, California. After juvenile offenders overcame their initial fear of being hooked up to a potential lie detector, I instructed them in “Quick Coherence”1 and asked them to imagine breathing into the area of their heart. The participants created a library of positive feelings, thoughts, and memories on which they could focus. After a period of positive focus and rhythmic breathing, the clients were often able to move into medium or high coherence. In this state, they noticed that they felt calmer. I explained that they could use this tool to improve their mood. I also practiced alongside the youths in order to demonstrate the technique. The detained youths learned quickly, requested repeated sessions, and learned to combine breathing with recalling the good people, places, foods, and feelings in their lives that sustained them. We could also decrease coherence through the use of negative words such as “loss of privileges” on their side or “pay cut” on mine and then move back to coherence with suggestions of positive mental images.",2014.0,9.0,6.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '68 - 71', 'name': 'Global Advances in Health and Medicine'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Lutz2014AnIC,\n author = {Barbara Lutz},\n journal = {Global Advances in Health and Medicine},\n pages = {68 - 71},\n title = {An Institutional Case Study: Emotion Regulation With HeartMath at Santa Cruz County Children's Mental Health},\n volume = {3},\n year = {2014}\n}\n""}","[{'authorId': '40916248', 'name': 'Barbara Lutz'}]"

This process involves a gradual reduction in the capacity of a fear-conditioned stimulus to elicit fear by presenting the conditioned stimulus repeatedly on its own. Fear extinction is context-dependent and is generally considered to involve the establishment of inhibitory control of the prefrontal cortex over amygdala-based fear processes. In this paper, we review research progress on the neural basis of fear extinction with a focus on the role of the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. We evaluate two competing hypotheses for how the medial prefrontal cortex inhibits amygdala output. In addition, we present new findings showing that lesions of the basal amygdala do not affect fear extinction. Based on this result, we propose an updated model for integrating hippocampal-based contextual information with prefrontal-amygdala circuitry.",2004.0,187.0,412.0,"{'volume': '11 5', 'pages': '\n          525-35\n        ', 'name': 'Learning & memory'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sotres-Bayon2004EmotionalPA,\n author = {Francisco Sotres-Bayon and D.

Clinical vignettes illustrate the use of therapist self-disclosure to provide feedback on the interpersonal impact made by the client, enhance positive expectations and motivation, strengthen the therapeutic bond, normalize the client's reaction, reduce the client's fears, and model an effective way of functioning. Therapists need to observe appropriate boundaries when self-disclosing, and in particular, should consider their own motivations for self-disclosing. Although more research is needed on the effects of self-disclosure, cognitive-behavior therapists have found that self-disclosure can be a powerful intervention.",2003.0,23.0,98.0,"{'volume': '59 5', 'pages': '\n          555-68\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Goldfried2003TherapistSI,\n author = {M.

Research on age-related positivity has identified age differences in attention to emotional content, which may support emotion regulation in older age. The current research examines the roles of age and attention under various emotion regulation instructions. We measured younger (N = 92) and older (N = 88) adults’ fixation to negative emotional content and continuously rated affect during normal viewing and instructions to regulate. Those instructed to regulate first did so generally, then using detached or positive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Older adults (OAs) fixated less than younger adults (YAs) in negative areas regardless of instructions, suggesting broad age-related attentional tendencies. In contrast to some previous research, between-subjects analyses showed no age differences in effects of either form of reappraisal or suppression on affect. Within-subject analyses showed specific regulation instructions predicted less negative affect than general instructions for both age groups. Attention was unrelated to affect for both YAs and OAs across instructions. In sum, this research presents pervasive attentional preferences away from negative material in OAs as well as evidence of successful reappraisal and suppression in both age groups. Looking patterns, however, seemed unrelated to emotion regulation instructions’ effects on mood for either age group. Age differences in attentional patterns may therefore not translate into age differences in subsequent emotion regulation success.",2018.0,37.0,31.0,"{'volume': '33', 'pages': '373–383', 'name': 'Psychology and Aging'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Livingstone2018TheRO,\n author = {Kimberly M Livingstone and D.

We investigated, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and healthy volunteers, how the amygdala interacts with other cortical regions while subjects are judging the sex of faces with negative, positive, or neutral emotion. The data were analyzed by a subtractive method, then, to clarify possible interaction among regions within the brain, several kinds of analysis (i.e., a correlation analysis, a psychophysiological interaction analysis and a structural equation modeling) were performed. Overall, significant activation was observed in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, and the right parietal lobe during the task. The results of subtraction between the conditions showed that the left amygdala, right orbitofrontal cortex, and temporal cortices were predominantly involved in the processing of the negative expressions. The right angular gyrus was involved in the processing of the positive expressions when the negative condition was subtracted from the positive condition. The correlation analysis showed that activity in the left amygdala positively correlated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex under the negative minus neutral subtraction condition. The psychophysiological interaction revealed that the neural responses in the left amygdala and the right prefrontal cortex underwent the condition-specific changes between the negative and positive face conditions. The right amygdaloid activity also had an interactive effect with activity in the right hippocampus and middle temporal gyrus. These results may suggest that the left and right amygdalae play a differential role in effective processing of facial expressions in collaboration with other cortical or subcortical regions, with the left being related with the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and the right with the right temporal lobe.",2001.0,59.0,237.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '1035-1047', 'name': 'Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Iidaka2001NeuralIO,\n author = {T.

Potential use in education was first considered in the early 1990s, when it was suggested that VR technology could provide powerful learning environments not available through other means (M. Bricken, 1991). A growing VR research community has since sought to examine the benefits of using this technology in mainstream and special needs education, as well as other learning environments. This article first presents a brief description of VR technology and its use in teaching and learning. VR can be used as a tool for communication, as a medium through which individuals express ideas, and for learning about communication, through guided training and rehearsal in simulated social scenarios. This article concentrates on the latter application and presents 4 research projects conducted by the Virtual Reality Applications Research Team and associated colleagues in special needs education since 1991.

As much of the previous research has addressed generalized regulatory habits, far less is known about the ways in which individuals respond to emotions in daily life. The literature is particularly sparse in explorations of positive emotion regulation. In the current study, we provide an assessment of naturalistic experiences and regulation of emotion, both positive and negative in valence. Using an electronic experience sampling methodology, participants reported on their use of 40 regulatory strategies in response to 14 emotions for 10 consecutive days. On average, participants used 15 different regulatory strategies in response to negative emotions over this time, most frequently relying on acceptance, behavioral activation, and rumination. Participants used a similarly large repertoire of strategies, approximately 16 total, in response to positive emotions, particularly savoring, future focus, and behavioral activation. Participants' mood ratings following strategy use, however, indicated that the most frequently used strategies were often not the most effective strategies. The results of this study provide estimates of the frequency and effectiveness of a large number of emotion regulation strategies in response to both negative and positive emotions. Such findings characterize naturalistic emotion regulation, and estimates of normative emotion regulation processes are imperative to determining the ways in which deviations (e.g., small emotion regulation repertoires, insufficient attention to regulation of positive emotions) impact emotional functioning.",2014.0,62.0,163.0,"{'volume': '14 5', 'pages': '\n          878-91\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Heiy2014BackTB,\n author = {Jane E.

Affective contents analysis not only create an index for users to access their interested movie segments, but also provide feasible entry for video highlights. Most of the work focus on emotion type detection. Besides emotion type, emotion intensity is also a significant clue for users to find their interested content. For some film genres (Horror, Action, etc), the segments with high emotion intensity have the most possibilities to be video highlights. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical structure for emotion categories and analyze emotion intensity and emotion type by using arousal and valence related features hierarchically. Firstly, High, Medium and Low are detected as emotion intensity levels by using fuzzy c-mean clustering on arousal features. Fuzzy clustering provides a mathematical model to represent vagueness, which is close to human perception. After that, valence related features are used to detect emotion types (Anger, Sad, Fear, Happy and Neutral). Considering video is continuous time series data and the occurrence of a certain emotion is affected by recent emotional history, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to capture the context information. Experimental results shows the movie segments with high emotion intensity cover over 80% of the movie highlights in Horror and Action movies and the hierarchical method outperforms the one-step method on emotion type detection.

This preliminary study endeavored to evaluate the use of virtual reality (VR) enhanced exposure therapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) consequent to the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001.


METHOD
Participants were assigned to a VR treatment (N = 13) or a waitlist control (N = 8) group and were mostly middle-aged, male disaster workers. All participants were diagnosed with PTSD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). The study was conducted between February 2002 and August 2005 in offices located in outpatient buildings of a hospital campus.


RESULTS
Analysis of variance showed a significant interaction of time by group (p < .01) on CAPS scores, with a between-groups posttreatment effect size of 1.54. The VR group showed a significant decline in CAPS scores compared with the waitlist group (p < .01).

The presence of the mother was found to encourage exploratory behavior, her absence to depress exploration and to heighten attachment behaviors. In separation episodes such behaviors as crying and search increased. In reunion episodes proximity-seeking and contact-maintaining behaviors were heightened. In a substantial proportion of Ss, contact-resisting behaviors were also heightened in the reunion episodes, usually in conjunction with contactmaintaining behaviors, thus suggesting ambivalence. Some Ss also displayed proximity-avoiding behavior in relation to the mother in the reunion episodes.

On this basis, we propose a network to capture states of personal distress and (weak and strong forms of) empathic concern, which are particularly relevant for psychotherapists conducting attachment-based interventions. This model is then extended for the case of self-attachment therapy, in which conceptualized components of the self serve as both the source of and target for empathic resonance. In particular, we consider how states of empathic concern involving an other that is perceived as being closely related to the self might enhance the motivation for self-directed bonding (which in turn is proposed to lead the individual toward more compassionate states) in terms of medial prefrontal cortex–mediated activation of these caregiving pathways.

The present study focused on time awareness and its antipode timelessness as an expression of the extent one focuses on the passage of time. In an exploratory mixed-methods study, we investigated different extents of this time awareness and their relation to perceived valence of the environment, different states of consciousness, and strategies to cope with doing nothing. Thirty-three participants were tested for one hour or more with sitting and exploring as the within-subjects factor. For each condition, they stayed in one of two libraries characterized by their contemplative architecture. Then, participants answered quantitative questionnaires on their time experience and perceived valence and participated in a semi-structured interview. By means of grounded theory, we extracted four different types of time awareness from the qualitative data, of which three corresponded to the results of a cluster analysis on the dimensions of time awareness and perceived valence of the environment. In line with previous literature, we found relations between unpleasant high time awareness and boredom and pleasant low time awareness and flow. Additionally, the data revealed a pattern of high time awareness and positively perceived valence that was mainly experienced while sitting.

This decision to start the review in 2015 was purposeful in order to focus our review on recent, not historical trends in VR and emotion research, and to identify empirical studies that are concerned with three types of research: (1) the connection between VR and emotion from a emotion regulation perspective (e.g., mood induction, clinical applications), (2) studies that treat emotions as a mechanism to evaluate social or psychological phenomena, and (3) studies concerned with a deeper understanding of emotions or emotion theory. Our perspective draws on evidence from communication research, psychology, and human-computer interaction to achieve these aims. We ground our investigation in an overview of immersive VR and discuss current debates in emotion research.

However, inference about between‐study variability, which is typically modelled using a between‐study variance parameter, is usually an additional aim. The DerSimonian and Laird method, currently widely used by default to estimate the between‐study variance, has been long challenged. Our aim is to identify known methods for estimation of the between‐study variance and its corresponding uncertainty, and to summarise the simulation and empirical evidence that compares them. We identified 16 estimators for the between‐study variance, seven methods to calculate confidence intervals, and several comparative studies. Simulation studies suggest that for both dichotomous and continuous data the estimator proposed by Paule and Mandel and for continuous data the restricted maximum likelihood estimator are better alternatives to estimate the between‐study variance. Based on the scenarios and results presented in the published studies, we recommend the Q‐profile method and the alternative approach based on a ‘generalised Cochran between‐study variance statistic’ to compute corresponding confidence intervals around the resulting estimates. Our recommendations are based on a qualitative evaluation of the existing literature and expert consensus. Evidence‐based recommendations require an extensive simulation study where all methods would be compared under the same scenarios. © 2015 The Authors.

Gamification is the recent trend that offers to increase engagement through the inclusion of game-like features like points and badges, in non-game contexts. This review will answer the following question, ‘Are gamification strategies effective in increasing engagement in online programs?’ Method Eight databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO, Medline, INSPEC, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Business Source Complete and ACM Digital Library) were searched from 2010 to the 28th of October 2015 using a comprehensive search strategy. Eligibility criteria was based on the PICOS format, where “population” included adults, “intervention” involved an online program or smart phone application that included at least one gamification feature. “Comparator” was a control group, “outcomes” included engagement and “downstream” outcomes which occurred as a result of engagement; and “study design” included experimental studies from peer-reviewed sources. Effect sizes (Cohens d and 95% confidence intervals) were also calculated. Results 1017 studies were identified from database searches following the removal of duplicates, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The studies involved a total of 10,499 participants, and were commonly undertaken in tertiary education contexts. Engagement metrics included time spent (n = 5), volume of contributions (n = 11) and occasions visited to the software (n = 4); as well as downstream behaviours such as performance (n = 4) and healthy behaviours (n = 1). Effect sizes typically ranged from medium to large in direct engagement and downstream behaviours, with 12 out of 15 studies finding positive significant effects in favour of gamification. Conclusion Gamification is effective in increasing engagement in online programs. Key recommendations for future research into gamification are provided.

Data were collected during a summer day camp, which provided an ecologically valid setting for studying children's behavior in social contexts. Maltreated children were more likely than non-maltreated children to be aggressive, with findings suggesting that physically abused children were at heightened risk for reactive aggression.

Eighty-nine 3- and 4-year-old children (42 of whom had been enrolled in Kindermusik music and movement classes, and 47 demographically similar children who had not experienced structured early childhood music classes) completed a battery of laboratory self-regulation tasks and a selective attention task during which their private speech was reliably transcribed and categorized. Children currently enrolled in Kindermusik classes showed better self-regulation than those who were not currently enrolled (d = .41), and they also used more relevant private speech during the selective attention task (d = .57), a verbal strategy that was positively related to performance. Children exposed to the music program were also more likely to engage in the facilitative strategy of singing/humming to themselves during a waiting period in which they had to inhibit their desire to examine a gift, and they were less likely to call out socially to the experimenter, a strategy negatively associated with performance and self-regulation.

To explore the effect of acculturation attitudes and ethnic and national identity on behavior problems in arctic minority adolescents in northern Norway.


METHOD
The Youth Self-Report, the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure, and acculturation strategies were completed by 581 indigenous Sami and 291 Kven high school students in 1994-1995, at age 15-18 years. Response rate was 85%. Behavior problems were in addition to ethnic/national identity and acculturation attitudes studied in relation to ethnicity, gender, age, socioeconomic status, parentage, ethnic language, and ethnic context.


RESULTS
Although there were no ethnic group differences in behavior problems, the impact of ethnocultural predictors differed between ethnocultural and indigenous adolescents. Acculturation attitudes were most significant for indigenous adolescents' mental health, and identity issues showed the strongest impact on ethnocultural peers. The study revealed significant gender differences regarding the influence of ethnocultural factors, and contextual variation among Sami adolescents with the strongest impact in contexts with low density of Sami people.


CONCLUSIONS
The significant ethnic group variations emphasize the importance of conducting both between- and within-group analysis on the impact of ethnocultural issues on behavior problems in minority adolescents.",2003.0,35.0,94.0,"{'volume': '42 1', 'pages': '\n          57-65\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kvernmo2003AcculturationSA,\n author = {S.

The first group of reviewed studies illustrates the results of testing the motivational design process in several different E-learning settings, in relation to learner self-regulation and in terms of the interaction of personality characteristics and motivational strategies. The second group of studies includes tests of the validity of a simplified motivational design process that has been used in diverse types of E-learning settings, including multiple countries and cultures.

In this last case, graded exposure to feared social situations is one of the fundamental therapeutic ingredients. Virtual reality technologies are an interesting alternative to the standard exposure in social phobia, especially since studies have shown its usefulness for the fear of public speaking. This paper reports a preliminary study in which a virtual reality therapy (VRT), based on exposure to virtual environments, was used to treat social phobia. The sample consisted of 36 participants diagnosed with social phobia assigned to either VRT or a group-CBT (control condition). The virtual environments used in the treatment recreate four situations dealing with social anxiety: performance, intimacy, scrutiny, and assertiveness. With the help of the therapist, the patient learns adapted cognitions and behaviors in order to reduce anxiety in the corresponding real situations. Both treatments lasted 12 weeks, and sessions were delivered according to a treatment manual. Results showed statistically and clinically significant improvement in both conditions.

Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information.

However, existing work is based almost exclusively on static, self-reported descriptions of emotions and behavior that limit generalizability. Despite adoption of increasingly sophisticated research designs and technology (eg, mobile sensing using a global positioning system [GPS]), little research has integrated these seemingly disparate forms of data to improve understanding of how emotional experiences in everyday life are associated with time spent at home, and whether this is influenced by depression or social anxiety symptoms. Objective We hypothesized that more time spent at home would be associated with more negative and less positive affect. Methods We recruited 72 undergraduate participants from a southeast university in the United States. We assessed depression and social anxiety symptoms using self-report instruments at baseline. An app (Sensus) installed on participants’ personal mobile phones repeatedly collected in situ self-reported state affect and GPS location data for up to 2 weeks. Time spent at home was a proxy for social isolation. Results We tested separate models examining the relations between state affect and time spent at home, with levels of depression and social anxiety as moderators. Models differed only in the temporal links examined. One model focused on associations between changes in affect and time spent at home within short, 4-hour time windows. The other 3 models focused on associations between mean-level affect within a day and time spent at home (1) the same day, (2) the following day, and (3) the previous day. Overall, we obtained many of the expected main effects (although there were some null effects), in which higher social anxiety was associated with more time or greater likelihood of spending time at home, and more negative or less positive affect was linked to longer homestay. Interactions indicated that, among individuals higher in social anxiety, higher negative affect and lower positive affect within a day was associated with greater likelihood of spending time at home the following day. Conclusions Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of modeling the relationship between affect and homestay using fine-grained GPS data. Although these findings must be replicated in a larger study and with clinical samples, they suggest that integrating repeated state affect assessments in situ with continuous GPS data can increase understanding of how actual homestay is related to affect in everyday life and to symptoms of anxiety and depression.",2017.0,29.0,128.0,"{'volume': '19', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chow2017UsingMS,\n author = {Philip I.

How should such a seeing computer interact with its users? Three different interface styles -- a traditional GUI, a cartoon-like embodied agent and a realistic embodied agent -- are tested in two tasks where users are actively observed by a (simulated) cognitive vision system.

To find predictive effects of cognitive emotion regulation on psychological problems. Methodology Convenient sampling technique was used to obtain the sample of 500 participants (Male = 239, Female = 261). Research instrument consists of four parts. First part comprised of consent form, second part was about demographic profile, third part was Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21) while Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was the last part of the instrument. Results SPSS 23.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version was used for study analysis. Descriptive statistics used to summarize the raw data. The inferential statistics such as regression, correlation and t-test were used to calculate the findings according to research objectives. Results indicated that 33%, 40% and 27% individuals were experiencing Depression, Anxiety and Stress respectively during Covid-19 pandemic. Among these participants, 48% (N = 242) were experiencing normal level of all these targeted psychological problems while remaining 52% (N = 258) respondents have mild to very severe level of all these disorders. Furthermore, findings of linear regression analysis illustrated that cognitive emotion regulation significantly predicts psychological problems [R 2=.216; F = 51.223, p < .01] and 21% variation in psychological problems is due to cognitive emotion regulation.

A self-reporting measure was administered to 315 children to evaluate said variables. The resulting data were analyzed using structural equations. The study verified that maladaptive CERS partially mediated neuroticism's relationship with depression, while adaptive CERS, though negatively associated with depression, did not show a mediating effect on this relationship. The results provide evidence of the mediating function of maladaptive CERS on the neuroticism-depression relationship. Gender and school transition did not moderate the relationships proposed. Because, by their very nature, these strategies are modifiable, these results constitute an important finding that can be transferred to the design and content of child mental health prevention and promotion programs.",2016.0,101.0,37.0,"{'volume': '177', 'pages': '55 - 71', 'name': 'The Journal of Genetic Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Andrés2016NeuroticismAD,\n author = {María Laura Andrés and M.

Although a considerable amount of research has been conducted investigating age-related differences in emotion recognition of human faces (e.g., Sullivan, & Ruffman, 2004), the effect of age on emotion identification of virtual agent facial expressions has been largely unexplored. Age-related differences in emotion recognition of facial expressions are an important factor to consider in the design of agents that may assist older adults in a recreational or healthcare setting. The purpose of the current research was to investigate whether age-related differences in facial emotion recognition can extend to emotion-expressive virtual agents. Younger and older adults performed a recognition task with a virtual agent expressing six basic emotions. Larger age-related differences were expected for virtual agents displaying negative emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. In fact, the results indicated that older adults showed a decrease in emotion recognition accuracy for a virtual agent's emotions of anger, fear, and happiness.",2009.0,6.0,17.0,"{'volume': '53', 'pages': '131 - 135', 'name': 'Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Beer2009EmotionRO,\n author = {Jenay M.

It introduces the idea of stacking depth, that is, where a participant can simulate the process of entering the virtual environment while already in such an environment, which can be repeated to several levels of depth. An experimental study including 24 subjects was carried out. Half of the subjects were transported between environments by using virtual head-mounted displays, and the other half by going through doors. Three other binary factors were whether or not gravity operated, whether or not the subject experienced a virtual precipice, and whether or not the subject was followed around by a virtual actor. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic representation systems and egocentric/exocentric perceptual positions were assessed by a preexperiment questionnaire. Presence was assessed by the subjects as their sense of being there, the extent to which they experienced the virtual environments as more the presenting reality than the real world in which the experiment was taking place, and the extent to which the subject experienced the virtual environments as places visited rather than images seen. A logistic regression analysis revealed that subjective reporting of presence was significantly positively associated with visual and kinesthetic representation systems, and negatively with the auditory system. This was not surprising since the virtual reality system used was primarily visual. The analysis also showed a significant and positive association with stacking level depth for those who were transported between environments by using the virtual HMD, and a negative association for those who were transported through doors. Finally, four of the subjects moved their real left arm to match movement of the left arm of the virtual body displayed by the system. These four scored significantly higher on the kinesthetic representation system than the remainder of the subjects.",1994.0,18.0,1211.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '130-144', 'name': 'Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Slater1994DepthOP,\n author = {M.

1534,858cd829c74b77b8fb257dad7668bc13cfe50fe0,"Social networks, support and early psychosis: a systematic review","Background. There is strong evidence that those with a long-standing psychotic disorder have fewer social contacts and less social support than comparison groups. There is less research on the extent of social contacts and support prior to or at the onset of psychosis. In the light of recent evidence implicating a range of social experiences and contexts at the onset of psychosis, it is relevant to establish whether social networks and support diminished before or at the time of onset and whether the absence of such supports might contribute to risk, either directly or indirectly. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review of this literature to establish what is currently known about the relationship between social networks, support and early psychosis. Methods. We identified all studies investigating social networks and support in first episode psychosis samples and in general population samples with measures of psychotic experiences or schizotype by conducting systematic searches of electronic databases using pre-defined search terms and criteria. Findings were synthesized using non-quantitative approaches. Results. Thirty-eight papers were identified that met inclusion criteria. There was marked methodological heterogeneity, which limits the capacity to draw direct comparisons. Nonetheless, the existing literature suggests social networks (particularly close friends) and support diminished both among first episode samples and among non-clinical samples reporting psychotic experiences or with schizotype traits, compared with varying comparison groups. These differences may be more marked for men and for those from minority ethnic populations. Conclusions. Tentatively, reduced social networks and support appear to pre-date onset of psychotic disorder. However, the substantial methodological heterogeneity among the existing studies makes comparisons difficult and suggests a need for more robust and comparable studies on networks, support and early psychosis.",2012.0,77.0,207.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '131 - 146', 'name': 'Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gayer-Anderson2012SocialNS,\n author = {C.

1537,85da92173750f40f755ba94d342b94dde37d96cb,The functions of music for affect regulation,"Musical experiences are often reported to influence emotions (Juslin & Västfjäll, 2008; Sloboda, O’Neill, & Ivaldi, 2001): people consciously and unconsciously use music to change, create, maintain or enhance their emotions and moods (affect) on a daily basis for their personal benefit (DeNora, 1999; Schramm, 2005). This is known as affect regulation. However, existing research has not yet answered questions of how music regulates affect, especially beyond the expressive properties of music (Meyer, 1956). The aims of the studies presented here were to investigate (a) how music functions to regulate affect, (b) which affects it regulates, and (c) whether music listening can be considered a successful affect regulation device. A one-week diary study with interviews and a three-week diary study were conducted. The main findings were: (1) music helps through broader affect regulation strategies like distraction, introspection, and active coping; music can for example distract someone from the affect or situation, or help to think about the affect or situation in a rational way; (2) music plays a major role in creating happiness and relaxation; (3) music overall is a successful regulation device with a range of underlying mechanisms helping different strategies. The current paper is a valuable addition to the existing literature and provides several new insights into the function of music for affect regulation in everyday life. The insight gained into which strategies and underlying mechanisms are involved when music is used for affect regulation might be used for the benefit of people’s emotional wellbeing.",2011.0,45.0,208.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '208 - 228', 'name': 'Musicae Scientiae'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Goethem2011TheFO,\n author = {Anne van Goethem and J.

Ultimately, the success of any emerging technology will rely on the experience it provides the end user, and not on the technology itself. Subjective methods for quality-of-experience (QoE) assessment have as main disadvantage that converting such human factors into a quality rating is difficult, particularly for everyday users. To overcome this limitation, recent research has explored the use of objective methods to monitor neurophysiological correlates of relevant perception processes. In this paper, we describe the development of a neurophysiological sensor-equipped head-mounted display that combines a consumer off-the-shelf VR headset, a modified low-cost portable device for electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition repurposed to simultaneously acquire EEG, electrocardiogram (ECG), and electrooculogram (EOG) signals with high-quality dry electrodes. The device was evaluated under three different scenarios, each one designed to test the different ExG modalities. Initial tests showed promising results and allowed for (1) steady-state visually evoked potentials to be accurately measured from EEG, (2) heart rate variability measurements to discriminate between different affective videos, and (3) EOG measurements to monitor gaze direction and eye blinks, all while users were mobile. Being able to accurately monitor signals from the autonomic and central nervous systems in an unobtrusive and portable manner is an important step for instrumental QoE assessment of emerging VR/AR applications.",2018.0,0.0,10.0,"{'pages': '1-6', 'name': '2018 Tenth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cassani2018ANS,\n author = {Raymundo Cassani and Marc-Antoine Moinnereau and T.

This paper aims to test its psychometric properties, factor structure, and distribution scores across age, gender, education, and employment status. For this purpose, a representative sample of the Spanish population (N = 2,964) was used. Although analyses showed no significant differences across age or gender, participants with higher education level and those who held an occupation were more satisfied with their lives. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a unifactorial structure with significant correlations between the SWLS, and subjective happiness and social support. The internal consistency of the scale was .88. Thus, our results indicate that the Spanish version of the SWLS is a valid and reliable measure of life satisfaction within the Spanish context.",2013.0,63.0,216.0,"{'volume': '16', 'name': 'The Spanish Journal of Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vázquez2013SatisfactionWL,\n author = {C.

In this framework, functional interactions between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex mediate emotional influences on cognitive processes such as decision-making, as well as the cognitive regulation of emotion. However, neurons in these structures often have entangled representations, whereby single neurons encode multiple cognitive and emotional variables. Here we review studies using anatomical, lesion, and neurophysiological approaches to investigate the representation and utilization of cognitive and emotional parameters. We propose that these mental state parameters are inextricably linked and represented in dynamic neural networks composed of interconnected prefrontal and limbic brain structures.

Current theories of both parasuicide and BPD suggest that emotion dysregulation is the primary precipitant of self-injury, which serves to dampen overwhelmingly negative affect. To date, however, no studies have assessed endophenotypic markers of emotional responding among parasuicidal adolescents. In the present study, we compare parasuicidal adolescent girls (n = 23) with age-matched controls (n = 23) on both psychological and physiological measures of emotion regulation and psychopathology. Adolescents, parents, and teachers completed questionnaires assessing internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, substance use, trait affectivity, and histories of parasuicide. Psychophysiological measures including electrodermal responding (EDR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP) were collected at baseline, during negative mood induction, and during recovery. Compared with controls, parasuicidal adolescents exhibited reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at baseline, greater RSA reactivity during negative mood induction, and attenuated peripheral serotonin levels. No between-group differences on measures of PEP or EDR were found. These results lend further support to theories of emotion dysregulation and impulsivity in parasuicidal teenage girls.This work was supported by grants from the Seattle Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, the Pediatric Clinical Research Center at Seattle Children's Hospital (M01-RR 00037), and the National Foundation for Suicide Prevention to Cindy J.

The relevant literature is not conclusive and most of the research is correlational. However, the existing body of data provides initial support for the view that parental socialization practices have effects on children's emotional and social competence and that the socialization process is bidirectional. In particular, parental negative emotionality and negative reactions to children's expression of emotion are associated with children's negative emotionality and low social competence.

While prior work has made great strides in characterizing reappraisal's neural mechanisms and behavioral outcomes, the key issue of how regulation varies as a function of emotional intensity remains unaddressed. We compared the behavioral and neural correlates of reappraisal of high- and low-intensity emotional responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that successful reappraisal of both high- and low-intensity emotions depends upon recruitment of dorsomedial (dmPFC) as well as left dorsolateral (dlPFC) and ventrolateral (vlPFC) prefrontal cortex. However, reappraisal of high-intensity emotions more strongly activated left dlPFC, and in addition, activated right lateral and dorsomedial PFC regions not recruited by low-intensity reappraisal. No brain regions were more strongly recruited during reappraisal of low when compared with high-intensity emotions. Taken together, these results suggest that reappraisal of high-intensity emotion requires greater cognitive resources as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative differences in prefrontal recruitment. These data have implications for understanding how and when specific PFC systems are needed to regulate different types of emotional responses.",2015.0,56.0,89.0,"{'volume': '10 2', 'pages': '\n          172-9\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Silvers2015BadAW,\n author = {J.

One of the reasons for this is because shame can indicate serious damage to social acceptance and a breakdown in a variety of social relationships. The evolutionary root of shame is in a self-focused, social threat system related to competitive behavior and the need to prove oneself acceptable/desirable to others (Gilbert, 1989; 2002a). Guilt, however, evolved from a care-giving and “avoiding doing harm to others” system (Gilbert, 1998; Tangney and Dearing, 2002). Guilt will be explored here primarily to offer a contrast with shame and thus clarify the self-focused nature of shame. The evolutionary precursors for shame can be traced back to the way all animals must be able to detect and cope with social threats (Gilbert and McGuire, 1998). For many animals, attentiveness to conspecifics that could inflict harm, and are threats to them, is highly adaptive, and social anxiety, flight, or submission/appeasement are salient defenses (Gilbert, 2001). Social threats (unlike nonsocial threats) often involve communicating signals that impact on the state of mind of the threatening other(s); for example, a submissive display may be sufficient to stop a more dominate from seriously attacking a subordinate. Although shame requires a symbolic sense of self (Lewis, 1992), it too is regulated by social threats and automatic defenses to protect the self from threats posed by others (Gilbert, 2002a). Indeed, there is now evidence that shame can act as an inner warning signal of threats and challenges to the self, with a trig-",2015.0,52.0,319.0,"{'volume': '70', 'pages': '1205 - 1230', 'name': 'Social Research: An International Quarterly'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gilbert2015EvolutionSR,\n author = {P.

Use of virtual reality could facilitate new learning. Aims To test the hypothesis that enabling patients to test the threat predictions of persecutory delusions in virtual reality social environments with the dropping of safety-seeking behaviours (virtual reality cognitive therapy) would lead to greater delusion reduction than exposure alone (virtual reality exposure). Method Conviction in delusions and distress in a real-world situation were assessed in 30 patients with persecutory delusions. Patients were then randomised to virtual reality cognitive therapy or virtual reality exposure, both with 30 min in graded virtual reality social environments. Delusion conviction and real-world distress were then reassessed. Results In comparison with exposure, virtual reality cognitive therapy led to large reductions in delusional conviction (reduction 22.0%, P = 0.024, Cohen's d = 1.3) and real-world distress (reduction 19.6%, P = 0.020, Cohen's d = 0.8).

However, it remains unclear whether these 2 strategies are associated with differential consequences for emotion, physiology, or perceived cognitive costs in the short-term. The present study used a within-subjects design to examine the effects of reappraisal (reframing one’s thoughts) and acceptance (accepting feelings without trying to control or judge them) on the subjective experience of negative emotions, positive emotions, and physiological responses during and following recovery from sad film clips shown in the laboratory. Participants also reported on perceived regulatory effort, difficulty, and success after deploying each emotion regulation strategy. In 2 samples of participants (N = 142), reappraisal (vs. acceptance) was associated with larger decreases in negative and larger increases in positive emotions, both during the film clips and recovery period. However, acceptance was perceived as less difficult to deploy than reappraisal, and was associated with a smaller dampening of skin conductance level (indicating more successful regulation) during the film clips in 1 sample. These results suggest that reappraisal and acceptance may exert differential short-term effects: Whereas reappraisal is more effective for changing subjective experiences in the short term, acceptance may be less difficult to deploy and be more effective at changing one’s physiological response.

The emotional regulation (ER) strategies that we use determine the way in which we feel, express, and behave. Moreover, ER strategies are particularly important in adolescents, a population for which ER strategy deficits can be linked to the appearance of numerous mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, or disruptive behaviors. Thus, the early detection of dysfunctional ER strategies and training in adaptive ER strategies can help prevent future occurrences of possible behavioral and psychosocial disorders. In this article, the authors present the GameTeen System (GT-System), a novel instrument based on virtual reality and serious games for the assessment and training of ER strategies in adolescents. The results of their preliminary evaluation suggest that this system can effectively train and evaluate emotional regulation strategies in adolescents.",2015.0,4.0,39.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '65-73', 'name': 'IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rodríguez2015AVS,\n author = {Alejandro Rodríguez and B.

Workplace bullying has consistently been found to predict mental health problems among those affected. However, less attention has been given to personal dispositions as possible moderators in this relationship.


Aims
To investigate the moderating role of individual hardiness in the relationship between exposure to bullying behaviours and symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively, assuming that high hardiness, being an individual stress resilience factor, acts as a buffer in these relationships.


Methods
Survey data were gathered in 2016-17, among land-based employees in a Norwegian oil and gas company. Participants completed a questionnaire electronically via a link sent to their work e-mail. The PROCESS macro SPSS supplement was used to analyse the proposed relationships, with mean-centred variables.


Results
Altogether, 275 participated in the study (46% response rate). High hardiness acted as a buffer in the bullying-anxiety relationship, in that hardy individuals did not experience increased levels of anxiety when facing bullying behaviours. Low levels of hardiness, on the other hand, acted as an enhancement factor, in that the bullying-anxiety relationship was strengthened for this group. Contrary to expectations, hardiness did not act as a buffer in the bullying-depression relationship.


Conclusions
Hardy individuals were less likely to report anxiety in response to bullying than non-hardy workers, a finding with important practical implications. Yet, regardless of who is affected, managers should focus on good strategies to intervene when bullying is detected, and stress resilience training should be considered as part of these strategies.",2018.0,8.0,24.0,"{'volume': '68 1', 'pages': '\n          64-66\n        ', 'name': 'Occupational medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Reknes2018TheRO,\n author = {I.

Most patients with GAD never seek treatment, and those who do seek treatment often drop out before completing treatment. Although it is an understudied treatment, Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) indicate preliminary efficacy for the treatment of GAD symptoms, but many patients with GAD present other associated symptoms (e.g., attention deficits) that complicate the treatment. Virtual Reality DBT® Mindfulness Skills learning has recently been developed to make learning mindfulness easier for patients with emotion dysregulation who have trouble concentrating. Virtual Reality (VR) might serve as a visual guide for practicing mindfulness as it gives patients the illusion of “being there” in the 3D computer generated world. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of two MBIs (a MBI in a group setting alone and the same MBI plus 10 min VR DBT® Mindfulness skills training) to reduce GAD symptoms. A secondary aim was to explore the effect in depression, emotion regulation, mindfulness, and interoceptive awareness. Other exploratory aims regarding the use of VR DBT® Mindfulness skills were also carried out. The sample was composed of 42 patients (roughly half in each group) with GAD attending PC visits. After treatment, both groups of patients showed significant improvements in General Anxiety Disorder measured by the GAD-7 using mixed regression models [MBI alone (B = -5.70; p < 0.001; d = -1.36), MBI+VR DBT® Mindfulness skills (B = -4.38; p < 0.001; d = -1.33)]. Both groups also showed significant improvements in anxiety, depression, difficulties of emotion regulation and several aspects of mindfulness and interoceptive awareness. Patients in the group that received additional 10 min VR DBT Mindfulness Skills training were significantly more adherent to the treatment than those receiving only standard MBI (100% completion rate in MBI + VR vs. 70% completion rate in MBI alone; Fisher = 0.020). Although randomized controlled studies with larger samples are needed, this pilot study shows preliminary effectiveness of MBI to treat GAD, and preliminary evidence that adjunctive VR DBT® Mindfulness Skills may reduce dropouts.",2019.0,60.0,83.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Navarro-Haro2019EvaluationOA,\n author = {M.

The agent is composed of an animated human face that is displayed on a monitor affixed to the top of a human mannequin, with touch conveyed by an air bladder that squeezes a user's hand. We demonstrate that when touch is used alone, hand squeeze pressure and number of squeezes are associated with user perceptions of affect arousal conveyed by an agent, while number of squeezes and squeeze duration are associated with affect valence. We also show that, when affect-relevant cues are present in facial display, speech prosody, and touch used simultaneously by the agent, facial display dominates user perceptions of affect valence, and facial display and prosody are associated with affect arousal, while touch had little effect. Finally, we show that when touch is used in the context of an empathic, comforting interaction (but without the manipulation of affect cues in other modalities), it can lead to better perceptions of relationship with the agent, but only for users who are comfortable being touched by other people.",2010.0,58.0,90.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '60-71', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bickmore2010EmpathicTB,\n author = {T.

1600,8beec556fe7a650120544a99e9e063eb8fcd987b,Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency.,"This article addresses the centrality of the self-efficacy mechanism in human agency. Self-per- cepts of efficacy influence thought patterns, actions, and emotional arousal. In causal tests the higher the level of induced self-efficacy, the higher the perfor- mance accomplishments and the lower the emotional arousal. Different lines of research are reviewed, show- ing that the self-efficacy mechanism may have wide explanatory power. Perceived self-efficacy helps to ac- count for such diverse phenomena as changes in coping behavior produced by different modes of influence, level of physiological stress reactions, self-regulation of refractory behavior, resignation and despondency to failure experiences, self-debilitating effects of proxy control and illusory inefficaciousness, achievement strivings, growth of intrinsic interest, and career pur- suits. The influential role of perceived collective effi- cacy in social change is analyzed, as are the social con- ditions conducive to development of collective inefficacy. Psychological theorizing and research tend to cen- ter on issues concerning either acquisition of knowledge or execution of response patterns. As a result the processes governing the interrelation- ship between knowledge and action have been largely neglected (Newell, 1978). Some of the re- cent efforts to bridge this gap have been directed at the biomechanics problem—how efferent com- mands of action plans guide the production of ap- propriate response patterns (Stelmach, 1976,1978). Others have approached the matter in terms of algorithmic knowledge, which furnishes guides for executing action sequences (Greeno, 1973; Newell, 1973). ,",1982.0,111.0,14868.0,"{'volume': '37', 'pages': '122-147', 'name': 'American Psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bandura1982SelfefficacyMI,\n author = {A.

Prior efforts have used visual observation to distinguish emotional touch communications by certain gestures tied to one’s hand contact, velocity and position. The work herein describes an automated approach to eliciting the essential features of these gestures. First, a tracking system records the timing and location of contact interactions in 3-D between a toucher’s hand and a receiver’s forearm. Second, data post-processing algorithms extract dependent measures, derived from prior visual observation, tied to the intensity and velocity of the toucher’s hand, as well as areas, durations and parts of the hand in contact. Third, behavioral data were obtained from five couples who sought to convey a variety of emotional word cues. We found that certain combinations of six dependent measures well distinguish the touch communications. For example, a typical sadness expression invokes more contact, evolves more slowly, and impresses less deeply into the forearm than a typical attention expression. Furthermore, cluster analysis indicates 2-5 distinct expression strategies are common per word being communicated. Specifying the essential features of touch communications can guide haptic devices in reproducing naturalistic interactions.",2019.0,20.0,38.0,"{'pages': '407-412', 'name': '2019 IEEE World Haptics Conference (WHC)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hauser2019UncoveringHP,\n author = {Steven C.

METHOD: The sample was comprised of 50 healthy subjects, 19-75 years of age, with at least five years of formal education. The assessment was done individually, in two meetings with an interval from 1 to 6 months between test and retest. RESULTS: The findings showed a significant moderate positive correlation between test-retest in the overall calculation. In the analysis by segments, a significant moderate positive correlation was found for blocks 4 and 5, whereas there were no significant correlations for blocks 1, 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: These data corroborate recent studies that found moderate correlations between test-retest measures of executive functions, and suggest that the IGT can be used to assess decision making over time if specific analyses are taken into account.",2010.0,36.0,22.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '279-285', 'name': 'Jornal Brasileiro De Psiquiatria'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cardoso2010EstudoDF,\n author = {C.

Although several naturalistic studies have been conducted showing the usefulness of serious video games in the treatment of some abnormal behaviours, there is a lack of serious games specially designed for treating mental disorders. Aim The purpose of our project was to develop and evaluate a serious video game designed to remediate attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. Method and results The video game was created and developed within the European research project PlayMancer. It aims to prove potential capacity to change underlying attitudinal, behavioural and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. New interaction modes were provided by newly developed components, such as emotion recognition from speech, face and physiological reactions, while specific impulsive reactions were elicited. The video game uses biofeedback for helping patients to learn relaxation skills, acquire better self-control strategies and develop new emotional regulation strategies. In this article, we present a description of the video game used, rationale, user requirements, usability and preliminary data, in several mental disorders.",2012.0,55.0,175.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '364 - 374', 'name': 'Journal of Mental Health (Abingdon, England)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fernández-Aranda2012VideoGA,\n author = {F.

Taken separately, specific studies vary in task dimensions and in type(s) of emotion studied and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity. By examining findings across studies, we sought to determine if common or segregated patterns of activations exist across various emotional tasks. We reviewed 55 PET and fMRI activation studies (yielding 761 individual peaks) which investigated emotion in healthy subjects. Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings. We divided the brain into 20 nonoverlapping regions, and characterized each region by its responsiveness across individual emotions (positive, negative, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), to different induction methods (visual, auditory, recall/imagery), and in emotional tasks with and without cognitive demand. Our review yielded the following summary observations: (1) The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing; (2) fear specifically engaged the amygdala; (3) sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate; (4) emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala; (5) induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula; (6) emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula.

As TBIs are gaining acceptance, a question arises whether good therapeutic alliance, considered a key aspect of psychotherapy, can be established without or with minimal face-to-face contact or rather changes if blended concepts are applied. While therapeutic alliance has been studied extensively in the context of face-to-face therapy, only few studies have reviewed evidence on alliance ratings in TBIs. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine therapeutic alliance in technology-based psychological interventions for the treatment of depression. Methods We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, CINAHL, clinical trial registers, and sources of grey literature for randomized controlled trials on TBIs in the treatment of adults with unipolar depression. All publications were selected according to prespecified criteria. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Results A total of eight out of 98 studies (9.5%) included in the review on TBIs for depression considered therapeutic alliance as part of their evaluation. The available data covered eight different treatment conditions, including four stand-alone treatments (face-to-face psychotherapy, email, telephone, and internet program) and four combined treatments (face-to-face psychotherapy plus a smartphone app and an internet program combined with face-to-face psychotherapy, treatment as usual, or email/telephone). On average, patients rated the alliance positively across all groups. Importantly, no relevant group differences regarding therapeutic alliance sum scores were found in any of the studies. Five studies investigated the relationship between patients’ alliance ratings and treatment outcome, revealing mixed results. Conclusions Our results suggest that it is possible to establish a positive therapeutic alliance across a variety of different TBIs for depression, but this is based on a small number of studies. Future research needs to determine on what basis therapeutic alliance is formed in settings that do not allow for additional nonverbal cues, perhaps with adapted instruments to measure therapeutic alliance.

Applications can be found in many domains including multimedia retrieval and human–computer interaction. In recent years, deep neural networks have been used with great success in determining emotional states. Inspired by this success, we propose an emotion recognition system using auditory and visual modalities. To capture the emotional content for various styles of speaking, robust features need to be extracted. To this purpose, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the speech, while for the visual modality a deep residual network of 50 layers is used. In addition to the importance of feature extraction, a machine learning algorithm needs also to be insensitive to outliers while being able to model the context. To tackle this problem, long short-term memory networks are utilized. The system is then trained in an end-to-end fashion where—by also taking advantage of the correlations of each of the streams—we manage to significantly outperform, in terms of concordance correlation coefficient, traditional approaches based on auditory and visual handcrafted features for the prediction of spontaneous and natural emotions on the RECOLA database of the AVEC 2016 research challenge on emotion recognition.",2017.0,53.0,443.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '1301-1309', 'name': 'IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tzirakis2017EndtoEndME,\n author = {Panagiotis Tzirakis and George Trigeorgis and M.

Often this interaction is organised around social principles, in that one agent may request the help of another, and in turn may make a commitment to assist another when requested. In this paper we investigate two measures of the social responsibility of an agent known as reliability and helpfulness. Intuitively, reliability measures how good an agent is at keeping its commitments, and helpfulness measures how willing an agent is to make a commitment, when requested for help. We discuss these notions in the context of FIPA protocols. It is important to note that these measures are dependent only on the messages exchanged between the agents, and do not make any assumptions about the internal organisation of the agents. This means that these measures are both applicable to any variety of software agent, and externally verifiable, i.e. able to be calculated by anyone with access to the messages exchanged.",2007.0,41.0,7.0,"{'volume': '5', 'pages': '31-46', 'name': 'Web Intell.

Some researchers propose that people apply the same social norms to computers as they do to humans, suggesting that social psychological knowledge can be applied to our interactions with computers. In contrast, theories of human–automation interaction postulate that humans respond to machines in unique and specific ways. We believe that anthropomorphism—the degree to which an agent exhibits human characteristics—is the critical variable that may resolve this apparent contradiction across the formation, violation, and repair stages of trust. Three experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints by varying the appearance and behavior of automated agents. Participants received advice that deteriorated gradually in reliability from a computer, avatar, or human agent. Our results showed (a) that anthropomorphic agents were associated with greater trust resilience, a higher resistance to breakdowns in trust; (b) that these effects were magnified by greater uncertainty; and c) that incorporating human-like trust repair behavior largely erased differences between the agents. Automation anthropomorphism is therefore a critical variable that should be carefully incorporated into any general theory of human–agent trust as well as novel automation design.",2016.0,131.0,317.0,"{'volume': '22 3', 'pages': '\n          331-49\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of experimental psychology.

There are other technological innovations that are beginning to be used in clinical and health psychology such as ambient intelligence, ubiquitous computing or persuasive computing. In the last fifteen years there has been a proliferation of studies testing the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for several mental disorders and health conditions. The essence of VR is that it can simulate reality and add a new possibility: the user has the illusion of “being” in the computer-generated environment while interacting with the VR objects. This unique feature of VR is very relevant for its use in Clinical Psychology. At the same time, it can raise several ethical issues. It is important to investigate the possible effects of blurring the distinction between real and virtual worlds in vulnerable populations. Some other concerns regarding the use of VR in therapy have already been investigated, such as cybersickness. After ten years of experience treating patients with VR, this has not been a problem in the published efficacy studies. Telepsychology has also been used to improve the delivery of CBT. A number of Internetdelivered programs have already become important tools in the health system. The main advantage is that online therapy can reach people who might not otherwise seek therapy, such as disabled people or those who live in remote areas. However, several concerns have been raised about self-help procedures, like the issue of self-diagnosis. and the fact that patients usually have all of the necessary self-help information at their disposal. It is important to establish criteria to protect people from the possible negative effects of this. Other innovations such as ambient intelligence and pervasive computing bring up other ethical issues. For example, is privacy being compromised too much when people are located using GPS or physiologically monitored 24 hours a day? Criteria for considering these issues must be established. Our research group has been working with new technologies and therapies for the last fifteen years. This paper addresses the ethical issues we have encountered in our research and clinical practice; it also explores ethical issues that will become increasingly important.",2009.0,62.0,58.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '77-100', 'name': 'PsychNology J.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Botella2009CybertherapyAL,\n author = {C.

For a long time, it has represented a sort of “oral encyclopedia” which, through narrative, has passed down from generation to generation traditions, customs and knowledge (Halverson, 1992). The role that storytelling played, even before the discovery of writing, in the diffusion of knowledge, in the construction of interpersonal relationships and in the birth of new societies, is well known. Without doubt writing is the earliest “technology” invented by man, through which culture and knowledge have been passed down over time, after having been transmitted orally for a long time. According to Barthes and Duisit (1975), in fact, storytelling begins with the same story of the human race, almost as if to represent an ontogenetically distinctive trait of the species, which unites homo sapiens with the homo digitalis of today’s society (Montag & Diefenbach, 2018). Other authors (Kenyon et al., 1996) argue that men and women not only have stories to tell, but that they are the stories they tell.

1628,8db3f00721e99b7bd44d7089d39641ae4b971bf3,Affect Dysregulation and Disorders of the Self,"Allan Schore has for some 15 years written about the processes underlying affect regulation in normal and abnormal self-development and attachment. His best known book entitled Affect Regulation and the Origin of the Self: The Neurobiology of Emotional Development, published in 1994, was the first coherent attempt to integrate the then recent findings of neurobiology with clinical observations in children and adults and brought down barriers that had impeded the understanding of the self and its disorders. In the present volume, Schore incorporates the vast amount of data from neurosciences since 1994 and presents the reader with a truly compelling theoretical synthesis of this literature. 
 
In part I, there are 4 chapters on developmental affective neuroscience. They deal with the contribution experience expectant vs. experience dependent phenomena make to the development of affect regulation. The former are primarily gene dependent (e.g., the CNS of a newborn is equipped to function well in infants who live within a reasonably safe environment and are exposed to gradual rather than violent changes) while the latter are dependent on the care taking practices the child is exposed to. One example cited is the affective transmissions in mutual gaze transactions between infants and their mothers. These affective parental responses are the first means by which mothers can provide a model of affect modulation to their infants (e.g., mother senses when her baby is becoming overstimulated and will respond by decreasing her own stimulation, leading to calming the infant). Such soothing behaviors will secondarily effect the maturation of the orbitofrontal cortex and strengthen its regulatory abilities. Attachment behavior is likewise based on the reciprocal activation of the couple’s endogenous opiate systems but also regulates the dopamine levels in the infant’s brain. Schore brings these and other interdisciplinary findings together by citing the available evidence and at times even presenting colored PET or fMRI scans to make his point. 
 
In part II, 5 chapters deal with developmental neuropsychiatric data and their relevance on development of the right brain, secure attachment relationships and on symptoms of PTSD, borderline and antisocial personality disorders. Here again, Schore cites studies that explain important psychological processes through neuropsychiatric data. For example, he cites evidence that in the context of face-to-face interactions, mothers trigger production of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in their infants. The CRF, in turn raises the concentration of noradrenaline, increasing general energy metabolism but also controls endorphin and ACTH. production, leading to an elated state in the infant. 
 
When it comes to PTSD and other well-defined psychiatric disorders, the overall picture becomes more complicated. For example, Schore claims that PTSD is related to the inability of the right prefrontal cortex to sufficiently modulate amygdala (i.e., aggressive) functions. The fact that this also occurs in children with a disorganized disoriented insecure attachment pattern is then seen as proof that this particular early maternal caretaking pattern contributes to later dissociative psychopathology. One could counter that proposition by pointing out that elevated cortisol levels are important for overall stress management – but that prenatally elevated levels, especially in the third trimester of pregnancy, have been found to be especially pathogenic as they effect the developing brain at its most critical time. However, high cortisol levels can be caused by a variety of conditions. Intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) is a common condition associated in children born with ‘small gestational age’ (SGA). It is innately stressful for the infant, hence associated with elevated prenatal cortisol levels that are not associated to later maternal attachment patterns. Aggressive behavior disorders are also described as a consequence of a right brain system impaired for regulating aggressive affective states. Here it is said to be the low arousal state characteristic for antisocial and aggressive individuals that such individuals try to increase back to optimal or normal levels by seeking stimulation. While this may be one pathway leading to aggressive behavior disorders, there are authors such as Tremblay and colleagues in Montreal who claim that all young children are highly aggressive and must “unlearn” this behavior in the process of development. Those who do not or cannot do so will make up our clinical population. 
 
In summary, the present volume of Allan Schore provides the reader with a provocative and stimulating theoretical synthesis of multi-disciplinary work that relates affect regulation to the development of the self and its deviations. Schore’s writing style is almost poetic and transforms potentially dry data into an exciting story of discovery and multidisciplinary dependency. He also suggests, at least indirectly, preventive measures that can address the problem of violence and other dysfunctions of the developing self in children through optimal early social-emotional experiences. I highly recommend this volume to researchers and clinicians.",2006.0,0.0,533.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '100-101', 'name': ""Journal de l'Académie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent""}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Minde2006AffectDA,\n author = {K.

1629,8db7f5a54321e1a4cd51d0666607279556a57404,Systematic review of the efficacy of meditation techniques as treatments for medical illness.,"BACKGROUND
Meditative techniques are sought frequently by patients coping with medical and psychological problems. Because of their increasingly widespread appeal and use, and the potential for use as medical therapies, a concise and thorough review of the current state of scientific knowledge of these practices as medical interventions was conducted.


PURPOSE
To systematically review the evidence supporting efficacy and safety of meditative practices in treating illnesses, and examine areas warranting further study. Studies on normal healthy populations are not included.


METHODS
Searches were performed using PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Database. Keywords were Meditation, Meditative Prayer, Yoga, Relaxation Response. Qualifying studies were reviewed and independently rated based on quality by two reviewers. Mid-to-high-quality studies (those scoring above 0.65 or 65% on a validated research quality scale) were included.


RESULTS
From a total of 82 identified studies, 20 randomized controlled trials met our criteria. The studies included 958 subjects total (397 experimentally treated, 561 controls). No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included or excluded clinical trials. Serious adverse events are reported in the medical literature, though rare. The strongest evidence for efficacy was found for epilepsy, symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome and menopausal symptoms. Benefit was also demonstrated for mood and anxiety disorders, autoimmune illness, and emotional disturbance in neoplastic disease.


CONCLUSIONS
The results support the safety and potential efficacy of meditative practices for treating certain illnesses, particularly in nonpsychotic mood and anxiety disorders. Clear and reproducible evidence supporting efficacy from large, methodologically sound studies is lacking.",2006.0,125.0,227.0,"{'volume': '12 8', 'pages': '\n          817-32\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of alternative and complementary medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Arias2006SystematicRO,\n author = {A.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether momentary emotional experiences (anxiety, depression, anger/irritability) and self-esteem predicted the onset and duration of a paranoid episode. We also studied whether levels of emotional experiences and self-esteem were respectively higher and lower during a paranoid episode. DESIGN. A 1-week, prospective momentary assessment study. METHODS. Data were collected using the experience sampling method, a structured self-assessment diary technique. The sample consisted of 158 individuals who ranged across the paranoia continuum. Participants with a psychotic disorder were recruited from in-patient and out-patient mental health services. Participants without psychotic disorder were sampled from the general population. RESULTS. Specific aspects of emotional experience were implicated in the onset and persistence of paranoid episodes. Both an increase in anxiety and a decrease in self-esteem predicted the onset of paranoid episodes. Cross-sectionally, paranoid episodes were associated with high levels of all negative emotions and low level of self-esteem. Initial intensity of paranoia and depression was associated with longer, and anger/irritability with shorter duration of paranoid episodes. CONCLUSIONS. Paranoid delusionality is driven by negative emotions and reductions in self-esteem, rather than serving an immediate defensive function against these emotions and low self-esteem.

Externalizing problems, which are the main reason for youth referrals to mental health agencies, are highly persistent and predict a range of negative outcomes. Youths with externalizing problems are also frequently comorbid with anxiety. Among the most widely recognized evidence-based treatments is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Although CBT principles seem to be sound, effect sizes remain moderate, suggesting improvements could be made to this conventional treatment approach. The main premise of the current pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing a videogame intervention (""Dojo"" [Gamedesk, Los Angeles, CA]) that incorporates CBT principles and aims to address the limitations of conventional CBT delivery models, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for this difficult-to-treat population.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
""Dojo"" is an emotion management game that helps youths to recognize and control their physiological and emotional arousal. We explored the implementation and user experience of ""Dojo"" in a sample of eight adolescents in residential treatment for both externalizing and anxiety problems.


RESULTS
Participants attended all sessions without complaints. They evaluated ""Dojo"" very positively and exhibited high compliance during the training sessions. We encountered some problems with session scheduling and obtaining mentor reports. Quantitative data show the predicted decrease in three out of four measurements.


CONCLUSIONS
The smooth implementation, high user satisfaction, high self-reported compliance during training sessions, and initial outcome results all indicate the high potential ""Dojo"" holds as an innovative intervention. If additional rigorously designed randomized controlled trials prove to be successful, ""Dojo"" can be a cost-effective way to engage high-risk youths in effective intervention.",2015.0,42.0,28.0,"{'volume': '4 5', 'pages': '\n          401-8\n        ', 'name': 'Games for health journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schuurmans2015APS,\n author = {A.

All of the ideas are illustrated with examples drawn from everyday life. The book is organized into two parts. The first presents an overall conteptual framework for understanding emotions. It looks at all the typical characteristics and components of emotions, distinguishes emotions from other affective phenomena, classifies the emotions and covers such related issues as emotional intelligence, regulating emotions, and emotions and morality. The second part discusses individual emotions, including envy, jealousy, pleasure-in-others'-misfortune, pity, compassion, anger, hate, disgust, love, sexual desire, happiness, sadness, pride, regret and shame. The text is laced with insightful and often amusing quotations from sources ranging from Mae West to Montesquieu.",2000.0,0.0,771.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': ""@Inproceedings{Ben-Ze'ev2000TheSO,\n author = {A.

One important choice domain that remains virtually unexplored is that of emotion regulation. This is surprising given that healthy adaptation requires flexibly choosing between regulation strategies in a manner that is responsive to differing situational demands. In the present article, we provide a broad conceptual framework that systematically evaluates the rules that govern the ways individuals choose between different emotion regulation strategies. This conceptual account is buttressed by empirical findings from 6 studies that show the effects of hypothesized emotional, cognitive, and motivational determinants of regulation choice (Studies 1-3) and illuminate the mechanisms that underlie choices between different emotion regulation strategies (Studies 4-6).

1638,8e3b2c3efa2f8a97ddb2dafcc98ac574d1531a5e,The Affective Slider: A Digital Self-Assessment Scale for the Measurement of Human Emotions,"Self-assessment methods are broadly employed in emotion research for the collection of subjective affective ratings. The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), a pictorial scale developed in the eighties for the measurement of pleasure, arousal, and dominance, is still among the most popular self-reporting tools, despite having been conceived upon design principles which are today obsolete. By leveraging on state-of-the-art user interfaces and metacommunicative pictorial representations, we developed the Affective Slider (AS), a digital self-reporting tool composed of two slider controls for the quick assessment of pleasure and arousal. To empirically validate the AS, we conducted a systematic comparison between AS and SAM in a task involving the emotional assessment of a series of images taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), a database composed of pictures representing a wide range of semantic categories often used as a benchmark in psychological studies. Our results show that the AS is equivalent to SAM in the self-assessment of pleasure and arousal, with two added advantages: the AS does not require written instructions and it can be easily reproduced in latest-generation digital devices, including smartphones and tablets. Moreover, we compared new and normative IAPS ratings and found a general drop in reported arousal of pictorial stimuli. Not only do our results demonstrate that legacy scales for the self-report of affect can be replaced with new measurement tools developed in accordance to modern design principles, but also that standardized sets of stimuli which are widely adopted in research on human emotion are not as effective as they were in the past due to a general desensitization towards highly arousing content.",2016.0,34.0,239.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Betella2016TheAS,\n author = {Alberto Betella and P.

This paper presents the design phase of the project, starting by theoretically grounding the initial concept. We then discuss 15 co-design sessions which provided informal conceptual validation and led to several concrete design iterations aimed at balancing users' perceived sense of control.

Instead, individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a framework. We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person's emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes--response-dependent and response-independent--that could support interpersonal regulation. This framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse, heretofore independent data on ""pieces"" of interpersonal regulation, and identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.",2013.0,105.0,653.0,"{'volume': '13 5', 'pages': '\n          803-10\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zaki2013InterpersonalER,\n author = {Jamil Zaki and W.

Despite the growing number of apps available, the evidence base for their efficacy is unclear. Objective This review aimed to systematically appraise the available research evidence on the efficacy and acceptability of mobile apps for mental health in children and adolescents younger than 18 years. Methods The following were systematically searched for relevant publications between January 2008 and July 2016: APA PsychNet, ACM Digital Library, Cochrane Library, Community Care Inform-Children, EMBASE, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Social Policy and Practice, Web of Science, Journal of Medical Internet Research, Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking, and OpenGrey. Abstracts were included if they described mental health apps (targeting depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, self-harm, suicide prevention, conduct disorder, eating disorders and body image issues, schizophrenia, psychosis, and insomnia) for mobile devices and for use by adolescents younger than 18 years. Results A total of 24 publications met the inclusion criteria. These described 15 apps, two of which were available to download. Two small randomized trials and one case study failed to demonstrate a significant effect of three apps on intended mental health outcomes. Articles that analyzed the content of six apps for children and adolescents that were available to download established that none had undergone any research evaluation. Feasibility outcomes suggest acceptability of apps was good and app usage was moderate. Conclusions Overall, there is currently insufficient research evidence to support the effectiveness of apps for children, preadolescents, and adolescents with mental health problems.

In the past, equivalence has either been imposed by matching or balancing, or has been assured statistically by randomization. Matching and balancing, while useful in many contexts, nonetheless have important limitations, as does simple randomization. In recent years, a new tool has been developed that represents a compromise between balancing and randomization. This method, urn randomization, gives clinical investigators new options for improving the credibility of studies at a relatively modest cost. Urn randomization is randomization that is systematically based in favor of balancing. It can be used with several covariates, both marginally and jointly, producing optimal multivariate equivalence of treatment groups for large sample sizes. It preserves randomization as the primary basis for assignment to treatment and is less susceptible to experimenter bias or manipulation of the allocation process by staff than is balancing. Disadvantages include the fact that it is more difficult to implement, and that it violates the simple probability model of simple randomization. A number of research studies on addictions, including client-treatment matching trials, have used urn randomization. A summary of the mechanics of urn randomization is presented, and guidelines for its use in treatment studies are discussed.",1994.0,8.0,452.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '\n          70-5\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of studies on alcohol.

Furthermore, to improve positioning accuracy, we propose a Gaussian error correction multi‐objective positioning model with non‐dominated sorting (NSGA‐II), which named GGAII‐DVHop.

1651,8ec142f38110493bffb59a98046d5dea678033bd,The SmartCAT: an m-health platform for ecological momentary intervention in child anxiety treatment.,"INTRODUCTION
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety, although efficacious, typically requires 16-20 weekly sessions with a therapist. Brief CBT (BCBT; eight sessions) for child anxiety is promising but may have less favorable outcomes owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential to improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage youth in learning and practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cues youth to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to engage youth in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal. A pilot study with nine youth (9-14 years old) examined the platform's feasibility as an adjunct to BCBT.


RESULTS
SmartCAT was found to be capable of supporting BCBT for child anxiety and received positive feedback from both therapists and youth patients. Patients rated the app as highly usable (mean=1.7 on a 1-7 scale, with 1=""easy""). Patients completed 5.36 skills coach entries per session (standard deviation=1.95) and took an average of 3.14 min (standard deviation=0.98 min) to complete the entries.


CONCLUSIONS
A smartphone app is feasible within CBT for child anxiety. Users found SmartCAT both acceptable and easy to use. Integrating an m-health platform within BCBT for anxious children may facilitate involvement in treatment and dissemination of effective procedures.",2014.0,39.0,131.0,"{'volume': '20 5', 'pages': '\n          419-27\n        ', 'name': 'Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pramana2014TheSA,\n author = {Gede Pramana and B.

In recent decades this approach has brought valuable insight into the cognition of an interacting human. Automated RBSD can be used to set up a brain–computer interface (BCI) providing a novel input modality for technical systems solely based on brain activity. In BCIs the user usually sends voluntary and directed commands to control the connected computer system or to communicate through it. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach by fusing BCI technology with cognitive monitoring, providing valuable information about the users' intentions, situational interpretations and emotional states to the technical system. We call this approach passive BCI. In the following we give an overview of studies which utilize passive BCI, as well as other novel types of applications resulting from BCI technology. We especially focus on applications for healthy users, and the specific requirements and demands of this user group. Since the presented approach of combining cognitive monitoring with BCI technology is very similar to the concept of BCIs itself we propose a unifying categorization of BCI-based applications, including the novel approach of passive BCI.",2011.0,61.0,748.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '025005', 'name': 'Journal of Neural Engineering'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zander2011TowardsPB,\n author = {T.

In Internet-based eHealth interventions, ECAs may be used for the delivery of automated human support factors. Objective We aim to provide an overview of the technological and clinical possibilities, as well as the evidence base for ECA applications in clinical psychology, to inform health professionals about the activity in this field of research. Methods Given the large variety of applied methodologies, types of applications, and scientific disciplines involved in ECA research, we conducted a systematic scoping review. Scoping reviews aim to map key concepts and types of evidence underlying an area of research, and answer less-specific questions than traditional systematic reviews. Systematic searches for ECA applications in the treatment of mood, anxiety, psychotic, autism spectrum, and substance use disorders were conducted in databases in the fields of psychology and computer science, as well as in interdisciplinary databases. Studies were included if they conveyed primary research findings on an ECA application that targeted one of the disorders. We mapped each study’s background information, how the different disorders were addressed, how ECAs and users could interact with one another, methodological aspects, and the study’s aims and outcomes. Results This study included N=54 publications (N=49 studies). More than half of the studies (n=26) focused on autism treatment, and ECAs were used most often for social skills training (n=23). Applications ranged from simple reinforcement of social behaviors through emotional expressions to sophisticated multimodal conversational systems. Most applications (n=43) were still in the development and piloting phase, that is, not yet ready for routine practice evaluation or application. Few studies conducted controlled research into clinical effects of ECAs, such as a reduction in symptom severity. Conclusions ECAs for mental disorders are emerging. State-of-the-art techniques, involving, for example, communication through natural language or nonverbal behavior, are increasingly being considered and adopted for psychotherapeutic interventions in ECA research with promising results. However, evidence on their clinical application remains scarce. At present, their value to clinical practice lies mostly in the experimental determination of critical human support factors. In the context of using ECAs as an adjunct to existing interventions with the aim of supporting users, important questions remain with regard to the personalization of ECAs’ interaction with users, and the optimal timing and manner of providing support. To increase the evidence base with regard to Internet interventions, we propose an additional focus on low-tech ECA solutions that can be rapidly developed, tested, and applied in routine practice.",2017.0,85.0,247.0,"{'volume': '19', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Provoost2017EmbodiedCA,\n author = {Simon Provoost and Ho Ming Lau and Jeroen Ruwaard and H.

Cognition and emotion are intricately linked and cognitive deficits, which are characteristic of many psychiatric conditions, are often driven by affect dysregulation, which itself can usually be traced back to sub-optimal childhood development as supported by Attachment Theory. Individuals with insecure attachment types in their childhoods are prone to a variety of mental illness, whereas a secure attachment type in childhood provides a secure base in life. We therefore propose a holistic approach to tackle chronic anxiety and depression, typical of Axis II clinical disorders, which is informed by the development of the infant brain in social interaction with its primary care-givers. We formulate, in a self-administrable way, the protocols governing the interaction of a securely attached child with its primary care-givers that produce the capacity for affect regulation in the child. We posit that these protocols construct, by neuroplasticity and long term potentiation, new optimal neural pathways in the brains of adults with insecure childhood attachment that suffer from mental disorder. This procedure is called self-attachment and aims to help the individuals to create their own attachment objects in the form of their adult self looking after their inner child.",2017.0,0.0,6.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Edalat2017SelfattachmentA,\n author = {A.

The Experience-Sampling Method (ESM) is an attempt to provide a valid instrument to describe variations in self-reports of mental processes. It can be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity, and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional, cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of thought disturbance. The article reviews pratical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short-and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the technique can be usefully applied.",1987.0,42.0,2578.0,"{'volume': '175', 'pages': '526–536', 'name': 'The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Csíkszentmihályi1987ValidityAR,\n author = {M.

What ties a great deal of this scholarship together is a common understanding of the Internet as a site for the production of ""cultural texts"" and an approach that explores, as Rosemary Coombe puts it, ""the relationship between the word and the world"" (Coombe 1998:17). It is hardly surprising, then, that much of the critical commentary on the Internet comes out of English departments and communications or media studies programs because, after all, the Internet is indeed largely textual in nature, being made up of email, discussion groups, message services, websites, images, and other forms that lend themselves to symbolic analysis. Yet what troubles me about a great deal of this literature is that it tends to be concerned almost solely with social effects (real or imagined) rather than the various apparatuses (technological as well as social and political) and the people who are actively involved in using the Internet on a daily basis. I find an imbalance between the tendency to theorize the Internet at a general level and not enough close-to-the-ground ethnographic study of the new social spaces the Internet makes possible. Mizuko Ito, an anthropologist who has conducted on-line fieldwork, suggests that many of these studies erase the real world technological and social underpinnings of Internet phenomena: ""Much of the social commentary around virtual worlds implicitly reinscribes a split between information (virtuality) and materials (reality), describing ways in which on-line spaces provide a space of 'pure' information that is both amputated from, and inconsequential for, real world physicality"" (Ito 1997:88). Furthermore, it is too easy to forget that like the products of mass media, the ""cultural texts"" produced by the Internet are themselves public representational forms, a part of what might be called ""public culture."" The danger of a purely textual approach is that it perpetuates ""the fantasy that one can understand the workings of public cultural representations solely by interpreting/deconstructing [such] representations"" (Ortner 1999: 55-56).",2003.0,10.0,101.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '233-263', 'name': 'Cultural Anthropology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lysloff2003MusicalCO,\n author = {René T.

CR is distinct from attentional deployment (AD), an ER process that is theorized to operate via changes in attention. However, a recent neuroimaging study has suggested that the ER effects of CR might largely be explained by AD. In this study, I manipulated CR while holding visual AD constant across CR conditions. In a randomized within-subjects design, 54 participants used CR to increase and decrease emotion in response to unpleasant pictures. This was compared with simply viewing the pictures. On all trials, gaze was directed to a circumscribed area of the pictures. Even with gaze held constant across conditions, increase reappraisals led to higher ratings of emotional intensity, greater corrugator activity, and greater autonomic arousal. In addition, decrease reappraisals led to lower ratings of emotional intensity and lower corrugator activity, the latter of which held only when gaze was directed to arousing information. Overall, the results suggest that changes in appraisal are the likely mechanism for the ER effects of CR.",2010.0,34.0,147.0,"{'volume': '10 1', 'pages': '\n          125-35\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Urry2010SeeingTA,\n author = {Heather L.

However, the full values and potential of online communities cannot be realised without users' ongoing participation. Thus, this study aims at developing and empirically testing a research model to examine users' continuance intention to participate in an online community based on an extended information systems (IS) continuance model. Specifically, entertainment value and affective commitment are included in the IS continuance model and empirically examined in the context of online communities. A total of 240 returns collected from an online survey, which was conducted among users of a website bulletin board-based community in China, were analysed using partial least squares. The results reveal that users' continuance intention to participate in an online community is determined by both satisfaction and affective commitment. Satisfaction and affective commitment are, in turn, influenced by positive disconfirmations of purposive and entertainment values. The findings of this study contribute not only to theory building in online community continuance but also inform online community moderators in their effort to develop strategies for retaining their users.",2010.0,54.0,160.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '383 - 394', 'name': 'Behaviour & Information Technology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jin2010PredictingCI,\n author = {Xiaoling Jin and Matthew K.

This paper reports on the hardware and software instrumentation development and signal processing approach used to detect changes in the stress level of a subject interacting with a computer, within the framework of a specific experimental task. For this experiment a computer game was implemented on the basis of a clinical mental stress test, called the 'Stroop Test', adapted to make the subject experience two different levels of stress, while his/her BVP, GSR and PD signals were continuously recorded Several data processing techniques were applied to extract effective attributes of the 'stress' state of the subjects.

Expanding on the upper part of this framework, we then propose the Multilevel Personality in Context (MPIC) model, showing how it integrates and extends past theorizing on the hierarchical organization of personality. The model builds upon McAdams's three-tier (traits, goals, and selves) conception of personality, adding a foundational level (psychological needs) beneath individual differences and incorporating social relations and cultural factors as higher level influences upon behavior and individual differences. New data (N= 3,665 in 21 cultures) are briefly presented showing that culture, self, motive, and trait variables each have independent effects upon subjective well-being (SWB) and showing that psychological need satisfaction (at the foundational level) mediates these effects as predicted. Consistent with McAdams and Pals's (2006) “fifth principle” of personality, culture had top-down effects upon self-level variables and moderated several of the relations to SWB. We conclude by suggesting some general heuristics for designing studies using the MPIC approach.",2011.0,66.0,105.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '1 - 16', 'name': 'Psychological Inquiry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sheldon2011UnderstandingWA,\n author = {Kennon M.

We report here the application of a method based on information theory that decomposes one or more ERPs recorded at multiple scalp sensors into a sum of components with fixed scalp distributions and sparsely activated, maximally independent time courses. Independent component analysis (ICA) decomposes ERP data into a number of components equal to the number of sensors. The derived components have distinct but not necessarily orthogonal scalp projections. Unlike dipole-fitting methods, the algorithm does not model the locations of their generators in the head. Unlike methods that remove second-order correlations, such as principal component analysis (PCA), ICA also minimizes higher-order dependencies. Applied to detected-and undetected-target ERPs from an auditory vigilance experiment, the algorithm derived ten components that decomposed each of the major response peaks into one or more ICA components with relatively simple scalp distributions. Three of these components were active only when the subject detected the targets, three other components only when the target went undetected, and one in both cases. Three additional components accounted for the steady-state brain response to a 39-Hz background click train. Major features of the decomposition proved robust across sessions and changes in sensor number and placement. This method of ERP analysis can be used to compare responses from multiple stimuli, task conditions, and subject states.",1997.0,47.0,1201.0,"{'volume': '94 20', 'pages': '\n          10979-84\n        ', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Makeig1997BlindSO,\n author = {S.

Healthy participants (n = 90) with varying levels of vulnerability (psychosis symptoms assessed by the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences) were randomly assigned to either an anxiety or a nonanxiety condition. Anxiety was induced by pictures from the International Affective Picture System and by in sensu exposure to individual anxiety-provoking situations. During each condition, symptoms of paranoia were assessed by a state-adapted version of the Paranoia Checklist. Jumping to conclusions (JTC) was assessed using a modified version of the beads task. Overall, participants in the anxiety condition reported significantly more paranoid thoughts and showed more JTC than participants in the neutral condition. Participants with higher baseline vulnerability were more likely to show an increase in paranoia as reaction to the anxiety manipulation. Moreover, the association of anxiety and paranoia was mediated by the increased tendency to jump to conclusions in the beads task. The results are in line with a threat anticipation conceptualization of paranoia and provide evidence for an interaction of anxiety and reasoning biases in the development of paranoid beliefs. A combination of meta-cognitive training directed at reasoning biases and promoting emotion regulation skills might prove beneficial in preventing symptoms.",2010.0,68.0,172.0,"{'volume': '36 6', 'pages': '\n          1140-8\n        ', 'name': 'Schizophrenia bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lincoln2010TheEO,\n author = {T.

Few measures have been developed specifically to assess individual differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies. This paper reports on a new self-report instrument designed to assess the frequency with which adolescents use both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, which draw on both internal (intrapersonal) and external (interpersonal) resources to regulate emotions. The new measure was used in a cross-sectional survey of 225 adolescents. Factor analyses supported the structure of the measure, which has four scales: ‘internal-functional’, ‘internal-dysfunctional’, ‘external-functional’ and ‘external-dysfunctional’ emotion regulation. The new measure demonstrated good psychometric properties. Frequent use of dysfunctional emotion regulation was significantly positively correlated with parent reports of level of emotional and behavioural problems, and also with self-reported level of psychosomatic health problems. Frequent use of functional emotion regulation was significantly positively correlated with self-reported quality of life across a number of different dimensions. These results provide evidence for the validity of the measure. The results also highlight that assessment of both functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation is important. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2007.0,26.0,162.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '145-156', 'name': 'Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Phillips2007ANS,\n author = {K.

However, psychological therapies that promote adaptive emotion regulation may be inaccessible and unattractive to youth. Digital interventions may help address this need. Objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize evidence on the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of emotion regulation digital interventions in children and early adolescents aged 8 to 14 years. Methods Systematic searches of Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Education Resources Information Centre, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore up to July 2020 identified 39 studies, of which 11 (28%) were included in the meta-analyses (n=2476 participants). A bespoke tool was used to assess risk of bias. Results The studies evaluated digital games (27/39, 69%), biofeedback (4/39, 10%), virtual or augmented reality (4/39, 10%), and program or multimedia (4/39, 10%) digital interventions in samples classified as diagnosed, at risk, healthy, and universal. The most consistent evidence came from digital games, which reduced negative emotional experience with a small significant effect, largely in youth at risk of anxiety (Hedges g=–0.19, 95% CI –0.34 to –0.04). In general, digital interventions tended to improve emotion regulation, but this effect was not significant (Hedges g=0.19, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.54). Conclusions Most feasibility issues were identified in diagnosed youth, and acceptability was generally high across intervention types and samples. Although there is cause to be optimistic about digital interventions supporting the difficulties that youth experience in emotion regulation, the predominance of early-stage development studies highlights the need for more work in this area.",2021.0,154.0,1.0,"{'name': 'JMIR Serious Games', 'volume': '10'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Reynard2021DigitalIF,\n author = {Sally Reynard and João Dias and Marija Mitic and B.

It remains unclear whether NFB can be used to aid and sustain complex emotions, with ecological validity implications. We provide a technical proof of concept of a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) NFB procedure. Using rtfMRI-NFB, we enabled participants to voluntarily enhance their own neural activity while they experienced complex emotions. The rtfMRI-NFB software (FRIEND Engine) was adapted to provide a virtual environment as brain computer interface (BCI) and musical excerpts to induce two emotions (tenderness and anguish), aided by participants' preferred personalized strategies to maximize the intensity of these emotions. Eight participants from two experimental sites performed rtfMRI-NFB on two consecutive days in a counterbalanced design. On one day, rtfMRI-NFB was delivered to participants using a region of interest (ROI) method, while on the other day using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our multimodal VR/NFB approach was technically feasible and robust as a method for real-time measurement of the neural correlates of complex emotional states and their voluntary modulation. Guided by the color changes of the virtual environment BCI during rtfMRI-NFB, participants successfully increased in real time, the activity of the septo-hypothalamic area and the amygdala during the ROI based rtfMRI-NFB, and successfully evoked distributed patterns of brain activity classified as tenderness and anguish during SVM-based rtfMRI-NFB. Offline fMRI analyses confirmed that during tenderness rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the septo-hypothalamic area and other regions ascribed to social affiliative emotions (medial frontal / temporal pole and precuneus). During anguish rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the amygdala and other dorsolateral prefrontal and additional regions associated with negative affect. These findings were robust and were demonstrable at the individual subject level, and were reflected in self-reported emotion intensity during rtfMRI-NFB, being observed with both ROI and SVM methods and across the two sites. Our multimodal VR/rtfMRI-NFB protocol provides an engaging tool for brain-based interventions to enhance emotional states in healthy subjects and may find applications in clinical conditions associated with anxiety, stress and impaired empathy among others.",2018.0,76.0,59.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Neurology', 'volume': '9'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lorenzetti2018EmotionRU,\n author = {V.

Wobble boards represent a relatively inexpensive type of equipment that may be used to train one's ankles preventively or as part of the rehabilitation process once the damage has been done. However, individuals in need of such training frequently lack the motivation necessary in order to successfully complete the training or rehabilitation process. This paper details the design and implementation of a prototype intended to alleviate this problem by leveraging games' potential as a source of intrinsic motivation. More specifically, the prototype enables users to control a game by means of a wobble board, thus allowing them to perform the necessary exercises while playing. An expert on ankle rehabilitation assessed the efficacy of the training facilitated by the prototype, and 40 individuals partook in a quantitative test performed in order to determine whether the prototype could potentially provide the needed motivation. Based on the findings from the two tests, it is concluded that the prototype does ensure correct ankle training and the act of playing was experienced as intrinsically motivating by the majority of the test participants.",2012.0,31.0,17.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '69-84', 'name': 'PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nilsson2012GameplayAA,\n author = {N.

However, some patients are resistant to self-compassion. Aims To investigate whether the effects of self-identification with virtual bodies within immersive virtual reality could be exploited to increase self-compassion in patients with depression. Method We developed an 8-minute scenario in which 15 patients practised delivering compassion in one virtual body and then experienced receiving it from themselves in another virtual body. Results In an open trial, three repetitions of this scenario led to significant reductions in depression severity and self-criticism, as well as to a significant increase in self-compassion, from baseline to 4-week follow-up. Four patients showed clinically significant improvement. Conclusions The results indicate that interventions using immersive virtual reality may have considerable clinical potential and that further development of these methods preparatory to a controlled trial is now warranted.

A wide range of smart watches, bands, garments, and patches with embedded sensors, small portable devices and mobile applications now exist to record and provide users with feedback on many different physical performance variables. These variables include cardiorespiratory function, movement patterns, sweat analysis, tissue oxygenation, sleep, emotional state, and changes in cognitive function following concussion. In this review, we have summarized the features and evaluated the characteristics of a cross-section of technologies for health and sports performance according to what the technology is claimed to do, whether it has been validated and is reliable, and if it is suitable for general consumer use. Consumers who are choosing new technology should consider whether it (1) produces desirable (or non-desirable) outcomes, (2) has been developed based on real-world need, and (3) has been tested and proven effective in applied studies in different settings. Among the technologies included in this review, more than half have not been validated through independent research. Only 5% of the technologies have been formally validated. Around 10% of technologies have been developed for and used in research. The value of such technologies for consumer use is debatable, however, because they may require extra time to set up and interpret the data they produce. Looking to the future, the rapidly expanding market of health and sports performance technology has much to offer consumers. To create a competitive advantage, companies producing health and performance technologies should consult with consumers to identify real-world need, and invest in research to prove the effectiveness of their products.

Thus the lip image synthesis plays an important role to realize a natural human-like face of computer agents. Moreover the synthesized lip movement images can compensate lack of auditory information for hearing impaired people. We propose a novel lip movement synthesis method based on mapping from input speech based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This paper compares the HMM-based method and a conventional method using vector quantization (VQ). In the experiment, error and time differential error between synthesized lip movement images and original ones are used for evaluation. The result shows that the error of the HMM based method is 8.7% smaller than that of the VQ-based method. Moreover, the HMM-based method reduces time differential error by 32% than the VQ's. The result also shows that the errors are mostly caused by phoneme /h/ and /Q/. Since lip shapes of those phonemes are strongly dependent on succeeding phoneme, the context dependent synthesis on the HMM-based method is applied to reduce the error. The improved HMM-based method realizes reduction of the error (differential error) by 10.5% (11%) compared with the original HMM-based method.",1998.0,23.0,136.0,"{'pages': '154-159', 'name': 'Proceedings Third IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yamamoto1998LipMS,\n author = {E.

A nimals and humans all manifest social qualities and skills. Dogs recognize dominance and submission , stand corrected by their superiors, demonstrate consistent personalities, and so forth. On the other hand, only humans communicate through language and carry on conversations with one another. The skills involved in human conversation have developed in such a way as to exploit all the special characteristics of the human body. We make complex repre-sentational gestures with our prehensile hands, gaze away and toward one another out of the corners of our centrally set eyes, and use the pitch and melody of our flexible voices to emphasize and clarify what we are saying. Perhaps because conversation is so defining of humanness and human interaction, the metaphor of face-to-face conversation has been applied to human-computer interface design for quite some time. One of the early arguments for the utility of this metaphor pointed to the application of the features of face-to-face conversation in human-computer interaction, including mixed initiative, nonverbal communication , sense of presence, and the rules involved in transferring control [9]. However, although these features have gained widespread recognition, human-computer conversation has only recently become more than a metaphor. That is, only recently have human-computer interface designers taken the metaphor seriously enough to attempt to design a computer that could hold up its end of the conversation with a human user. Here, I describe some of the features of human-human conversation being implemented in this new genre of embodied conversational agent, exploring a notable embodied conversational agent—named Rea—based on these features.

How should we organize the myriad ways people attempt to regulate their emotions? We explore the utility of a framework that distinguishes among four fundamental classes of emotion regulation strategies. The framework describes each strategy class in terms their behavioral characteristics, underlying psychological processes and supporting neural systems. A key feature of this multi-level framework is its conceptualization of the psychological processes in terms of two orthogonal dimensions that describe (i) the nature of the emotion regulation goal (ranging from to implicit to explicit) and (ii) the nature of the emotion change process (ranging from more automatic to more controlled). After describing the core elements of the framework, we use it to review human and animal research on the neural bases of emotion regulation and to suggest key directions for future research on emotion regulation.",2017.0,153.0,309.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '1545 - 1557', 'name': 'Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Braunstein2017ExplicitAI,\n author = {Laura Martin Braunstein and J.

The treatment of choice for this disorder is considered to be cognitive-behavioral therapy, which uses exposure techniques. This technique is underused in clinical practice on account of both psychologist and patients considering it to be highly aversive and painful. Currently there are several studies supporting the usefulness of virtual reality (VR) in the treatment of PTSD, overcoming some of the limitations of exposure therapy. Dr. C. Botella’s team from the University Jaime I of Castellon, has developed a VR system called «EMMA’s world» with a view to easing the emotional processing of emotions related to post-traumatic reactions in adults. For its use in traumatized children we adapted the EMMA system, called EMMA-Childhood.

It is unclear if this elevated risk extends into late adolescence. The aim of this study was to test whether bullying perpetration and victimization in elementary school predict psychotic experiences in late adolescence. Method The current study is based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective community-based study. A total of 4720 subjects with bullying perpetration and victimization were repeatedly assessed between the ages of 8 and 11 years by child and mother reports. Suspected or definite psychotic experiences were assessed with the Psychosis-Like Symptoms semi-structured interview at age 18 years. Results Controlling for child's gender, intelligence quotient at age 8 years, childhood behavioural and emotional problems, and also depression symptoms and psychotic experiences in early adolescence, victims [child report at 10 years: odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6–3.4; mother report: OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.3], bully/victims (child report at 10 years: OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7–5.8; mother: OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7–5.0) and bullies (child report at 10 years: OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3–17.7; mother: OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.46–3.1, n.s.) had a higher prevalence of psychotic experiences at age 18 years. Path analysis revealed that the association between peer victimization in childhood and psychotic experiences at age 18 years was only partially mediated by psychotic or depression symptoms in early adolescence. Conclusions Involvement in bullying, whether as victim, bully/victim or bully, may increase the risk of developing psychotic experiences in adolescence.

However, the mechanisms underlying these social effects remain to be specified. We examined one potential mediator that arises directly from emotion-regulatory effort (expression of positive emotion), and another mediator that does not involve emotion processes per se, but instead results from the link between regulation and self-processes (subjective inauthenticity). Across three studies, only inauthenticity mediated the link between habitual use of suppression and poor social functioning (lower relationship satisfaction, lower social support). These findings replicated across individuals socialized in Western and East Asian cultural contexts, younger and older adults, when predicting social functioning concurrently and a decade later, and even when broader adjustment was controlled. Thus, the social costs of suppression do not seem to be due to reduced positive emotion expression but rather the incongruence between inner-self and outer-behavior. Reappraisal was not consistently related to social functioning. Implications of these findings for emotion processes, self processes, and interpersonal relationships are discussed.",2013.0,93.0,260.0,"{'volume': '13 2', 'pages': '\n          314-329\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{English2013UnderstandingTS,\n author = {T.

To do so, a computational model is proposed that embraces explicit intentions in the agents that are aimed at increasing the other's relations towards them.

Consistent with this idea, we found that the use of situation selection interacted with individual differences in emotional reactivity and competence at emotion regulation to predict emotional outcomes in both a correlational (Study 1; N = 301) and an experimental field study (Study 2; N = 125).

The present research examined whether Eastern dialectical beliefs about negative emotions lead to cultural differences in how people regulate their emotions after experiencing a negative event. We hypothesized that, because of dialectical beliefs about negative emotions prevalent in Eastern culture, Easterners are less motivated than Westerners to engage in hedonic emotion regulation-up-regulation of positive emotions and down-regulation of negative emotions. By assessing online reactions to a recent negative event, Study 1 found that European Americans are more motivated to engage in hedonic emotion regulation. Furthermore, consistent with the reported motivation to regulate emotion hedonically, European Americans show a steeper decline in negative emotions 1 day later than do Asians. By examining retrospective memory of reactions to a past negative event, Study 2 further showed that cultural differences in hedonic emotion regulation are mediated by cultural differences in dialectical beliefs about motivational and cognitive utility of negative emotions, but not by personal deservingness or self-efficacy beliefs.

Generally, social skills training designed to help patients develop social skills includes role-playing, but this form of training has typical shortcomings, which are largely due to a trainer's difficulties to project emotion. Virtual reality (VR)-based techniques have the potential to solve these difficulties, because they provide a computer-generated but realistic three-dimensional world and humanlike avatars that can provide emotional stimuli. In this paper, we report on a method of implementing virtual environments (VEs) in order to train people with schizophrenia to develop conversational skills in specific situations, which could overcome the shortcomings of or complement conventional role-playing techniques.

Firstly, there is no general service platform for such robots.

In one sense, explicated in this paper, to call an emotion appropriate is to say that the emotion is fitting: it accurately presents its object as having certain evaluative features. For instance, envy might be thought appropriate when one's rival has something good which one lacks. But someone might grant that a circumstance has these features, yet deny that envy is appropriate, on the grounds that it is wrong to be envious. These two senses of 'appropriate' have much less in common than philosophers have supposed. Indeed, the distinction between propriety and correctness is crucial to understanding the distinctive role of the emotions in ethics. We argue here that an emotion can be fitting despite being wrong to feel, and that various philosophical arguments are guilty of a systematic error which we term the moralistic fallacy.",2000.0,19.0,467.0,"{'volume': '61', 'pages': '65-90', 'name': 'Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{D'arms2000TheMF,\n author = {Justin D'arms and Daniel Jacobson},\n journal = {Philosophy and Phenomenological Research},\n pages = {65-90},\n title = {The Moralistic Fallacy: On the 'Appropriateness' of Emotions},\n volume = {61},\n year = {2000}\n}\n""}","[{'authorId': '1410845292', 'name': ""Justin D'arms""}, {'authorId': '143601261', 'name': 'Daniel Jacobson'}]"

Anthropomorphism can be seen as the extension of ToM to non-human entities. This review examines the literature concerning ToM and anthropomorphism in relation to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), specifically addressing the questions of how and why those on the spectrum both show an increased interest for anthropomorphism and may even show improved ToM abilities when judging the mental states of anthropomorphic characters. This review highlights that while individuals with ASD traditionally show deficits on a wide range of ToM tests, such as recognizing facial emotions, such ToM deficits may be ameliorated if the stimuli presented is cartoon or animal-like rather than in human form. Individuals with ASD show a greater interest in anthropomorphic characters and process the features of these characters using methods typically reserved for human stimuli. Personal accounts of individuals with ASD also suggest they may identify more closely with animals than other humans. It is shown how the social motivations hypothesized to underlie the anthropomorphizing of non-human targets may lead those on the spectrum to seek social connections and therefore gain ToM experience and expertise amongst unlikely sources.",2018.0,186.0,42.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Atherton2018SeeingMT,\n author = {Gray Atherton and Liam B.

Younger adults did not exhibit this attentional bias. Interactions of age and valence were also found for memory for the faces, with older adults remembering positive better than negative faces.

Then, we describe a character-based job interview scenario where a user's affective state derived from physiological data is projected back (or 'mirrored') to the user in real-time.

Other work has shown that autistic individuals may not underperform on ToM tests when the agent of evaluation is anthropomorphic rather than typically human. Two studies examined the relation between ToM and autistic trait profiles in over 650 adults using either the standard Faux Pas Recognition Test (FPT) or an anthropomorphized version of the FPT (FPTa). Results showed that autistic trait profiles were related to faux pas detection ability in the FPT but not the FPTa. Furthermore, while those with the broad autism phenotype scored significantly worse than those who were typically developed on the FPT, scores did not significantly differ on the FPTa. These findings add to a growing body of work suggesting that ToM ability is not at a global deficit in those on the autistic spectrum, but may relate to the mindreading of specifically human agents.",2019.0,64.0,14.0,"{'volume': '180', 'pages': '81 - 95', 'name': 'The Journal of Genetic Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Atherton2019AnimalFP,\n author = {Gray Atherton and Liam B.

Fear reactions in spider-phobic patients can be activated by specific perceptual cues or by conceptual fear-related information. Matching perceptual fear cues and fear-related information were expected to result in maximal fear responses, perceptual fear cues alone in less fear, and information alone in the weakest responses.


METHOD
We used virtual reality to manipulate the available cues and information. Forty-eight phobic patients and 48 healthy participants were repeatedly exposed to either a perceptual cue, information, or a combination of both.


RESULTS
In conditions with a fear-relevant perceptual cue, phobic patients reported increased fear compared to the condition with information only. Across exposures trials, these reactions diminished. Skin conductance in phobic patients was significantly higher in the combined than in the cue or the information condition.


CONCLUSIONS
Perceptual cues are essential for phobic fear reactions in spider phobia. In combination with fear-relevant information, perceptual cues activate an intense and persistent fear reaction.",2014.0,36.0,36.0,"{'volume': '70 7', 'pages': '\n          704-14\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Peperkorn2014TriggersOF,\n author = {Henrik M.

Two crucial everyday tasks that people with ASD typically struggle with are managing finances and recognizing emotions. As the online gaming sector grows and develops, the question of why this type of media can't be used as a useful educational tool for those with ASD arises. This paper discusses this issue via a novel virtual agent-based multiplayer online serious game referred to as ""EMOCASH,"" which aims to improve these important tasks for Egyptian children with ASD and achieve transfer of acquired knowledge to real-world situations via a 3D virtual shop scenario that was designed using the Autism ASPECTSS Design Index. EMOCASH served as an instrument for investigating the following research question: What role does technology play in the education of those with ASD?

We assessed the effectiveness of two smartphone applications games combined with biofeedback in reducing stress. Methods: We compared a control game to gaming-style smartphone applications combined with a skin conductance biofeedback device (the Pip). Fifty participants aged between 18 and 35 completed the Trier Social Stress Test. They were then randomly assigned to the intervention (biofeedback game) or control group (a non-biofeedback game) for thirty minutes. Perceived stress, heart rate and mood were measured before and after participants had played the games. Results: A mixed factorial ANOVA showed a significant interaction between time and game type in predicting perceived stress [F(1,48) = 14.19, p < 0.001]. Participants in the biofeedback intervention had significantly reduced stress compared to the control group. There was also a significant interaction between time and game in predicting heart rate [F(1,48) = 6.41, p < 0.05].

Unlike other animals, humans have the unique ability to control and modulate instinctive emotional reactions through intellectual processes such as reasoning, rationalizing, and labeling our experiences. This study used functional MRI to identify the neural networks underlying this ability. Subjects either matched the affect of one of two faces to that of a simultaneously presented target face (a perceptual task) or identified the affect of a target face by choosing one of two simultaneously presented linguistic labels (an intellectual task). Matching angry or frightened expressions was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the left and right amygdala, the brain's primary fear centers. Labeling these same expressions was associated with a diminished rCBF response in the amygdalae. This decrease correlated with a simultaneous increase in rCBF in the right prefrontal cortex, a neocortical region implicated in regulating emotional responses. These results provide evidence for a network in which higher regions attenuate emotional responses at the most fundamental levels in the brain and suggest a neural basis for modulating emotional experience through interpretation and labeling.",2000.0,19.0,1243.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '43–48', 'name': 'NeuroReport'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hariri2000ModulatingER,\n author = {A.

1749,99b0926673c7a727eff3697d579ce1a69056fc75,Relaxation with Immersive Natural Scenes Presented Using Virtual Reality.,"INTRODUCTION
Virtual reality (VR) can provide exposure to nature for those living in isolated confined environments. We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood.


METHODS
There were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality.


RESULTS
Reductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (-0.59, -0.52, and 0.32 μS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline ( 1.2 and 1.1 points), but the control scene did not ( 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect ( 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene ( 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points).


DISCUSSION
Natural scene VR provided relaxation both objectively and subjectively, and scene preference had a significant effect on mood and perception of scene quality. VR may enable relaxation for people living in isolated confined environments, particularly when matched to personal preferences.Anderson AP, Mayer MD, Fellows AM, Cowan DR, Hegel MT, Buckey JC.

However, CVEs differ in type of avatar representation and level of behavioral realism afforded to users. The present investigation compared the effect of behavioral realism on users' nonverbal behavior, self-presence, social presence, and interpersonal attraction during a dyadic interaction. Fifty-one dyads (aged 18 to 26) embodied either a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands and inferred arm movements, an avatar consisting of only a floating head and mapped hands, or a static full-bodied avatar. Planned contrasts compared the effect of behavioral realism against no behavioral realism, and compared the effect of low versus high behavioral realism. Results show that participants who embodied the avatar with only a floating head and hands experienced greater social presence, self-presence, and interpersonal attraction than participants who embodied a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands. In contrast, there were no significant differences on these measures between participants in the two mapped-hands conditions and those who embodied a static avatar. Participants in the static-avatar condition rotated their own physical head and hands significantly less than participants in the other two conditions during the dyadic interaction. Additionally, side-to-side head movements were negatively correlated with interpersonal attraction regardless of condition. We discuss implications of the finding that behavioral realism influences nonverbal behavior and communication outcomes.",2018.0,62.0,37.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '163-182', 'name': 'PRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Herrera2018EffectOB,\n author = {Fernanda Herrera and Soo Youn Oh and J.

However, online training is challenged to reproduce the hands-on element that is critical to adult learning. Since most adults learn better when they manipulate objects in a real environment, a virtual environment can help replicate the physical training environment while maintaining effectiveness. This pilot study focused on the use of 3-D virtual safety exercises to enhance online training. In these simulations, workers interacted within a virtual environment that simulates a live, hands-on environment, but without risk. Results indicate that participants in a virtual environment retained as much information as peers trained in the mechanical lab environment.

However, there has been a recent convergence among numerous theoretical orientations in drawing from investigations of emotions within basic affective sciences, which highlight the survival and societal functions of emotions, the involvement of multiple biological systems in emotion generation, and a dynamic model for regulatory aspects of emotions. These characterizations of emotion suggest a number of ways that current treatments may benefit from explicit incorporation of interventions targeting emotions, particularly for resistant forms of adult psychopathology. Specifically, emotion-related skills training and broadening the role of emotions in meaning change may be important areas for expansion within the treatment of adult psychopathology.",2007.0,165.0,178.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '329-352', 'name': 'Clinical Psychology-science and Practice'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mennin2007EmotionAE,\n author = {D.

Little is known, however, about whether emotion regulation also has cognitive consequences. A process model of emotion suggests that expressive suppression should reduce memory for emotional events but that reappraisal should not. Three studies tested this hypothesis. Study 1 experimentally manipulated expressive suppression during film viewing, showing that suppression led to poorer memory for the details of the film. Study 2 manipulated expressive suppression and reappraisal during slide viewing. Only suppression led to poorer slide memory. Study 3 examined individual differences in typical expressive suppression and reappraisal and found that suppression was associated with poorer self-reported and objective memory but that reappraisal was not.

1762,9a329ac01124b1b23a06ccaad929911d87ab9c5e,Energy limitation as a selective pressure on the evolution of sensory systems,"SUMMARY Evolution of animal morphology, physiology and behaviour is shaped by the selective pressures to which they are subject. Some selective pressures act to increase the benefits accrued whilst others act to reduce the costs incurred, affecting the cost/benefit ratio. Selective pressures therefore produce a trade-off between costs and benefits that ultimately influences the fitness of the whole organism. The nervous system has a unique position as the interface between morphology, physiology and behaviour; the final output of the nervous system is the behaviour of the animal, which is a product of both its morphology and physiology. The nervous system is under selective pressure to generate adaptive behaviour, but at the same time is subject to costs related to the amount of energy that it consumes. Characterising this trade-off between costs and benefits is essential to understanding the evolution of nervous systems, including our own. Within the nervous system, sensory systems are the most amenable to analysing costs and benefits, not only because their function can be more readily defined than that of many central brain regions and their benefits quantified in terms of their performance, but also because recent studies of sensory systems have begun to directly assess their energetic costs. Our review focuses on the visual system in particular, although the principles we discuss are equally applicable throughout the nervous system. Examples are taken from a wide range of sensory modalities in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We aim to place the studies we review into an evolutionary framework. We combine experimentally determined measures of energy consumption from whole retinas of rabbits and flies with intracellular measurements of energy consumption from single fly photoreceptors and recently constructed energy budgets for neural processing in rats to assess the contributions of various components to neuronal energy consumption. Taken together, these studies emphasize the high costs of maintaining neurons at rest and whilst signalling. A substantial proportion of neuronal energy consumption is related to the movements of ions across the neuronal cell membrane through ion channels, though other processes such as vesicle loading and transmitter recycling also consume energy. Many of the energetic costs within neurons are linked to 3Na+/2K+ ATPase activity, which consumes energy to pump Na+ and K+ ions across the cell membrane and is essential for the maintenance of the resting potential and its restoration following signalling. Furthermore, recent studies in fly photoreceptors show that energetic costs can be related, via basic biophysical relationships, to their function. These findings emphasize that neurons are subject to a law of diminishing returns that severely penalizes excess functional capacity with increased energetic costs. The high energetic costs associated with neural tissue favour energy efficient coding and wiring schemes, which have been found in numerous sensory systems. We discuss the role of these efficient schemes in reducing the costs of information processing. Assessing evidence from a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate examples, we show that reducing energy expenditure can account for many of the morphological features of sensory systems and has played a key role in their evolution.",2008.0,149.0,876.0,"{'volume': '211', 'pages': '1792 - 1804', 'name': 'Journal of Experimental Biology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Niven2008EnergyLA,\n author = {J.

An AAC system was devised in order to generate a stimulus set covering nine discrete sectors of a two-dimensional emotion space by means of a 16-channel feed-forward artificial neural network. This system was used to generate a stimulus set of short pieces of music, which were rendered using a sampled piano timbre and evaluated by a group of experienced listeners who ascribed a two-dimensional valence-arousal coordinate to each stimulus. The underlying musical feature set, initially drawn from the literature, was subsequently adjusted by amplifying or attenuating the quantity of each feature in order to maximize the spread of stimuli in the valence-arousal space before a second listener evaluation was conducted. This process was repeated a third time in order to maximize the spread of valence-arousal coordinates ascribed to the generated stimulus set in comparison to a spread taken from an existing prerated database of stimuli, demonstrating that this prototype AAC system is capable of creating short sequences of music with a slight improvement on the range of emotion found in a stimulus set comprised of real-world, traditionally composed musical excerpts.",2017.0,42.0,25.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '1 - 13', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Applied Perception (TAP)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Williams2017AffectiveCO,\n author = {Duncan A.

This paper expands on recent work which allowed unidirectional touch from human to VH, by evaluating bidirectional touch as a new channel for nonverbal communication. A VH augmented with a haptic interface is able to touch her interaction partner using a pseudo-haptic touch or an active-haptic touch from a co-located mechanical arm. Within the context of a simulated doctor-patient interaction, two user studies (n = 54) investigate how touch can be used by both human and VH to communicate. Results show that human-to-VH touch is used for the same communication purposes as human-to-human touch, and that VH-to-human touch (pseudo-haptic and active-haptic) allows the VH to communicate with its human interaction partner. The enhanced nonverbal communication provided by bidirectional touch has the potential to solve difficult problems in VH research, such as disambiguating user speech, enforcing social norms, and achieving rapport with VHs.",2009.0,16.0,29.0,"{'pages': '175-178', 'name': '2009 IEEE Virtual Reality Conference'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kotranza2009VirtualHT,\n author = {Aaron Kotranza and Benjamin C.

Respondents to an extensive web-survey's (FLOSS-US 2003) questions about their reasons for beginning to work FLOSS are classified according to their distinct ""motivational profiles"" by hierarchical cluster analysis. Over half of them also are matched to projects of known membership sizes, revealing that although some members from each of the clusters are present in the small, medium and large ranges of the distribution of project sizes, the mixing fractions for the large and the very small project ranges are statistically different. Among developers who changed projects, there is a discernable flow from the bottom toward the very small towards to large projects, some of which is motivated by individuals seeking to improve their programming skills. It is found that the profile of early motivation, along with other individual attributes, significantly affects individual developers' selections of projects from different regions of the size range.",2008.0,87.0,163.0,{'name': 'Entrepreneurship & the Social Sciences eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{David2008CommunityBasedPO,\n author = {P.

For virtual environments where social interaction is needed, an agent's facial expression may communicate emotive state to users both young and old. However, younger and older adults differ in how they label human facial expressions (Ruffman et al., 2008). Such possible age-related differences in labeling virtual agent expressions may impact the user's social experience in a virtual environment. The purpose of the current research was to investigate age-related differences in emotion recognition of several on-screen characters of varying degrees of human-likeness. Participants performed a recognition task with three characters demonstrating four basic emotions or neutral. The results indicated age-related differences for all character types. Older adults commonly mislabeled the human and synthetic human emotions of anger, fear, sadness, and neutral. For the virtual agent face, older adults commonly mislabeled the emotions of anger, fear, happiness, and neutral.",2010.0,12.0,10.0,"{'name': 'Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting', 'pages': '2388 - 2392', 'volume': '54'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Beer2010RecognizingEI,\n author = {Jenay M.

We dismiss the traditional dichotomy between reactive and symbolic architectures. A classiication in terms of the amount of knowledge embedded in the system is made, instead, running from regulatory to planning to adaptive agents. Regulatory agents are implementable as control systems or automata, and represent the ideal case in which the agent has all the knowledge it needs. We nd that each type of agent is best suited for a particular kind of behavior. The diierent kinds of behavior form a hierarchy in terms of frequency of occurrence and response time, and do not gracefully reduce to each other. This suggests implementing agents as hierarchies of simpler agents, each specialized in the kind of behavior it implements. In this scheme, agents at one level act through agents at the next lower level. We introduce the concept of drive to address the issue of where an agent's goals come from. A discussion is made of common pitfalls and suggestions for the design of planning agents. Finally, a parallel architecture that embodies many of the ideas presented is sketched and discussed. This architecture solves the two major problems present in Georgee's earlier architecture, PRS: strictly sequential execution, and inability to learn.",1991.0,17.0,53.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Brustoloni1991AutonomousAC,\n author = {J.

The proposed system consists of five stages: video capturing, fuzzy image processing, signal processing, feature extraction and, classification. The pupil parameters including Pupil Diameter (PD) and Pupil Dilation Acceleration (PDA) are measured using soft computing techniques wherein the eye region is detected using the genetic algorithm (GA), and a fuzzy filter is designed for noise reduction. Edge detection is performed based on fuzzy reasoning and linking is done using Hough transform. Then, signal processing technique is applied to the pupil parameters to extract their most relevant features. Extracted features are imported into the learning system to classify the affective states between ""stress"" and ""relaxed"". The Fuzzy SVM (FSVM) is applied to this classification process. In order to induce the stress in subjects, a Stroop color-word test is designed. Also, the results obtained from the pupil parameters are compared with two other physiological signals including Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). The experimental results indicate the pupil parameters have great potential for stress recognition compared to the other two physiological signals and, proposed stress recognition system is promising.",2011.0,12.0,25.0,"{'pages': '430-433', 'name': '2011 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mokhayeri2011MentalSD,\n author = {F.

It is proposed that infants first become sensitised to their categorical emotion-states through a natural social biofeedback process provided by the parent's 'marked' reflections of the baby's emotion displays during affect-regulative interactions. They argue that this sensitisation process is mediated (similarly to that of adult biofeedback training) by the mechanism of contingency-detection and maximising. Apart from sensitisation, affect-mirroring serves three further developmental functions: (1) it contributes to the infant's state-regulation; (2) it leads to the establishment of secondary representations that become associated with the infant's primary procedural affect-states providing the cognitive means for accessing and attributing emotions to the self; (3) it results in the development of a generalised communicative code of ""marked' expressions characterised by the representational functions of referential decoupling, anchoring and suspension of realistic consequences. They consider the clinical implications of our theory, relating it to current psychodynamic approaches to the functions of parental affect-mirroring. Using their model they identify various types of deviant mirroring styles and speculate about their developmental consequences. Finally, they discuss what role their social biofeedback model may play as a mediating mechanism in the therapeutic process.",1996.0,70.0,575.0,"{'volume': '77 ( Pt 6)', 'pages': '\n          1181-212\n        ', 'name': 'The International journal of psycho-analysis'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gergely1996TheSB,\n author = {G.

Those with chronic pain endure frequent or constant discomfort in their daily lives, sometimes severely limiting their physical capacities. With the advent of affordable consumer-grade equipment, clinicians have access to a promising and engaging intervention for pediatric pain, both acute and chronic. In addition to providing relief from acute and procedural pain, virtual reality (VR) may also help to provide a corrective psychological and physiological environment to facilitate rehabilitation for pediatric patients suffering from chronic pain. The special qualities of VR such as presence, interactivity, customization, social interaction, and embodiment allow it to be accepted by children and adolescents and incorporated successfully into their existing medical therapies. However, the powerful and transformative nature of many VR experiences may also pose some risks and should be utilized with caution.

La ultima decada ha supuesto una clara revolucion respecto a la utilizacion de diferentes tecnologias para la aplicacion de tratamientos psicologicos y la promocion de la salud, de manera que se facilite y mejore el aprendizaje de una diversidad de competencias emocionales y conductas saludables en estas poblaciones que estan en continuo proceso de desarrollo y cambio. La orientacion cognitivo-comportamental y los tratamientos psicologicos basados en la evidencia han sido transferidos con exito a las TICs y existen numerosos estudios que lo ponen de manifiesto. El presente articulo aborda una revision de las principales aplicaciones basadas en TICs para el tratamiento de diferentes trastornos psicologicos en la infancia y adolescencia, asi como en otras areas destacadas de la salud en estas edades. Se analizan las implicaciones que esto puede tener y, ademas, se plantean retos futuros para optimizar estos recursos y abrir nuevas lineas de investigacion relevantes para esta tematica. EnglishA review of the applications of the Information and Communication Technologies in Clinical and Health Psychology in childhood and adolescence. The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has meant a radical change in a variety of disciplines, including Clinical and Health Psychology. During childhood and adolescence, interaction with the ICTs is common and regular, and it is also facilitated because they are digital natives who are naturally identified with the technological advances. The last decade has seen a clear revolution regarding the use of different technologies for the application of psychological treatments and the promotion of health, so as to facilitate and improve the learning of a variety of emotional competences and healthy behaviors in those populations that are in a continuous process of development and change. Cognitive-behavioral orientation and evidence-based psychological treatments have been successfully transferred to the ICTs and there are many studies that support this. The present article addresses a review of the main ICT-based devices for the treatment of different psychological disorders during childhood and adolescence, as well as in other important areas of health at these ages. The implications that these devices may have are being analyzed, as well as the possible potential challenges to optimize these resources.

Temporal dynamics of affect.,"A new theory of motivation is described along with its applications to addiction and aversion. The theory assumes that many hedonic, affective, or emotional states are automatically opposed by central nervous system mechanisms which reduce the intensity of hedonic feelings, both pleasant and aversive. The opponent processes for most hedonic states are strengthened by use and are weakened by disuse. These simple assumptions lead to deductions of many known facts about acquired motivation. In addition, the theory suggests several new lines of research on motivation. It argues that the establishment of some types of acquired motivation does not depend on conditioning and is nonassociative in nature. The relationships between conditioning processes and postulated opponent processes are discussed. Finally, it is argued that the data on several types of acquired motivation, arising from either pleasurable or aversive stimulation, can be fruitfully reorganized and understood within the framework provided by the opponent-process model.",1974.0,26.0,1553.0,"{'volume': '81 2', 'pages': '\n          119-45\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Solomon1974AnOT,\n author = {R.

An increased risk for psychosis is observed in people with hearing impairment. According to the social defeat hypothesis, the long-term experience of exclusion leads to enhanced baseline activity and/or sensitization of the dopamine system and puts the individual at increased risk for psychosis.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether young adults with severe hearing impairment (SHI) experience more feelings of social defeat, show greater dopamine release in response to dexamphetamine, and report a stronger subjective reaction to this substance than normal-hearing young adults and to examine whether dopamine release is associated with both self-reported social exclusion and dexamphetamine-induced psychotic experiences.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A sample of 19 participants with SHI and 19 smoking-, age-, and sex-matched healthy controls underwent single-photon emission computed tomography with iodine 123-labeled iodobenzamide as a radiotracer before and after an amphetamine challenge at an academic hospital.


EXPOSURES
Dexamphetamine sulfate (0.3 mg/kg) administered intravenously.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Baseline D2/3 receptor binding and endogenous dopamine release.


RESULTS
The participants with SHI reported experiencing more feelings of social defeat (U=109, z=-2.09, P=.04) and loneliness (U=87.5, z=-2.72, P=<.001) than did healthy controls, but they did not differ from healthy controls with regard to baseline psychotic symptoms (U=156.5, z=-0.70, P=.48). There were no significant group differences in baseline D2/3 receptor binding. However, repeated-measures multivariate analysis of covariance with age (in months) and tobacco smoking (in pack-years) as covariates showed that there was a greater amphetamine-induced striatal dopamine release among the participants with SHI than among the healthy controls (F1,34=4.55, P=.04). After amphetamine administration, the participants with SHI reported more changes in affect than the healthy controls, but not a greater increase in psychotic symptoms. Likewise, reports of social exclusion and an increase in psychotic symptoms were not associated with dopamine release.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
Our study presents preliminary evidence of dopamine sensitization in a socially excluded group of people with hearing impairment. If replicated by future studies in other excluded groups, this finding may have major implications for our understanding of the underlying mechanism and for prevention of psychotic disorders.",2014.0,33.0,52.0,"{'volume': '71 12', 'pages': '\n          1364-72\n        ', 'name': 'JAMA psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gevonden2014IncreasedRO,\n author = {M.

Background Nurses play a vital role in responding to the COVID‐19 outbreak, but many of them suffer from psychological problems due to the excessive workload and stress. Understanding the correlation between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and anxiety and depression will promote targeted psychosocial interventions for these affected nurses. Methods This cross‐sectional study of 586 nurses was conducted in Eastern China. Participants completed online questionnaires that investigated anxiety, depression and cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Results The prevalence of nurses' anxiety and depression was 27.6% and 32.8%, respectively. Lower self‐blame, rumination and catastrophizing, as well as greater acceptance and positive refocusing, were related to fewer symptoms of anxiety or depression. Conclusion The cognitive emotion regulation strategies of acceptance and positive refocusing contribute to reducing anxiety or depression. These strategies should be considered when implementing psychotherapeutic interventions to improve nurses' adverse emotional symptoms. Implications for Nursing Management This study highlights the need to assess cognitive emotion regulation strategies use in screening for anxiety and depression. Nurse managers should develop psychosocial interventions including appropriate strategies to help nurses with adverse emotions during a pandemic.",2021.0,43.0,44.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '1263 - 1274', 'name': 'Journal of Nursing Management'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2021AnxietyDA,\n author = {Qing-qing Wang and Yuan-Yuan Fang and Hao-Lian Huang and Wen-Jun Lv and Xiao-Xiao Wang and Tian-Ting Yang and Jing-Mei Yuan and Ying Gao and Rui-Lian Qian and Yanhong Zhang},\n journal = {Journal of Nursing Management},\n pages = {1263 - 1274},\n title = {Anxiety, depression and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in Chinese nurses during the COVID‐19 outbreak},\n volume = {29},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2109062284', 'name': 'Qing-qing Wang'}, {'authorId': '151260490', 'name': 'Yuan-Yuan Fang'}, {'authorId': '2047154209', 'name': 'Hao-Lian Huang'}, {'authorId': '153022132', 'name': 'Wen-Jun Lv'}, {'authorId': '2108170699', 'name': 'Xiao-Xiao Wang'}, {'authorId': '2034056559', 'name': 'Tian-Ting Yang'}, {'authorId': '114409510', 'name': 'Jing-Mei Yuan'}, {'authorId': '2118545026', 'name': 'Ying Gao'}, {'authorId': '1382195658', 'name': 'Rui-Lian Qian'}, {'authorId': '2108027657', 'name': 'Yanhong Zhang'}]"

Ten boys diagnosed with ADHD and ten normal control boys participated in the study. Groups did not significantly differ in mean age, grade level, ethnicity, or handedness. No participants reported simulator sickness following VR exposure. Children with ADHD exhibited more omission errors, commission errors, and overall body movement than normal control children in the VR classroom. Children with ADHD were more impacted by distraction in the VR classroom. VR classroom measures were correlated with traditional ADHD assessment tools and the flatscreen CPT. Of note, the small sample size incorporated in each group and higher WISC-III scores of normal controls might have some bearing on the overall interpretation of results.

The proposed internalization model of reflective emotion regulation argues that caregivers’ co-regulation of emotionally challenging events plays a constitutive role for the development of 4- to 6-year-olds’ reflective emotion regulation. The model specifies the gradual shift from co- to self-regulation by focusing on two important ways how caregivers structure emotionally challenging interactions: Through emotion talk, caregivers promote the development of preschoolers’ emotional awareness. Once established, they support children in establishing a repertoire of effective emotion regulation strategies and they guide preschoolers’ emerging skills to generate, evaluate, and select from alternative appraisals or behavioral responses.",2016.0,87.0,23.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '17-32', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Silkenbeumer2016TheRO,\n author = {Judith Rebecca Silkenbeumer and Eva-Maria Schiller and Manfred Holodynski and Joscha Kärtner},\n pages = {17-32},\n title = {The role of co-regulation for the development of social-emotional competence},\n volume = {2},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '115964516', 'name': 'Judith Rebecca Silkenbeumer'}, {'authorId': '2052760391', 'name': 'Eva-Maria Schiller'}, {'authorId': '6051757', 'name': 'Manfred Holodynski'}, {'authorId': '4185170', 'name': 'Joscha Kärtner'}]"

We articulate our four levels along with specific design qualities through concrete examples of existing mindfulness apps and through research through design (RtD) work conducted with design fiction examples. We then use a working design case prototype to further illustrate the possibilities of presence-with and presence-in.

Because regions of PFC and the amygdala are known to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, here we test whether PFC and amygdala responses during emotion regulation predict the diurnal pattern of salivary cortisol secretion. We also test whether PFC and amygdala regions are engaged during emotion regulation in older (62- to 64-year-old) rather than younger individuals. We measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging as participants regulated (increased or decreased) their affective responses or attended to negative picture stimuli. We also collected saliva samples for 1 week at home for cortisol assay. Consistent with previous work in younger samples, increasing negative affect resulted in ventral lateral, dorsolateral, and dorsomedial regions of PFC and amygdala activation. In contrast to previous work, decreasing negative affect did not produce the predicted robust pattern of higher PFC and lower amygdala activation. Individuals demonstrating the predicted effect (decrease < attend in the amygdala), however, exhibited higher signal in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) for the same contrast. Furthermore, participants displaying higher VMPFC and lower amygdala signal when decreasing compared with the attention control condition evidenced steeper, more normative declines in cortisol over the course of the day.

1810,9e2f156e3b1c83540ed412e803e2ce414ba914aa,The amygdala: contributions to fear and stress,"Abstract Recent studies have identified major components of the neural system mediating the classical conditioning of defense or fear responses to sensory stimuli. The pathways involve transmission to the amygdala from sensory processing areas in the thalamus and cortex. Within the amygdala, the lateral nucleus receives the sensory inputs and the central nucleus provides the interface with motor systems controlling specific defense responses. Internal connections between the lateral and central nuclei allow the structures involved in receiving inputs and generating outputs to communicate. This circuitry contributes to stress reactions in two important ways. First, by way of these pathways environmental events that are interpreted as threatening activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and thereby initiate so-called stress reactions. Second, nuclear regions of the amygdala contain receptors for adrenal steroids. Steroids released from the adrenal gland as a result of amygdala activity can therefore influence the processing of the environment by the amygdala. Although the amygdala is likely to play a major role in stress responses, relatively little work has been done to elucidate the nature of its role. This is an important topic for future research aimed at understanding how the biological cascade that constitutes the stress response fits into a broader network involved in emotional and cognitive information processing functions. In contrast to other models of stress, fear conditioning allows as to approach this complex problem armed with a clear understanding of major aspects of the circuitry involved in processing stress-inducing stimuli.",1994.0,0.0,100.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '231-237', 'name': 'Seminars in Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{LeDoux1994TheAC,\n author = {Joseph E LeDoux},\n journal = {Seminars in Neuroscience},\n pages = {231-237},\n title = {The amygdala: contributions to fear and stress},\n volume = {6},\n year = {1994}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2332694', 'name': 'Joseph E LeDoux'}]"

So far the effect of touch on human physiology has been studied at an individual level. The present study aims at extending the study of affective touch from isolated individuals to truly interacting dyads. We have designed an ecological paradigm where romantic partners interact only via touch and we manipulate their empathic states. Simultaneously, we collected their autonomic activity (skin conductance, pulse, respiration). Fourteen couples participated to the experiment. We found that interpersonal touch increased coupling of electrodermal activity between the interacting partners, regardless the intensity and valence of the emotion felt. In addition, physical touch induced strong and reliable changes in physiological states within individuals. These results support an instrumental role of interpersonal touch for affective support in close relationships. Furthermore, they suggest that touch alone allows the emergence of a somatovisceral resonance between interacting individuals, which in turn is likely to form the prerequisites for emotional contagion and empathy.",2014.0,56.0,104.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chatel-Goldman2014TouchIA,\n author = {Jonas Chatel-Goldman and M.

Perceived stigma prevents many from reporting their symptoms. Stigma is a particularly pervasive problem among military service members, preventing them from reporting symptoms of combat-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, research shows increased reporting by service members when anonymous assessments are used. For example, service members report more symptoms of PTSD when they anonymously answer the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) symptom checklist compared to the official PDHA, which is identifiable and linked to their military records. To investigate the factors that influence reporting of psychological symptoms by service members, we used a transformative technology: automated virtual humans that interview people about their symptoms. Such virtual human interviewers allow simultaneous use of two techniques for eliciting disclosure that would otherwise be incompatible; they afford anonymity while also building rapport. We examined whether virtual human interviewers could increase disclosure of mental health symptoms among active-duty service members that just returned from a year-long deployment in Afghanistan. Service members reported more symptoms during a conversation with a virtual human interviewer than on the official PDHA. They also reported more to a virtual human interviewer than on an anonymized PDHA. A second, larger sample of active-duty and former service members found a similar effect that approached statistical significance. Because respondents in both studies shared more with virtual human interviewers than an anonymized PDHA -even though both conditions control for stigma and ramifications for service members’ military records- virtual human interviewers that build rapport may provide a superior option to encourage reporting.",2017.0,70.0,163.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '51', 'name': 'Frontiers Robotics AI'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lucas2017ReportingMH,\n author = {Gale M.

Spaces can affect both the acoustic properties of the sound event itself and may also impose boundaries to the actions one can take with respect to this event. Virtual acoustic rooms of different sizes were used in a subjective and psychophysiological experiment that evaluated the influence of the auditory space perception on emotional responses to various sound sources. Participants (N = 20) were exposed to acoustic spaces with sound source positions and room acoustic properties varying across the experimental conditions. The results suggest that, overall, small rooms were considered more pleasant, calmer, and safer than big rooms, although this effect of size seems to disappear when listening to threatening sound sources. Sounds heard behind the listeners tended to be more arousing, and elicited larger physiological changes than sources in front of the listeners. These effects were more pronounced for natural, compared to artificial, sound sources, as confirmed by subjective and physiological measures.",2010.0,36.0,62.0,"{'volume': '10 3', 'pages': '\n          416-22\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tajadura-Jiménez2010WhenRS,\n author = {A.

Node identity authentication is an important means to ensure its security. Traditional IoT identity authentication protocols usually rely on trusted third parties. However, many IoT environments do not allow such conditions, and are prone to single point failure. Blockchain technology with decentralization features provides a new solution for distributed IoT system. In this paper, a blockchain based multi-WSN authentication scheme for IoT is proposed. The nodes of IoT are divided into base stations, cluster head nodes and ordinary nodes according to their capability differences, which are formed to a hierarchical network. A blockchain network is constructed among different types of nodes to form a hybrid blockchain model, including local chain and public chain. In this hybrid model, nodes identity mutual authentication in various communication scenarios is realized, ordinary node identity authentication operation is accomplished by local blockchain, and cluster head node identity authentication are realized in public blockchain. The analysis of security and performance shows that the scheme has comprehensive security and better performance.",2020.0,47.0,314.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '241-251', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Services Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cui2020AHB,\n author = {Z.

In this study, the authors examined how observed pupillary size modulates processing of facial expression, extending the finding that incidentally perceived pupils influence ratings of sadness but not those of happy, angry, or neutral facial expressions. Healthy subjects rated the valence and arousal of photographs depicting facial muscular expressions of sadness, surprise, fear, and disgust. Pupil sizes within the stimuli were experimentally manipulated. Subjects themselves were scored with an empathy questionnaire. Diminishing pupil size linearly enhanced intensity and valence judgments of sad expressions (but not fear, surprise, or disgust). At debriefing, subjects were unaware of differences in pupil size across stimuli. These observations complement an earlier study showing that pupil size directly influences processing of sadness but not other basic emotional facial expressions. Furthermore, across subjects, the degree to which pupil size influenced sadness processing correlated with individual differences in empathy score. Together, these data demonstrate a central role of sadness processing in empathetic emotion and highlight the salience of implicit autonomic signals in affective communication.",2007.0,37.0,83.0,"{'volume': '7 4', 'pages': '\n          724-9\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Harrison2007ProcessingOO,\n author = {Neil A Harrison and C.

Compared with state-of-the-art work by Zhang on music video affective analysis, our main contributions are in the following aspects: (1) Another 3 affect-related features are extracted to enrich the feature set and exploit their correlation with arousal and valence. (2) All extracted features are ordered via feature importance analysis, and then optimal feature subset is selected after ordering. (3) Different regression methods are compared for arousal and valence modeling in order to find the fittest estimation function. Our method achieves 33.39% and 42.17% deduction in terms of mean absolute error compared with Zhang's method. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed method has a considerable improvement on music video affective understanding.",2010.0,23.0,18.0,{'pages': '213-219'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cui2010MusicVA,\n author = {Yue Cui and Jesse S.

F r Hawkins therefore deserves our thanks in a special w a y ; such work as this is necessary and its effects, though slow, are sure. There are a number of excellences about the book. I t reveals a wide knowledge of contem­ porary English thought on the subject ; an index would have shown many references to Mind, to the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society and to works of modern logic (the well-arranged table of contents gives some idea of the book's scope in this respect). Recent attempts to eliminate the notion of causality are very carefully repulsed. The writing is almost invariably attractive, and there are no slips or misprints obscuring the argument, which must be something like a record for Catholic philosophical books in recent years. These last virtues unfortunately are not shared by the only review (to the writer's present knowledge) which has had anything in particular to say about F r Hawkins's book, that in the Tablet (October 23rd, 1937).

Through a 3-week controlled deployment, we examine how voice-based and chat-based interaction affect workers' reflection and support self-learning. We demonstrate that, while many current technical limitations exist, adding dedicated mobile voice interaction separate from the already busy chat modality may further enable users to step back and reflect on their work.

However, therapeutic strategies that successfully target cognitive impairments are lacking. Recent work has demonstrated that playing action video games leads to improvements in cognition, in particular executive function, in healthy individuals. We therefore set out to test whether playing video games can reduce symptoms associated with depression. We focussed on depressive symptoms and on rumination, since rumination is a good predictor of depression and may contribute to triggering depression. We recruited 68 clinically depressed individuals (mean age: 46 years, 47 females) that were randomized into the training group playing a fast paced action video game for 6 weeks or a waitlist control group. Before and after training participants completed online questionnaires and a neuropsychological test battery. Only participants who actually played the game were included in the analysis. The final sample consisted of n = 21 training group and n = 29 waitlist control group. The training group showed significantly higher subjective cognitive ability, as well as lower self-reported rumination at posttest in contrast to the control group (although these findings do not survive Bonferroni correction). On a subsample with cognitive performance data (n = 19) we detected an improvement in executive function (Trail Making Task A and B) in the training compared with the control group. The results show that the fast paced action video game employed in the present study improved Trail Making performance and may reduce rumination and enhance subjective cognitive ability.

Although, significant differences have been revealed for spatiotemporal perception between IVEs and the physical world such as distance underestimation, there is still a scarcity of knowledge about the reasons for such perceptual discrepancies, in particular regarding the perception of temporal durations in IVEs. In this article, we explore the effects of manipulated zeitgebers, cognitive load and immersion on time estimation as yet unexplored factors of spatiotemporal perception in IVEs. We present an experiment in which we analyze human sensitivity to temporal durations while experiencing an immersive head-mounted display (HMO) environment. We found that manipulations of external zeitgebers caused by a natural or unnatural movement of the virtual sun had a significant effect on time judgments. Moreover, using the dual-task paradigm the results show that increased spatial and verbal cognitive load resulted in a significant shortening of judged time as well as an interaction with the external zeitgebers. Finally, we discuss the implications for the design of near-natural computer-generated virtual worlds.",2016.0,47.0,41.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '1387-1395', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schatzschneider2016WhoTT,\n author = {Christian Schatzschneider and G.

In a two-week long in-the-wild study with 30 participants we captured 502,851 instances of smartphone application use in tandem with corresponding emotional data from facial expressions. Our analysis shows that while in most cases application use drives user emotions, multiple application categories exist for which the causal effect is in the opposite direction.

Many different theories of emotion have emerged since then, but it has been demonstrated that a specifically induced physiological state can influence an individual's emotional responses to stimuli. In the present study, auditory and/or vibrotactile heartbeat stimuli were presented to participants (N = 24), and the stimuli's effect on participants' physiological state and subsequent emotional attitude to affective pictures was measured. In particular, we aimed to investigate the effect of the perceived distance to stimuli on emotional experience. Distant versus close sound reproduction conditions (loudspeakers vs. headphones) were used to identify whether an ""embodied"" experience can occur in which participants would associate the external heartbeat sound with their own. Vibrotactile stimulation of an experimental chair and footrest was added to magnify the experience. Participants' peripheral heartbeat signals, self-reported valence (pleasantness) and arousal (activation) ratings for the pictures, and memory performance scores were collected. Heartbeat sounds significantly affected participants' heartbeat, the emotional judgments of pictures, and their recall. The effect of distance to stimuli was observed in the significant interaction between the spatial location of the heartbeat sound and the vibrotactile stimulation, which was mainly caused by the auditory-vibrotactile interaction in the loudspeakers condition. This interaction might suggest that vibrations transform the far sound condition (sound via loudspeakers) in a close-stimulation condition and support the hypothesis that close sounds are more affective than distant ones. These findings have implications for the design and evaluation of mediated environments.",2008.0,30.0,25.0,"{'volume': '11 1', 'pages': '\n          33-8\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tajadura-Jiménez2008SelfRepresentationIM,\n author = {A.

The design was a case study, 12 weeks intervention, with no follow-up. The setting was a university research laboratory. The participants were a referred sample of three children with cerebral palsy, age 7-12, all male. All completed the intervention. Participants trained on the Rutgers Ankle CP system for 36 rehabilitation sessions (12 weeks, three times/week), playing two custom virtual reality games. The games were played while participants were seated, and trained one ankle at-a-time for strength, motor control, and coordination. The primary study outcome measures were for impairment (DF/PF torques, DF initial contact angle and gait speed), function (GMFM), and quality of life (Peds QL). Secondary outcome measures relate to game performance (game scores as reflective of ankle motor control and endurance). Gait function improved substantially in ankle kinematics, speed and endurance. Overall function (GMFM) indicated improvements that were typical of other ankle strength training programs. Quality of life increased beyond what would be considered a minimal clinical important difference. Game performance improved in both games during the intervention. This feasibility study supports the assumption that game-based robotic training of the ankle benefits gait in children with CP. Game technology is appropriate for the age group and was well accepted by the participants. Additional studies are needed however, to quantify the level of benefit and compare the approach presented here to traditional methods of therapy.",2013.0,39.0,110.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '165-173', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Burdea2013RoboticsAG,\n author = {G.

Social adversity is a risk factor for psychosis, but the translating mechanisms are not well understood. This study tests whether the relationship between social adversity and psychosis is mediated by cognitive vulnerability in the form of low perceived social rank, negative schemas related to self and other, and loneliness and whether the putative mediations are specific to psychosis or are largely explained by depression.


Methods
The study was a survey in a community sample (N = 2350) from Germany (n = 786), Indonesia (n = 844), and the United States (n = 720). Mediation path analysis with structural equation modeling was used to test for the specificity of the hypothesized paths to psychosis controlling for depression.


Results
Social adversity had a significant medium to large effect on positive (R2 = .20) and negative symptoms (R2 = .38). Social rank, negative schemas, and loneliness significantly mediated the relationship between social adversity and negative symptoms and the models explained a large amount of the variance (R2 = .43-.44). For positive symptoms, only negative schemas were a significant mediator (R2 = .27).


Discussion
The results emphasize the role of social adversity in psychosis and support the assumption that cognitive vulnerability is a relevant translating mechanism as postulated by the social defeat hypothesis and cognitive models of psychosis. This underlines the relevance of the clinical practice of targeting beliefs in cognitive interventions for psychosis. It also indicates that targeting cognitive vulnerability in people experiencing social adversity could be a promising approach to prevention.",2016.0,77.0,58.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '557–565', 'name': 'Schizophrenia Bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jaya2016SocialAA,\n author = {E.

Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using a hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers. Through a thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility.",2018.0,68.0,30.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Ali2018AVC,\n author = {M.

This study used eye tracking to investigate the role of cognitive control in older adults' selective visual attention. Younger and older adults viewed emotional-neutral and emotional-emotional pairs of faces and pictures while their gaze patterns were recorded under full or divided attention conditions. Replicating previous eye-tracking findings, older adults allocated less of their visual attention to negative stimuli in negative-neutral stimulus pairings in the full attention condition than younger adults did. However, as predicted by a cognitive-control-based account of the positivity effect in older adults' information processing tendencies (Mather & Knight, 2005), older adults' tendency to avoid negative stimuli was reversed in the divided attention condition. Compared with younger adults, older adults' limited attentional resources were more likely to be drawn to negative stimuli when they were distracted.

In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem.

While researchers generally agree that it is necessary to examine outlier and influential case diagnostics when conducting a meta‐analysis, limited studies have addressed how to obtain such diagnostic measures in the context of a meta‐analysis. The present paper extends standard diagnostic procedures developed for linear regression analyses to the meta‐analytic fixed‐ and random/mixed‐effects models. Three examples are used to illustrate the usefulness of these procedures in various research settings. Issues related to these diagnostic procedures in meta‐analysis are also discussed.

Although stress-related reactions could sometimes provoke impairments in physiological processes due to the frequency of exposure or the stress burden of the event, physiological recovery after coping with stressors is highly implied in the aversive consequences of stress. To analyze the effects of listening to relaxing music (generated by the Melomics computer system) on the cardiovascular recovery and subjective feelings of anxiety after undergoing an acute-stress episode, a double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in healthy adults (N = 24; M = 23.05 years, SD = 2.97). Participants reported their levels of psychiatric symptomatology and anxiety and were then exposed to a stress induction protocol. Afterward, they underwent a period of recovery where they would be exposed to either a relaxing music track or silence, depending on a random assignation. Heart-derived functioning and self-reported anxiety were monitored throughout the study stages. All the participants showed stress-related reactions throughout the study stages, as it was shown for the study outcomes. Regarding the effect of listening to music, participants who listened to relaxing music during the recovery stage showed higher levels of sample entropy than controls, highlighting a large effect size on this difference (η2partial = .59). Relaxing music promotes more adaptive emotional regulation after coping with an acutely stressful event. This study aims to shed light on the actual effects of music interventions, and encourage the use of music-based interventions on health services.",2017.0,76.0,30.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '124 - 141', 'name': 'Nordic Journal of Music Therapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Torre-Luque2017AcuteSR,\n author = {A. de la Torre-Luque and R.

While it is straightforward for humans to recognize and acknowledge others’ feelings in a conversation, this is a significant challenge for AI systems due to the paucity of suitable publicly-available datasets for training and evaluation. This work proposes a new benchmark for empathetic dialogue generation and EmpatheticDialogues, a novel dataset of 25k conversations grounded in emotional situations. Our experiments indicate that dialogue models that use our dataset are perceived to be more empathetic by human evaluators, compared to models merely trained on large-scale Internet conversation data.

Recent studies showing that members of literate cultures associated the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors could not demonstrate that at least some facial expressions of emotion are universal; the cultures compared had all been exposed to some of the same mass media presentations of facial expression, and these may have taught the people in each culture to recognize the unique facial expressions of other cultures. To show that members of a preliterate culture who had minimal exposure to literate cultures would associate the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors as do members of Western and Eastern literate cultures, data were gathered in New Guinea by telling subjects a story, showing them a set of three faces, and asking them to select the face which showed the emotion appropriate to the story.

One trend in this vein is systems that support calm breathing habits. We designed and evaluated techniques to support respiratory regulation to reduce stress and increase parasympathetic tone. Our study revealed that auditory guidance was more effective than visual at creating self-reported calm. We attribute this to the users' ability to effectively map sound to respiration, thereby reducing cognitive load and mental exertion. Interestingly, we found that visual guidance led to more respiratory change but less subjective calm. Thus, motivating users to exert physical or mental efforts may counter the calming effects of slow breathing. Designers of calming technologies must acknowledge the discrepancy between mechanical slow breathing and experiential calm in designing future systems.",2012.0,7.0,29.0,{'pages': '69-70'},"{'bibtex': ""@Inproceedings{Wongsuphasawat2012YouCF,\n author = {Kanit Wongsuphasawat and Alexander V.

Group-based interventions seem to achieve higher participation in the long-term. However, there are many factors that can make of group exercises a challenging setting for older adults. A major one, due to the heterogeneity of this particular population, is the difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a technology-based intervention that enable online group exercises in older adults with different levels of skills. Methods A total of 37 older adults between 65 and 87 years old followed a personalized exercise program based on the OTAGO program for fall prevention, for a period of eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a tablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to the Control group, representing the traditional individual home-based training program, or the Social group, representing the online group exercising. Pre- and post- measurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes. Results After the eight-weeks training program there were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in terms of physical outcomes, given the high level of adherence of both groups. Considering the baseline measures, however, the results suggest that while in the Control group fitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case for the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For psychological outcomes there were improvements on both groups, regardless of the application used. There was no significant difference between groups in social wellbeing outcomes, both groups seeing a decrease in loneliness despite the presence of social features in the Social group. However, online social interactions have shown to be correlated to the decrease in loneliness in the Social group. Conclusion The results indicate that technology-supported online group-exercising which conceals individual differences in physical skills is effective in motivating and enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter individuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together despite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise might reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context. However, results from this pilot are limited to a small sample size and therefore are not conclusive. Longer term interventions with more participants are instead recommended to assess impacts on wellbeing and behavior change.",2017.0,90.0,45.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'PeerJ'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Báez2017EffectsOO,\n author = {Marcos Báez and I.

Expectation-confirmation theory is adapted from the consumer behavior literature and integrated with theoretical and empirical findings from prior IS usage research to theorize a model of IS continuance. Five research hypotheses derived from this model are empirically validated using a field survey of online banking users. The results suggest that users' continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with IS use and perceived usefulness of continued IS use. User satisfaction, in turn, is influenced by their confirmation of expectation from prior IS use and perceived usefulness. Post-acceptance perceived usefulness is influenced by users' confirmation level. This study draws attention to the substantive differences between acceptance and continuance behaviors, theorizes and validates one of the earliest theoretical models of IS continuance, integrates confirmation and user satisfaction constructs within our current understanding of IS use, conceptualizes and creates an initial scale for measuring IS continuance, and offers an initial explanation for the acceptance-discontinuance anomaly.",2001.0,58.0,6410.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '351-370', 'name': 'MIS Q.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bhattacherjee2001UnderstandingIS,\n author = {Anol Bhattacherjee},\n journal = {MIS Q.},\n pages = {351-370},\n title = {Understanding Information Systems Continuance: An Expectation-Confirmation Model},\n volume = {25},\n year = {2001}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1772304', 'name': 'Anol Bhattacherjee'}]"

This dependence model asserts that the primary issue in understanding breakup decisions is degree of dependence on a relationship. Dependence is great when important outcomes in the current relationship are not available elsewhere. Need satisfaction dependence measures identify important needs in a relationship and compare satisfaction of those needs in the current relationship to satisfaction in alternative relationships. Two longitudinal studies provide good support for the dependence model. Need satisfaction dependence measures significantly differentiated between subjects who remained in their relationships and those who voluntarily broke up. The studies also compared the model to simpler breakup models and assessed whether commitment mediates the link between dependence and breakup decisions. Why do individuals sometimes remain in relationships that are not terribly satisfying? This article advances a dependence model of breakups. The dependence model clarifies and extends concepts from interdependence theory (Kelley & Thibaut, 1978; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959), proposing that the decision to remain in or voluntarily end a given relationship is strongly related to the degree of dependence on that relationship. Dependence is asserted to be great when the most important needs a relationship fulfills cannot be gratified elsewhere. Thus, we suggest that an individual may sometimes remain in a relationship that is not terribly satisfying because of high dependence on that relationship—dissatisfying as it is, the relationship may nevertheless fulfill important needs that cannot be gratified in alternative relationships. From the outset, it is important to distinguish between the concepts of satisfaction and dependence. These constructs were first introduced in Thibaut and Kelley's (1959) interdependence theory, in their discussion of two subjective criteria for Editors Note.

Filling this gap is one of the main aims of the Games and Learning Alliance (http://www.galanoe.eu) European Network of Excellence on Serious Games, which has a focus upon pedagogy-driven SGs. This paper relies on the assumption that the fundamental aspect of SG design consists in the translation of learning goals/practices into mechanical element of gameplay, serving to an instructional purpose beside that of play and fun. This paper proposes the Learning Mechanics–Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, which supports SG analysis and design by allowing reflection on the various pedagogical and game elements in an SG. The LM-GM model includes a set of pre-defined game mechanics and pedagogical elements that we have abstracted from literature on game studies and learning theories. 
 
Designers and analysts can exploit these mechanics to draw the LM-GM map for a game, so as to identify and highlight its main pedagogical and entertainment features, and their interrelations. The tool may also be useful for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of a given game and better understand how to implement it in educational settings. A case study is reported to illustrate the framework's support in determining how gameplay and pedagogy intertwine in an SG.

There are various side effects associated with drugs and not everyone has access to therapy, whether due to cost or availability. Self-administrable therapies allow for greater ease of access and as such, a novel virtual reality based self-attachment therapy is currently being developed. One of its main goals is for the user to develop a bond and reparent a child avatar representing one’s childhood self. To do so efficiently, the emotions, felt by the user when discussing their childhood, should be transferred to this child avatar. This project aims to train an emotion recognition model to allow the detection of multiple emotions. In addition, it aims to implement the self-attachment theory scenario to manage the dialogue between a user and a virtual therapist. The two parts of the project are to be integrated within the proposed virtual reality application. The devised multimodal and multi-emotion recognition model trained on CMUMOSEI dataset, achieves state-of-the-art results on happiness detection and competitive results for other emotions.

We propose that a major next step in the effort to promote healthy emotional development is to improve the field's understanding of the most proximal contributor to parent ESBs: parents' own experience and regulation of emotions in the context of caregiving. As an initial step, this paper integrates Eisenberg and colleagues' model of emotion socialization with theoretical and empirical work on parental emotion. We review the literature on the emotionally evocative nature of parenting, which influences parental ESBs, including parents' expressions of emotions and their responses to children's emotions. However, whereas parental emotions influence behavior, they do not necessarily determine it; parents may regulate their emotions to engage in optimal ESBs. Thus, parental regulation contributes to emotion socialization not only by modeling emotion regulation strategies for children, but also by influencing the quality of parents' ESBs. From a clinical perspective, parental emotion regulation is of utmost importance due to the degree of parental involvement in interventions for childhood emotional and behavioral disorders, which are often aimed at promoting child self-regulation. To illustrate practical applications of Eisenberg's model, we discuss evidence-based practices that include enhancement of parent emotion regulation as a primary target, with the ultimate goal of promoting child emotional development. Ultimately, we aim to spur future theoretical, empirical, and translational work in this area.

In particular, the notion of intention developed here has equal status with the notions of belief and desire, and cannot be reduced to these concepts. This allows di(cid:11)erent types of rational agents to be modeled by imposing certain conditions on the persistence of an agent’s beliefs, goals, and intentions.

In similar circumstances, younger people would use digital technologies to stay occupied and connected, but few elderly citizens have this capability. Our research investigates the ways that the social wellbeing of elderly citizens, wherever they reside, can be enhanced by their use of information and communications technologies (ICT), particularly digital technologies. A 2-year action research study of the social use of ICT by residents in aged-care facilities was conducted in order to determine how developing digital capabilities could enhance their wellbeing. Research interventions included the establishment of computer kiosks in aged-care facilities and weekly classes for developing ICT skills. As their digital capability improved, many of the elderly residents were observed to engage in meaningful computer-based activities of their own choosing. A set of themes among these activities was identified: connection, self-worth/esteem and personal development, productivity, occupation, self-sufficiency, being in control, and enjoyment. Our results are consistent with recently reported domains of social wellbeing among recipients of community-based aged-care services: (a) social participation and involvement, (b) occupation, (c) control over daily life and (d) dignity.",2016.0,27.0,50.0,"{'volume': '42', 'pages': '749 - 757', 'name': 'Educational Gerontology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hasan2016EnhancingTW,\n author = {H.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of self-reflective practice on cognitive emotion regulation and resilience of mothers of preterm infants in the NICU. 
Methods & Materials: A total of 90 mothers whose preterm infants were admitted to NICU enrolled in the current non-randomized clinical trial study by convenience sampling (n=45 in each group). The data of the control group were gathered prior to the intervention group. Pre- and post-test data were gathered using the demographic questionnaire, the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the Conner and Davidson Resilience Scale. Self–reflection practice was designed and conducted based on Gibbs' reflective cycle for the intervention group, which applied a blended model (face-to-face and virtual). Statistical analysis was conducted by SPSS-25 and using the repeated measure ANOVA. 
Results: Using ANCOVA, the results indicated that the self-reflection practice was effective in improving cognitive emotion regulation (F=66.01, P≤0.001, Eta=0.60) and resilience (F=89.43, P≤0.001, Eta= 0.67) among mothers in the intervention group.  
Conclusion: Self-reflection practice was an effective intervention for improving mothers’ skills, helping them be more resilient, and assisting them in regulating their emotions.

Consequently, almost no research has investigated the potential importance of subconscious (automatic) behaviors, also known as habits. This study represents a first step toward validating the idea that one can add explanatory power to a behavioral model such as Ajzen’s [1985] theory of planned behavior (TPB) by including the habit construct. We conducted a two-stage questionnaire-based survey involving two different groups of students who had access to a sophisticated internet-based communication tool (IBCT). These data were used to test a behavioral model integrating theoretical constructs of TPB and a relevant subset of Triandis’ [1980] behavioral framework. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both conscious (intentions) and subconscious (habits) factors in explaining usage behavior.

However, the extent to which gross asymmetries in the fake body can be assimilated remains unknown. Participants experienced, through a head-tracked stereo head-mounted display a virtual body coincident with their real body. There were 5 conditions in a between-groups experiment, with 10 participants per condition. In all conditions there was visuo-motor congruence between the real and virtual dominant arm. In an Incongruent condition (I), where the virtual arm length was equal to the real length, there was visuo-tactile incongruence. In four Congruent conditions there was visuo-tactile congruence, but the virtual arm lengths were either equal to (C1), double (C2), triple (C3) or quadruple (C4) the real ones. Questionnaire scores and defensive withdrawal movements in response to a threat showed that the overall level of ownership was high in both C1 and I, and there was no significant difference between these conditions. Additionally, participants experienced ownership over the virtual arm up to three times the length of the real one, and less strongly at four times the length. The illusion did decline, however, with the length of the virtual arm. In the C2–C4 conditions although a measure of proprioceptive drift positively correlated with virtual arm length, there was no correlation between the drift and ownership of the virtual arm, suggesting different underlying mechanisms between ownership and drift. Overall, these findings extend and enrich previous results that multisensory and sensorimotor information can reconstruct our perception of the body shape, size and symmetry even when this is not consistent with normal body proportions.",2012.0,49.0,370.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kilteni2012ExtendingBS,\n author = {Konstantina Kilteni and Jean-Marie Normand and Maria V.

Objective The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of The Adventures of DoReMiFa, an integration model of the cognitive-behavioral approach and positive psychology by using digital game–based and school-based mental health enhancement intervention to magnify the social and emotional health and well-being of the school children in Hong Kong aged 9 to 11 years. Methods A quasi-experimental design method was used to evaluate this digital game and school-based intervention. The Adventures of DoReMiFa was piloted in 4 primary schools where students were allocated to either an intervention or a control group. The participants were assessed at pre- and postintervention with a 6-month follow-up measuring their mental health knowledge, levels of anxiety symptoms, positive and negative thinking, perspective-taking, and self-esteem. Results A total of 459 primary school students from 4 primary schools participated in the study. The response rate on the questionnaires answered on the Web was up to 85.1% (391/459). Compared with the control group, the intervention group was found to have significant association with improved mental health knowledge at the time immediately after the intervention (beta=.46; P=.01) and in the 6-month postintervention period (beta=.66; P<.001); for perspective-taking, the intervention group had exhibited a significant improvement 6 months after the completion of the universal program (beta=1.50; P=.03). The intervention, however, was found not to be effective in reducing the rates of anxiety symptoms and negative thinking among the participating students. Conclusions The Adventures of DoReMiFa, an integration of a digital game–based and school-based mental health enhancement intervention, was shown to be effective in elevating the knowledge of mental health and promoting perspective-taking in the primary school students of Hong Kong. Although there was insufficient evidence to support a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and negative automatic thoughts, the overall results were still encouraging in that a preventive effect was found, indicating that the program has the potential to enhance the mental well-being of schoolchildren.

We will argue that, to attain a deeper and more engaging control, in certain conditions, users should be able to inspect, disclose, and modify the characters minds. To illustrate this idea, we will present a collaborative virtual environment called {\it Teatrix}, designed for children to build their own stories - fairy tales. In {\it Teatrix}, virtual actors play roles (such as: villain, hero, etc.) and may be controlled either by children or by the system. {\it Teatrix} allows children to go into the minds of the characters through a special tool named {\it “Hot Seating”}. {\it Teatrix} is already in use by children ages between 7 and 9 in the context of a Computer integrated Classroom (CiC) scenario installed in a school.

The amalgamation of computer graphics and artificial intelligence has lead to the possibility of creating believable virtual personalities. The focus has shifted from modeling and animation towards imparting personalities to virtual humans. The aim is to create virtual humans that can interact spontaneously using a natural language, emotions and gestures. This paper discusses a system that allows the design of personality for emotional virtual human. We adopt the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality from psychology studies. To realize the model, we use Bayesian Belief Network. We introduce a layered approach for modeling personality, moods and emotions. In order to demonstrate a virtual human with emotional personality, we integrate the system into a chat application.

Yet there exists a dearth of information on mental health issues concerning Filipino Americans, who represent a diverse mixture of culture, beliefs, and practices and vary widely from other minorities as well as from the larger population. This group has experienced emotional and behavioral challenges in acclimatizing to Western culture. Their historical underpinnings, native core values, and traditions exert a crucial influence on their mental well-being. Filipino Americans underutilize existing mental health care services that are culturally, socially, and linguistically incompatible with their needs. Along with stigma, the adherence of traditional practices and healing methods remains a formidable barrier to the appropriate provision of care.

A randomized controlled trial (n = 138) was conducted to test the effectiveness of a biofeedback video game (Dojo) for adolescents with elevated levels of anxiety. Adolescents (11–15 years old) were randomly assigned to play Dojo or a control game (Rayman 2: The Great Escape). Initial screening for anxiety was done on 1,347 adolescents in five high schools; only adolescents who scored above the “at-risk” cut-off on the Spence Children Anxiety Survey were eligible. Adolescents’ anxiety levels were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and at three month follow-up to examine the extent to which playing Dojo decreased adolescents’ anxiety. The present study revealed equal improvements in anxiety symptoms in both conditions at follow-up and no differences between Dojo and the closely matched control game condition. Latent growth curve models did reveal a steeper decrease of personalized anxiety symptoms (not of total anxiety symptoms) in the Dojo condition compared to the control condition. Moderation analyses did not show any differences in outcomes between boys and girls nor did age differentiate outcomes. The present results are of importance for prevention science, as this was the first full-scale randomized controlled trial testing indicated prevention effects of a video game aimed at reducing anxiety. Future research should carefully consider the choice of control condition and outcome measurements, address the potentially high impact of participants’ expectations, and take critical design issues into consideration, such as individual- versus group-based intervention and contamination issues.",2016.0,93.0,82.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Scholten2016ARC,\n author = {H.

AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system that helps students compose explanations of difficult concepts in Newtonian physics and enhances computer literacy and critical thinking by interacting with them in natural language with adaptive dialog moves similar to those of human tutors. AutoTutor constructs a cognitive model of students' knowledge levels by analyzing the text of their typed or spoken responses to its questions. The model is used to dynamically tailor the interaction toward individual students' zones of proximal development. Affective AutoTutor takes the individualized instruction and human-like interactivity to a new level by automatically detecting and responding to students' emotional states in addition to their cognitive states. Over 20 controlled experiments comparing AutoTutor with ecological and experimental controls such reading a textbook have consistently yielded learning improvements of approximately one letter grade after brief 30--60-minute interactions. Furthermore, Affective AutoTutor shows even more dramatic improvements in learning than the original AutoTutor system, particularly for struggling students with low domain knowledge. In addition to providing a detailed description of the implementation and evaluation of AutoTutor and Affective AutoTutor, we also discuss new and exciting technologies motivated by AutoTutor such as AutoTutor-Lite, Operation ARIES, GuruTutor, DeepTutor, MetaTutor, and AutoMentor.

EEG data that were recorded on smartphone in both outdoors and indoors conditions were used for evaluation (N = 27). A direct comparison between the original ASR and Riemannian ASR (rASR) was conducted for three performance measures: reduction of eye-blinks (sensitivity), improvement of visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) (specificity), and computation time (efficiency).

A Norwegian research network, however, recognizes the importance of involving service users as coresearchers and initiated a training program in research methodology and design intended to empower them as active participants in research projects. In this article, we explore how these coresearchers with a mental health service user background experience their participation in projects as well as in attending the training: What is it like being a service user coresearcher in collaborative studies on issues in mental health? How do coresearchers negotiate their roles and mandate? Method: We used focus groups as our data collection method, transcribed the group discussions verbatim, and analyzed the transcriptions using qualitative methodology. We then took the preliminary analyses back to the participants for discussion, auditing, and reanalysis. Results: We identified themes that represent important social processes around which the participants developed a consensual understanding: self-definition, constructive differentiation and negotiations. Conclusion: Our findings generate hypotheses on how participatory research into mental health issues can be fruitfully organized, in a way that empowers service users to active and constructive participation. Implications for Rehabilitation Participatory research on issues in mental health holds potential for empowering service users. Collaborating with service users in research puts weight on the lived experiences of mental distress and on the expertise of the first person perspective. Organizing a formal training and peer group context in this kind of research can contribute to the service user coresearchers process of defining their own mandate in the research process as well as to help them constructively differentiate themselves from the roles of other researchers.",2012.0,33.0,605.0,"{'volume': '34', 'pages': '1608 - 1616', 'name': 'Disability and Rehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Moltu2012NegotiatingTC,\n author = {C.

Precisely, the results showed a decrease of walking speed as well as an increase of the clearance distance (i. e., the minimal distance between the walker and the obstacle) when facing virtual obstacles compared to real ones.

Two types of collaborative telelearning environments are considered. One involves local groups (i.e., students on the same campus), and the other involves non-proximate distant groups (i.e., students on two separate campuses). The collaborative telelearning environments are compared to each other and to a traditional face-to-face collaborative learning environment.The study found that the three environments are equally effective in terms of student knowledge acquisition; however, higher critical-thinking skills were found in the distant DVC environment. The subjects in the three learning environments were equally satisfied with their learning process and outcomes. At the conclusion of the longitudinal assessment, the distant students using DVC were more committed and attracted to their groups compared to local students who worked face-to-face or through DVC.",1995.0,26.0,489.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '293-312', 'name': 'MIS Q.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Alavi1995UsingIT,\n author = {M.

It, e.g., affects people's interpersonal distance and is thus largely involved when navigating through social environments. However, the PS is regulated dynamically, its size depends on numerous social and personal characteristics and its violation evokes different levels of discomfort and physiological arousal. Thus, gaining more insight into this phenomenon is important. We contribute to the PS investigations by presenting the results of a controlled experiment in a CAVE, focusing on German males in the age of 18 to 30 years. The PS preferences of 27 participants have been sampled while they were approached by either a single embodied, computer-controlled virtual agent (VA) or by a group of three VAs. In order to investigate the influence of a VA's emotions, we altered their facial expression between angry and happy. Our results indicate that the emotion as well as the number of VAs approaching influence the PS: larger distances are chosen to angry VAs compared to happy ones; single VAs are allowed closer compared to the group. Thus, our study is a foundation for social and behavioral studies investigating PS preferences.",2018.0,48.0,50.0,"{'pages': '199-206', 'name': '2018 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Bönsch2018SocialVH,\n author = {A.

A major challenge confronting behavioral scientists aiming to develop a JITAI concerns the selection and integration of existing empirical, theoretical and practical evidence into a scientific model that can inform the construction of a JITAI and help identify scientific gaps. The purpose of this paper is to establish a pragmatic framework that can be used to organize existing evidence into a useful model for JITAI construction. This framework involves clarifying the conceptual purpose of a JITAI, namely, the provision of just-in-time support via adaptation, as well as describing the components of a JITAI and articulating a list of concrete questions to guide the establishment of a useful model for JITAI construction. The proposed framework includes an organizing scheme for translating the relatively static scientific models underlying many health behavior interventions into a more dynamic model that better incorporates the element of time. This framework will help to guide the next generation of empirical work to support the creation of effective JITAIs.",2015.0,80.0,399.0,"{'volume': '34S', 'pages': '\n          1209-19\n        ', 'name': 'Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nahum-Shani2015BuildingHB,\n author = {I.

This gross mismatch can be alleviated by improving farmers' access to information and expert advice (e.g., knowing which seeds to sow and how to treat pests can significantly impact yield). In this paper, we report our experience of designing a conversational agent, called FarmChat, to meet the information needs of farmers in rural India. We conducted an evaluative study with 34 farmers near Ranchi in India, focusing on assessing the usability of the system, acceptability of the information provided, and understanding the user population's unique preferences, needs, and challenges in using the technology. We performed a comparative study with two different modalities: audio-only and audio+text. Our results provide a detailed understanding on how literacy level, digital literacy, and other factors impact users' preferences for the interaction modality. We found that a conversational agent has the potential to effectively meet the information needs of farmers at scale.

It still remains unclear, however, how different prefrontal regions interact to control and regulate emotional responses. We used fMRI and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to characterize the functional interrelationships among dorsal and ventral PFC regions involved in reappraisal. Specifically, we examined the effective connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and other reappraisal-related regions (supplementary motor area, supramarginal gyrus) during the up- and downregulation of emotions in response to highly arousing extreme sports film clips. We found DLPFC to be the central node of the prefrontal emotion regulation network, strongly interconnected with the IFG. The DCM analysis further revealed excitatory changes of connection strength from the DLPFC to the IFG and strong inhibitory changes of connection strength between the IFG and DLPFC during reappraisal. These bidirectional changes in connectivity strength indicate a feedback mechanism by which the IFG may select one out of several possible goal-appropriate reappraisals held active in working memory (represented in the DLPFC) and inhibits the DLPFC once the selection process is completed.",2016.0,122.0,112.0,"{'volume': '26 5', 'pages': '\n          1923-1937\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Morawetz2016ChangesIE,\n author = {C.

This result was obtained using a new method for inducing mood states unobtrusively and with minimal or no cognitive concomitants. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that for participants who were exposed to positive feedback a pre-existing positive mood led to stronger feelings of pride in comparison to negative mood. The results of Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that pre-existing mood directly influences the experience of subsequently elicited emotions independent of what one knows about the causes of this feeling. When participants were required to differentiate between the funniness of a cartoon and their subjective humour response, mood influenced only the latter judgement (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, reminding participants of the mood induction resulted in a contrast effect in judging the funniness of a cartoon. However, the pre-existing mood continued to exert an assimilation effect on the overt mirth response.

In this opinion paper, we highlight the potential of combining two recently developed behavioural and neural training techniques (cognitive bias modification and functional magnetic neuroimaging-based neurofeedback) into a research approach that could help make the most of increased levels of plasticity during childhood and adolescence. We discuss how this powerful combination could be used to explore changing brain-behaviour relationships throughout development in the context of emotion processing, a cognitive domain that exhibits continuous development throughout the second decade of life. By targeting both behaviour and brain response, we would also be in an excellent position to define sensible time windows for enhancing plasticity, thereby allowing for targeted intervention approaches that can help improve emotion processing in both typically and atypically developing populations.",2013.0,63.0,56.0,"{'volume': '16 4', 'pages': '\n          574-83\n        ', 'name': 'Developmental science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kadosh2013PlasticityDC,\n author = {Kathrin Cohen Kadosh and D.

Although intravenous ketamine infusions can lift mood within hours, the current review describes how intranasal ketamine administration can have ultra-rapid antidepressant effects, beginning within minutes (5–40 minutes) and lasting hours, but with repeated treatments needed for sustained antidepressant actions. Research in rodents suggests that increased synaptogenesis in PFC may contribute to the prolonged benefit of ketamine administration, beginning hours after administration. However, these data cannot explain the relief that occurs within minutes of intranasal ketamine delivery. We hypothesize that the ultra-rapid effects of intranasal administration in humans may be due to ketamine blocking the NMDAR circuits that generate the emotional representations of pain (eg, Brodmann Areas 24 and 25, insular cortex), cortical areas that can be overactive in depression and which sit above the nasal epithelium. In contrast, NMDAR blockade in the dorsolateral PFC following systemic administration of ketamine may contribute to cognitive deficits. This novel view may help to explain how intravenous ketamine can treat the symptoms of depression yet worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia.",2015.0,84.0,25.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '12 - 22', 'name': 'CNS Spectrums'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Opler2015AmelioratingTD,\n author = {L.

1947,ab1383827cfefbb09df3831762a10e768e93bae1,The Behavioral Intervention Technology Model: An Integrated Conceptual and Technological Framework for eHealth and mHealth Interventions,"A growing number of investigators have commented on the lack of models to inform the design of behavioral intervention technologies (BITs). BITs, which include a subset of mHealth and eHealth interventions, employ a broad range of technologies, such as mobile phones, the Web, and sensors, to support users in changing behaviors and cognitions related to health, mental health, and wellness. We propose a model that conceptually defines BITs, from the clinical aim to the technological delivery framework. The BIT model defines both the conceptual and technological architecture of a BIT. Conceptually, a BIT model should answer the questions why, what, how (conceptual and technical), and when. While BITs generally have a larger treatment goal, such goals generally consist of smaller intervention aims (the ""why"") such as promotion or reduction of specific behaviors, and behavior change strategies (the conceptual ""how""), such as education, goal setting, and monitoring. Behavior change strategies are instantiated with specific intervention components or “elements” (the ""what""). The characteristics of intervention elements may be further defined or modified (the technical ""how"") to meet the needs, capabilities, and preferences of a user. Finally, many BITs require specification of a workflow that defines when an intervention component will be delivered. The BIT model includes a technological framework (BIT-Tech) that can integrate and implement the intervention elements, characteristics, and workflow to deliver the entire BIT to users over time. This implementation may be either predefined or include adaptive systems that can tailor the intervention based on data from the user and the user’s environment. The BIT model provides a step towards formalizing the translation of developer aims into intervention components, larger treatments, and methods of delivery in a manner that supports research and communication between investigators on how to design, develop, and deploy BITs.",2014.0,49.0,399.0,"{'volume': '16', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mohr2014TheBI,\n author = {D.

However, the particular spatial layouts created to represent time may differ across cultures. This paper examines whether people automatically access and use culturally specific spatial representations when reasoning about time. In Experiment 1, we asked Hebrew and English speakers to arrange pictures depicting temporal sequences of natural events, and to point to the hypothesized location of events relative to a reference point. In both tasks, English speakers (who read left to right) arranged temporal sequences to progress from left to right, whereas Hebrew speakers (who read right to left) arranged them from right to left, replicating previous work. In Experiments 2 and 3, we asked the participants to make rapid temporal order judgments about pairs of pictures presented one after the other (i.e., to decide whether the second picture showed a conceptually earlier or later time-point of an event than the first picture). Participants made responses using two adjacent keyboard keys. English speakers were faster to make ""earlier"" judgments when the ""earlier"" response needed to be made with the left response key than with the right response key. Hebrew speakers showed exactly the reverse pattern. Asking participants to use a space-time mapping inconsistent with the one suggested by writing direction in their language created interference, suggesting that participants were automatically creating writing-direction consistent spatial representations in the course of their normal temporal reasoning. It appears that people automatically access culturally specific spatial representations when making temporal judgments even in nonlinguistic tasks.",2010.0,30.0,329.0,"{'volume': '34 8', 'pages': '\n          1430-51\n        ', 'name': 'Cognitive science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fuhrman2010CrossCulturalDI,\n author = {Orly Fuhrman and L.

Two hundred and fifty effects of the experimental induction of positive, elated and negative, depressed mood in adult, non-clinical samples were integrated. Effect sizes were generally larger for negative than for positive mood inductions. The presentation of a film or story turned out to be most effective in inducing both positive and negative mood states. The effects are especially large when subjects are explicitly instructed to enter the specified mood state. For elated mood, all other MIPs yielded considerably lower effectiveness scores. For the induction of negative mood states, Imagination, Velten, Music, Social Interaction and Feedback MIPs were about as effective as the Film/Story MIP without instruction. Induction effects covaried with several study characteristics. Effects tend to be smaller when demand characteristics are controlled or subjects are not informed about the purpose of the experiment. For behavioural measures, effects are smaller than for self-reports but still larger than zero.

1955,ab77e32d02cbd227a6dd73e4d6fbc2f9d726719a,Intelligent emotion recognition system using brain signals (EEG),Human emotion is a complex and psycho physiological state of mind which can be expressed as positive or negative reactions to external and internal stimuli. Typical communication channels that indicate emotions are voice and facial expressions. People who are paralyzed or have other severe movement disorders have no way of expressing their emotions thereby forming a wide communication rift between them and the outside world. Communication through eye tracking is one of the alternative ways of giving such disabled patients to interact with the outside world. This paper investigates the possibility of recognizing emotions using signal processing of Electroencephalography using discrete wavelet transform and feeding appropriate values to an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for classification. The system enables severely disabled as well as able users to interact with the system using eye movement in order to respond to detected emotion. The solution can be used to detect emotions of motor disabled people and provision a means of communication; also it is a learning tool for trainee neurologists. The prototype was built using Matlab successfully and it was evaluated by experts and the intended users very creditably stating it as a useful software for disabled people.,2012.0,3.0,10.0,"{'pages': '454-459', 'name': '2012 IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Harischandra2012IntelligentER,\n author = {Janani Harischandra and M.U.S. Perera},\n journal = {2012 IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences},\n pages = {454-459},\n title = {Intelligent emotion recognition system using brain signals (EEG)},\n year = {2012}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2057092061', 'name': 'Janani Harischandra'}, {'authorId': '2255378559', 'name': 'M.U.S. Perera'}]"

Yet little is known about the validity of indirect questioning in reducing social desirability bias. This article reports on three studies that examine indirect questioning as a technique to reduce social desirability bias on self-report measures. The effects of asking indirect (i.e., structured, projective) questions were compared with direct (i.e., structured, personal) questions The pattern of results indicates that indirect questioning reduces social desirability bias on variables subject to social influence and has no significant effect on socially neutral variables. The social nature of the differences between direct and indirect questioning groups, and the attribution of an undesirable trait to an out-group but not an in-group target, supports the view that subjects projected their beliefs and evaluations in the indirect response situation.

To address this question, 50 participants (25 females and 25 males) were exposed to either a real-life contemplative scenario (a panoramic view of a lake) or to an immersive 360° footage of the same landscape. Next, type and valence of emotions, as well as sense of presence reported by participants, were compared across conditions. Findings showed that emotions elicited by virtual and natural conditions were not significantly different. The only exception was anger, which was significantly higher in the natural condition, and amusement, which was significantly higher in the virtual condition. Sense of physical presence and engagement dimensions of presence did not significantly differ between virtual and real conditions. However, different correlation patterns between emotions and key dimensions of presence were found after in vivo and in virtuo exposure. These findings provide initial evidence that emotions and sense of presence elicited by immersive videos are comparable with those evoked by real-life scenarios and warrant further investigations.",2019.0,23.0,113.0,"{'volume': '22 3', 'pages': '\n          220-226\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chirico2019WhenVF,\n author = {A.

Using item-remainder correlations, the most highly correlated anxiety-present and anxiety-absent items were combined, and correlated with scores obtained using the full-form of the STAI. Correlation coefficients greater than .90 were obtained using four and six items from the STAI. Acceptable reliability and validity were obtained using six items. The use of this six-item short-form produced scores similar to those obtained using the full-form. This was so for several groups of subjects manifesting a range of anxiety levels. This short-form of the STAI is therefore sensitive to fluctuations in state anxiety.

The aim of this study was to replicate and extend previous work using geographic location (GPS) sensors to identify depressive symptom severity. Methods We used a dataset collected from 48 college students over a 10-week period, which included GPS phone sensor data and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) to evaluate depressive symptom severity at baseline and end-of-study. GPS features were calculated over the entire study, for weekdays and weekends, and in 2-week blocks. Results The results of this study replicated our previous findings that a number of GPS features, including location variance, entropy, and circadian movement, were significantly correlated with PHQ-9 scores (r’s ranging from −0.43 to −0.46, p-values < .05). We also found that these relationships were stronger when GPS features were calculated from weekend, compared to weekday, data. Although the correlation between baseline PHQ-9 scores with 2-week GPS features diminished as we moved further from baseline, correlations with the end-of-study scores remained significant regardless of the time point used to calculate the features. Discussion Our findings were consistent with past research demonstrating that GPS features may be an important and reliable predictor of depressive symptom severity. The varying strength of these relationships on weekends and weekdays suggests the role of weekend/weekday as a moderating variable. The finding that GPS features predict depressive symptom severity up to 10 weeks prior to assessment suggests that GPS features may have the potential as early warning signals of depression.",2016.0,53.0,226.0,"{'volume': '4', 'name': 'PeerJ'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Saeb2016TheRB,\n author = {Sohrab Saeb and E.

METHODS: We have developed a user-friendly, interactive VR platform for self-attachment featuring a virtual assistant and a customised child avatar that resembles the user in their childhood. The virtual agent interacts with the user and using an emotion recognition algorithm can provide suggestions for the user to undertake an appropriate self-attachment sub-protocol. Furthermore, the platform allows user interaction with the child avatar, such as embracing the avatar.

There are many factors that can make of group exercises a challenging setting for older adults. A major one in the elderly population is the difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a novel virtual gym that enables online group-exercises in older adults with different levels of skills. 
Methods. A total of 37 older adults (65-87 years old) followed a personalized exercise program based on the OTAGO program for fall prevention, for a period of eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a tablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to a Control group (individual training) or Social group (online group-exercising). Pre- and post- measurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes. The study received ethical approval from the CREATE-NET Ethics Committee on ICT Research Involving Human Beings (Application N. 2014-001). 
Results. There were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in terms of physical outcomes. Interestingly though, while in the Control group fitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case for the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For psychological and social wellbeing outcomes there were improvements on both groups, regardless of the application used. 
Conclusion. Group exercising in a virtual gym can be effective in motivating and enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter individuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together despite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise can reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context. Longer term interventions with more participants are instead recommended to assess impacts on wellbeing.",2016.0,63.0,3.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1612.02686', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Báez2016EffectsOO,\n author = {Marcos Báez and I.

Although many existing works focus on emotion recognition from music, there seems to be a relative scarcity of research on emotion recognition from general sounds. One of the key characteristics of sound events is the sound source spatial position, i.e. the location of the source relatively to the acoustic receiver. Existing studies that aim to investigate the relation of the latter source placement and the elicited emotions are limited to distance, front and back spatial localization and/or specific emotional categories. In this paper we analytically investigate the effect of the source angular position on the listener's emotional state, modeled in the well-established valence/arousal affective space. Towards this aim, we have developed an annotated sound events dataset using binaural processed versions of the available International Affective Digitized Sound (IADS) sound events library. All subjective affective annotations were obtained using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) approach. Preliminary results obtained by processing these annotation scores are likely to indicate a systematic change in the listener affective state as the sound source angular position changes. This trend is more obvious when the sound source is located outside of the visible field of the listener.",2015.0,53.0,14.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '27-42', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Drossos2015InvestigatingTI,\n author = {K.

Past research on ER has mainly focused on one-time measurements of habitual ER. Linking regulatory strategies to emotions in daily lives is key to understanding adolescents’ emotional lives. Using an Experience Sampling Method with 78 adolescents (Mage = 13.91, SDage = .95, 66% girls), we investigated the use, selection, and success in down-regulating negative emotions of eight ER strategies across 44 assessments. Acceptance was the strategy employed most often followed by problem-solving, rumination, distraction, avoidance, reappraisal, social support, and suppression. Interestingly, negativity of the event influenced the use of ER strategies: With low intensity negative emotions, acceptance was more likely to be used, and with high intensity negative emotions, suppression, problem-solving, distraction, avoidance, social support, and rumination were more likely to be used. With regard to success, multilevel models revealed that problem-solving, reappraisal, and acceptance were more successful in down-regulating negative emotions than rumination. Further, among girls, no relations between the momentary use of ER strategies and depressive symptoms was found. Among boys, a negative relation between acceptance and depressive symptoms emerged. Results from this study suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between the intensity of negative emotions and ER strategies and that gender differences may exist. Taken together, this study showed which ER strategies are used by a healthy adolescent sample, and these results are discussed with regard to their theoretical and practical importance.",2018.0,72.0,76.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '1 - 11', 'name': 'International Journal of Behavioral Development'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lennarz2018EmotionRI,\n author = {H.

Age shifts in emotion regulation may be rooted in beliefs about different strategies. We test whether there are age differences in the beliefs people hold about specific emotion regulation strategies (derived from the process model of emotion regulation: Gross, 1998) and whether profiles of emotion beliefs vary by age.


Method
An adult lifespan sample (N = 557) sorted 13 emotion regulation strategies either by (a) how effective the strategies would be or (b) how likely they would be to use them, in 15 negative emotion-eliciting situations.


Results
Younger adults ranked attentional and cognitive distraction more effective than older adults, and preferred avoidance, distraction, and rumination more (and attentional deployment less) than middle-aged and older adults. Latent profile analysis on preferences identified three distinct strategy profiles: Classically adaptive regulators preferred a variety of strategies; situation modifiers showed strong preferences for changing situations; a small percentage of people preferred avoidance and rumination. Middle-aged and older adults were more likely than younger adults to be classically adaptive regulators (as opposed to situation modifiers or avoiders/ruminators).

We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.

1983,adbb20378727b892a1705425c8df6efec423c5ab,Patterns of cognitive appraisal in emotion.,"There has long been interest in describing emotional experience in terms of underlying dimensions, but traditionally only two dimensions, pleasantness and arousal, have been reliably found. The reasons for these findings are reviewed, and integrating this review with two recent theories of emotions (Roseman, 1984; Scherer, 1982), we propose eight cognitive appraisal dimensions to differentiate emotional experience. In an investigation of this model, subjects recalled past experiences associated with each of 15 emotions, and rated them along the proposed dimensions. Six orthogonal dimensions, pleasantness, anticipated effort, certainty, attentional activity, self-other responsibility/control, and situational control, were recovered, and the emotions varied systematically along each of these dimensions, indicating a strong relation between the appraisal of one's circumstances and one's emotional state. The patterns of appraisal for the different emotions, and the role of each of the dimensions in differentiating emotional experience are discussed.",1985.0,53.0,3553.0,"{'volume': '48 4', 'pages': '\n          813-38\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Smith1985PatternsOC,\n author = {Craig A.

Existing studies on the relation between sense of presence and level of anxiety, however, have yielded mixed results on the correlation between the two. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed publications on VRET for anxiety that included self-reported presence and anxiety. The comprehensive search of the literature identified 33 publications with a total of 1196 participants. The correlation between self-reported sense of presence and anxiety was extracted and meta-analyzed. Potential moderators such as technology characteristics, sample characteristics including age, gender and clinical status, disorder characteristics and study design characteristics such as measurements were also examined. The random effects analysis showed a medium effect size for the correlation between sense of presence and anxiety (r = .28; 95% CI: 0.18–0.38). Moderation analyses revealed that the effect size of the correlation differed across different anxiety disorders, with a large effect size for fear of animals (r = .50; 95% CI: 0.30–0.66) and a no to small effect size for social anxiety disorder (r = .001; 95% CI: −0.19–0.19). Further, the correlation between anxiety and presence was stronger in studies with participants who met criteria for an anxiety disorder than in studies with a non-clinical population. Trackers with six degrees of freedom and displays with a larger field of view resulted in higher effect sizes, compared to trackers with three degrees of freedom and displays with a smaller field of view. In addition, no difference in effect size was found for the type of presence measurement and the type of anxiety measurement. This meta-analysis confirms the positive relation between sense of presence and anxiety and demonstrates that this relation can be affected by various moderating factors.",2014.0,93.0,146.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ling2014AMO,\n author = {Y.

While the RHI relates to visual and tactile integration, we can also consider a similar illusion with visual and motor integration on a fake hand. We call this a “robot hand illusion” (RoHI), which relates to both the senses of ownership and agency. Here we investigate the effect of delayed visual feedback on the RoHI. Participants viewed a virtual computer graphic hand controlled by their hand movement recorded using a data glove device. We inserted delays of various lengths between the participant’s hand and the virtual hand movements (90–590 ms), and the RoHI effects for each delay condition were systematically tested using a questionnaire. The results showed that the participants felt significantly greater RoHI effects with temporal discrepancies of less than 190 ms compared with longer temporal discrepancies, both in the senses of ownership and agency. Additionally, participants felt significant, but weaker, RoHI effects with temporal discrepancies of 290–490 ms in the sense of agency, but not in the sense of ownership. The participants did not feel a RoHI with temporal discrepancies of 590 ms in either the senses of agency or ownership.

To address this issue, brain activation was measured in normal male subjects while they either responded in a normal manner to erotic film excerpts or voluntarily attempted to inhibit the sexual arousal induced by viewing erotic stimuli. Results demonstrated that the sexual arousal experienced, in response to the erotic film excerpts, was associated with activation in ""limbic"" and paralimbic structures, such as the right amygdala, right anterior temporal pole, and hypothalamus. In addition, the attempted inhibition of the sexual arousal generated by viewing the erotic stimuli was associated with activation of the right superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate gyrus. No activation was found in limbic areas. These findings reinforce the view that emotional self-regulation is normally implemented by a neural circuit comprising various prefrontal regions and subcortical limbic structures. They also suggest that humans have the capacity to influence the electrochemical dynamics of their brains, by voluntarily changing the nature of the mind processes unfolding in the psychological space.",2001.0,36.0,1031.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': 'RC165 - RC165', 'name': 'The Journal of Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Beauregard2001NeuralCO,\n author = {M.

1992,ae55a1cfd424e9d4beedf3dbea53b67c38bd99a1,Better cognitive control of emotional information is associated with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine reactivity to emotional stress,"Abstract Stress is strongly associated with several mental and physical health problems that involve inflammation, including asthma, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, and depression. It has been hypothesized that better cognitive control of emotional information may lead to reduced inflammatory reactivity to stress and thus better health, but to date no studies have examined whether differences in cognitive control predict pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to stress. To address this issue, we conducted a laboratory-based experimental study in which we randomly assigned healthy young-adult females to either an acute emotional stress (emotionally evocative video) or no-stress (control video) condition. Salivary levels of the key pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 were measured before and after the experimental manipulation, and following the last cytokine sample, we assessed participants’ cognitive control of emotional information using an emotional Stroop task. We also assessed participants’ cortisol levels before and after the manipulation to verify that documented effects were specific to cytokines and not simply due to increased nonwater salivary output. As hypothesized, the emotional stressor triggered significant increases in IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Moreover, even in fully adjusted models, better cognitive control following the emotional (but not control) video predicted less pronounced cytokine responses to that stressor. In contrast, no effects were observed for cortisol. These data thus indicate that better cognitive control specifically following an emotional stressor is uniquely associated with less pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine reactivity to such stress. These findings may therefore help explain why superior cognitive control portends better health over the lifespan.",2016.0,24.0,66.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '63 - 68', 'name': 'Stress'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shields2016BetterCC,\n author = {G.

The Moderating Role of Emotion Regulation: A Conceptual Framework,"The common practice of connecting to one’s job outside the primary office by using ICTs is linked to adverse outcomes like work-family conflict and poor-sleep quality. However, outcomes are shown to vary between individuals. This work aims to establish the root cause behind individual variations by unearthing the foundational generative mechanisms that lead to the outcomes. The ontological and epistemological approach of critical realism is used to propose a novel conceptual framework that offers a three-way interaction effect between psychological control over work-life balance, emotion regulation strategies and job-connectedness outcomes. According to the framework positive emotion regulation generated by the appropriate use of savoring and dampening strategies elicits specific neurobiological processes that mitigate adverse outcomes of job-connectedness. This work theoretically extends Bandura’s agentic perspective of socio-cognitive theory and practically provides managers with a deep understanding of the generative forces underlying human functioning that can be leveraged for hiring, leadership development and performance-management. An additional contribution of this work is providing a taxonomy of traditionally interchangeably-used terms to denote different kinds of alternate work arrangements, thus clearing the prevalent ambiguity in literature. A research limitation is the theoretical nature of the framework that needs to be tested empirically to confirm the effect sizes of the proposed relationships. This work is timely and offers future research directions in the interdisciplinary fields of IS and psychology.   ",2022.0,0.0,0.0,{'name': 'Journal of Management Research'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Hasan2022JobCC,\n author = {Deeba Hasan and T.

2002,af54896bf22ff27b2a55c64b28a12e6a71e0e795,Passive Sensing of Health Outcomes Through Smartphones: Systematic Review of Current Solutions and Possible Limitations,"Background Technological advancements, together with the decrease in both price and size of a large variety of sensors, has expanded the role and capabilities of regular mobile phones, turning them into powerful yet ubiquitous monitoring systems. At present, smartphones have the potential to continuously collect information about the users, monitor their activities and behaviors in real time, and provide them with feedback and recommendations. Objective This systematic review aimed to identify recent scientific studies that explored the passive use of smartphones for generating health- and well-being–related outcomes. In addition, it explores users’ engagement and possible challenges in using such self-monitoring systems. Methods A systematic review was conducted, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, to identify recent publications that explore the use of smartphones as ubiquitous health monitoring systems. We ran reproducible search queries on PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus online databases and aimed to find answers to the following questions: (1) What is the study focus of the selected papers? (2) What smartphone sensing technologies and data are used to gather health-related input? (3) How are the developed systems validated? and (4) What are the limitations and challenges when using such sensing systems? Results Our bibliographic research returned 7404 unique publications. Of these, 118 met the predefined inclusion criteria, which considered publication dates from 2014 onward, English language, and relevance for the topic of this review. The selected papers highlight that smartphones are already being used in multiple health-related scenarios. Of those, physical activity (29.6%; 35/118) and mental health (27.9; 33/118) are 2 of the most studied applications. Accelerometers (57.7%; 67/118) and global positioning systems (GPS; 40.6%; 48/118) are 2 of the most used sensors in smartphones for collecting data from which the health status or well-being of its users can be inferred. Conclusions One relevant outcome of this systematic review is that although smartphones present many advantages for the passive monitoring of users’ health and well-being, there is a lack of correlation between smartphone-generated outcomes and clinical knowledge. Moreover, user engagement and motivation are not always modeled as prerequisites, which directly affects user adherence and full validation of such systems.",2019.0,140.0,87.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'JMIR mHealth and uHealth'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Trifan2019PassiveSO,\n author = {A.

2003,af8d0db17e6d965dc1d13c01c9aa27f03a87e2c2,Using Virtual Reality to Distract Overweight Children from Bodily Sensations During Exercise,"This study analyzes the potential of virtual reality (VR) to enhance attentional distraction in overweight children as they experience bodily sensations during exercise. It has been suggested that one reason why obese children stop exercising is the perception of bodily sensations. In a counterbalanced design, a total of 109 children (33 overweight, 10-15 years old) were asked to walk twice for 6 minutes on a treadmill under one of two conditions: (a) traditional condition (TC)-focusing their attention on their physical feelings and sensations or (b) distraction condition (DC)-focusing their attention on a virtual environment. Attentional focus during exercise, bad-good feeling states (pre- and postexperimental), perceived exertion (3 minutes and post), heart rate, and enjoyment were assessed. Results indicated that overweight children focused on internal information under the TC, but they significantly shifted their attention to regard the external environment in the DC. This attentional distraction effect of VR was more intense in overweight than in normal-weight children. No differences between groups were found when examining changes in feeling states and perceived exertion. VR increased enjoyment during exercise, and children preferred exercise using virtual environments. VR is useful to promote distraction and may help overweight and obese children to enjoy exercise.",2016.0,0.0,49.0,"{'volume': '19 2', 'pages': '\n          115-9\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Baños2016UsingVR,\n author = {R.

2009,afff404fc21a9f5084cecfa495de4aaa7c5d8666,"Vagal tone, development, and Gray's motivational theory: Toward an integrated model of autonomic nervous system functioning in psychopathology","In the last decade, cardiac vagal tone has emerged as a psychophysiological marker of many aspects of behavioral functioning in both children and adults. Research efforts during this time have produced an extensive list of vagal tone correlates that includes temperamental variables as well as both anxious/internalizing and disruptive/externalizing behaviors. This potentially confusing state of affairs is compounded by developmental shifts in vagal tone–behavior relations that to date have not been elucidated. In this paper, the vagal tone literature is reviewed, and discrepancies, including the lack of specificity of vagal tone as a psychophysiological marker, are clarified. Such clarification requires that we (a) view vagal tone–behavior relations in developmental context, (b) juxtapose vagal tone–behavior relations in typical and atypical samples, and (c) consider the parasympathetic underpinnings of vagal tone as but one component in a broader model of autonomic nervous system functioning. Such a model is provided by combining Gray's motivational theory with Porges's polyvagal theory. Together these models account for behavioral and emotional differences in a diverse range of psychological disorders that are not differentiated by either model alone. Moreover, use of the integrated model offers a theory-driven approach to the study of autonomic nervous system–behavior relations.",2001.0,219.0,1351.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '183 - 214', 'name': 'Development and Psychopathology'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Beauchaine2001VagalTD,\n author = {Theodore P.

The first part is dedicated to the state of the art, from the point of view of both psychology (history of theories of emotions) and computer science (presentation of emotional agents and their applications).The second part is dedicated to the logical formalisation of emotions. It introduces our logical framework, exposes and argues the formal definitions of twenty emotions, and proves some of their properties. Finally the last part is dedicated to practical applications and continuation prospects of this work. Such a work offers interesting contributions : it offers to the agent community a formal model of a great number of emotions; it shows the interest of BDI logics; and it opens research prospects about the dynamics of emotions and their influence on the behaviour of agents, a field not much explored for now.",2007.0,164.0,74.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Adam2007EmotionsFP,\n author = {C.

On the basis of a new process conception of emotion regulation, we hypothesized that in low-intensity negative situations, people would show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by engagement reappraisal, which allows emotional processing. However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3). In response to these emotional contexts, participants chose between using either reappraisal or distraction as an emotion-regulation strategy. Results in all experiments supported our hypothesis. This pattern in the choice of emotion-regulation strategies has important implications for the understanding of healthy adaptation.",2011.0,25.0,1089.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '1391 - 1396', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sheppes2011EmotionRegulationC,\n author = {G.

We specifically addressed whether the contingent non‐verbal feedback of virtual humans affects the association between interactants' social anxiety and their verbal self‐disclosure. This subject was investigated across three experimental conditions where participants interacted with real human videos and virtual humans in computer‐mediated interview interactions. The results demonstrated that socially anxious people revealed more information and greater intimate information about themselves when interacting with a virtual human when compared with real human video interaction, whereas less socially anxious people did not show this difference. We discuss the implication of this association between the interactional fidelity of virtual humans and social anxiety in a human interactant on the design of an embodied virtual agent for social skills' training and psychotherapy.

I had the good fortune to be one of them. The morning session of the scientific meeting we were attending had just ended, and everyone else had gone off to lunch. We had stayed behind at the request of Giacomo Rizzolatti, Professor of Human Physiology at the University Parma, who said he had something exciting to show us and wanted our opinion about what it might mean. He slipped a videotape into the tape deck that he had managed to hook up to the hotel's television set and pushed ''play.'' We found ourselves watching (and listening to) a video that Rizzolatti had made a few weeks earlier in his laboratory in Parma. In the video, a monkey was seated in a primate chair and was reaching out to grasp morsels of food placed in front of it by the experimenter, whom some of the scientists recognized as Rizzolatti's young associate, Leo Fogassi. We heard the familiar ''brrrrp'' of a stream of action potentials every time the monkey grasped a piece of food. Rizzolatti explained that the neuron we were listening to was located in the ventral premotor area, a brain region in the frontal lobes just in front of primary motor cortex, which Rizzolatti and his group had been studying since the early 1980s. So far, nothing on the tape seemed out of the ordinary. The neuron appeared to be coding the movements associated with grasping, just as many other neurons had done in the past when Rizzolatti and his group lowered microelectrodes into this region. Then something quite remarkable happened. The camera turned from the monkey to Leo Fogassi, who now, like the monkey, could be seen picking up pieces of food with his fingers. But as all of us could hear, the neuron continued to fire—and the timing of that firing was locked to Leo's grasping movements! All of us were stunned. Rizzolatti had shown us a neuron that fired not only when the monkey performed a particular action but also when the monkey observed another individual, in fact a member of another species, performing the same action. We didn't know it at the time, but we were among the first to witness a …",2008.0,10.0,484.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Iacoboni2008MirroringPT,\n author = {M.

First, by extending the reach of online programs to those who might not otherwise use them. Second, by improving engagement through both game-based and “serious” motivational dynamics. Third, by utilizing varied mechanisms for change, including therapeutic processes and gaming features. In this scoping review, we aim to advance the field by exploring the potential and opportunities available in this area. We review engagement factors which may be exploited and demonstrate that there is promising evidence of effectiveness for serious games for depression from contemporary systematic reviews. We illustrate six major categories of tested applied games for mental health (exergames, virtual reality, cognitive behavior therapy-based games, entertainment games, biofeedback, and cognitive training games) and demonstrate that it is feasible to translate traditional evidence-based interventions into computer gaming formats and to exploit features of computer games for therapeutic change. Applied games have considerable potential for increasing the impact of online interventions for mental health. However, there are few independent trials, and direct comparisons of game-based and non-game-based interventions are lacking.

2023,b0dfdb9a4ff0b013beddc4874fc3d9e1fb68b6e5,A Serious Videogame as an Additional Therapy Tool for Training Emotional Regulation and Impulsivity Control in Severe Gambling Disorder,"Background: Gambling disorder (GD) is characterized by a significant lack of self-control and is associated with impulsivity-related personality traits. It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression.",2015.0,115.0,67.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tarrega2015ASV,\n author = {S.

In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms. 
 
We consider similarity information in the setting of contextual bandits, a natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm is given the context--a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on web pages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a similarity distance between the context-arm pairs which bounds from above the difference between the respective expected payoffs. 
 
Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses ""uniform"" partitions of the similarity space, so that each context-arm pair is approximated by the closest pair in the partition. Algorithms based on ""uniform"" partitions disregard the structure of the payoffs and the context arrivals, which is potentially wasteful. We present algorithms that are based on adaptive partitions, and take advantage of ""benign"" payoffs and context arrivals without sacrificing the worst-case performance. The central idea is to maintain a finer partition in high-payoff regions of the similarity space and in popular regions of the context space. Our results apply to several other settings, e.g., MAB with constrained temporal change (Slivkins and Upfal, 2008) and sleeping bandits (Kleinberg et al., 2008a).",2009.0,69.0,420.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '2533-2568', 'name': 'J.

Load sharing varies by physical closeness and relationship quality. We investigated the effect of load sharing on emotional arousal via galvanic skin response, an indicator of sympathetic nervous system arousal, during a social stressor. Social stress was elicited in 66 adolescent girls (Mage = 15 years) using a spontaneous public-speaking task. Mother-daughter dyads reported their relationship quality, and physical closeness was manipulated by having mothers either touch or not touch their daughter's hand during the performance. We found evidence of load sharing among dyads who held hands, independent of relationship quality. However, without physical contact, load sharing was only evident among dyads with higher relationship quality. Thus, high relationship quality buffers against threat in a similar way to the physical comfort of a loved one.",2016.0,52.0,34.0,"{'volume': '16 1', 'pages': '\n          83-93\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lougheed2016SharingTB,\n author = {Jessica P.

Subjects were asked either to conceal or to exaggerate the facial display associated with the anticipation and reception of painful shocks that varied in intensity. Both self-reports of shock painfulness and skin conductance measures of emotional response showed significant changes paralleling the changes induced in expressive behavior; that is, the suppression of expressive responses decreased the magnitude of phasic skin conductance changes and subjective reports of painfulness as compared to the free expression or exaggeration of pain-related expressive response. The effects were obtained for shocks of varying intensities and for both male and female subjects. The findings support theories of emotion that assume that expressive responses serve a self-regulatory as well as a social-communicative function, and further suggest that the self-regulation is mediated neurally, rather than via a process of self-attribution. Finally, the results highlight the need for research on dissimulation in social interaction to consider the effects of acting upon the actor, as well as its effects upon the inferences of observers.",1976.0,35.0,255.0,"{'volume': '33 3', 'pages': '\n          354-70\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lanzetta1976EffectsON,\n author = {J.

Researchers provide interventions in the form of cognitive behavior therapy as interventions to reduce obsessive compulsive behavior, and to improve mental health in schools. This therapy aims to oppose wrong thoughts and emotions by presenting evidence that contradicts beliefs about the problem at hand. The method used in this research is qualitative with a case study approach. Subjects were female who were 16 years old and had obsessive compulsive behavior for 14 months. The cognitive behavior therapy procedure is first, the subject is asked for relaxation in the form of progressivrizkie muscle relaxation to learn to stretch and relax various muscle groups and learn to notice the difference between tension and relax. Second, cognitive restructuring, reducing the anxiety level of the subject caused by negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive thoughts, and. Third, exposure with response prevention, to overcome obsessive compulsive behavior. Where the subject is faced with a situation of having the belief that must perform the usual ritual behavior but the subject is prevented from doing the ritual. If the subject can prevent not doing the ritual and it turns out that something terrible did not happen, this can help in changing the subject's belief in compulsive behavior. The intervention consisted of eight sessions with two sessions a week and 60 minutes each for each session.

To systematically review the experience of fathers of preterm infants hospitalised in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.


BACKGROUND
Family-centred care is more and more acknowledged in Neonatal Intensive Care Units, advocating for active engagement of both parents in the care journey. Nonetheless, fathers' Neonatal Intensive Care Unit experience has received limited research attention.


DESIGN
Systematic review of qualitative studies.


METHODS
Four electronic databases (CINHAL, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus) were explored and studies published between 2000-2014 were included. Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tool for Qualitative Studies guidelines were adopted. Key themes were extracted and synthesised.


RESULTS
Five main themes resuming fathers' experience of preterm birth and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay were identified from 14 studies. Themes were: emotional roller-coaster, paternal needs, coping strategies, self-representation and caregiving engagement. These dimensions were found to be dynamically shaped across three critical turning points: preterm birth, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay and at home.


CONCLUSIONS
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit fathers of preterm infants experience ambivalence, a set of different needs and coping strategies. They modify their self-representations along the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit journey and needs specific nursing support and intervention to sustain caregiving engagement and transition to parenthood.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
A systematic and deepened understanding of preterms' fathers lived experience in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit would be helpful to inform nursing practice. Specific action priorities are suggested within the frame of family-centred care.",2015.0,33.0,108.0,"{'volume': '24 13-14', 'pages': '\n          1784-94\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of clinical nursing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Provenzi2015TheLE,\n author = {L.

By measuring participants’ brain activity with electroencephalography (EEG), we found face-recognition event related potentials (ERPs) in the visual cortex, around 200–250 ms, to be prominent for the different familiarity levels. A less positive component was found for self-recognized pictures (P200) than pictures of others, showing similar effects in both real faces and look-alike avatars. A rapid adaptation in the same component was found when comparing the neural processing of avatar faces vs. real faces, as if avatars in general were assimilated as real face representations over time. ERP results also showed that in the case of the self-avatar, the P200 component correlated with more complex conscious encodings of self-representation, i.e., the difference in voltage in the P200 between the self-avatar and the self-picture was reduced in participants that felt the avatar looked like them. This study is put into context within the literature of self-recognition and face recognition in the visual cortex. Additionally, the implications of these results on look-alike avatars are discussed both for future virtual reality (VR) and neuroscience studies.",2016.0,74.0,29.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{González-Franco2016TheNT,\n author = {Mar González-Franco and Anna I.

The overall purpose of the present paper was to bring some clarity to this concept by critically examining how it has been presented in the literature and by proposing both rationally and empirically derived typologies for organizing social support functions. From a review of prominent discussions of support functions, a rational typology was proposed that included six categories: Material Aid, Behavioral Assistance, Intimate Interaction, Feedback, and Positive Social Interaction. To empirically examine the structure of social support, a factor analysis was conducted on items from a scale of socially supportive behaviors. The four factors that subsequently emerged were labeled Directive Guidance, Non-directive Support, Positive Social Interaction, and Tangible Assistance.

However, there is concern regarding levels of user engagement, uptake and adherence. Key guidance regarding digital health interventions stress the importance of early user input in the development, evaluation and implementation of technologies to help ensure they are engaging, feasible, acceptable and potentially effective. Co-design is a process of active involvement of stakeholders, requiring a change from the traditional approaches to intervention development. However, there is a lack of literature to inform the co-design of digital technologies to help child and adolescent mental health. Methods We reviewed the literature and practice in the co-design of digital mental health technologies with children and young people. We searched Medline, PsycInfo and Web of Science databases, guidelines, reviews and reference lists, contacted key authors for relevant studies, and extracted key themes on aspects of co-design relevant to practice. We supplemented this with case studies and methods reported by researchers working in the field. Results We identified 25 original articles and 30 digital mental health technologies that were designed/developed with children and young people.

In fact, VR can be described as an advanced form of human–computer interface that is able to induce a feeling of ‘presence’ in the computer-generated world experienced by the user. This feature transforms VR in an ‘empowering environment’, a sheltered setting where patients can start to explore and act without feeling threatened. With such assurance, they can freely explore, experiment, feel, live out and experience feelings and/or thoughts. The paper presents the current state of clinical research in this area. Furthermore, the open source ‘NeuroVR’ system and its potential clinical applications are presented and discussed.",2009.0,42.0,115.0,"{'volume': '37', 'pages': '337 - 345', 'name': 'British Journal of Guidance & Counselling'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riva2009VirtualRA,\n author = {G.

One of the four blocks (in counterbalanced order) was designed to be stressful (S), while the other blocks were designed to be calm (C). The motions required of the users were the same in both conditions; only the visual and audio feedback were different across the S and C conditions. Users' self-scored arousal in the S condition was significantly higher. We analyzed the recorded motions by segmenting out 2747 ""fast motions"", i.e., intervals of time where the sum of the speed of the hands was above a threshold. A simple machine learning algorithm (a decision tree) could learn to classify these fast motions as either calm or stressed, with ≈80% accuracy, using only two features: the maximum speed achieved during the motion, and the heart rate at the moment of maximum speed, where both features were normalized. If only the maximum speed feature is used (i.e., with no physiological data), ≈70% accuracy is achieved.",2019.0,43.0,9.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Robitaille2019IncreasedAI,\n author = {Patrice Robitaille and Michael J.

A conversational chatbot is a promising oracle for delivering appropriate just-in-time interventions. However, designing emotionally-aware agents, specially in this context, is under-explored. Furthermore, the feasibility of automating the delivery of just-in-time mHealth interventions via such an agent has not been fully studied. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of EMMA (EMotion-Aware mHealth Agent) through a two-week long human-subject experiment with N=39 participants. EMMA provides emotionally appropriate micro-activities in an empathetic manner. We show that the system can be extended to detect a user's mood purely from smartphone sensor data. Our results show that our personalized machine learning model was perceived as likable via self-reports of emotion from users.

The phenomenon was approached through an inductive theory construction. The data were gathered from eight adolescents by means of group interviews and follow-up forms, and were then analysed using constructive grounded theory methods. The analysis resulted in a theoretical model, which describes mood regulation by music as a process of satisfying personal mood-related goals through various musical activities. The general nature of the mood regulation is described, the goals and strategies of mood regulation are examined, and finally the specific role of music in mood regulation is discussed.",2007.0,65.0,598.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '109 - 88', 'name': 'Psychology of Music'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Saarikallio2007TheRO,\n author = {Suvi Saarikallio and Jaakko Erkkilä},\n journal = {Psychology of Music},\n pages = {109 - 88},\n title = {The role of music in adolescents' mood regulation},\n volume = {35},\n year = {2007}\n}\n""}","[{'authorId': '6732966', 'name': 'Suvi Saarikallio'}, {'authorId': '2851744', 'name': 'Jaakko Erkkilä'}]"

A great challenge in this domain is that although the presence of hate speech can be deleterious to the quality of service provided by social platforms, it still comprises only a tiny fraction of the content that can be found online, which can lead to performance deterioration due to majority class overfitting. To this end, we perform a thorough study on the application of deep learning to the hate speech detection problem: a) we propose three text-based data augmentation techniques aimed at reducing the degree of class imbalance and to maximise the amount of information we can extract from our limited resources and b) we apply them on a selection of top-performing deep architectures and hate speech databases in order to showcase their generalisation properties. The data augmentation techniques are based on a) synonym replacement based on word embedding vector closeness, b) warping of the word tokens along the padded sequence or c) class-conditional, recurrent neural language generation. Our proposed framework yields a significant increase in multi-class hate speech detection, outperforming the baseline in the largest online hate speech database by an absolute 5.7% increase in Macro-F1 score and 30% in hate speech class recall.",2019.0,49.0,78.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Rizos2019AugmentTP,\n author = {Georgios Rizos and Konstantin Hemker and Björn Schuller},\n journal = {Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management},\n title = {Augment to Prevent: Short-Text Data Augmentation in Deep Learning for Hate-Speech Classification},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '40185455', 'name': 'Georgios Rizos'}, {'authorId': '2121244573', 'name': 'Konstantin Hemker'}, {'authorId': '145411696', 'name': 'Björn Schuller'}]"

It explores how affective factors influence interactions between humans and technology, how affect sensing and affect generation techniques can inform our understanding of human affect, and on the design, implementation, and evaluation of systems that intricately involve affect at their core. The Oxford Handbook of Affective Computing will help both new and experienced researchers identify trends, concepts, methodologies, and applications in this burgeouning field. The volume features 41 chapters divided into five main sections: history and theory, detection, generation, methodologies, and applications. Section One begins with a look at the makings of AC and a historical review of the science of emotion. Chapters discuss the theoretical underpinnings of AC from an interdisciplinary perspective involving the affective, cognitive, social, media, and brain sciences. Section Two focuses on affect detection or affect recognition, which is one of the most commonly investigated areas in AC. Section Three examines aspects of affect generation including the synthesis of emotion and its expression via facial features, speech, postures and gestures. Cultural issues in affect generation are also discussed. Section Four features chapters on methodological issues in AC research, including data collection techniques, multimodal affect databases, emotion representation formats, crowdsourcing techniques, machine learning approaches, affect elicitation techniques, useful AC tools, and ethical issues in AC. Finally, Section Five highlights existing and future applications of AC in domains such as formal and informal learning, games, robotics, virtual reality, autism research, healthcare, cyberpsychology, music, deception, reflective writing, and cyberpsychology.With chapters authored by world leaders in each area, The Oxford Handbook of Affective Computing is suitable for use as a textbook in undergraduate or graduate courses in AC, and will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners across the globe.",2014.0,0.0,336.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Calvo2014TheOH,\n author = {R.

Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed.

However, tailored adaptive behaviours based on multi-dimensional and deep understanding of the human essential for enduring beneficial relationships in certain contexts are lacking.

Dr. Lazarus and his collaborator, Dr. Susan Folkman, present here a detailed theory of psychological stress, building on the concepts of cognitive appraisal and coping which have become major themes of theory and investigation. As an integrative theoretical analysis, this volume pulls together two decades of research and thought on issues in behavioral medicine, emotion, stress management, treatment, and life span development. A selective review of the most pertinent literature is included in each chapter. The total reference listing for the book extends to 60 pages. This work is necessarily multidisciplinary, reflecting the many dimensions of stress-related problems and their situation within a complex social context. While the emphasis is on psychological aspects of stress, the book is oriented towards professionals in various disciplines, as well as advanced students and educated laypersons. The intended audience ranges from psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, nurses, and social workers to sociologists, anthropologists, medical researchers, and physiologists.",2020.0,5.0,16314.0,{'name': 'Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Lazarus2020StressAA,\n author = {R.

Sexual minorities are subject to similar stressors. The aim of this study is to examine whether sexual minorities are at increased risk for psychotic symptoms and to explore mediating pathways. Method A cross-sectional survey was performed assessing cumulative incidence of psychotic symptoms with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview in two separate random general population samples (NEMESIS-1 and NEMESIS-2). Participants were sexually active and aged 18–64 years (n = 5927, n = 5308). Being lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB) was defined as having sexual relations with at least one same-sex partner during the past year. Lifetime experience of any psychotic symptom was analysed using logistic regression, adjusted for gender, educational level, urbanicity, foreign-born parents, living without a partner, cannabis use and other drug use. Results The rate of any psychotic symptom was elevated in the LGB population as compared with the heterosexual population both in NEMESIS-1 [odds ratio (OR) 2.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.71–3.84] and NEMESIS-2 (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.42–3.71). Childhood trauma, bullying and experience of discrimination partly mediated the association. Conclusions The finding that LGB orientation is associated with psychotic symptoms adds to the growing body of literature linking minority status with psychosis and other mental health problems, and suggests that exposure to minority stress represents an important mechanism.",2013.0,57.0,71.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '421 - 433', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gevonden2013SexualMS,\n author = {M.

2080,b6732f04b6cae542122da2073ece2a7bfc6865a8,Ecological momentary interventions: incorporating mobile technology into psychosocial and health behaviour treatments.,"PURPOSE
Psychosocial and health behaviour treatments and therapies can be extended beyond traditional research or clinical settings by using mobile technology to deliver interventions to individuals as they go about their daily lives. These ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are treatments that are provided to people during their everyday lives (i.e. in real time) and in natural settings (i.e. real world). The goal of the present review is to synthesize and critique mobile technology-based EMI aimed at improving health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms.


METHODS
Twenty-seven interventions using palmtop computers or mobile phones to deliver ambulatory treatment for smoking cessation, weight loss, anxiety, diabetes management, eating disorders, alcohol use, and healthy eating and physical activity were identified.


RESULTS
There is evidence that EMI can be successfully delivered, are accepted by patients, and are efficacious for treating a variety of health behaviours and physical and psychological symptoms. Limitations of the existing literature were identified and recommendations and considerations for research design, sample characteristics, measurement, statistical analyses, and clinical implementation are discussed.


CONCLUSIONS
Mobile technology-based EMI can be effectively implemented as interventions for a variety of health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms. Future research should integrate the assessment and intervention capabilities of mobile technology to create dynamically and individually tailored EMI that are ecologically sensitive.",2010.0,71.0,1098.0,"{'volume': '15 Pt 1', 'pages': '\n          1-39\n        ', 'name': 'British journal of health psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Heron2010EcologicalMI,\n author = {Kristin E.

Well-crafted questions lead to new insights, generate discussion, and promote the comprehensive exploration of subject matter. Poorly constructed questions can stifle learning by creating confusion, intimidating students, and limiting creative thinking. Teachers most often ask lower-order, convergent questions that rely on students’ factual recall of prior knowledge rather than asking higher-order, divergent questions that promote deep thinking, requiring students to analyze and evaluate concepts.

Previously published studies have shown that VR graded exposure therapy (VR-GET) treatment can result in improvements in PTSD symptoms. Less is known about the impact on depression, general anxiety, and neuropsychological functioning in patients with PTSD. This study examined changes in self-reports of PTSD, depression, and anxiety before and after treatment, and also examined neuropsychological functioning as assessed by a computerized test of simple reaction time, procedural reaction time, and performance on the congruent, incongruent, emotional, and neutral (match the color of the ""nonsense word"") Stroop tests. Results showed that subjects treated with VR-GET showed significant reductions in PTSD and anxiety severity and significant improvements on the emotional Stroop test. Changes in depression and other measures of neuropsychological function were not significant. Change scores on the emotional Stroop test did not correlate with changes in self-report measures of PTSD. Overall, these findings support the use of VR-GET as a treatment for PTSD but indicate that benefits may be narrowly focused.

Ten processes of change have been identified for producing progress along with decisional balance, self-efficacy, and temptations. Basic research has generated a rule of thumb for at-risk populations: 40% in precontemplation, 40% in contemplation, and 20% in preparation. Across 12 health behaviors, consistent patterns have been found between the pros and cons of changing and the stages of change. Applied research has demonstrated dramatic improvements in recruitment, retention, and progress using stage-matched interventions and proactive recruitment procedures. The most promising outcomes to date have been found with computer-based individualized and interactive interventions. The most promising enhancement to the computer-based programs are personalized counselors. One of the most striking results to date for stage-matched programs is the similarity between participants reactively recruited who reached us for help and those proactively recruited who we reached out to help.

CBIs are based on constructive meditations where imagery abilities are essential. One of the major difficulties that participants report during the training is the difficulty related to imagery abilities. Virtual reality (VR) can be a useful tool to overcome this limitation because it can facilitate the construction and sustainment of mental images. The machine to be another (TMTBA) uses multi-sensory stimulation to induce a body swap illusion. This system allows participants to see themselves from a third perspective and have the illusion of touching themselves from outside. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the efficacy of a self-compassion meditation procedure based on the TMTBA system versus the usual meditation procedure (CAU) in increasing positive affect states, mindful self-care, and adherence to the practice, and explore the influence of imagery abilities as moderators of the effects of the condition on adherence. A sample of 16 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: TMTBA-VR and CAU. All participants had to listen to an audio meditation about self-compassion and answer questionnaires before and after the training. The TMTBA-VR condition also had a body swap experience at the end of the meditation while listening to self-compassionate messages. Afterward, they were invited to practice this meditation for 2 weeks and then measured again. After the compassion practice, both conditions significantly increased positive qualities toward self/others, decreased negative qualities toward self, and increased awareness and attention to mental events and bodily sensations, with no differences between the conditions. After 2 weeks, both conditions showed a similar frequency of meditation practice and increases in specific types of self-care behaviors, with the frequency of clinical self-care behaviors being significantly higher in TMTBA. Finally, lower imagery ability in the visual and cutaneous modality were moderators of the efficacy of the TMTBA (vs. CAU) condition in increasing adherence to the practice. Embodied VR could be an interesting tool to facilitate and increase the efficacy of CBIs by facilitating the construction of positive and powerful mental images.",2019.0,52.0,29.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cebolla2019PuttingOI,\n author = {A.

Emotion-specific response biases differed by age: Older adults were disproportionately more likely to incorrectly label lexical stimuli as happiness, sadness, and surprise and to incorrectly label facial stimuli as disgust and fear. After these biases were controlled, findings suggested that older adults were less accurate at identifying emotions than were young adults, but the pattern differed across emotions and task types. The lexical task showed stronger age differences than the facial task, and for lexical stimuli, age groups differed in accuracy for all emotional states except fear. For facial stimuli, in contrast, age groups differed only in accuracy for anger, disgust, fear, and happiness.

As such, understanding boredom and the associated cognitive and affective components of the experience, represents an important first step in combatting the consequences of boredom for psychological well-being. We surveyed 1928 undergraduate students on measures of boredom proneness, self-control, MW, depression and aggression to investigate how these constructs were related. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that self-control operated as a strong negative predictor of boredom proneness. Finally, when controlling for age and self-control, we observed large decreases in the magnitudes of the relationships between boredom proneness and our other measures of interest. Together, these results imply a strong relationship between boredom proneness and cognitive and affective dysregulation, and show that individual levels of self-control can account for the lion’s share of variance in the relationships between boredom, cognition, and affect.",2017.0,36.0,82.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '1741 - 1748', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Isacescu2017CognitiveAA,\n author = {Julia Isacescu and Andriy A.

However, scant availability of well-controlled emotional face stimuli from non-Western populations limit the evaluation of cultural differences in face emotion perception and how this might be modulated by age and sex differences. We present a database of East Asian face expression stimuli, enacted by young and older, male and female, Taiwanese using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Combined with a prior database, this present database consists of 90 identities with happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, surprised and neutral expressions amounting to 628 photographs. Twenty young and 24 older East Asian raters scored the photographs for intensities of multiple-dimensions of emotions and induced affect. Multivariate analyses characterized the dimensionality of perceived emotions and quantified effects of age and sex. We also applied commercial software to extract computer-based metrics of emotions in photographs. Taiwanese raters perceived happy faces as one category, sad, angry, and disgusted expressions as one category, and fearful and surprised expressions as one category. Younger females were more sensitive to face emotions than younger males. Whereas, older males showed reduced face emotion sensitivity, older female sensitivity was similar or accentuated relative to young females. Commercial software dissociated six emotions according to the FACS demonstrating that defining visual features were present. Our findings show that East Asians perceive a different dimensionality of emotions than Western-based definitions in face recognition software, regardless of age and sex. Critically, stimuli with detailed cultural norms are indispensable in interpreting neural and behavioral responses involving human facial expression processing.

Incorporating human assessments in a stratified propensity score analysis based framework, we identify comparable subpopulations of individuals and measure the effect of online social support language.

In social psychology, rapport is described as the establishment of a positive relationship among interaction partners by rapidly detecting and responding to each other’s nonverbal behavior (Gratch et al., 2007a). This includes displaying behaviors that indicate positive emotions (such as head nods and smiles), showing mutual attentiveness (such as mutual gaze) and certain coordination behaviors (such as postural mimicry and synchronized movement) (Tickle-Degnan & Rosenthal, 1990). Niewiadomski et al. (2010) reports that when an agent displays appropriate and socially adapted emotional expressions, he is perceived as more human-like than an agent that shows human expressions which are inappropriate or not socially adapted. Garau et al. (2005) conducted a study showing that only participants who interacted with an agent that was responsive to their movements, experienced a sense of personal contact with the agent which influenced them to behave more socially considerate as opposed to interacting with a static or moving but unresponsive agent. This indicates that rapport is an important feature in order for the agent to be perceived as human-like and for any social effects, such as social facilitation, to occur. Previous research on social facilitation/inhibition illustrates how the presence of others affects an individuals’ task performance either positively or negatively (Guerin & Innes, 1982; Zanjonc, 1965; Sanders, Baron & Moore, 1978). Whether or not similar facilitation/inhibition effects occur in presence of virtual agents has been subject to several studies. Rickenberg and Reeves (2000) found that tasks are facilitated or inhibited by the “social” presence of a virtual agent. A study by Zanbaka et al. (2004) indicates that when asked to perform a task, participants reacted similarly to the presence of a virtual agent as they would have in the presence of another human. A follow-up study by Zanbaka et al. (2007) demonstrates that the presence of a virtual agent inhibits the performance of participants on a mathematical task. The limitation of this study was that the sample consisted of only female participants being confronted with an agent of matching gender. Hayes et al. (2010) found a similar decrease in performance with regard Abstract The purpose of the present research is to investigate whether virtual agents can help enhance participants’ performance, effort and motivation in mathematics. We hypothesize that a minimal amount behavioral realism induced by display of rapport is necessary for any social effects to occur in human- computer interaction. Further, we examine whether social facilitation effects occur depending on the gender of the participants and the interacting virtual agents. In a 2x2 between subjects design, participants interacted with a male or female virtual agent that either displayed rapport or no rapport. Our results confirm that gender plays a role when interacting with virtual agents that are capable of establishing rapport. Participants’ performance and effort were significantly enhanced when interacting with an agent of opposite gender that displayed rapport . Our results have implications on designing agents for education and training purposes. Keywords: social facilitation, STEM, rapport, virtual agents Introduction There is considerable interest in factors that enhance science and math performance. Recently, there has been an upsurge of interest in educational technology that exploits social and motivational factors that enhance math performance in general, and reduce gender inequality in particular (Kim, 2004; Baylor & Ryu, 2003). This work builds on the phenomena that people often treat computers as social actors. Therefore, psychological factors that improve people's performance in traditional face-to-face settings can be simulated by technologies in form of virtual learning companions or virtual instructors. In this paper, we seek to address two related goals. First, we aim to show that certain social psychological phenomena can enhance math performance in a human-computer setting. Specifically, we show that a form of social facilitation can improve performance on standardized math tests. Second, we seek to provide further evidence that people do treat computers as social actors and help elucidate the design principles that foster this effect. We specifically demonstrate that virtual agents must possess a minimum level of behavioral realism to achieve any social effects.",2012.0,22.0,21.0,"{'volume': '34', 'name': 'Cognitive Science'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Karacora2012TheIO,\n author = {Bilge Karacora and Morteza Dehghani and Nicole Krämer-Mertens and J.

To address such variation, we focused on cognitive reappraisal and considered the effects of goals (i.e., what people are trying to achieve) and tactics (i.e., what people actually do) on outcomes (i.e., how affective responses change). To examine goals, we randomly assigned participants to either increase positive emotion or decrease negative emotion to a negative stimulus. To examine tactics, we categorized participants' reports of how they reappraised. To examine reappraisal outcomes, we measured experience and electrodermal responding. Findings indicated that (a) the goal of increasing positive emotion led to greater increases in positive affect and smaller decreases in skin conductance than the goal of decreasing negative emotion, and (b) use of the reality challenge tactic was associated with smaller increases in positive affect during reappraisal. These findings suggest that reappraisal can be implemented in the service of different emotion goals, using different tactics. Such differences are associated with different outcomes, and they should be considered in future research and applied attempts to maximize reappraisal success. Researchers have identified many types of emotion regulation strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression; Gross & Thompson, 2007). Contrasting these strategies has led to important insights about differences among emotion regulatory but has deemphasized the variability that exists within any given strategy, such as those occasioned by differing goals (i.e., what people are trying to achieve) or tactics (i.e., what people actually do). One promising target for examining within-strategy variation is cognitive reappraisal, which refers to altering emotions by changing the way one thinks. Successful reappraisal influences many aspects of emotional responding, including self-reported negative has been notable variation in reappraisal success across studies. For example, reappraisal may be impaired in those with depression Zaldivar, 2009). Variability in these findings may be due to the relative freedom that participants are given to enact reappraisal. Two potentially important sources of variation are (a) the emotion goals pursued during reappraisal and (b) the specific tactics used to reappraise. Studies of unrestricted reappraisal indicate that there may be two different emotion goals that lead to successfully regulated negative emotion (McRae et al.

Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.",1989.0,81.0,22928.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '982-1003', 'name': 'Management Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Davis1989UserAO,\n author = {Fred D.

Objectives: To provide theoretical framework which integrates the scientific literature regarding the transdiagnostic dimensions in the eating disorders (ED) spectrum: self-agency, mentalization, self-control and self-regulation. In addition to introducing a newly developed eating and control style axis, (ECOSA), it focuses on better conceptualizing the complex interaction between eating style, control conditions, and the impact of the “emotional brain” versus the “thinking brain.”
Methods: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, were performed on April–May 2020 using the keywords Self agency or mentalization or reflective functioning or self-regulation or emotion regulation or self-control or self-agency and eating disorders.
Results: There are numerous scientific literatures related to eating disorders. However, only two were related to all the dimensions discussed in this manuscript. Most reviews have focused on a single diagnostic category or two dimensions. Only, one study reported the results of mentalization-based treatment (MBT). ECOSA provides an example of a tool that may be used to promote self-agency in the management of eating disorders.
Conclusion: To enhance perception of ownership over an effector (self-agency), clinicians need an instrument that assists in exploring the agent’s inner intentions.

Early adolescence is an especially important period in which peer influence and school environment strongly shape psychological development and maturation of core social-emotional regulatory functions. Yet, there is no integrated evidence based model of SPR in this age group to inform future research and practice. The current meta-analysis synthetizes evidence from 364 studies into an integrated model of potential determinants of SPR in early adolescence. The model encompasses links with 93 variables referring to individual (identity, skills/strengths, affect/well-being, and behavior/health) and environmental (peer group, school, family, community, and internet/technology) potential influences on SPR based on cross-sectional correlational data. Findings suggest the central importance of identity and social–emotional skills in SPR. School environment stands out as a compelling setting for future prevention programs. Finally, we underscore an alarming gap of research on the influence of the virtual and online environment on youth's social realm given its unquestionable importance as a globally expanding social interaction setting. Hence, we propose an integrated model that can serve as organizational framework, which may ultimately lead to the adoption of a more structured and integrated approach to understanding peer relationship processes in youth and contribute to overcoming marked fragmentation in the field.",2020.0,205.0,64.0,"{'volume': '12', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mitic2020TowardAI,\n author = {Marija Mitic and K.

To determine the factors associated with the adoption or maintenance of consistent safer sexual behaviors among human immunodeficiency virus-positive adolescents and young adults with hemophilia. Methods. One hundred eleven adolescents at 10 hemophilia care sites participated in an intervention program designed to increase safer sexual behaviors (abstinence, condom use, or nonpenetrative behavior). The theory-based intervention spanned 1 year. Adolescents attended individual sessions, small group activities, and an intensive group retreat. Results. Patients who maintained or improved safer sexual behaviors were compared with those who relapsed or did not improve. Logistic regression analyses found that improvement and maintenance of safer sexual behavior were significantly associated with perceived peer support for outercourse (odds ratio [OR]: 5.47; confidence interval [CI]: 1.4–20.8), perceived peer support for abstinence (OR: 5.08; CI: 1.2–20.1), and decreased general emotional distress (OR: 4.65; CI: 1.04–20.6). Perceived health status and previous sexual behavior were unrelated to change in safer sexual behavior. Conclusions. These longitudinal data indicate that improvement and maintenance of safer sexual behavior among adolescents during an intervention is strongly associated with perceptions of peer support for safer sex and lesser degrees of emotional distress.

The aim of this review is to explore available published literature relating to the efficacy, barriers and facilitators of digital technologies in enhancing emotion/mood regulation skills. Methods A review of the literature was performed to explore the effectiveness of digital technology in enhancing ER skills. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 31st August 2020. In addition, the first 10 pages of Google Scholar were examined for relevant articles. The following MeSH term and key words were used to identify relevant articles: “emotion regulation OR mood regulation” AND “intervention OR treatment OR program$ OR therap$” AND “digital technologies OR web-based OR mobile application OR App.” Reference lists of retrieved papers were hand searched to identify additional publications. Findings were summarized narratively. Results Titles and abstracts were reviewed by one reviewer in two phases, and confirmed by a second reviewer; discrepancies were resolved through discussion. First, the retrieved titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify relevant studies. Full texts of retrieved studies were then read to determine eligibility. The search resulted in 209 studies of which 191 citations were identified as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. After reviewing the title and abstract of the 191 papers, 33 studies were identified as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. Following full-text review, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicated the potential effectiveness of online, text-messaging, and smartphone interventions for enhancing ER skills. Conclusion There is encouraging evidence that digital technologies may be beneficial for enhancing ER skills and providing personalized care remotely. Digital technologies, particularly the use of smartphones, were instrumental in facilitating assessments and delivering online self-help interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy.

2151,bc1cc2575bfd787e8e579fd3b6da31c25eefee19,A Digital Coach to Promote Emotion Regulation Skills,"There is growing awareness that effective emotion regulation is critical for health, adjustment and wellbeing. Emerging evidence suggests that interventions that promote flexible emotion regulation may have the potential to reduce the incidence and prevalence of mental health problems in specific at-risk populations. The challenge is how best to engage with at risk populations, who may not be actively seeking assistance, to deliver this early intervention approach. One possible solution is via digital technology and development, which has rapidly accelerated in this space. Such rapid growth has, however, occurred at the expense of developing a deep understanding of key elements of successful program design and specific mechanisms that influence health behavior change. This paper presents a detailed description of the design, development and evaluation of an emotion regulation intervention conversational agent (ERICA) who acts as a digital coach. ERICA uses interactive conversation to encourage self-reflection and to support and empower users to learn a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies including Refocusing, Reappraisal, Planning and Putting into Perspective. A pilot evaluation of ERICA was conducted with 138 university students and confirmed that ERICA provided a feasible and highly usable method for delivering an emotion regulation intervention. The results also indicated that ERICA was able to develop a therapeutic relationship with participants and increase their intent to use a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies. These findings suggest that ERICA holds potential to be an effective approach for delivering an early intervention to support mental health and wellbeing. ERICA’s dialogue, embedded with interactivity, therapeutic alliance and empathy cues, provide the basis for the development of other psychoeducation interventions.",2023.0,64.0,1.0,"{'name': 'Multimodal Technol.

The relation of the alliance and treatment outcome was investigated using a three-level meta-analysis with random-effects restricted maximum-likelihood estimators. The overall alliance–outcome association for face-to-face psychotherapy was r = .278 (95% confidence intervals [.256, .299], p < .0001; equivalent of d = .579). There was heterogeneity among the effect sizes, and 2% of the 295 effect sizes indicated negative correlations. The correlation for Internet-based psychotherapy was approximately the same (viz., r = .275, k = 23). These results confirm the robustness of the positive relation between the alliance and outcome.

Although previous studies have confirmed that this illusion disappears when the rubber hand was touched asynchronously with the subject's hand, the minimum temporal discrepancy of these two events for attenuation of RHI has not been examined. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, various temporal discrepancies between visual and tactile stimulations were introduced by using a visual feedback delay experimental setup, and RHI effects in each temporal discrepancy condition were systematically tested. The results showed that subjects felt significantly greater RHI effects with temporal discrepancies of less than 300 ms compared with longer temporal discrepancies. The RHI effects on reaching performance (proprioceptive drift) showed similar conditional differences. Conclusions/Significance Our results first demonstrated that a temporal discrepancy of less than 300 ms between visual stimulation of the rubber hand and tactile stimulation to the subject's own hand is preferable to induce strong sensation of RHI. We suggest that the time window of less than 300 ms is critical for multi-sensory integration processes constituting the self-body image.",2009.0,15.0,257.0,"{'volume': '4', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shimada2009RubberHI,\n author = {Sotaro Shimada and Kensuke Fukuda and K.

During the last years a multidisciplinary research team comprised of engineers, psychologists, physiotherapists and paediatricians have been testing these technologies. Throughout the tests, physiological (cardiovascular and metabolic response with biomedical sensors (smart fabrics TIAS) and psychological responses have been collected. The results presented in this paper reflect two main aspects: 1) the feasibility of the monitoring techniques employed and 2) the validity of virtual reality and exergaming technologies as promoters of physical activity and their potential as tools in clinical intervention programs. In the first study (n=90) children, a commercial platform was tested as support tool to aerobic exercise in a treadmill. Results showed a more physiological effort by obese group and limitations to measure effort perception with Borg scale especially in obese group. In second study (n=126) a new VR platform was developed (VREP) and tested as support of aerobic activities, a difference of first study, all the boys completed both conditions (same Aerobic exercise with/without support VR). 59.5% felt that they had to exert more effort in the traditional condition. Regarding to acceptability in both studies the vast majority of the participants liked the idea of combining physical activity with the VR platform as a form of treatment to increase physical activity. The capacity of VR technology to create controllable, multisensory, interactive 3D stimulus environments within which children's performance can be motivated, recorded, and measured, has been tested in these studies, offering clinical assessment and intervention options which are not possible using traditional methods.",2013.0,72.0,11.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '1199-1218', 'name': 'J.

Its fidelity depends in part on the extent to which the VR environment provides a convincing simulation, for example whether a putatively stressful VR situation actually produces a stress response. Methods: We studied the stress response in 28 healthy men exposed either to a stressor VR elevator (which simulated travelling up the outside of a tall building and culminated in the participant being asked to step off the elevator platform), or to a control elevator. We measured psychological and physiological (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase, blood pressure, pulse, skin conductance) stress indices. We also measured subsequent performance on the N-back task because acute stress has been reported to impact on working memory. Results: Compared to participants in the control elevator, those in the external elevator had increases in skin conductance, pulse and subjective stress and anxiety ratings, altered heart rate variability, and a delayed rise in cortisol. N-back performance was unaffected. Conclusions: A putatively stressful VR elevator produces a physiological as well as a psychological stress response, supporting its use in the investigation and treatment of stress-related disorders, and its potential value as an experimental laboratory stressor.",2019.0,53.0,62.0,"{'volume': '33', 'pages': '1264 - 1273', 'name': 'Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Martens2019ItFR,\n author = {M.

These age-related behaviors may have biological roots embedded in the evolutionary past, with similar adolescent-typical characteristics evident across a variety of mammalian species. Drawing across human behavioral and fMRI data and studies conducting in laboratory animals, this review examines processing of rewards, aversions, and affect in adolescence. Evidence for both hyper-and hypo-reactivity during adolescence in the processing of rewards is reviewed, along with possible contributors to these differences. Indications of sometimes heightened reward reactivity during adolescence are contrasted with frequent attenuations in adolescent sensitivity to aversive stimuli. At the same time, adolescents appear particularly prone to becoming emotionally aroused, especially in social contexts. Emerging evidence hints that exaggerated adolescent reactivity in reward and affective systems may be promoted in part by unusual strong cross-reactivity between these systems during adolescence. Such age-related propensities may promote adolescent risk taking, especially in social and exciting contexts, and contribute to adolescent-typical propensities to attach greater benefit and less cost to risky behaviors such as alcohol and drug use than individuals at other ages.",,176.0,236.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n author = {Linda Patia Spear},\n title = {Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Review Rewards, Aversions and Affect in Adolescence: Emerging Convergences across Laboratory Animal and Human Data}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2263079761', 'name': 'Linda Patia Spear'}]"

In this vein, we provide a concrete solution that personalizes game maps in a top-down action-shooter game to suit an individual player's preferences. The need for personalized PCG is steadily growing as the player market diversifies, making it more difficult to design a game that will accommodate a broad range of preferences and skills. In the solution presented here, the geometry of the map and the density of content within that geometry are represented and generated in distinct evolutionary processes, with the player's preferences being captured and utilized through a combination of interactive evolution and a player model formulated as a recommender system. All these components were implemented into a test bed game and experimented on through an unsupervised public experiment. The solution is examined against a plausible random baseline that is comparable to random map generators that have been implemented by independent game developers. Results indicate that the system as a whole is receiving better ratings, that the geometry and content evolutionary processes are exploring more of the solution space, and that the mean prediction accuracy of the player preference models is equivalent to that of existing recommender system literature. Furthermore, we discuss how each of the individual solutions can be used with other game genres and content types.",2015.0,57.0,15.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '139-155', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Raffe2015IntegratedAT,\n author = {W.

Recently, advanced virtual reality setups were developed to induce a virtual hand illusion (VHI). Here, we present functional imaging data from a sample of 25 healthy participants using a new device to induce the VHI in the environment of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. In order to evaluate the neuronal robustness of the illusion, we varied the degree of synchrony between visual and tactile events in five steps: in two conditions, the tactile stimulation was applied prior to visual stimulation (asynchrony of −300 ms or −600 ms), whereas in another two conditions, the tactile stimulation was applied after visual stimulation (asynchrony of +300 ms or +600 ms). In the fifth condition, tactile and visual stimulation was applied synchronously. On a subjective level, the VHI was successfully induced by synchronous visuotactile stimulation. Asynchronies between visual and tactile input of ±300 ms did not significantly diminish the vividness of illusion, whereas asynchronies of ±600 ms did. The temporal order of visual and tactile stimulation had no effect on VHI vividness. Conjunction analyses of functional MRI data across all conditions revealed significant activation in bilateral ventral premotor cortex (PMv). Further characteristic activation patterns included bilateral activity in the motion-sensitive medial superior temporal area as well as in the bilateral Rolandic operculum, suggesting their involvement in the processing of bodily awareness through the integration of visual and tactile events. A comparison of the VHI-inducing conditions with asynchronous control conditions of ±600 ms yielded significant PMv activity only contralateral to the stimulation site. These results underline the temporal limits of the induction of limb ownership related to multisensory body-related input.",2014.0,65.0,74.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bekrater-Bodmann2014TheIO,\n author = {R.

 Flow is a mental state characterized by deep absorption during challenging activities, which was first studied by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. One of the defining characteristics of this state is the loss of the sense of time. Despite the widespread scientific interest in flow, there are few quantitative studies specifically on the aspect of time perception. The present study focuses on the relation between time perception and flow states in the context of video game play. Participants (n = 100) played the rhythm game Thumper for 25 minutes in one of two conditions: in virtual reality (VR) or on a computer screen (2D). Participants who played the game in VR performed better and had a stronger feeling of presence than those who played in 2D. Thumper was flow-inducing regardless of condition and the more flow participants experienced the less they thought about time and the faster time passed subjectively. The total score obtained by players as an objective measure of player performance was positively correlated with flow states, indicating that the more flow participants experienced, the better they played.",2021.0,70.0,22.0,{'name': 'Timing & Time Perception'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Rutrecht2021TimeSU,\n author = {H.

In this paper we show the credibility of three premises that make the case that providing touch capability to social robots will increase their effectiveness in communicating emotions, building trust and achieving behavioral changes. The first premise is that humans can communicate distinct emotions through touch only, the second is that this is also possible through mediated (virtual) touch, and the third is that social agents can use the same mediated touch technology as effectively as humans. Based on a literature review, we also formulate ten design rules as guidance for the development of social agents that can touch.

With effective application in therapy for a range of mental health issues, the spread of CBT methods to Web-based therapy sources is evident. The development of mobile phone apps using CBT principles is increasing within the research area. Despite the move to Web-based methods of therapy, it is argued that these methods lack the same efficacy of face-to-face therapy sessions. Objective The aim of this review was to assess extent research findings with regard to the effectiveness of CBT-related mobile health (mHealth) apps. By assessing only studies employing a randomized controlled trial design, the review aimed to determine app efficacy within the highly regarded method of investigation. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several databases. Search results were filtered, and results were subject to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria because of the nature of the review. Where possible, analysis of effect size was calculated and results reported. Results A total of 8 studies investigating the effectiveness of mHealth CBT-related apps across a range of mental health issues were reviewed. Three studies used the app against a control group, and 5 studies used the app intervention against another form of treatment or intervention. A range of effect sizes were seen across all included studies (d=−0.13 to 1.83; 0.03-1.44), with the largest effects often being seen when comparing the data from pre- to posttest for the app engaged group. Conclusions The studies reviewed support the use of mHealth apps containing CBT principles for a range of mental health issues. However, the effectiveness over longer time periods should be assessed. Researchers and professionals should seek to collaborate effectively when creating new apps to enhance their effectiveness as a treatment for the general public.",2017.0,51.0,107.0,"{'volume': '19', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rathbone2017AssessingTE,\n author = {A.

Yet, there remains a stunning lack of convenient tools for promoting long-term and effective meditation practice. In this paper, we present MindfulWatch, a practical smartwatch-based sensing system that monitors respiration in real-time during meditation -- offering essential biosignals that can potentially be used to empower various future applications such as tracking changes in breathing pattern, offering real-time guidance, and providing an accurate bio-marker for meditation research. To this end, MindfulWatch is designed to be convenient for everyday use with no training required. Operating solely on a smartwatch, MindfulWatch can immediately reach the growing population of smartwatch users, making it ideal for longitudinal data collection for meditation studies. Specifically, it utilizes motion sensors to sense the subtle “micro” wrist rotation (0.01 rad/s) induced by respiration. To accurately capture breathing, we developed a novel self-adaptive model that tracks changes in both breathing pattern and meditation posture over time. MindfulWatch was evaluated based on data from 36 real-world meditation sessions (8.7 hours, 11 subjects). The results suggest that MindfulWatch offers reliable real-time respiratory timing measurement (70% errors under 0.5 seconds).",2017.0,49.0,33.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '57:1-57:19', 'name': 'Proc.

The fundamental idea of immersive journalism is to allow the participant, typically represented as a digital avatar, to actually enter a virtually recreated scenario representing the news story. The sense of presence obtained through an immersive system (whether a Cave or head-tracked head-mounted displays [HMD] and online virtual worlds, such as video games and online virtual worlds) affords the participant unprecedented access to the sights and sounds, and possibly feelings and emotions, that accompany the news. This paper surveys current approaches to immersive journalism and the theoretical background supporting claims regarding avatar experience in immersive systems. We also provide a specific demonstration: giving participants the experience of being in an interrogation room in an offshore prison.

It is unlikely, however, that the diversity of environmental influences associated with schizophrenia can be linked to as many different underlying mechanisms. There is evidence that environmental exposures may induce, in interaction with (epi)genetic factors, psychological or physiological alterations that can be traced to a final common pathway of cognitive biases and/or altered dopamine neurotransmission, broadly referred to as ""sensitization,"" facilitating the onset and persistence of psychotic symptoms. At the population level, the behavioral phenotype for sensitization may be examined by quantifying, in populations exposed to environmental risk factors associated with stress or dopamine-agonist drugs, (1) the increased rate of persistence (indicating lasting sensitization) of normally transient developmental expressions of subclinical psychotic experiences and (2) the subsequent increased rate of transition to clinical psychotic disorder.",2007.0,66.0,274.0,"{'volume': '34 2', 'pages': '\n          220-5\n        ', 'name': 'Schizophrenia bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Collip2007DoesTC,\n author = {D.

According to one proponent of this view, when we reason about probability we fall victim to “inevitable illusions” (Piattelli-Palmarini 1994). Other proponents maintain that the human mind is prone to “systematic deviations from rationality” (Bazerman & Neale 1986) and is “not built to work by the rules of probability” (Gould 1992). It has even been suggested that human beings are “a species that is uniformly probability-blind” (Piattelli-Palmarini 1994). This provocative and pessimistic interpretation of the experimental findings has been challenged from many different directions over the years. One of the most recent and energetic of these challenges has come from the newly emerging field of evolutionary psychology, where it has been argued that it’s singularly implausible to claim that our species would have evolved with no “instinct for probability” and, hence, be “blind to chance” (Pinker 1997, 351). Though evolutionary psychologists concede that it is possible to design experiments that “trick our probability",2002.0,58.0,129.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Samuels2002EndingTR,\n author = {R.

2184,bef40c4e1347f940e8f3d420e24d9a070863e8d9,Measuring inconsistency in meta-analyses,"Cochrane Reviews have recently started including the quantity I 2 to help readers assess the consistency of the results of studies in meta-analyses. What does this new quantity mean, and why is assessment of heterogeneity so important to clinical practice? 

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses can provide convincing and reliable evidence relevant to many aspects of medicine and health care.1 Their value is especially clear when the results of the studies they include show clinically important effects of similar magnitude. However, the conclusions are less clear when the included studies have differing results. In an attempt to establish whether studies are consistent, reports of meta-analyses commonly present a statistical test of heterogeneity. The test seeks to determine whether there are genuine differences underlying the results of the studies (heterogeneity), or whether the variation in findings is compatible with chance alone (homogeneity). However, the test is susceptible to the number of trials included in the meta-analysis. We have developed a new quantity, I 2, which we believe gives a better measure of the consistency between trials in a meta-analysis.

Assessment of the consistency of effects across studies is an essential part of meta-analysis. Unless we know how consistent the results of studies are, we cannot determine the generalisability of the findings of the meta-analysis. Indeed, several hierarchical systems for grading evidence state that the results of studies must be consistent or homogeneous to obtain the highest grading.2–4

Tests for heterogeneity are commonly used to decide on methods for combining studies and for concluding consistency or inconsistency of findings.5 6 But what does the test achieve in practice, and how should the resulting P values be interpreted?

A test for heterogeneity examines the null hypothesis that all studies are evaluating the same effect.

Physiological indicators, including EEG (electroencephalogram), blood pressure, skin conductance, and pulse, were monitored in 180 Chinese university students (mean age: 20.72 ± 2.56 years) while they were watching bamboo videos. Before and after watching the videos, their psychological indicators, including positive and negative moods, were measured using the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. After watching the bamboo videos of different durations, all of the physiological indicators responded to the stimulation after only 1 min. The indicators showed different trends at 1, 3 and 5 min. EEG decreased and then was maintained at a stable level after 1 min, and the high β, low β, and α waves had no significant differences between 1, 3 and 5 min. Blood pressure dropped to a stable state after 3 min, and the decline was significantly different greater after 3 min than after 1 min. Skin conductance increased for 1 to 5 min, and it did not stabilize after a long time (5 min). Pulse decreased after 1 min but increased after 5 min. After watching the videos with bamboo of varying structures, the physiological and psychological indicators showed significantly different changes. Skin conductance significantly increased (mean value: 6.78%), and the amount of sweat was more effectively reduced, thereby reducing tension, when the students viewed videos of sympodial bamboo forests compared with monopodial bamboo forests. Bamboo forests with a higher canopy density (0.83–0.85) could significantly decrease α waves (mean value: 1.50 Hz), relaxing the human body. High β and low β waves showed greater decreases, with tension reduced more effectively, when bamboo forests with a low tilt ratio (< 1.5%) were viewed.

The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen’s kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from −1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen’s suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.",2012.0,14.0,9847.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '276 - 282', 'name': 'Biochemia Medica'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McHugh2012InterraterRT,\n author = {M.

2194,bfa05c294f24f889de622a3fa6377b7aac7049fb,Computer vision and pattern recognition,"This Special Issue of International Journal of Computer Mathematics (IJCM) offers a venue to present innovative approaches in computer vision and pattern recognition, which have been changing our everyday life dramatically over the last few years. Below we present the origin of this Special Issue and then give an overview of the papers included. The papers emanate from the International Workshop on Intelligent Computing in Pattern Analysis/Synthesis (IWICPAS 2006), which ran as a satellite workshop of the 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition. The former took place in Xi’an on 26–27 August 2006 and the latter in Hong Kong on 20–24 August 2006, both in P. R. China. IWICPAS brought together people from academia and industry in the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition, and most of the pattern recognition algorithms presented have been employed on vision-related applications. The IWICPAS Workshop attracted a record number of 264 paper submissions from 20 countries. From these 264 papers, 51 were accepted. The proceedings were published as a book in the LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) series of Springer-Verlag. Thereafter, out of these 51 papers, nine were selected for this Special Issue. These were then substantially extended and went through another round of reviewing. We strongly believe that it is now an ideal time to publish this Special Issue with the aforesaid selected papers. The contents will provide readers of IJCM with cutting-edge and topical information for their related research. As we look forward to the future, we envisage computer vision and pattern recognition research to significantly benefit from cognitive science and psychology, as evidenced in the paper by Oyekoya and Stentiford. This Special Issue starts with three papers on feature generation and selection. The next two papers focus on the classical segmentation problem, which is a basic task in various image processing systems. After three compression and coding related papers, the last paper deals with the interaction between the human vision system and a computerized visual information management system. We now highlight the core contributions of each of the papers. In the paper ‘BTF modelling using BRDF texels’, Filip and Haindl developed two schemes to enlarge Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) data. The two schemes perform best for spatially random BTF. In their paper ‘Combinatorial and statistical methods for part selection for object recognition’, Zhao et al. presented a statistical method for choosing image patches and then using these patches for object detection and classification.

From mood management theory, this increased intervention potential should make computer games particularly adept mood repair agents. To test this assertion, a study was conducted that varied levels of task demand (our operationalization of intervention potential) in a computer game to examine mood repair for bored and stressed individuals. Results show that increasing the amount of control an individual has over a mediated environment significantly increases that medium’s intervention potential. This increase in intervention potential results in an enhanced ability to relieve boredom and stress, but too much task demand is detrimental to mood repair.",2012.0,37.0,88.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '1339 - 1357', 'name': 'New Media & Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bowman2012TaskDA,\n author = {N.

However, until recently, the impact of emotion regulation difficulties for adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received little attention. We investigated emotion regulation difficulties from the perspective of those who would experience the sequelae. This included parents, teachers, and psychologists. Method Seven focus groups with parents, teachers, and psychologists, and 7 interviews with adolescents and young adults with ASD were conducted. Results Across the groups, participants discussed their triggers of distressing emotions, difficulties with emotional awareness, emotion regulation strategies, and the consequences of their distressing emotions. Both depression and anxiety were perceived as the most experienced distressing issues with the greatest consequences. Conclusions The implications of the themes revealed in the interviews and focus groups are discussed in light in previous literature and may help to inform future interventions.",2017.0,59.0,15.0,"{'volume': '42', 'pages': '275 - 284', 'name': 'Journal of Intellectual & Developmental Disability'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Santomauro2017InvestigationsIE,\n author = {D.

Toward that end, the first section of the paper outlines a model of the processes and neural systems involved in emotion generation and regulation. The second section surveys recent research supporting and elaborating the model, focusing primarily on studies of the most commonly investigated strategy, which is known as reappraisal. At its core, the model specifies how prefrontal and cingulate control systems modulate activity in perceptual, semantic, and affect systems as a function of one's regulatory goals, tactics, and the nature of the stimuli and emotions being regulated. This section also shows how the model can be generalized to understand the brain mechanisms underlying other emotion regulation strategies as well as a range of other allied phenomena.

In the present study, two meta-analyses examined the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety. The first meta-analysis tested whether virtual reality exposure therapy reduces social anxiety more than a waitlist control condition. The results of the first meta-analysis, consisting of six studies and 233 participants, showed a significant overall effect size, indicating that virtual reality exposure therapy was effective in reducing social anxiety. The second meta-analysis tested whether the standard treatment for social anxiety, which includes in vivo or imaginal exposure, leads to greater effects than virtual reality exposure therapy. The second meta-analysis, consisting of seven studies and 340 total participants, showed essentially no difference in effect sizes between virtual reality exposure and in vivo or imaginal exposure.

In the United States, the prevalence rate in Asian immigrants is high (26%-70%), with Southeast Asian men having the highest rate. Acculturation has been associated with smoking behavior in this ethnic group. Objective: The purposes of this meta-analysis are to describe the extent to which acculturation affects smoking behavior in Asian immigrants and to compare the direction and magnitude of the effect between subgroups by gender and age. Methods: Databases within PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO were searched. Twenty-one studies published in English or Korean from 1994 through 2005 met criteria, and 9 of these studies contained sufficient data. Among the 9 studies, 3 presented gender-specific data; thus, these studies were entered separately for men and women, making a total of 12 entries for final analysis. The odds ratio was used as an effect size statistic. The values of odds ratios were calculated from the data in the studies. Results: The average effect size for men was 0.53 (95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.99), indicating that acculturated men are 53% less likely to smoke than nonacculturated or ""traditional"" men. The average effect size for women was 5.26 (2.75-10.05), suggesting that acculturated women are 5 times more likely to smoke than traditional women. In adolescents, the average effect size was 1.92 (1.22-3.01), indicating that acculturated adolescents are almost 2 times more likely to smoke than traditional adolescents. Conclusions: Acculturation may have a protective effect on smoking behavior in Asian men and a harmful effect in Asian women and adolescents. The magnitude of effect is larger in women and adolescents than in men. Smoking cessation programs should target acculturated women, adolescents, and traditional men.",2008.0,29.0,86.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '67-73', 'name': 'The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Choi2008EffectsOA,\n author = {Sarah E.

2203,c0292ef46a4bed4f8146a654983683a206295f1d,Photorealistic avatars to enhance the efficacy of Selfattachment psychotherapy,"We have designed, developed, and tested an Immersive virtual reality (VR) platform to practice the protocols of Self-attachment psychotherapy. We made use of customized photorealistic avatars for the implementation of both the high-end version (based on Facebook’s Oculus) and the low-end version (based on Google’s cardboard) of our platform. Under the Selfattachment therapeutic framework, the causes of mental disorders such as chronic anxiety and depression are traced back to the individual’s insecure attachment with their primary caregiver during childhood and their subsequent problems in affect regulation. The conventional approach (without VR) to Selfattachment requires that the individual uses their childhood photographs to recall their childhood memories and then imagine that the child that they were is present with them. They thus establish a compassionate relationship with their childhood self and then, using love songs and dancing, create an affectional bond with them. Their adult self subsequently role plays a good parent and interacts with their imagined childhood self to perform various developmental and re-parenting activities. The goal is to enhance their capacities for self-regulation of emotion, which can lead them into earning secure attachment. It is hypothesized that our immersive virtual reality platform – which enables the users to interact with their customized 3D photorealistic childhood avatar - offers either a better alternative or at least a complementary visual tool to the conventional imaginal approach to Self-attachment. The platform was developed in Unity 3D, a cross-platform game engine, and takes advantage of the itSeez3D Avatar SDK for generating a customized photorealistic 3D avatar head from a 2D childhood image of the user. The platform also offers facial and body animations for some of the basic emotional states such as Happy, Sad, Scared and Joyful and it allows modifications to the avatar body (height/ width) and clothing color. A study to compare the use of the avatar-based approach (VR) to Self-attachment with the conventional photo-based approach showed promising results. Almost 85% of the participants reported that their photorealistic childhood avatar in VR was more relatable than their childhood photos. Both low-end and high-end VR based approaches were unanimously reported to be more effective than the conventional imaginal approach. Participants reported that the high-end version of the VR platform was more realistic and immersive than the low-end mobile VR version.",2020.0,42.0,2.0,"{'pages': '60-67', 'name': '2020 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality (AIVR)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ghaznavi2020PhotorealisticAT,\n author = {I.

Here we argue that immersive virtual reality is especially interesting for the study of how people respond to violent incidents where a perpetrator attacks a victim. We are interested in the circumstances under which bystanders are likely to intervene in order to prevent harm to the victim. Immersive virtual reality provides an ecologically valid setting in which to study this issue while at the same time removing the problem of physical danger, and overcoming the many ethical issues involved in the study of violence. In the rest of this paper we fi rst briefl y review some of the literature relating to responses to violence in desktop based systems such as video games, before going on to describe what we mean by immersive virtual reality, and how this is profoundly different with respect to engaging people in realistic responses to virtual situations. Next we review one experiment where participants infl ict violence on virtual characters in immersive virtual reality, a reprise of the Stanley Milgram obedience experiments. Next we apply these ideas to new research that is using virtual reality to study bystander responses to violent incidents, and we describe some qualitative results from ongoing pilot studies. Finally we discuss recommendations for the use of virtual reality in the study of violence.

In response to this, mental health apps (MHapps) are becoming available for monitoring, managing, and promoting positive mental health and well-being. Thus far, evidence supports favorable outcomes when users engage with MHapps, yet there is a relative paucity of reviews on apps that support positive mental health and well-being. Objective We aimed to systematically review the available research on MHapps that promote emotion regulation, positive mental health, and well-being in the general population aged 18-45 years. More specifically, the review aimed at providing a systematic description of the theoretical background and features of MHapps while evaluating any potential effectiveness. Methods A comprehensive literature search of key databases, including MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), was performed until January 2021. Studies were included if they described standalone mental health and well-being apps for adults without a formal mental health diagnosis. The quality of all studies was assessed against the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. In addition, the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool (RoB-2) was used to assess randomized control trials (RCTs). Data were extracted using a modified extraction form from the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were then undertaken to address the review aims. Results In total, 3156 abstracts were identified. Of these, 52 publications describing 48 MHapps met the inclusion criteria. Together, the studies evaluated interventions across 15 countries. Thirty-nine RCTs were identified suggesting some support for the role of individual MHapps in improving and promoting mental health and well-being. Regarding the pooled effect, MHapps, when compared to controls, showed a small effect for reducing mental health symptoms (k=19, Hedges g=–0.24, 95% CI –0.34 to –0.14; P<.001) and improving well-being (k=13, g=0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.29, P=.004), and a medium effect for emotion regulation (k=6, g=0.49, 95% CI 0.23-0.74, P<.001). There is also a wide knowledge base of creative and innovative ways to engage users in techniques such as mood monitoring and guided exercises. Studies were generally assessed to contribute unclear or a high risk of bias, or to be of medium to low methodological quality. Conclusions The emerging evidence for MHapps that promote positive mental health and well-being suggests promising outcomes. Despite a wide range of MHapps, few apps specifically promote emotion regulation. However, our findings may position emotion regulation as an important mechanism for inclusion in future MHapps. A fair proportion of the included studies were pilot or feasibility trials (k=17, 33%), and full-scale RCTs reported high attrition rates and nondiverse samples. Given the number and pace at which MHapps are being released, further robust research is warranted to inform the development and testing of evidence-based programs.",2021.0,115.0,41.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'JMIR Mental Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Eisenstadt2021MobileAT,\n author = {M.

While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations.

We develop a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes.

Frustration, confusion, anger, anxiety and similar emotional states can affect not only the interaction itself, but also productivity, learning, social relationships, and overall well-being. This paper suggests a new solution to this problem: designing human-computer interaction systems to actively support users in their ability to manage and recover from negative emotional states. An interactive affect-support agent was designed and built to test the proposed solution in a situation where users were feeling frustration. The agent’s text-only interaction used components of active listening, empathy, and sympathy, in an effort to support users in their ability to recover from frustration. The agent’s effectiveness was evaluated against two control conditions, which were also text-based interactions: (1) users’ emotions were ignored, and (2) users were able to report problems and “vent” their feelings and thoughts to the computer. Behavioral results showed that users chose to continue to interact with the system that had caused their frustration significantly longer after interacting with the affect-supporting agent, in comparison with the two controls. These results support the prediction that the computer can undo some of the negative feelings it causes by helping a user manage his or her emotional state. Implications of this solution are discussed, including possibilities for misuse or abuse, as well as potentially strong benefits when the approach is used correctly.",2002.0,52.0,78.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Klein2002ThisCR,\n author = {Jonathan Klein and Youngme Moon and Rosalind W.

Using a community sample of adolescents (N = 177, M = 13.6 years), groups based on five measures of ER (reappraisal, suppression, concealing, emotional engagement, and adjusting) were created through latent profile analysis. A six-group model was the best fit. As hypothesized, ER profiles with high scores on one or two indicators were associated with higher levels of internalizing problems, whereas profiles with average to high scores on several indicators and high scores on adjusting were associated with lower levels of internalizing problems (depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety).

Different things will disgust different people, depending on individual sensibilities or cultural backgrounds. In Yuck!, Daniel Kelly investigates the character and evolution of disgust, with an emphasis on understanding the role this emotion has come to play in our social and moral lives. Disgust has recently been riding a swell of scholarly attention, especially from those in the cognitive sciences and those in the humanities in the midst of the ""affective turn."" Kelly proposes a cognitive model that can accommodate what we now know about disgust. He offers a new account of the evolution of disgust that builds on the model and argues that expressions of disgust are part of a sophisticated but largely automatic signaling system that humans use to transmit information about what to avoid in the local environment. He shows that many of the puzzling features of moral repugnance tinged with disgust are by-products of the imperfect fit between a cognitive system that evolved to protect against poisons and parasites and the social and moral issues on which it has been brought to bear. Kelly's account of this emotion provides a powerful argument against invoking disgust in the service of moral justification.",2011.0,0.0,215.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kelly2011YuckTN,\n author = {Daniel Kelly},\n title = {Yuck!: The Nature and Moral Significance of Disgust},\n year = {2011}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '144128311', 'name': 'Daniel Kelly'}]"

Patients and methods An Internet-based program was used to teach adaptive ways to cope with depressive symptoms and daily problems. A total of 124 participants who were experiencing at least one stressful event that caused interference in their lives, many of whom had clinically significant depressive symptoms, were randomly assigned into either an intervention group with ICT support (automated mobile phone messages, automated emails, and continued feedback through the program); an intervention group with ICT support plus human support (brief weekly support phone call without clinical content); or a waiting-list control. At pre-, post-, and 12-month follow-up, they completed depression, anxiety, positive and negative effect, and perceived stress measures. Results were analyzed using both intention-to-treat and completers data. The majority were women (67.7%), with a mean age of 35.6 years (standard deviation =9.7). Results The analysis showed that the two intervention groups improved significantly pre- to posttreatment, compared with the control group. Furthermore, improvements were maintained at the 12-month follow-up. Adherence and satisfaction with the program was high in both conditions. Conclusion The Internet-based program was effective and well accepted, with and without human support, showing that ICT-based automated support may be useful.

Interactive narrative allows the user to participate in a dynamically unfolding story, by playing a character or by exerting directorial control. By allowing the user to interact, interactive narrative provides a richer and potentially more engaging experience than traditional narrative. Moreover, because different choices of the user lead to different paths through the story, the author of interactive narrative can tailor the experience for the user or user groups. 
The design of interactive narrative faces many challenges. The central challenge comes from the integration of interactivity into the narrative. Instead of presenting one well-crafted static story, the author has to design the characters' behaviors along many paths through the story in response to possible user interactions. The amount of work can easily overwhelm an author. 
In this thesis, I present a multi-agent approach to modeling and simulating interactive narrative, implemented as the Thespian framework. Thespian utilizes a two-layer runtime system to drive the characters' interactions with the user. At the base is a multi-agent system comprised of goal-oriented autonomous agents that realize the characters in the story. Above this layer is a proactive director agent that continuously monitors the progress of the story and directs the characters toward the author's plot design goals. In addition to the two-layer runtime system, Thespian contains offline authoring procedures to facilitate the author in configuring the characters. 
The evaluation of the Thespian framework has been performed at different levels. Various components within Thespian have been individually evaluated or validated. In addition, Thespian's generality in practice for authoring a range of stories has been demonstrated through its many applications in different domains.",2010.0,0.0,11.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Marsella2010ThespianAD,\n author = {S.

Fifty-three individuals diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 53 never-depressed controls participated in a seven-day experience sampling study. Participants were prompted randomly eight times per day and answered questions about their physical activity and affective state. Over the week, the two groups of participants did not differ in average level of physical activity. As expected, participants with MDD reported lower average PA and higher average NA than did never-depressed controls. Both participants with MDD and controls reported higher levels of PA at prompts after physical activity than at prompts after inactive periods; moreover, for both groups of participants, PA increased from a prompt after an inactive period to a subsequent prompt at which activity was reported. Depressed participants in particular showed a dose-response effect of physical activity on affect: longer duration and/or higher intensity of physical activity increased their PA significantly more than did short duration and/or lower intensity physical activity. Physical activity did not influence NA in either group. In contrast to previous treatment studies that examined the effects of prescribed structured exercise, this investigation showed that self-initiated physical activity influences PA.

The studies described use electrophysiological procedures to make inferences about patterns of regional cortical activation. Such procedures have sufficient temporal resolution to be used in the study of brief emotional experiences denoted by spontaneous facial expressions. In adults and infants, the experimental arousal of positive, approach-related emotions is associated with selective activation of the left frontal region, while arousal of negative, withdrawal-related emotions is associated with selective activation of the right frontal region. Individual differences in baseline measures of frontal asymmetry are associated with dispositional mood, affective reactivity, temperament, and immune function. These studies suggest that neural systems mediating approach- and withdrawal-related emotion and action are, in part, represented in the left and right frontal regions, respectively, and that individual differences in the activation levels of these systems are associated with a coherent nomological network of associations which constitute a person's affective style.",1992.0,45.0,730.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '39 - 43', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Davidson1992EmotionAA,\n author = {R.

The authors examine the current literature using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Three key findings emerge. First, emotion dysregulation is prevalent in ADHD throughout the lifespan and is a major contributor to impairment. Second, emotion dysregulation in ADHD may arise from deficits in orienting toward, recognizing, and/or allocating attention to emotional stimuli; these deficits implicate dysfunction within a striato-amygdalo-medial prefrontal cortical network. Third, while current treatments for ADHD often also ameliorate emotion dysregulation, a focus on this combination of symptoms reframes clinical questions and could stimulate novel therapeutic approaches. The authors then consider three models to explain the overlap between emotion dysregulation and ADHD: emotion dysregulation and ADHD are correlated but distinct dimensions; emotion dysregulation is a core diagnostic feature of ADHD; and the combination constitutes a nosological entity distinct from both ADHD and emotion dysregulation alone. The differing predictions from each model can guide research on the much-neglected population of patients with ADHD and emotion dysregulation.",2014.0,152.0,771.0,"{'volume': '171 3', 'pages': '\n          276-93\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shaw2014EmotionDI,\n author = {P.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT®) is the most effective treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder, but demand for DBT® far exceeds existing clinical resources. Most patients with BPD never receive DBT®. Incorporating computer technology into the DBT® could help increase dissemination. Immersive Virtual Reality technology (VR) is becoming widely available to mainstream consumers. This case study explored the feasibility/clinical potential of using immersive virtual reality technology to enhance DBT® mindfulness skills training of a 32 year old female diagnosed with BPD. Prior to using VR, the patient experienced difficulty practicing DBT® mindfulness due to her emotional reactivity, and difficulty concentrating. To help the patient focus her attention, and to facilitate DBT® mindfulness skills learning, the patient looked into virtual reality goggles, and had the illusion of slowly “floating down” a 3D computer-generated river while listening to DBT® mindfulness training audios. Urges to commit suicide, urges to self harm, urges to quit therapy, urges to use substances, and negative emotions were all reduced after each VR mindfulness session and VR mindfulness was well accepted/liked by the patient. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, results from this feasibility study were encouraging. Future controlled studies are needed to quantify whether VR-enhanced mindfulness training has long term benefits e.g., increasing patient acceptance and/or improving therapeutic outcome. Computerizing some of the DBT® skills treatment modules would reduce cost and increase dissemination.",2016.0,55.0,82.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nararro-Haro2016TheUO,\n author = {Maria V.

We administered control and predictor measures when the children were 5 years old and obtained criterion data at age 9. After controlling for verbal ability and temperament, our index of emotion knowledge predicted aggregate indices of positive and negative social behavior and academic competence. Path analysis showed that emotion knowledge mediated the effect of verbal ability on academic competence.

Although developer-led studies have published results on the use of mental health apps in real-world settings, no study yet has systematically examined usage patterns of a large sample of mental health apps relying on independently collected data. Objective Our aim is to present real-world objective data on user engagement with popular mental health apps. Methods A systematic engine search was conducted using Google Play to identify Android apps with 10,000 installs or more targeting anxiety, depression, or emotional well-being. Coding of apps included primary incorporated techniques and mental health focus. Behavioral data on real-world usage were obtained from a panel that provides aggregated nonpersonal information on user engagement with mobile apps. Results In total, 93 apps met the inclusion criteria (installs: median 100,000, IQR 90,000). The median percentage of daily active users (open rate) was 4.0% (IQR 4.7%) with a difference between trackers (median 6.3%, IQR 10.2%) and peer-support apps (median 17.0%) versus breathing exercise apps (median 1.6%, IQR 1.6%; all z≥3.42, all P<.001). Among active users, daily minutes of use were significantly higher for mindfulness/meditation (median 21.47, IQR 15.00) and peer support (median 35.08, n=2) apps than for apps incorporating other techniques (tracker, breathing exercise, psychoeducation: medians range 3.53-8.32; all z≥2.11, all P<.05). The medians of app 15-day and 30-day retention rates were 3.9% (IQR 10.3%) and 3.3% (IQR 6.2%), respectively. On day 30, peer support (median 8.9%, n=2), mindfulness/meditation (median 4.7%, IQR 6.2%), and tracker apps (median 6.1%, IQR 20.4%) had significantly higher retention rates than breathing exercise apps (median 0.0%, IQR 0.0%; all z≥2.18, all P≤.04). The pattern of daily use presented a descriptive peak toward the evening for apps incorporating most techniques (tracker, psychoeducation, and peer support) except mindfulness/meditation, which exhibited two peaks (morning and night). Conclusions Although the number of app installs and daily active minutes of use may seem high, only a small portion of users actually used the apps for a long period of time.

2249,c4232f268a272f4c425f2abdf5891fde2cc2292a,The Future of Emotion Regulation Research,"Emotion regulation has been conceptualized as a process by which individuals modify their emotional experiences, expressions, and physiology and the situations eliciting such emotions in order to produce appropriate responses to the ever-changing demands posed by the environment. Thus, context plays a central role in emotion regulation. This is particularly relevant to the work on emotion regulation in psychopathology, because psychological disorders are characterized by rigid responses to the environment. However, this recognition of the importance of context has appeared primarily in the theoretical realm, with the empirical work lagging behind. In this review, the author proposes an approach to systematically evaluate the contextual factors shaping emotion regulation. Such an approach consists of specifying the components that characterize emotion regulation and then systematically evaluating deviations within each of these components and their underlying dimensions. Initial guidelines for how to combine such dimensions and components in order to capture substantial and meaningful contextual influences are presented. This approach is offered to inspire theoretical and empirical work that it is hoped will result in the development of a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the relationship between context and emotion regulation.",2013.0,160.0,713.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '155 - 172', 'name': 'Perspectives on Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Aldao2013TheFO,\n author = {A.

2252,c489b6787c5af8aca97f4761343a66f3f189b35d,Emotional Expressions Reconsidered: Challenges to Inferring Emotion From Human Facial Movements,"It is commonly assumed that a person’s emotional state can be readily inferred from his or her facial movements, typically called emotional expressions or facial expressions. This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life. This research is crucial to provide consumers of emotion research with the translational information they require.",2019.0,365.0,799.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '1 - 68', 'name': 'Psychological Science in the Public Interest'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Barrett2019EmotionalER,\n author = {L.

Method: A systematic review using search terms related to ageing and ER identified 23 relevant studies. Narrative synthesis was adopted to analyse the findings. Results: Generally, greater use of situation selection and attentional deployment was identified among older adults, although these relationships were dependent on contextual/moderator variables. While older adults employed greater levels of situation modification in response to negative stimuli, there was considerable variation in age differences across specific situation modification subtypes. Available evidence pointed to an absence of age differences in the cognitive change strategy of cognitive reappraisal. The use of relatively less-cognitively demanding cognitive change subtypes (e.g. acceptance) was, under particular circumstances, greater among older adults. Findings regarding the response modulation strategy of expressive suppression were equivocal. Conclusion: Adult development is not characterised by straightforward shifts in preferences for use of different ER strategies. Moderator variables appear to be of central importance in shaping the emergence of age differences in ER.

2255,c5068b078604b53c992d9b7f94e6547a4dccac9e,Transfer Reinforcement Learning under Unobserved Contextual Information,"In this paper, we study a transfer reinforcement learning problem where the state transitions and rewards are affected by the environmental context. Specifically, we consider a demonstrator agent that has access to a context-aware policy and can generate transition and reward data based on that policy. These data constitute the experience of the demonstrator. Then, the goal is to transfer this experience, excluding the underlying contextual information, to a learner agent that does not have access to the environmental context, so that they can learn a control policy using fewer samples. It is well known that, disregarding the causal effect of the contextual information, can introduce bias in the transition and reward models estimated by the learner, resulting in a learned suboptimal policy. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a method to obtain causal bounds on the transition and reward functions using the demonstrator’s data, which we then use to obtain causal bounds on the value functions. Using these value function bounds, we propose new Q learning and UCB-Q learning algorithms that converge to the true value function without bias. We provide numerical experiments for robot motion planning problems that validate the proposed value function bounds and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively make use of the data from the demonstrator to accelerate the learning process of the learner.",2020.0,26.0,5.0,"{'pages': '75-86', 'name': '2020 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2020TransferRL,\n author = {Yan Zhang and M.

However, research still witnesses a lack of methodologies, guidelines and best practices on how to develop effective serious games and how to integrate them in the actual learning and training processes. The process of integration heavily depends on providing and spreading evidence of the effectiveness of serious games. In this paper we present an overview on the factors that make serious games effective in the perspective of maximizing the learning impact, and discuss the current efforts in evaluating such impact. Such recommendations are the result of an extensive survey of the current proposition of serious games in different application domains. Serious games (SGs), digital games with educational objectives, may be an alternative and effective way to convey new knowledge to people. Such knowledge may refer to several application areas and spans from awareness to formal education, while players/learners cover a very broad category of users, ranging from general public to pupils. Modern theories of effective learning suggest that learning is most effective when it is active, experiential, situated, problem based and provides immediate feedback (1). Games have the potential to offer learning experiences with these features but pedagogical aspects are often not taken into account when designing serious games. Moreover, there is still lack of methodologies to evaluate the learning impact and then foster a wider adoption of serious games. This paper aims to provide operative guidelines to maximize the learning impact of serious games and is based on the extensive work done within the GALA project 1 in surveying and analyzing the current proposition of serious games in different application fields, namely Business & Management (BM, at present more than 40 serious games from different sectors have been tested and evaluated, based on literature review and/or expert evaluation (single or focus group) and/or user studies involving collectively more than 400 users. For each application domain, this extensive survey has highlighted exemplary best practices about how to measure the learning impact and how to design the game as an impact project by adhering to grounded pedagogical principles from the very beginning. We provided in the following a general synthesis of the findings of the specific application areas, after introducing briefly the necessary background. The paper is organized as follows: first, a brief overview of relevant pedagogical theories is given to introduce the best practices on pedagogically-driven design of SGs. Then, the few available frameworks for SG evaluation are presented and the common ways for evaluating the learning impact are discussed,",2014.0,38.0,42.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Catalano2014BestPF,\n author = {C.

Although some evidence suggests that adopting positive strategies is beneficial for emotional well-being, the literature is inconsistent about the effects of positive emotions on subsequent regulatory processes. In the present study, we adopted a two-week ecological momentary assessment to explore the association between positive emotions and positive emotion regulation in daily life. According to our results, the less individuals felt positive emotions at one point, the more they tended to enhance their use of positive strategies from this time to the next, which in turn resulted in subsequent higher levels of positive emotions. This prototype of positive regulation can be seen as a highly adaptive mechanism that makes it possible to compensate for a lack of positive emotions by enhancing the deployment of positive strategies.

However, less is known about the current clinical evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of smartphone apps in this population. Objective To review the published literature of smartphone apps applied for the care of patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Methods An electronic database search of Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment Database, Allied and Complementary Medicine, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, PsycINFO, and Embase was conducted on May 24, 2015. All eligible studies were systematically reviewed, and proportional meta-analyses were applied to pooled data on recruitment, retention, and adherence to examine the overall feasibility of smartphone interventions for schizophrenia. Results Our search produced 226 results from which 7 eligible articles were identified, reporting on 5 studies of smartphone apps for patients with schizophrenia. All examined feasibility, and one assessed the preliminary efficacy of a smartphone intervention for schizophrenia. Study lengths varied between 6 and 130 days. Overall retention was 92% (95% CI 82-98%). Participants consistently used the smartphone apps on more than 85% of days during the study period, averaging 3.95 interactions per person per day. Furthermore, participants responded to 71.9% of automated prompts (95% CI 65.7-77.8%). Participants reported a range of potential benefits from the various interventions, and user experience was largely positive. Conclusions Although small, the current published literature demonstrates strong evidence for the feasibility of using smartphones to enhance the care of people with schizophrenia.

Characters choose their actions autonomously, while director and cinematographer agents manage the action and its presentation in order to maintain story structure, achieve pedagogical goals, and present the dynamic story to as to achieve the best dramatic effect. Artistic standards must be maintained while permitting substantial variability in story scenario. To achieve these objectives, scripted dialog is deconstructed into elements that are portrayed by agents with emotion models.

In general, the use of meta-analysis has been increasing over the last three decades with mental health as a major research topic. It is then essential to well understand its methodology and interpret its results. In this publication, we describe how to perform a meta-analysis with the freely available statistical software environment R, using a working example taken from the field of mental health. Methods R package meta is used to conduct standard meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses for missing binary outcome data and potential selection bias are conducted with R package metasens. All essential R commands are provided and clearly described to conduct and report analyses. Results The working example considers a binary outcome: we show how to conduct a fixed effect and random effects meta-analysis and subgroup analysis, produce a forest and funnel plot and to test and adjust for funnel plot asymmetry. All these steps work similar for other outcome types. Conclusions R represents a powerful and flexible tool to conduct meta-analyses.

One dimension of context that has significance for emotion regulation is the nature of the relationship between interactive partners. This review provides an organized account of existing empirical evidence assessing emotion regulation within close relationships across the life span. Specifically, the reviewed research includes studies examining parent-child relationships, sibling relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships in relation to emotion regulation. The review highlights evidence concerning how relationship processes influence emotion regulation. Based on the current state of the literature, future directions for research in this area are recommended. This review seeks to advance a more nuanced approach to the study of the social processes associated with emotion regulation. An argument is made for how building upon research concerning the relationship context as a basis for emotion regulation can further elucidate theorizing on the determinants of emotion regulation.

One of them that is becoming very popular is hand tracking, as the idea to replace controllers for interactions in virtual worlds. This experiment aims to compare different interaction types in VR using either controllers or hand tracking. Participants had to play two simple VR games with various types of tasks in those games — grabbing objects or typing numbers. While playing, they were using interactions with different visualizations of hands and controllers. The focus of this study was to investigate user experience of varying interactions (controller vs. hand tracking) for those two simple tasks. Results show that different interaction types statistically significantly influence reported emotions with Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), where for hand tracking participants were feeling higher valence, but lower arousal and dominance. Additionally, task type of grabbing was reported to be more realistic, and participants experienced a higher presence. Surprisingly, participants rated the interaction type with controllers where both where hands and controllers were visualized as statistically most preferred. Finally, hand tracking for both tasks was rated with the System Usability Scale (SUS) scale, and hand tracking for the task typing was rated as statistically significantly more usable.

Questions that were addressed include: What personality do users prefer for the robotic TV-assistant? What level of control do they prefer? How do personality and the level of control relate to each other? Four prototypes were developed by combining two personalities and two levels of user control. In the high control condition, a speech-based command-and-control interaction style was used, whereas the interaction style in the low control condition consisted of speech-based system-initiative natural language dialogue. The results demonstrated an interaction between the effects of personality and level of control on user preferences. Overall, the most preferred combination was an extravert and friendly personality with low user control. Additionally, it was found that perceived level of control was influenced by the robot's personality.

2296,c872e5c7cc8050d9be978681e6f1a021dab1902e,Neuroadaptive technology enables implicit cursor control based on medial prefrontal cortex activity,"Significance The human brain continuously and automatically processes information concerning its internal and external context. We demonstrate the elicitation and subsequent detection and decoding of such “automatic interpretations” by means of context-sensitive probes in an ongoing human–computer interaction. Through a sequence of such probe–interpretation cycles, the computer accumulates responses over time to model the operator’s cognition, even without that person being aware of it. This brings human cognition directly into the human–computer interaction loop, expanding traditional notions of “interaction.” The concept introduces neuroadaptive technology—technology which automatically adapts to an estimate of its operator’s mindset. This technology bears relevance to autoadaptive experimental designs, and opens up paradigm-shifting possibilities for human–machine systems in general. The effectiveness of today’s human–machine interaction is limited by a communication bottleneck as operators are required to translate high-level concepts into a machine-mandated sequence of instructions. In contrast, we demonstrate effective, goal-oriented control of a computer system without any form of explicit communication from the human operator. Instead, the system generated the necessary input itself, based on real-time analysis of brain activity. Specific brain responses were evoked by violating the operators’ expectations to varying degrees. The evoked brain activity demonstrated detectable differences reflecting congruency with or deviations from the operators’ expectations. Real-time analysis of this activity was used to build a user model of those expectations, thus representing the optimal (expected) state as perceived by the operator. Based on this model, which was continuously updated, the computer automatically adapted itself to the expectations of its operator. Further analyses showed this evoked activity to originate from the medial prefrontal cortex and to exhibit a linear correspondence to the degree of expectation violation. These findings extend our understanding of human predictive coding and provide evidence that the information used to generate the user model is task-specific and reflects goal congruency. This paper demonstrates a form of interaction without any explicit input by the operator, enabling computer systems to become neuroadaptive, that is, to automatically adapt to specific aspects of their operator’s mindset. Neuroadaptive technology significantly widens the communication bottleneck and has the potential to fundamentally change the way we interact with technology.",2016.0,33.0,129.0,"{'volume': '113', 'pages': '14898 - 14903', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zander2016NeuroadaptiveTE,\n author = {T.

Given questions that focused on the cognitive causes of emotions rather than their phenomenological contents, 182 subjects rated the appraisal determinants of emotion experiences that they recalled. Results suggest that appraisals of unexpectedness (not unexpected/unexpected), situational state (motive-inconsistent/motiveconsistent), motivational state (aversive/appetitive), probability (uncertain/ certain), control potential (low/high), problem source (non-characterological/characterological factors), and agency (circumstances/other person/self), differentiate a large number of widely-discussed emotions.

2300,c8de6424a39ce4497b8ff6b11e6711c7e5d8a317,Schizophrenia: a neural diathesis-stress model.,"There is a substantive literature on the behavioral effects of psychosocial stressors on schizophrenia. More recently, research has been conducted on neurohormonal indicators of stress responsivity, particularly cortisol release resulting from activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This article integrates the psychosocial and biological literatures on stress in schizophrenia, and it offers specific hypotheses about the neural mechanisms involved in the effects of stressors on the diathesis. Both the behavioral and biological data indicate that stress worsens symptoms and that the diathesis is associated with a heightened response to stressors. A neural mechanism for these phenomena is suggested by the augmenting effect of the HPA axis on dopamine (DA) synthesis and receptors. Assuming the diathesis for schizophrenia involves an abnormality in DA receptors, it is proposed that the HPA axis acts as a potentiating system by means of its effects on DA. At the same time, DA receptor abnormality and hippocampal damage render the patient hypersensitive to stress. This neural diathesis-stress model is consistent with findings on prenatal factors and brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, and it provides a framework for explaining some key features of the developmental course and clinical presentation.",1997.0,213.0,825.0,"{'volume': '104 4', 'pages': '\n          667-85\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Walker1997SchizophreniaAN,\n author = {E.

Emerging mobile health (mHealth) and eHealth interventions may afford opportunities for reaching this at-risk group. Aim: To review the evidence on using emerging mHealth and eHealth technologies among people with SMI. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science through July 2014. Only studies which reported outcomes for mHealth or eHealth interventions, defined as remotely delivered using mobile, online, or other devices, targeting people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, were included. Results: Forty-six studies spanning 12 countries were included. Interventions were grouped into four categories: (1) illness self-management and relapse prevention; (2) promoting adherence to medications and/or treatment; (3) psychoeducation, supporting recovery, and promoting health and wellness; and (4) symptom monitoring. The interventions were consistently found to be highly feasible and acceptable, though clinical outcomes were variable but offered insight regarding potential effectiveness. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the feasibility and acceptability of emerging mHealth and eHealth interventions among people with SMI; however, it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding effectiveness.

Thirty-ﬁve female students were confronted with the approach of a male stranger, and blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored. Throughout the model's approach, HR showed a signiﬁcant triphasic change (an initial decrease, a subsequent increase, and then a secondary decrease), whereas subjective feelings of anxiety and tension showed signiﬁcant, gradual increases. These trends were similar to those of Yaezawa and Yoshida’s. Nonetheless, their explanation that the triphasic change in HR reﬂected once hightened and then relieved tension, which was incongruent with the subjective ratings, seemed questionable. As the BP elevated to a moderate degree in spite of the modest HR changes, total peripheral resistance must have been increasing during the model's approach. Blood pressure elevations via this sort of hemodynamic pressor mechanisms have often been reported when a person can only tolerate passively during exposure to stress.

Objective The goal of this systematic review was to understand the ways in which personalization has been used with conversational agents in health care and characterize the methods of its implementation. Methods We searched on PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and ACM Digital Library using a predefined search strategy. The studies were included if they: (1) were primary research studies that focused on consumers, caregivers, or health care professionals; (2) involved a conversational agent with an unconstrained natural language interface; (3) tested the system with human subjects; and (4) implemented personalization features. Results The search found 1958 publications. After abstract and full-text screening, 13 studies were included in the review. Common examples of personalized content included feedback, daily health reports, alerts, warnings, and recommendations. The personalization features were implemented without a theoretical framework of customization and with limited evaluation of its impact. While conversational agents with personalization features were reported to improve user satisfaction, user engagement and dialogue quality, the role of personalization in improving health outcomes was not assessed directly. Conclusions Most of the studies in our review implemented the personalization features without theoretical or evidence-based support for them and did not leverage the recent developments in other domains of personalization. Future research could incorporate personalization as a distinct design factor with a more careful consideration of its impact on health outcomes and its implications on patient safety, privacy, and decision-making.",2019.0,73.0,148.0,"{'volume': '21', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kocaballi2019ThePO,\n author = {A.

Although the efficacy of smartphone-delivered interventions for mental health problems is emerging, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of smartphone interventions are characterized by high rates of attrition and low adherence. High attrition and low adherence may threaten the validity of RCT findings, so a better understanding of these phenomena is needed. We examined attrition and adherence in 70 RCTs of smartphone interventions.


METHOD
Four online databases were searched for RCTs of mental health interventions delivered via smartphones.


RESULTS
The mean meta-analytic study attrition rate was 24.1% (95% CI [19.3, 29.6]) at short-term follow up and 35.5% (95% CI [26.7, 45.3]) at longer-term follow up. These rates varied according to target mental health condition. Attrition rates were significantly lower in trials that delivered an acceptance-based intervention, offered participants monetary compensation, and reminded participants to engage in the intervention, and were significantly higher in trials that used an online enrollment method (relative to telephone or in-person enrollment). No participant-level baseline characteristic reliably predicted attrition. Evidence of attrition bias came from many RCTs not conducting intention-to-treat analyses. However, the mean difference in the between-groups effect size on primary outcomes in trials that reported both per protocol an intention-to-treat analyses was only Δd = 0.18. Adherence rates were also suboptimal based on our qualitative synthesis; several participants failed to download the intervention, and intervention usage consistently declined over the course of the trial.


CONCLUSION
Study attrition and low adherence are common, problematic, and may undermine the validity of findings in RCTs of smartphone-delivered interventions for mental health problems.

Patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders are not typically offered evidence-based continuing care, although research suggests that continuing care is associated with better outcomes. A smartphone-based application could provide effective continuing care.


OBJECTIVE
To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control patients.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
An unmasked randomized clinical trial involving 3 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit treatment organization in the Midwestern United States and 2 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit organization in the Northeastern United States. In total, 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment were randomized to treatment as usual (n = 179) or treatment as usual plus a smartphone (n = 170) with the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS), an application designed to improve continuing care for alcohol use disorders.


INTERVENTIONS
Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A-CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention and follow-up period lasted 8 and 4 months, respectively.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Risky drinking days--the number of days during which a patient's drinking in a 2-hour period exceeded 4 standard drinks for men and 3 standard drinks for women, with standard drink defined as one that contains roughly 14 g of pure alcohol (12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits). Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment.


RESULTS
For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow-up, patients in the A-CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than did patients in the control group, with a mean of 1.39 vs 2.75 days (mean difference, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.46-2.27; P = .003).


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
The findings suggest that a multifeatured smartphone application may have significant benefit to patients in continuing care for alcohol use disorders.

Data from 523 participants were collected in a single night. The exploratory experiment was designed as a collective computer game where players manipulated mental states of relaxation and concentration with neurofeedback targeting modulation of relative spectral power in alpha and beta frequency ranges. Besides validating robust time-of-night effects, gender differences and distinct spectral power patterns for the two mental states, our results also show differences in neurofeedback learning outcome. The unusually large sample size allowed us to detect unprecedented speed of learning changes in the power spectrum (~ 1 min). Moreover, we found that participants' baseline brain activity predicted subsequent neurofeedback beta training, indicating state-dependent learning.

Neurofeedback (NF) may reflect such an option. Aim of the present analysis was to compare the effects of slow cortical potential (SCP) NF and θ/β NF on the DP using data from a previous trial. Methods Thirty children with ADHD (aged 8–12 years) and a DP score in the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-DP) ⩾ 3 were included. NF treatment consisted of one block of SCP NF and one block of θ/β NF (18 units per block) allowing an intraindividual comparison. Effects of the NF protocols were also contrasted to a control group (n = 18) that completed an attention skills training (between-group analysis). Results Regarding the SDQ-DP, SCP NF was superior to θ/β NF and the control condition. Effects of SCP NF and θ/β NF on ADHD symptom severity were not significantly different. The SDQ-DP score did not correlate with EEG-related measures previously found to be predictors for SCP NF on ADHD symptoms. Conclusions SCP NF may reflect a more general approach to improve cognitive, emotional and behavioral self-regulation skills. If confirmed in a larger sample, the SDQ-DP score could be used as an indication criterion and contribute to the individualization of NF in ADHD. Overall, the differential effect provides further evidence for the specificity of NF effects.",2019.0,37.0,10.0,"{'volume': '50', 'pages': '258 - 263', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Heinrich2019EffectsON,\n author = {H.

Specific testable propositions of phenomenological continuity and persistence are identified. Method Propositions are tested by systematic reviews of the epidemiology of PE, persistence of PE and disorder outcomes, and meta-analyses (including Monte Carlo permutation sampling, MCPS) of reported rates and odds ratios (ORs). Results Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of PE obtained from 61 cohorts revealed a median annual incidence of 2.5% and a prevalence of 7.2%. Meta-analysis of risk factors identified age, minority or migrant status, income, education, employment, marital status, alcohol use, cannabis use, stress, urbanicity and family history of mental illness as important predictors of PE. The mode of assessment accounted for significant variance in the observed rates. Across cohorts, the probability of persistence was very strongly related to the rate of PE at baseline. Of those who report PE, ∼20% go on to experience persistent PE whereas for ∼80%, PE remit over time. Of those with baseline PE, 7.4% develop a psychotic disorder outcome. Conclusions Compelling support is found for the phenomenological and temporal continuity between PE and psychotic disorder and for the fundamental proposition that this relationship is probabilistic. However, imprecision in epidemiological research design, measurement limitations and the epiphenomenological nature of PE invite further robust scrutiny of the continuity theory.",2012.0,128.0,920.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '1133 - 1149', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Linscott2012AnUA,\n author = {R.

Several serious games have been computed to help them dealing with facial expression recognition but very few focused on facial expression production adapted to a given social context. Method: JEMImE is a new serious game which aims to help the player to learn how to produce happiness, anger and sadness in a 3D virtual environment with social situations that should be resolved by producing the correct facial expression. He is guided in the game thanks to facial expression feedback and gauges that help him evaluating the quality of his/her production in real time. The feedbacks on the children productions are timely given by a facial expression recognition algorithm integrated in JEMImE architecture. Specific attention was paid to the visual and motivational aspects of the game. Using a brief feasibility study with children with ASD (N = 23), we evaluated the impression of the players on the game aspect and the possibility to insert algorithmic feedbacks in real time inside JEMImE. Results: During the training phase, children with ASD showed a significant progression during training for facial expression production after algorithmic autonomous feedbacks. This means children understand the challenge and that the algorithmic feedbacks are transparent enough to allow gaming. They expressed an overall good subjective experience with JEMImE in terms of ergonomics, playability, visual aspect and motivation.

Usually, models for emotion regulation assume mechanisms based on feedback loops that indicate how to change certain aspects of behavior or cognitive functioning in order to get a more satisfactory emotion response level. Adaptation of such feedback loops is usually left out of consideration. This paper introduces an adaptive computational model for emotion regulation by formalizing the model informally described by Gross (1998). The model has been constructed using a high-level modeling language, and integrates both quantitative aspects (such as levels of emotional response) and qualitative aspects (such as decisions to regulate one’s emotion). This model includes mechanisms for adaptivity of the degree of flexibility of the emotion regulation process. Also, the effects of events like traumas or therapies on emotion regulation can be simulated.

This uses two wearable technologies: a head-worn wearable computer (Google Glass) and a chest-worn depth sensor (Tango). The Google Glass is used to generate and display virtual information to the user, while the Tango is used to provide robust indoor position tracking for the Glass. The Tango enables spatial awareness of the surrounding world using various motion sensors including 3D depth sensing, an accelerometer and a motion tracking camera. Using these systems together allows users to create a virtual tag via voice input and then register this tag to a physical object or position in 3D space as an augmented annotation.

We explored long-term health consequences of age at sexual initiation and of abstinence until marriage to evaluate empirical support for the claim that postponing sexual initiation has beneficial health effects.


METHODS
We analyzed data from the 1996 National Sexual Health Survey, a cross-sectional study of the US adult population. We compared sexual health outcomes among individuals who had initiated sexual activity at an early or late age versus a normative age. We also compared individuals whose first sexual intercourse had occurred before versus after marriage.


RESULTS
Early initiation of sexual intercourse was associated with various sexual risk factors, including increased numbers of sexual partners and recent sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol, whereas late initiation was associated with fewer risk factors. However, both early and late initiation were associated with sexual problems such as problems with arousal and orgasm, primarily among men. Relationship solidity and sexual relationship satisfaction were not associated with early or late initiation.


CONCLUSIONS
Early sexual debut is associated with certain long-term negative sexual health outcomes, including increased sexual risk behaviors and problems in sexual functioning. Late initiation was also associated with sexual problems, especially among men. Further research is needed to understand how sexual initiation patterns affect later health outcomes.",2008.0,55.0,358.0,"{'volume': '98 1', 'pages': '\n          155-61\n        ', 'name': 'American journal of public health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sandfort2008LongtermHC,\n author = {T.

However so far the recognition of facial emotions is mainly addressed by computer vision researchers, based on facial display. Also detection of vocal expressions of emotions can be found in research work done by acoustic researchers. Most of these research paradigms are devoted purely to visual or purely to auditory human emotion detection. However we found that it is very interesting to consider both these auditory and visual information together, for processing, since we hope this kind of multi-modal information processing will become a datum of information processing in future multimedia era. By several intensive subjective evaluation studies we found that human beings recognise anger, happiness, surprise and dislike by their visual appearance, compared to voice only detection. When the audio track of each emotion clip is dubbed with a different type of auditory emotional expression, still anger, happiness and surprise were video dominant. However the dislike emotion gave mixed responses to different speakers. In both studies we found that sadness and fear emotions were audio dominant. As a conclusion, we propose a method of facial emotion detection by using a hybrid approach, which uses multi-modal information for facial emotion recognition.",1997.0,12.0,230.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '397-401 vol.1', 'name': 'Proceedings of ICICS, 1997 International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing.

Thirty-seven audience members were assigned to one of seven pianists’ performances and listened to his/her live performances of six pieces (fast and slow pieces by Bach, Schumann, and Debussy). Approximately 10 weeks after the live performance, each of the audience members returned to the same room and listened to the recorded performances of the same pianists’ via speakers. We recorded the audience members’ electrocardiograms in listening to the performances in both conditions, and analyzed their heart rates and the spectral features of the heart-rate variability (i.e., HF/TF, LF/HF). Results showed that the audience’s heart rate was higher for the faster than the slower piece only in the live condition. As compared with the recorded condition, the audience’s sympathovagal balance (LF/HF) was less while their vagal nervous system (HF/TF) was activated more in the live condition, which appears to suggest that sharing the ongoing musical moments with the pianist reduces the audience’s physiological stress.

However, in real life humans often face more complex multisensory social situations, involving more than one person. Here we ask if the audiovisual facilitation in emotion recognition previously found in simpler social situations extends to more complex and ecological situations. Stimuli consisting of the biological motion and voice of two interacting agents were used in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with visual, auditory, auditory filtered/noisy, and audiovisual congruent and incongruent clips. We asked participants to judge whether the two agents were interacting happily or angrily. In Experiment 2, another group of participants repeated the same task, as in Experiment 1, while trying to ignore either the visual or the auditory information. The findings from both experiments indicate that when the reliability of the auditory cue was decreased participants weighted more the visual cue in their emotional judgments. This in turn translated in increased emotion recognition accuracy for the multisensory condition. Our findings thus point to a common mechanism of multisensory integration of emotional signals irrespective of social stimulus complexity.",2015.0,60.0,29.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Piwek2015AudiovisualIO,\n author = {L.

A Randomized Controlled Trial for Reducing Fear of Gaining Weight and Other Eating Disorder Symptoms in Anorexia Nervosa through Virtual Reality-Based Body Exposure,"In vivo body exposure therapy is considered an effective and suitable intervention to help patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) reduce their body image disturbances (BIDs). However, these interventions have notable limitations and cannot effectively reproduce certain fears usually found in AN, such as the fear of gaining weight (FGW). The latest developments in virtual reality (VR) technology and embodiment-based procedures could overcome these limitations and allow AN patients to confront their FGW and BIDs. This study aimed to provide further evidence of the efficacy of an enhanced (by means of embodiment) VR-based body exposure therapy for the treatment of AN. Thirty-five AN patients (16 in the experimental group, 19 in the control group) participated in the study. FGW, BIDs, and other body-related and ED measures were assessed before and after the intervention and three months later. The experimental group received treatment as usual (TAU) and five additional sessions of VR-based body exposure therapy, while the control group received only TAU. After the intervention, ED symptoms were clearly reduced in both groups, with most of the changes being more noticeable in the experimental group. Specifically, after the intervention and at follow-up, significant group differences were found in the FGW and BIDs, with the experimental group showing significantly lower values than the control group. The current study provides new insights and encouraging findings in the field of exposure-based therapies in AN. VR technology might improve research and clinical practice in AN by providing new tools to help patients confront their core fears (i.e., food- or weight-related cues) and improve their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to their body image.",2021.0,91.0,31.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Porras-Garcia2021ANVRBEAR,\n author = {B.

This paper proposes a comprehensive computational model of emotions that can be incorporated into the physiological and social components of the emotions. Since interaction between characters can have a major impact on emotional dynamics, the model presents a social learning component for learning associations among characters, which in turn affects the character’s decision-making and social interactions. The model also designs a set of personality progression functions to enhance individual differences. In addition, we demonstrate this empirically through a computer simulation of a dynamic environment inhabited by a few characters to test our emotional model.

Ties with friends and relatives are fraying: we're 35 percent less likely to visit our neighbours or have dinner with our families than we were thirty years ago. We watch sport alone instead of with our friends. A century ago, American citizens' means of connecting were at a low point after decades of urbanisation, industrialisation and immigration uprooted them from families and friends. That generation demonstrated a capacity for renewal by creating the organisations that pulled Americans together. Putnam shows how we can learn from them and reinvent common enterprises that will make us secure, productive, happy and hopeful.",2000.0,0.0,30953.0,{'pages': '357'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Putnam2000BowlingAT,\n author = {R.

2357,cdf7e48f5b42847e1d7cabd7a4fdcb3761a40279,Development of a new resilience scale: The Connor‐Davidson Resilience Scale (CD‐RISC),"Resilience may be viewed as a measure of stress coping ability and, as such, could be an important target of treatment in anxiety, depression, and stress reactions. We describe a new rating scale to assess resilience. The Connor‐Davidson Resilience scale (CD‐RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5‐point scale (0–4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The scale was administered to subjects in the following groups: community sample, primary care outpatients, general psychiatric outpatients, clinical trial of generalized anxiety disorder, and two clinical trials of PTSD. The reliability, validity, and factor analytic structure of the scale were evaluated, and reference scores for study samples were calculated. Sensitivity to treatment effects was examined in subjects from the PTSD clinical trials. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and factor analysis yielded five factors. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that an increase in CD‐RISC score was associated with greater improvement during treatment. Improvement in CD‐RISC score was noted in proportion to overall clinical global improvement, with greatest increase noted in subjects with the highest global improvement and deterioration in CD‐RISC score in those with minimal or no global improvement. The CD‐RISC has sound psychometric properties and distinguishes between those with greater and lesser resilience. The scale demonstrates that resilience is modifiable and can improve with treatment, with greater improvement corresponding to higher levels of global improvement.

Resting EEG measures and a psychological test-battery assessing eating behavior traits, clinical symptoms, emotionality, and mood were obtained. While both the experimental (n = 10) and control group (n = 12) received their usual maintenance treatment, the experimental group received 10 sessions of individual alpha frequency training over a period of 5 weeks as additional treatment. Significant training effects were shown in eating behavior traits, emotion regulation, and in relative theta power in the eyes closed condition. Although the results are limited due to the small sample size, these are the first empirical data demonstrating the benefits of neurofeedback as a treatment adjunct in individuals with anorexia nervosa.",2016.0,81.0,29.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '354 - 374', 'name': 'Eating Disorders'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lackner2016EEGNE,\n author = {N.

However, it has recently been proposed that this view is overly simplistic: instead, adaptive ER involves applying strategies variably to meet contextual demands. Using data from four experience-sampling studies (Ns = 70, 95, 200, and 179), we tested the relationship between ER variability and negative affect (NA) in everyday life. The constantly changing demands of daily life provide a more ecologically valid context in which to test the role of variability. We calculated 2 global indicators of variability: within-strategy variability (of particular strategies across time) and between-strategy variability (across strategies at one time-point). Associations between within-strategy variability and NA were inconsistent. In contrast, when controlling for mean strategy endorsement, between-strategy variability was associated with reduced NA across both individuals and measurement occasions. This is the first evidence that variably choosing between different strategies within a situation may be adaptive in daily life.

There was no relationship between ethnic and racial group attachment among Whites, but a significant relationship was found between racial identity and other-group orientation. Multiple regression analyses for Blacks indicated that racial and ethnic identity explained a significant proportion of the variability in self-esteem.

2363,ce92e02f2189691f1cf5ef10f57ab9ee3f139b24,Emergent emotion via neural computational energy conservation on a humanoid robot,"This paper presents our initial work on how emotion based behaviors may emerge through computational mechanisms. We hold that in addition to basic emotions such as anger and fear that serves bodily well being of the organism, high level emotions such as boredom and affection have evolved to facilitate low cost brain computations. Higher level of emotions can be considered as affective state of the organism or mood, rather than the reflex-like physiologically triggered emotional responses such as fear and anger. In large and complex brains (e.g. primate brains), the neuronal energy consumption for cognition is non-negligible. We propose that for such organisms computational regulatory mechanisms for decision making give rise to behaviors that can be explained by various emotional states. As a proof of concept for this idea, we envision a robotic cognitive system and a select function that we assign a neural cost for its operation. To be concrete, we use a small humanoid robot platform (Darwin-OP) and implement a neural network (Hopfield Network) that allows the robot to recall learned patterns that it sees through its camera. As a model of neural computational energy consumption, we postulate that a change in the state of a neural unit of the network consumes one unit of (neural) energy. Therefore, the total computational energy consumed is determined by the incoming stimuli. The robot is programmed to avoid high energy consumption by showing aversive behavior when the energy consumption is high. Otherwise, the robot demonstrates engaging behavior. For an external observer these responses may be perceived as robot's having certain emotional (affectional) preference for input stimuli. In this article in addition to robot experiments, we also emphasize the biological support for our proposal and provide detailed exposition of biological background and its relevance for the hypothesis that (certain) emotions may emerge through computational mechanisms.",2013.0,13.0,7.0,"{'pages': '450-455', 'name': '2013 13th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kirtay2013EmergentEV,\n author = {M.

As a result, prior research has failed to systematically investigate whether individuals’ emotional and behavioral responses to perceived rejection differ as a function of the role of the potential rejector. In the present study, a total of 481 participants read two scenarios describing hypothetical situations in which rejection by a specific individual (i.e., significant other, friend, or acquaintance) was ambiguous. After each scenario, participants rated the extent to which they would be likely to anticipate (a) experiencing various negative emotions (e.g., upset) and (b) engaging in various behavioral responses (i.e., act friendly, retaliate, complain, avoid) to the potential rejector. Overall, the potential of being rejected by another person with whom one has a close and valued relationship (i.e., a significant other and, to a lesser degree, a friend) was associated with heightened negative emotion and a heightened likelihood of engaging in an active response, either prosocial (i.e., act friendly) or antisocial (i.e., retaliate or complain). In contrast, potential rejection by an acquaintance was associated with relatively little negative emotion and relatively little desire to engage the other (i.e., avoid). In sum, the participants’ relationship with specific individuals was found to influence both the intensity of their anticipated negative emotional response to ambiguous rejection and the pattern of their anticipated behavioral response to the potential rejectors.",2020.0,45.0,2.0,"{'volume': '149', 'pages': '57 - 71', 'name': 'The Journal of General Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jones2020AnticipatedEA,\n author = {Tucker L.

The reasoning system that controls the robot is designed to exhibit the kind of behavior expected of a rational agent, and is endowed with the psychological attitudes of belief, desire, and intention. Because these attitudes are explicitly represented, they can be manipulated and reasoned about, resulting in complex goal-directed and reflective behaviors. Unlike most planning systems, the plans or intentions formed by the robot need only be partly elaborated before it decides to act. This allows the robot to avoid overly strong expectations about the environment, overly constrained plans of action, and other forms of overcommitment common to previous planners. In addition, the robot is continuously reactive and has the ability to change its goals and intentions as situations warrant.

There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one’s ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 “shelter-in-place” and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. Objective The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. Methods The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. Results The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant’s depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression).

Emotions are usually assessed through surveys that do not allow information to be collected in real-time. In our work, we suggest the use of smartphones for mobile emotion assessment. We use the front-facing smartphone camera as a tool for emotion detection based on facial expressions. Such information can be used to reflect on emotional states or provide emotion-aware user interface adaptation. We collected facial expressions along with app usage data in a two-week field study consisting of a one-week training phase and a one-week testing phase. We built and evaluated a person-dependent classifier, yielding an average classification improvement of 33% compared to classifying facial expressions only. Furthermore, we correlate the estimated emotions with concurrent app usage to draw insights into changes in mood. Our work is complemented by a discussion of the feasibility of probing emotions on-the-go and potential use cases for future emotion-aware applications.",2020.0,57.0,12.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Kosch2020EmotionsOT,\n author = {T.

An Empathic Virtual Agent Delivers Behavior Change Health Interventions,"We discuss our approach to developing a novel modality for the computer-delivery of Brief Motivational Interventions (BMIs) for behavior change in the form of a personalized On-Demand VIrtual Counselor (ODVIC), accessed over the internet. ODVIC is a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) that empathically delivers an evidence-based behavior change intervention by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and nonverbal communication messages to those of the user’s during their interaction. We currently focus our work on excessive alcohol consumption as a target behavior, and our approach is adaptable to other target behaviors (e.g., overeating, lack of exercise, narcotic drug use, non-adherence to treatment). We based our current approach on a successful existing patient-centered brief motivational intervention for behavior change---the Drinker’s Check-Up (DCU)---whose computer-delivery with a text-only interface has been found effective in reducing alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users’ evaluation of the computer-based DCU intervention delivered with a text-only interface compared to the same intervention delivered with two different ECAs (a neutral one and one with some empathic abilities). Users rate the three systems in terms of acceptance, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the system, among other dimensions.

We examined the psychometric properties of a Persian‐language version of the second edition of this instrument (BDI‐II) [Beck et al., 1996] in an Iranian college‐student sample. In a sample of 125 student volunteers from two Iranian universities, we compared mean item scores on the BDI‐II‐Persian with those on the English‐language version administered to North American college students, and assessed internal consistency and test‐retest reliability of the BDI‐II‐Persian and its concurrent validity against a measure of negative automatic thoughts in depression, the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire [Hollon and Kendall, 1980]. We also examined the factor structure of the BDI‐II‐Persian through comparing the fit of various proposed models to the data using confirmatory factor analysis. The BDI‐II‐Persian had high internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.87) and acceptable test‐retest reliability (r=0.74). The instrument correlated strongly with the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire. In factor analysis, models with strongly correlated affective‐cognitive and somatic‐vegetative factors provided a better fit than models with one global factor. These data support the reliability and concurrent validity of the BDI‐II‐Persian as a measure of depressive symptoms in nonclinical samples.

In particular, therapist-guided Internet treatments have been found to be effective for a wide range of psychiatric and somatic conditions in well over 100 controlled trials. These treatments require (a) a secure web platform, (b) robust assessment procedures, (c) treatment contents that can be text based or offered in other formats, and (d) a therapist role that differs from that in face-to-face therapy. Studies suggest that guided Internet treatments can be as effective as face-to-face treatments, lead to sustained improvements, work in clinically representative conditions, and probably are cost-effective.

Our result provides for the first time a rigorous solution of the mean filed equations for the standard Hopfield model and is in contrast to the mathematically unjustifiable replica technique that has been used hitherto for this derivation. We show that the critical temperature for stability of a strong pattern is equal to its degree or multiplicity, when the sum of the squares of degrees of the patterns is negligible compared to the network size. In the case of a single strong pattern, when the ratio of the number of all stored pattens and the network size is a positive constant, we obtain the distribution of the overlaps of the patterns with the mean field and deduce that the storage capacity for retrieving a strong pattern exceeds that for retrieving a simple pattern by a multiplicative factor equal to the square of the degree of the strong pattern. This square law property provides justification for using strong patterns to model attachment types and behavioural prototypes in psychology and psychotherapy.",2013.0,35.0,10.0,{'pages': '2661-2669'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Edalat2013CapacityOS,\n author = {A.

While visual designers and artists carefully manipulate visual elements such as colour, form and motion to evoke affect, understanding what aspects of motion contribute to this still remains a matter of designer craft rather than validated principle. We report an empirical study of how simple features of motion in 3D textures, or motionscapes, contribute to the elicitation of affect. 12 university students were recruited to evaluate a series of 3D motionscapes. Results showed basic motion properties including speed, direction, path curvature and shape had significant influence on affective impressions such as valence, comfort, urgency and intensity, suggesting further directions for applications and explorations in this design space.",2014.0,41.0,18.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Perception'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Feng2014EvaluatingAF,\n author = {Chao Feng and L.

VR provides an immersive experience into a simulated environment. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviours. Children with ASD often require social skills training while VR provides a safe, controllable environment to practice skills repeatedly. The Centre for Innovative Applications of Internet and Multimedia Technologies (AIMTech Centre) at City University of Hong Kong developed a VR-enabled training program to examine its efficacy on emotional and social skills with six VR scenarios depicting the daily lives of typical children in Hong Kong. 94 children from mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong completed the study and 72 children were included in the analysis. Children from training group scored higher on emotion expression and regulation (M = 20.2, SD = 3.00) than before the training (M = 18.9, SD = 3.57, t(35) = −2.174, p = .037) and higher on social interaction and adaptation after the training (M = 21.8, SD = 2.99) than before training (M = 20.2, SD = 3.43, t(35) = −3.987, p < .0005). There was a statistically significant interaction between group and time on affective expressions, F(1, 70) = 5.223, p = .025, partial η2 = .069, and on social reciprocity, F(1, 70) = 7.769, p = .007, partial η2 = .100. Children were able to engage in VR training despite initial challenges with viewing goggles. Some children declined to participate due to scheduling reasons which may be minimised through the adoption of head-mounted displays as a portable, cost-effective device. VR seems to be a promising asset to traditional training and therapy while the importance trainers’ or therapists’ support has yet to be further investigated.",2018.0,7.0,79.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '110 - 112', 'name': 'London Journal of Primary Care'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yuan2018UsingVR,\n author = {Sze Ngar Vanessa Yuan and H.

Although tales of past panics are often met with amusement today, current concerns routinely engender large research investments and policy debate. What we learn from studying past technological panics, however, is that these investments are often inefficient and ineffective. What causes technological panics to repeatedly reincarnate? And why does research routinely fail to address them? To answer such questions, I examined the network of political, population, and academic factors driving the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics. In this cycle, psychologists are encouraged to spend time investigating new technologies, and how they affect children and young people, to calm a worried population. Their endeavor, however, is rendered ineffective because of the lack of a theoretical baseline; researchers cannot build on what has been learned researching past technologies of concern. Thus, academic study seemingly restarts for each new technology of interest, which slows down the policy interventions necessary to ensure technologies are benefiting society. In this article, I highlight how the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics stymies psychology’s positive role in steering technological change and the pervasive need for improved research and policy approaches to new technologies.",2020.0,84.0,103.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '1143 - 1157', 'name': 'Perspectives on Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Orben2020TheSC,\n author = {Amy C.

The purpose of the current pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary impact of using immersive virtual reality environments (IVREs) paired with a brief emotion regulation and risk reduction intervention (ER + IVRE) relative to this same intervention content paired with role-plays (ER + RP).


METHODS
Eighty-five adolescents attending middle school (grades 6th-8th; ages 12-15 years) in an urban northeast city were recruited and randomized to ER + IVRE (n = 44) or ER + RP (n = 41) and had complete data. Data examining acceptability, feasibility, sexual knowledge and attitudes, and ER were collected at baseline and 3 months after intervention completion. Analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores were used to evaluate study outcomes. Within and between intervention effect sizes were calculated with effect sizes ≥.20 considered meaningful.


RESULTS
At the 3-month follow-up assessment, several within intervention condition effect sizes were found to exceed d = 0.20 across the measured sexual attitudes and ER outcomes. Between intervention analyses found that adolescents randomized to ER + IVRE attended more intervention sessions, reported less difficulty accessing ER strategies (d = 0.46), and reported higher emotional self-efficacy (d = 0.20) at the 3-month follow-up relative to adolescents randomized to the ER + RP intervention.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides preliminary evidence that using virtual reality environments to enhance ER skill building in risk situations was acceptable, feasible to deliver, and positively impacted ER abilities.",2018.0,55.0,36.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Pediatric Psychology', 'pages': '425–435', 'volume': '44'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hadley2018MovingBR,\n author = {Wendy S Hadley and Christopher Houck and L.

2411,d39683d3d326d5a78bab73cc27d1767083af6d7c,Aging and emotion recognition: not just a losing matter.,"Past studies on emotion recognition and aging have found evidence of age-related decline when emotion recognition was assessed by having participants detect single emotions depicted in static images of full or partial (e.g., eye region) faces. These tests afford good experimental control but do not capture the dynamic nature of real-world emotion recognition, which is often characterized by continuous emotional judgments and dynamic multimodal stimuli. Research suggests that older adults often perform better under conditions that better mimic real-world social contexts. We assessed emotion recognition in young, middle-aged, and older adults using two traditional methods (single emotion judgments of static images of faces and eyes) and an additional method in which participants made continuous emotion judgments of dynamic, multimodal stimuli (videotaped interactions between young, middle-aged, and older couples). Results revealed an Age × Test interaction. Largely consistent with prior research, we found some evidence that older adults performed worse than young adults when judging single emotions from images of faces (for sad and disgust faces only) and eyes (for older eyes only), with middle-aged adults falling in between. In contrast, older adults did better than young adults on the test involving continuous emotion judgments of dyadic interactions, with middle-aged adults falling in between. In tests in which target stimuli differed in age, emotion recognition was not facilitated by an age match between participant and target. These findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and methodological implications for the study of aging and emotional processing.",2012.0,98.0,96.0,"{'volume': '27 4', 'pages': '\n          940-950\n        ', 'name': 'Psychology and aging'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sze2012AgingAE,\n author = {Jocelyn A Sze and Madeleine S.

In addition, appraisal theories assume that an appraisal component elicits changes in the other emotion components (e.g., motivational, behavioural, experiential). Neither the componential definition of emotion nor appraisal theory have been systematically translated to paradigms for emotion induction, many of which rely on passive emotion induction without a clear theoretical framework. As a result, the observed emotions are often weak. This study explored the potential of virtual reality (VR) to evoke strong emotions in ecologically valid scenarios that fully engaged the mental and bodily components of the participant. Participants played several VR games and reported on their emotions. Multivariate analyses using hierarchical clustering and multilevel linear modelling showed that participants experienced intense, multi-componential emotions in VR. We identified joy and fear clusters of responses, each involving changes in appraisal, motivation, physiology, feeling, and regulation. Appraisal variables were found to be the most predictive for fear and joy intensities, compared to other emotion components, and were found to explain individual differences in VR scenarios, as predicted by appraisal theory.

Virtual reality shows promise for the evaluation and management of patients with eating disorders. This technology, when accepted by this population, allows immersion in virtual environments, assessment, and therapeutic approaches, by exposing users to high-calorie foods or changes in body shape. Objective To better understand the value of virtual reality, we conducted a review of the literature, including clinical studies proposing the use of virtual reality for the evaluation and management of patients with eating disorders. Methods We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science up to April 2017. We created the list of keywords based on two domains: virtual reality and eating disorders. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research while minimizing bias. Results The initial database searches identified 311 articles, 149 of which we removed as duplicates. We analyzed the resulting set of 26 unique studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 8 studies were randomized controlled trials, 13 were nonrandomized studies, and 5 were clinical trials with only 1 participant. Most articles focused on clinical populations (19/26, 73%), with the remainder reporting case-control studies (7/26, 27%). Most of the studies used visual immersive equipment (16/26, 62%) with a head-mounted display (15/16, 94%). Two main areas of interest emerged from these studies: virtual work on patients’ body image (7/26, 27%) and exposure to virtual food stimuli (10/26, 38%). Conclusions We conducted a broad analysis of studies on the use of virtual reality in patients with eating disorders.

Many real-time interactive systems feature virtual anthropomorphic characters in order to simulate conversing groups and add plausibility and believability to the simulated environments. However, only a few have dealt with autonomous behavior generation, and in those cases, the agents’ exhibited behavior should be evaluated by users in terms of appropriateness, believability, and conveyed meaning (e.g., attitudes). In this article we present an integrated intelligent interactive system for generating believable nonverbal behavior exhibited by virtual agents in small simulated group conversations. The produced behavior supports group formation management and the expression of interpersonal attitudes (friendly vs. unfriendly) both among the agents in the group (i.e., in-group attitude) and towards an approaching user in an avatar-based interaction (out-group attitude). A user study investigating the effects of these attitudes on users’ social presence evaluation and proxemics behavior (with their avatar) in a three-dimensional virtual city environment is presented. We divided the study into two trials according to the task assigned to users, that is, joining a conversing group and reaching a target destination behind the group. Results showed that the out-group attitude had a major impact on social presence evaluations in both trials, whereby friendly groups were perceived as more socially rich. The user’s proxemics behavior depended on both out-group and in-group attitudes expressed by the agents. Implications of these results for the design and implementation of similar intelligent interactive systems for the autonomous generation of agents’ multimodal behavior are briefly discussed.",2016.0,80.0,26.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '12:1-12:33', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

Specifically, virtual environments (VEs) have ideal characteristics for navigational training aimed at rehabilitating spatial memory. A systematic search, following PRISMA guidelines, was carried out to explore the current scenario in neurorehabilitation of spatial memory using virtual reality. The literature on this topic was queried, 5048 papers were screened, and 16 studies were included, covering patients presenting different neuropsychological diseases. Our findings highlight the potential of the navigational task in virtual environments (VEs) for enhancing navigation and orientation abilities in patients with spatial memory disorders. The results are promising and suggest that VR training can facilitate neurorehabilitation, promoting brain plasticity processes. An overview of how VR-based training has been implemented is crucial for using these tools in clinical settings.

At its core, anger represents an outlook of grandiosity, selfrighteousness, commanding, and condemning. Many mental health professionals disagree with this view, that all kinds of anger are generally bad for you. Most therapists classify anger as ""appropriate"" or ""inappropriate"" according to context, and they usually argue that, when appropriate, it is healthy to express anger (""let it out"") and unhealthy to suppress anger (""bottle it up"").",1971.0,0.0,75.0,"{'volume': '128 4', 'pages': '\n          454-60\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rothenberg1971OnA,\n author = {A.

Study participants were divided into four separate groups (younger nonpsychiatric = YN; younger psychiatric = YP; older non-psychiatric = ON; and older psychiatric = OP). Findings indicated that, as hypothesized, individuals in the OP and YP groups reported more negative affect intensity and reactivity and more maladaptive emotion regulation than individuals in the ON and YN groups. Contrary to hypotheses, when collapsed across psychiatric conditions, older adults did not report significantly less negative affect intensity and reactivity than younger adults. A significant age by psychiatric group interaction effect on negative affect intensity occurred such that individuals in YN and ON groups reported similar levels of negative affect intensity and individuals in the YP group reported more negative affect intensity than individuals in the OP group. The finding that older adults with Axis I and Axis II diagnoses differ in their symptom reports from younger adults with similar diagnoses suggests there may be important assessment and intervention issues related to the interaction of aging and psychopathology.

A central concern in designing innovation contests is how many competitors to admit. Using a unique data set of 9,661 software contests, we provide evidence of two coexisting and opposing forces that operate when the number of competitors increases. Greater rivalry reduces the incentives to expend effort by individual solvers across competitors of all skill levels, while at the same time, increases the likelihood that at least one competitor will find an extreme-value solution. We show that the effort-reducing effect of greater rivalry dominates for less uncertain problems whereas the effect on the extreme value prevails for more uncertain problems. Adding competitors thus systematically increases overall contest performance for high-uncertainty problems. We also find that higher uncertainty reduces the negative effect of added competitors on incentives. We explore the implications of our findings for the theory and practice of innovation contests.",2010.0,52.0,22.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Boudreau2010TheEO,\n author = {K.

Study 1 explores the meaning of these constructs within culture (in the United States), identifying the individual-differences variable, idiocentrism versus allocentrism, that corresponds to the constructs. Factor analyses of responses to items related to the constructs suggest that UrS. individualism is reflected in (a) Self-Reliance With Competition, (b) Low Concern for Ingroups, and (c) Distance from Ingroups. A higher order factor analysis suggests that Subordination oflngroup Goals to Personal Goals may be the most important aspect of U.S. individualism. Study 2 probes the limits of the constructs with data from two collectivist samples (Japan and Puerto Rico) and one individualist sample (Illinois) of students. It is shown that responses depend on who the other is (i.e., which ingroup), the context, and the kind of social behavior (e.g., feel similar to other, attentive to the views of others). Study 3 replicates previous work in Puerto Rico indicating that allocentric persons perceive that they receive more and a better quality of social support than do idiocentric persons, while the latter report being more lonely than the former.

Interpersonal distance is an important nonverbal behavior, and is used to regulate personal space in a complex interplay with other nonverbal behaviors such as eye gaze. In social anxiety, studies regarding the impact of interpersonal distance on within-situation avoidance behavior are so far rare. Thus the present study aimed to scrutinize the relationship between gaze direction, sex, interpersonal distance, and social anxiety in social interactions. Social interactions were modeled in a virtual-reality (VR) environment, where 20 low and 19 high socially anxious women were confronted with approaching male and female characters, who stopped in front of the participant, either some distance away or close to them, and displayed either a direct or an averted gaze. Gaze and head movements, as well as heart rate, were measured as indices of avoidance behavior and fear reactions. High socially anxious participants showed a complex pattern of avoidance behavior: when the avatar was standing farther away, high socially anxious women avoided gaze contact with male avatars showing a direct gaze. Furthermore, they showed avoidance behavior (backward head movements) in response to male avatars showing a direct gaze, regardless of the interpersonal distance. Overall, the current study proved that VR social interactions might be a very useful tool for investigating avoidance behavior of socially anxious individuals in highly controlled situations. This might also be the first step in using VR social interactions in clinical protocols for the therapy of social anxiety disorder.",2010.0,48.0,83.0,"{'volume': '13 5', 'pages': '\n          547-54\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wieser2010VirtualSI,\n author = {M.

However, many people are overwhelmed by their emotions, fearful of their feelings, and unable to cope because they believe their sadness or anxiety prohibits effective behaviour. In this extract, Leahy, Tirch and Napolitano explore the multidimensional nature of emotion, and the role of emotion regulation and dysregulation in various psychological disorders. Coping with experience is part of emotional regulation. If the individual copes better - either by problem solving, asserting him or herself, engaging in behavioural activation to seek more rewarding experiences, or reappraisal of the situation - his or her emotions are less likely to escalate. Drawing on the research and different theoretical approaches the authors consider the evolutionary context and value of emotion, the neurobiology of emotion, and the question of causality - do emotions have primacy, or do cognitions lead to emotions? A comprehensive approach to emotion regulation recognises the multifaceted nature of emotion and provides techniques that can address any of these processes, within the context of considerable variation in coping strategies and preferences of the individual.",2012.0,97.0,6.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '68', 'name': 'Psychotherapy in Australia'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Leahy2012WhyIE,\n author = {R.

We developed an easy-to-use VR self-management relaxation tool (VRelax) with immersive 360° nature videos and interactive animated elements. Objective To investigate the immediate effects of VR relaxation on negative and positive affective states and short-term effects on perceived stress and symptoms in patients with a psychiatric disorder, compared to standard relaxation exercises. Methods A randomized crossover trial was conducted in 50 patients receiving ambulatory treatment for anxiety, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to start with VRelax or standard relaxation and used both interventions for 10 days at home. They completed 8 visual analog scales of momentary negative and positive affective states before and after each session. Global perceived stress and psychiatric symptoms were measured before and after both intervention periods. Treatment effects were analyzed with multilevel mixed model regression analyses and 2-way analysis of variance. Results Both VRelax and standard relaxation exercises led to a statistically significant immediate improvement of all negative and positive affective states. Compared to standard relaxation, VRelax resulted in a significantly greater reduction of total negative affective state (change 16.2% versus 21.2%; t1684=−2.02, 95% CI −18.70 to −0.28; P=.04). Specifically, VRelax had a stronger beneficial effect on momentary anxiety (t1684=−3.24, 95% CI −6.86 to −1.69), sadness (t1684=−2.32, 95% CI −6.51 to −0.55), and cheerfulness (t1684=2.35, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.75). There were no significant differences between short-term effects of the two treatments on global perceived stress and symptoms. Conclusions If the results of this trial are replicated and extended, VRelax may provide a much-needed, effective, easy-to-use self-management relaxation intervention to enhance psychiatric treatments.

In an effort to distill the complexity of affective experience, psychologists routinely focus on a simplified subset of subjective rating scales (i.e., dimensions) that capture considerable variability in reported affect: reported valence (i.e., how good or bad?) and reported arousal (e.g., how strong is the emotion you are feeling?). Still, existing theoretical approaches address the basic organization and measurement of these affective dimensions differently. Some approaches organize affect around the dimensions of bipolar valence and arousal (e.g., the circumplex model), whereas alternative approaches organize affect around the dimensions of unipolar positivity and unipolar negativity (e.g., the bivariate evaluative model). In this report, we (a) replicate the data structure observed when collected according to the two approaches described above, and reinterpret these data to suggest that the relationship between each pair of affective dimensions is conditional on valence ambiguity, and (b) formalize this structure with a mathematical model depicting a valence ambiguity dimension that decreases in range as arousal decreases (a triangle).

Aims To assess a wide range of paranoid thoughts multidimensionally and examine their distribution, to identify the associated coping strategies and to examine social–cognitive processes and paranoia. Method Six questionnaire assessments were completed by 1202 individuals using the internet. Results Paranoid thoughts occurred regularly in approximately a third of the group.

Our overall objective is to enhance the ability of embod-ied conversational agents (ECAs) to bond with humans. To reach such an objective, we have endowed an ECA with the capacity to touch and be touched in a social interaction with a human in an immersive environment. By drawing inspiration from literature on human-human social touch and related works on human-agent tactile interactions, we have developed a framework for a touching ECA able to perceive when and how a user touches it and decide when and how to respond accordingly. This paper focuses on going beyond a simple bi-directional touch interaction through a decision model that actually adapts its behaviour to the content of the interaction, the level of rapport and the human’s touch avoidance sensibility.

To determine the feasibility and utility of a thematic analysis approach to synthesising qualitative evidence about parental experiences in the neonatal intensive care unit.


BACKGROUND
Admission of infants to the neonatal intensive care unit is usually an unexpected event for parents who can cause them to experience psychosocial difficulties. A qualitative systematic review is the best method for exploring these parents' experiences regarding this type of admission.


DESIGN
Systematic review.


METHODS
Qualitative studies in peer-reviewed journals aimed at understanding parental experiences regarding infant neonatal intensive care unit admission were identified in six electronic databases. Three reviewers selected relevant articles and assessed the quality of the methodological studies using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. A thematic analysis approach was used to identify the most common themes in the studies describing parental experiences in the neonatal intensive care unit.


RESULTS
A total of eighty articles were identified; nine studies were included in this review. Four studies used semistructured interviews, three used interviews, one used self-reporting and one used both focus group and interview methodologies. Common themes across parents' experiences were the stress of hospitalisation, alteration in parenting roles and the impact of infant hospitalisation on psychological health.


CONCLUSION
Having an infant hospitalised in the neonatal intensive care unit is a stressful experience for parents. This experience is the result of exposure to different stressors related to the infant's condition, an alteration in parenting roles or the neonatal intensive care unit environment and staffing. These parents suffered negative psychological effects, experienced an interrupted development of a healthy parent-infant attachment and/or felt parental role alteration.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The study's findings are crucial for neonatal intensive care unit nurses to develop intervention strategies and programmes that help parents to decrease the stress of their experience and to support them in facing this stressful situation.",2016.0,19.0,194.0,"{'volume': '25 19-20', 'pages': '\n          2745-56\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of clinical nursing'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Maghaireh2016SystematicRO,\n author = {Dua'a Fayiz Al Maghaireh and Khatijah Lim Abdullah and C.

They often rely on atmospheric cues that influence how an environment feels. The design of such ambient visual cues for affect is an elusive topic that has been studied by painters, theatre directors, scenic designers, lighting designers, filmmakers, producers, and artists for years. Research shows that simple motions have the capacity to be both perceptually efficient and powerfully evocative, and motion textures -- patterns of ambient motion throughout the scene -- are frequently used to imbue the atmosphere with affect. To date there is little empirical evidence of what properties of motion texture are most influential in this affect. In this paper we report the results of a study of simple, abstract motion textures that show path curvature, speed and texture layout can influence affective impressions such as valence, comfort, urgency and intensity.",2011.0,34.0,23.0,{'pages': '89-96'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Lockyer2011SimpleMT,\n author = {Matt Lockyer and L.

We propose that emotional reliance (ER) is typically beneficial to well-being. However, due to differing socialization and norms, ER is also expected to differ across gender and cultures. Further, following a self-determination theory perspective, we hypothesize that ER is facilitated by social partners who support one’s psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Results from the studies supported the view that ER is generally associated with greater well-being and that it varies significantly across different relationships, cultural groups, and gender. Within-person variations in ER were systematically related to levels of need satisfaction within specific relationships, over and above betweenperson differences.

In this paper, we consider multi-armed bandits with a popular risk-sensitive objective called the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). We present an novel optimism-based algorithm for this setting: instead of adding bonuses to the CVaR estimate of each arm, we apply optimism at the sample level, generating an optimistic set of samples for each arm and then computing CVaR estimates from them instead. We present regret bounds for our algorithm, along with experiments showing order-of-magnitude improvements over baselines and prior work.

2451,d7950fc046147b31c2e652093f071298b69a4473,Emotion regulation.,"Emotion regulation (ER) refers to attempts to influence emotions in ourselves or others. Over the past several decades, ER has become a popular topic across many subdisciplines within psychology. One framework that has helped to organize work on ER is the process model of ER, which distinguishes 5 families of strategies defined by when they impact the emotion generation process. The process model embeds these ER strategies in stages in which a need for regulation is identified, a strategy is selected and implemented, and monitoring occurs to track success. Much of the research to date has focused on a strategy called cognitive reappraisal, which involves changing how one thinks about a situation to influence one's emotional response. Reappraisal is thought to be generally effective and adaptive, but there are important qualifications. In this article, we use reappraisal as an example to illustrate how we might consider 4 interrelated issues: (a) the consequences of using ER, either when instructed or spontaneous; (b) how ER success and frequency are shaped by individual and environmental determinants; (c) the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms that make ER possible; and (d) interventions that might improve how well and how often people use ER.

Study 1 supported the hypothesis that dysphoric participants induced to ruminatively self-focus on their feelings and personal characteristics would endorse more negative, biased interpretations of hypothetical situations than dysphoric participants induced to distract themselves from their mood, or nondysphoric participants. Study 2 showed that dysphoric participants who ruminated were more pessimistic about positive events in their future than the other 3 groups. Study 3 showed that dysphoric ruminating participants generated less effective solutions to interpersonal problems than the other 3 groups. In Studies 1 and 3, dysphoric ruminating participants also offered the most pessimistic explanations for interpersonal problems and hypothetical negative events.

Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, limitations in holding or touching the baby, and medical complications during the NICU stay can negatively affect parental mental health. This can threaten the developing parent-infant relationship and might adversely impact child development. Music therapy in the NICU is an internationally growing field of clinical practice and research and is increasingly applied to promote relationship building between parents and babies. The two most commonly used concepts describing the early parent-infant relationship are ‘attachment’ and ‘bonding’. While frequently used interchangeably in the literature, they are actually not the same and describe distinctive processes of the early relationship formation. Thus, it is important to discuss the overlaps and differences between attachment and bonding and the implications for music therapy clinical practice and research. Whereas providing examples and possible scenarios for music therapists working on either bonding or attachment, the distinction between both concepts is relevant for many health care professionals concerned with early parenting interventions in the NICU. This will hopefully lead to a more precise use of theory, and ultimately, to a more informed clinical practice and research.",2021.0,64.0,16.0,"{'volume': '18', 'name': 'International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ettenberger2021DefiningAA,\n author = {Mark Ettenberger and Łucja Bieleninik and Shulamit Epstein and C.

Social exposure conducted in virtual reality (VR), embedded in individual cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT), could be an answer. Aims To show that conducting VR exposure in CBT for SAD is effective and is more practical for therapists than conducting exposure in vivo. Method Participants were randomly assigned to either VR exposure (n = 17), in vivo exposure (n = 22) or waiting list (n = 20). Participants in the active arms received individual CBT for 14 weekly sessions and outcome was assessed with questionnaires and a behaviour avoidance test. (Trial registration number ISRCTN99747069.) Results Improvements were found on the primary (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) and all five secondary outcome measures in both CBT groups compared with the waiting list. Conducting exposure in VR was more effective at post-treatment than in vivo on the primary outcome measure and on one secondary measure. Improvements were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. VR was significantly more practical for therapists than in vivo exposure. Conclusions Using VR can be advantageous over standard CBT as a potential solution for treatment avoidance and as an efficient, cost-effective and practical medium of exposure.",2017.0,53.0,221.0,"{'volume': '210', 'pages': '276 - 283', 'name': 'British Journal of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bouchard2017VirtualRC,\n author = {S.

Theories of emotion and aging suggest younger and older adults differ in the emotion regulation strategies they use when regulating their own emotions. If how individuals regulate their own emotions and the emotions of others are related, these theorised age differences may also emerge for interpersonal emotion regulation. In two studies, younger and older adults’ intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulation strategy choices were examined via self-report and behavioural assessments of regulating the emotions of another participant (Study 1; N = 80) and of a virtual human (Study 2; N = 100). Across both studies, younger adults reported greater intrapersonal suppression but not greater reappraisal. Younger and older adults were generally similar (supported by Bayesian analyses) for both self-reported and behavioural interpersonal emotion regulation strategies. Behavioural interpersonal emotion regulation was not related to self-reported intra- and interpersonal preferences. These results suggest interpersonal emotion regulation in ageing may show distinct patterns from theorised age differences in intrapersonal emotion regulation.",2022.0,51.0,1.0,"{'name': 'Cognition and Emotion', 'pages': '643 - 659', 'volume': '36'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gurera2022InterpersonalER,\n author = {J.

However, it is not clear how to use the information extracted from electrophysiological signals to create visual representations of the emotional states of Virtual Reality (VR) users. Visualization of users' emotions in VR can lead to biofeedback therapies for training emotion self-regulation. Understanding how to visualize emotions in VR requires an interdisciplinary approach that integrates disciplines such as psychology, electrophysiology, and audiovisual design. Therefore, this review aims to integrate previous studies from these fields to understand how to develop virtual environments that can automatically create visual representations of users' emotional states. This manuscript addresses this challenge in three sections: First, theories related to emotion and affect are compared. Second, evidence suggesting that specific visual and sound cues tend to be associated with particular emotions are discussed.

However, which of these “big three” health behaviors most strongly predicts mental health and well-being, and their higher-order relationships in predictive models, is less known. This study investigated the differential and higher-order associations between sleep, physical activity, and dietary factors as predictors of mental health and well-being in young adults. Method In a cross-sectional survey design, 1,111 young adults (28.4% men) ages 18–25 from New Zealand and the United States answered an online survey measuring typical sleep quantity and quality; physical activity; and consumption of raw and processed fruit and vegetables, fast food, sweets, and soda, along with extensive covariates (including demographics, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, and health conditions) and the outcome measures of depressive symptoms [measured by the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale (CES-D)] and well-being (measured by the Flourishing Scale). Results Controlling for covariates, sleep quality was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms and well-being, followed by sleep quantity and physical activity. Only one dietary factor—raw fruit and vegetable consumption—predicted greater well-being but not depressive symptoms when controlling for covariates. There were some higher-order interactions among health behaviors in predicting the outcomes, but these did not survive cross-validation. Conclusion Sleep quality is an important predictor of mental health and well-being in young adults, whereas physical activity and diet are secondary but still significant factors.

Method Respondents in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication with common 12-month DSM-IV mood, anxiety, substance, impulse control and childhood disorders were asked about perceived need for treatment, structural barriers and attitudinal/evaluative barriers to initiation and continuation of treatment. Results Low perceived need was reported by 44.8% of respondents with a disorder who did not seek treatment. Desire to handle the problem on one's own was the most common reason among respondents with perceived need both for not seeking treatment (72.6%) and for dropping out of treatment (42.2%). Attitudinal/evaluative factors were much more important than structural barriers both to initiating (97.4% v. 22.2%) and to continuing (81.9% v. 31.8%) of treatment. Reasons for not seeking treatment varied with illness severity. Low perceived need was a more common reason for not seeking treatment among individuals with mild (57.0%) than moderate (39.3%) or severe (25.9%) disorders, whereas structural and attitudinal/evaluative barriers were more common among respondents with more severe conditions. Conclusions Low perceived need and attitudinal/evaluative barriers are the major barriers to treatment seeking and staying in treatment among individuals with common mental disorders.

Emotions, such as anger and happiness, affect concession-making, not only in human vs. human negotiations but also in human vs. agent negotiations. Recent research has demonstrated the impact of emotional expressions in morally-charged negotiations. Thus, taking people’s moral concerns into account is crucial for building agents that operate in morally sensitive domains. This paper explores the interplay between people’s moral concerns, emotional expressions and concession-making during a morally charged negotiation. Our results demonstrate that participants who had stronger concerns for the Individualizing foundations (Harm and Fairness) make greater concessions for sacred negotiation items when faced with a sad opponent than an angry opponent. Also, we find that participants who had high Binding foundations (In-group, Authority and Purity) are more sensitive to social status, and make greater concessions in scenarios that involve agents in a higher social status. Keywords: Emotion; Moral Foundations Theory; Sacred values; Negotiation; Agent Modeling. Introduction With the growing interest in understanding the role of emotional expressions in negotiation (e.g., Barry, Fulmer & Goates, 2006; Van Kleef et al., 2010), many studies have investigated how emotional expression affects negotiation processes and outcomes (Ames & Johar, 2009; Choi et al., 2012; de Melo et al., 2014). For instance, negotiators concede more when their opponent expresses anger instead of happiness (Van Kleef, De Dreu & Manstead, 2004a, 2004b). Sinaceur & Tiedens (2006) further reveal that the effect of anger on concession works only when anger recipients have poor alternatives. The past works on emotional expression suggest that emotion plays an important role as a signal (e.g., anger indicates a negotiator’s dissatisfaction with his opponent’s offer). Furthermore, negotiators respond to emotional expressions depending on their own conditions (e.g., alternatives). Thus, it is important to understand what moderates a negotiator’s reaction to emotional expression. Past studies have shown that positive moods in negotiation foster concession-making (e.g., Carnevale & Isen, 1986). Mood effects may be mediated by expression of positive emotion, for example, a positive-mood induction procedure may lead negotiators to smile more and this smiling may have an impact on perceptions and concession- making. Regardless, the possible interaction of emotion and other variables, for example, cognition as in decision frame (Carnevale, 2008), or motivation as in moral concerns, is a domain highly worthy of inquiry. Although some studies have tried to understand how people’s innate personality interacts with their emotion during negotiation games (Bolton, Katok, & Zwick, 1998; Batson & Moran, 1999), little research has paid attention to how moral concerns impact reactions to emotional expressions and affect concession-making. Our recent research demonstrates that emotional expressions can potentially shift moral concerns during a negotiation, such that displays of anger would backfire if the negotiator associates moral significance to the objects of the negotiation, whereas displays of sadness promote higher concession-making (Dehghani, Gratch and Carnevale, 2012). Because morality significantly influences decision- making (e.g., Sjoberg & Winroth, 1986; Gintis et al., 2003), the present research aims to examine the role of people’s moral concerns on how they react to emotional expressions and make concessions. Adapting the Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt & Graham, 2007; Haidt & Joseph, 2007; Graham, 2013), we examine effects of two different types of foundations (i.e., Individualizing foundations and Binding foundations) on concession-making. We predict that people who have stronger Individualizing foundations would react more to emotional expressions because the Individualizing foundations indicate the tendency to care about other people’s emotions (whether others are emotionally or physically suffering, or being treated fairly) and therefore, that would effect their concession-making. On the other hand, we predict that people with stronger Binding foundations be more sensitive to their negotiation partner’s social status because Binding foundations indicate concern about other people’s roles in the group (whether negotiation partner is their boss or co-worker). Understanding the interaction between moral concerns and emotion are crucial in designing autonomous decision- making agents that operate in morally sensitive domains. Progress in agent research has enabled us to work closely with software agents in morally sensitive situations where agents’ actions may lead to significant results, such as loss of life (Tambe, 2011; Dehghani et al., 2013). Therefore, it is important to better understand the interactions between people’s moral concerns, emotion and agent decision- making strategies. Our results suggest that incorporating",2014.0,26.0,4.0,"{'volume': '36', 'name': 'Cognitive Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kim2014EffectsOM,\n author = {Eunkyung Kim and Morteza Dehghani and Y.

Coping strategies can play an important role in mitigating the onset and progression of these conditions in emerging adulthood. The current study examined daily mood, coping strategy use, and alcohol use during an individualized, ecological momentary intervention (EMI).Objectives: To examine the within-person relationship between mood, coping strategy use, and alcohol use.Methods: Emerging adults (N = 20, 55% female) in a partial hospital program for anxiety or mood disorders who endorsed drinking to cope completed a 6-week EMI to increase non-substance coping skills. The study also measured mood, coping strategy use, and alcohol use over the course of the intervention.Results: Mood and coping variables did not predict the likelihood of drinking on a given day. On drinking days, the number of pre-consumption coping strategies were related to reduced alcohol use (p =.02) and there was a significant interaction between negative mood and coping in predicting alcohol use (p <.01). When pre-consumption negative mood was high, coping strategies predicted decreased alcohol use (p =.02), but when negative mood was low, this relationship was nonsignificant.Conclusions: Using coping skills was associated with reduced alcohol use on days when negative mood was high. Increasing non-substance coping skills may help emerging adults reduce their alcohol use in response to negative mood.",2020.0,35.0,8.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '651 - 658', 'name': 'The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Stevenson2020AnEM,\n author = {Brittany L.

However, the literature has mostly focused on the functionality design and utilitarian value of such decision support systems, mostly ignoring the potential social influence they could exert on their users. The objective of this study is to apply a social relationship perspective to the design of interfaces for PRAs. We investigate the effects of applying anthropomorphic interfaces—namely, humanoid embodiment and voice output—on users' perceived social relationship with a technological and software-based artifact designed for electronic commerce contexts. The findings from a laboratory experiment indicate that using humanoid embodiment and human voice-based communication significantly influences users' perceptions of social presence, which in turn enhances users' trusting beliefs, perceptions of enjoyment, and ultimately, their intentions to use the agent as a decision aid. These results extend the applicability of theories concerning traditional shopper-salesperson relationships to customers' interactions with technological artifacts residing on Web sites—that is, the recommendation agent software—and provide practitioners with guidelines on how to design Internet stores with the goal of building social relationships with online shoppers and enhancing their overall shopping experiences.",2009.0,136.0,488.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '145 - 182', 'name': 'Journal of Management Information Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Qiu2009EvaluatingAP,\n author = {Lingyun Qiu and I.

Research in the human neurosciences often involves the use of simple and static stimuli lacking many of the potentially important aspects of real world activities and interactions. While this research is valuable, there is a growing interest in the human neurosciences to use cues about target states in the real world via multimodal scenarios that involve visual, semantic, and prosodic information. These scenarios should include dynamic stimuli presented concurrently or serially in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Furthermore, there is growing interest in contextually embedded stimuli that can constrain participant interpretations of cues about a target’s internal states. Virtual reality environments proffer assessment paradigms that combine the experimental control of laboratory measures with emotionally engaging background narratives to enhance affective experience and social interactions.

Previously, methodological and reporting guidelines have been presented to outline best practices and provide input on methodological issues and decisions that are faced when planning and conducting AA studies (e.g., Bolger & Laurenceau, 2013; Mehl & Conner, 2012; Stone & Shiffman, 2002). However, despite the publication of these important resources and guidelines, it remains an open question as to how much uniformity or consistency is evident in the design and reporting of AA studies of psychopathology. To address this, we reviewed the reported practices of published studies using AA in major psychopathology journals (Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Psychological Medicine, Clinical Psychological Science) over the last 7 years (2012-2018). Our review highlights (a) sample selection and size; (b) sampling design; (c) selection and reporting of measures; (d) devices used and software; (e) compliance; (f) participant training, monitoring and remuneration; and (g) data management and analysis.

Past research on age differences in attentional deployment using stationary eye tracking has revealed older adults show relatively more positive looking and seem to benefit more moodwise from this looking pattern, compared with younger adults. However, these past studies have greatly constrained the stimuli participants can look at, despite real-world settings providing numerous possibilities for what we choose to look at. The authors therefore used mobile eye tracking to study age differences in attentional selection, as indicated by fixation patterns to stimuli of different valence freely chosen by the participant. In contrast to stationary eye-tracking studies of attentional deployment, Study 1 showed that younger and older individuals generally selected similar proportions of valenced stimuli, and attentional selection had similar effects on mood across age groups. Study 2 replicated this pattern with an adult life span sample including middle-aged individuals. Emotion regulation-relevant attention may thus differ depending on whether stimuli are freely chosen or not.

The present meta-analyses focus on one specific game genre that has been of particular interest to the scientific community—action video games, and cover the period 2000–2015. To assess the long-lasting impact of action video game play on various domains of cognition, we first consider cross-sectional studies that inform us about the cognitive profile of habitual action video game players, and document a positive average effect of about half a standard deviation (g = 0.55). We then turn to long-term intervention studies that inform us about the possibility of causally inducing changes in cognition via playing action video games, and show a smaller average effect of a third of a standard deviation (g = 0.34). Because only intervention studies using other commercially available video game genres as controls were included, this latter result highlights the fact that not all games equally impact cognition. Moderator analyses indicated that action video game play robustly enhances the domains of top-down attention and spatial cognition, with encouraging signs for perception. Publication bias remains, however, a threat with average effects in the published literature estimated to be 30% larger than in the full literature. As a result, we encourage the field to conduct larger cohort studies and more intervention studies, especially those with more than 30 hours of training.",2018.0,252.0,403.0,"{'volume': '144', 'pages': '77–110', 'name': 'Psychological Bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bediou2018MetaAnalysisOA,\n author = {B.

This approach is distinctly different from spatially localized real‐time implementations, since it does not require prior assumptions about functional localization and individual performance strategies, and has the ability to provide feedback based on intuitive translations of brain state rather than localized fluctuations. Thus this approach provides the capability for a new class of experimental designs in which real‐time feedback control of the stimulus is possible—rather than using a fixed paradigm, experiments can adaptively evolve as subjects receive brain‐state feedback. In this report, we describe our implementation and characterize its performance capabilities. We observed ∼80% classification accuracy using whole brain, block‐design, motor data. Within both left and right motor task conditions, important differences exist between the initial transient period produced by task switching (changing between rapid left or right index finger button presses) and the subsequent stable period during sustained activity. Further analysis revealed that very high accuracy is achievable during stable task periods, and that the responsiveness of the classifier to changes in task condition can be much faster than signal time‐to‐peak rates. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this implementation with respect to behavioral task, suggesting that our results are applicable across a spectrum of cognitive domains. Beyond basic research, this technology can complement electroencephalography‐based brain computer interface research, and has potential applications in the areas of biofeedback rehabilitation, lie detection, learning studies, virtual reality‐based training, and enhanced conscious awareness.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an updated and authoritative measure of individualism vs collectivism (IDV-COLL) as a dimension of national culture. 
 
 
 
 
Design/methodology/approach 
 
 
 
 
Rather than focus solely on Hofstede’s classic work, the authors review the main nation-level studies of IDV-COLL and related constructs to identify the salient cultural differences between rich societies and developing nations. The authors conceptualize and operationalize IDV-COLL on the basis of those differences and propose a new national IDV-COLL index, using new data from large probabilistic samples: 52,974 respondents from 56 countries, adequately representing the national cultures of all inhabited continents. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
The proposed index is a new, valid measure of IDV-COLL as it is strongly correlated with previous measures of closely associated constructs. As a predictor of important cultural differences that can be expected to be associated with IDV-COLL, it performs better (yields higher correlations) than any known measure of IDV-COLL or a related construct. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
An important facet of IDV-COLL – in-group favoritism vs out-group neglect or exclusionism – does not transpire convincingly from the authors’ operationalization of IDV-COLL. The study relies on self-construals. Respondents are unlikely to construe their selves in terms of such concepts. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
The new IDV-COLL measure can be used as a reliable, up-to-date national index in studies that compare the cultures of rich and developing nations. The new IDV-COLL scale, consisting of only seven items, can be easily used in future studies. 
 
 
 
 
Originality/value 
 
 
 
 
This is the first IDV-COLL measure based on the communalities of previous studies in this domain and derived from large probabilistic samples that approach national representativeness. The superior predictive properties of the authors’ new measure with respect to extraneous variables are another important strength and contribution.",2017.0,33.0,136.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '386-404', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Minkov2017ARO,\n author = {M.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.",2001.0,20.0,1188.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '214 - 219', 'name': 'Current Directions in Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gross2001EmotionRI,\n author = {J.

In older individuals with a mild cognitive impairment, deficits in working memory are frequent and can precede those of episodic memory, in addition to having a strong prognostic value of evolution toward a dementia of Alzheimer type. Because of its implication in numerous cognitive and cognitive-motor tasks, working memory is called upon in a wide range of daily life activities. Impairment in working memory therefore increases the risk of a loss of autonomy. In the current review, we present different working memory training programs. We show how these training programs are associated with specific effects and to near and far transfers towards other cognitive functions in older adults without cognitive impairment or with mild cognitive impairment, as well as in patients with dementia.

Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants’ comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy.

After providing informed consent/assent, these participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups during wound care: standard care, passive distraction watching a movie, or virtual reality (VR) using a tripod-arm device rather than an immersive helmet. Before wound care, participants completed the Spielberger’s State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and Pre-Procedure Questionnaire while blinded to group assignment. A total of 28 participants completed the study and rated treatment pain after wound care by using the Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool and completed a Post-Procedure Questionnaire. The VR group reported less pain during wound care than either the passive distraction or standard care group as determined by multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, preprocedure pain, state anxiety, opiate use, and treatment length. The VR group was the only group to have an estimated decrease in pain perception from baseline preprocedure pain to procedural pain reported. Adolescents pretreated with opiate analgesics and female adolescents reported more pain during wound care.This between-subjects clinical study provides further support for VR, even without requiring wearing of an immersive helmet, in lessening burn wound care pain in adolescents. Passive distraction by watching a movie may be less effective in reducing treatment pain.

Alterations in central corticotropin-releasing factor signaling pathways have been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We aimed to characterize the effects of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF-R1) antagonist, GW876008, on brain and skin conductance responses during acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear to the threat of abdominal pain in subjects with IBS and healthy individuals (controls).


METHODS
We performed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, 3-period crossover study of 11 women with IBS (35.50 ± 12.48 years old) and 15 healthy women (controls) given a single oral dose (20 mg or 200 mg) of the CRF-R1 antagonist or placebo. Blood-oxygen level-dependent responses were analyzed using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a tertiary care setting.


RESULTS
Controls had greater skin conductance responses during acquisition than extinction, validating the fear-conditioning paradigm. In contrast, during extinction, women with IBS had greater skin conductance responses than controls-an effect normalized by administration of a CRF-R1 antagonist. Although the antagonist significantly reduced activity in the thalamus in patients with IBS and controls during acquisition, the drug produced greater suppression of blood-oxygen level-dependent activity in a wide range of brain regions in IBS patients during extinction, including the medial prefrontal cortex, pons, hippocampus, and anterior insula.


CONCLUSIONS
Although CRF signaling via CRF-R1 is involved in fear acquisition and extinction learning related to expected abdominal pain in patients with IBS and controls, this system appears to be up-regulated in patients with IBS. This up-regulation might contribute to the previously reported abnormal brain responses to expected abdominal pain.",2013.0,68.0,76.0,"{'volume': '145 6', 'pages': '\n          1253-61.e1-3\n        ', 'name': 'Gastroenterology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Labus2013ImpairedEL,\n author = {J.

We argue that these anxiety-transfer processes may be exploited strategically when attempting to regulate relationship partners’ emotion. More generally, anxiety may serve as either a warning signal to other people about threat (alerting function) or an appeal for emotional support or practical help (comfort-seeking function). Tensions between these two interpersonal functions may account for mutually incongruent interpersonal responses to expressed anxiety, including mistargeted interpersonal regulation attempts. Because worry waxes and wanes over time as a function of other people's ongoing reactions, interpersonal interventions may help to alleviate some of its maladaptive consequences.",2012.0,80.0,87.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '462 - 479', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Parkinson2012WorrySI,\n author = {B.

First, presence is a defining feature of self and it is related to the evolution of a key feature of any central nervous system: the embedding of sensory-referred properties into an internal functional space. Without the emergence of the sense of presence it is impossible for the nervous system to experience distal attribution: the referencing of our perception to an external space beyond the limits of the sensory organs themselves. Second, even if the experience of the sense of presence is a unitary feeling, conceptually it can be divided in three different layers, phylogenetically different and strictly related to the three levels of self identified by Damasio. In particular we can make conceptual distinctions between proto presence (self vs. non self), core presence (self vs. present external world), and extended presence (self relative to present external world). Third, given that each layer of presence solves a particular facet of the internal/external world separation, it is characterized by specific properties. Finally, in humans the sense of presence is a direct function of these three layers: the more they are integrated, the more we are present. In the experience of optimal presence, biologically and culturally determined cognitive processes are working in harmony--to focus all levels of the self on a significant situation in the external world, whether this is real or virtual.",2004.0,50.0,211.0,"{'volume': '7 4', 'pages': '\n          402-16\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riva2004TheLO,\n author = {G.

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments.

Recent findings indicate that there are narrow and cell type-specific temporal windows for such synaptic modification and that the generally accepted input- (or synapse-) specific rule for modification appears not to be strictly adhered to. Spike timing-dependent modifications, together with selective spread of synaptic changes, provide a set of cellular mechanisms that are likely to be important for the development and functioning of neural networks. When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B or repeatedly or consistently takes part in firing it, some growth or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.",2001.0,183.0,1418.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '\n          139-66\n        ', 'name': 'Annual review of neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Bi2001SynapticMB,\n author = {G.

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",2019.0,63.0,63157.0,{'pages': '4171-4186'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Devlin2019BERTPO,\n author = {Jacob Devlin and Ming-Wei Chang and Kenton Lee and Kristina Toutanova},\n pages = {4171-4186},\n title = {BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '39172707', 'name': 'Jacob Devlin'}, {'authorId': '1744179', 'name': 'Ming-Wei Chang'}, {'authorId': '2544107', 'name': 'Kenton Lee'}, {'authorId': '3259253', 'name': 'Kristina Toutanova'}]"

This study comprises two parts that describe and assess an immersive VR task, the Virtual Shop, which can be used to measure episodic memory. Part 1 addresses its applicability in healthy older adults by measuring presence, motivation, and cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 addresses its construct validity by investigating correlations between performance in the VR task and on a traditional experimental memory task, and by measuring whether the VR task is sensitive to age-related memory differences. Fifty-seven older and 20 younger adults were assessed in the Virtual Shop, in which they memorised and fetched 12 familiar items. Part 1 showed high levels of presence, higher levels of motivation for the VR than for the traditional task, and negligible cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 indicates that memory performance in the VR task is positively correlated with performance on a traditional memory task for both age groups, and age-related differences were found on the VR and traditional memory tasks. Thus, the use of VR is feasible in older adults and the Virtual Shop is a valid task to assess and train episodic memory in this population.",2018.0,53.0,65.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '462 - 480', 'name': 'Neuropsychological Rehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lecavalier2018UseOI,\n author = {Nick Corriveau Lecavalier and Émilie Ouellet and Benjamin Boller and S.

In Studies 1 and 2 we found that positive feelings were remembered as being nearly independent of negative feelings in the past year, but the two types of affect were moderately negatively correlated for the past month. In Studies 3 and 5, subjects completed daily mood reports for 70 and 30 days, respectively. In Study 4, subjects completed three-week, daily, and moment mood reports and also filled out reports when they experienced strong emotions. The principal finding was that the relation between positive and negative affect differed greatly depending on the time frame. The strongest negative correlation between the two affects occurred during emotional times. The correlation decreased in a linear fashion as the time span covered increased logarithmically. It appears that positive and negative affect are independent in terms of how much people feel in their lives over longer time periods. Researchers need to focus on the processes that underlie both positive and negative affect and that are responsible for producing their relative independence.",1984.0,39.0,2328.0,"{'volume': '47 5', 'pages': '\n          1105-17\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Diener1984TheIO,\n author = {E.

2546,e0f9362543791a3fe9c745dc95f725caff0ea9a9,Virtual reality,"Although the terms cyberspace and virtual reality have been around for years, virtual reality as an industry is in its infancy. The term virtual reality is credited to Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research; earlier experimenters, like Myron Krueger in the mid-1970s, used phrases like artificial reality. William Gibson coined cyberspace in his 1984 science fiction novel. Neuromancer. Few technologies in recent years have evoked such fiery discussions in the technical community, and fewer still have sparked such passionate involvement of the humanities and the cultural sector. Maybe the humanities community reacts because the VR interaction is so tightly coupled to the human senses. Perhaps the cultural sector clamours for a role in the evolution of VR because the technology is finally interfacing with the human, rather than the human interfacing with the technology. Whatever the reasons, VR is more a convergence of previously disparate disciplines than a whole new branch of technology. It simply takes a fresh look at human interaction. Evolving from user interface design, flight and visual simulation, and telepresence technologies, VR is unique in its emphasis on the experience of the human participant. VR focuses the user's attention on the experience while suspending disbelief about the method of creating it. We feel that neither the devices used nor the level of interactiveness or fidelity determine whether a system is VR. The quality of the experience is crucial. To stimulate creativity and productivity. the virtual experience must be credible. The reality must both react to the human participants in physically and perceptually appropriate ways, and conform to their personal cognitive representations of the microworld in which they are engrossed. The experience does not necessarily have to be realistic/spl minus/just consistent.<<ETX>>",1994.0,9.0,1722.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '15-16', 'name': 'IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Machover1994VirtualR,\n author = {C.

Aim: We described the results of a series of meta-analyses examining what this large body of research has contributed to our knowledge of these treatments of depression. Results: We found that different types of psychotherapy are efficacious in the treatment of adult depression, including cognitive behavior therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, problem-solving therapy, non-directive supportive therapy and behavioral activation therapy. Differences between types of psychotherapy are small. The efficacy of psychotherapy for mild to moderate depression is about the same as the efficacy of pharmacotherapy, and that combined treatment is more effective than psychotherapy alone and pharmacotherapy alone. Psychotherapy is not only effective in depressed adults in general, but also in older adults, women with postpartum depression, patients with general medical disorders, in inpatients, in primary care patients, patients with chronic depression and in subthreshold depression. Conclusions: We found no evidence showing that psychotherapy is less efficacious in severe depression (with mean baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores up to 31, mean Beck Depression Inventory scores up to 35.85 and mean Beck Depression Inventory-II scores up to 36.50), but effects are smaller in chronic depression.

To evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) in the treatment of PTSD, we performed a systematic review of published articles using the following electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and PILOTS. Eligibility criteria included the use of patients diagnosed with PTSD according to DSM-IV, the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the use of virtual reality for performing exposure. 10 articles were selected, seven of which showed that VRET produced statistically significant results in comparison to the waiting list. However, no difference was found between VRET and exposure treatment. Of these 10, four were randomized, two were controlled but not randomized and four were non-controlled. The majority of the articles used head-mounted display virtual reality (VR) equipment and VR systems specific for the population that was being treated. Dropout rates do not seem to be lower than in traditional exposure treatment. However, there are a few limitations. Because this is a new field of research, there are few studies in the literature. There is also a need to standardize the number of sessions used. The randomized studies were analyzed to assess the quality of the methodology, and important deficiencies were noted, such as the non-use of intent-to- treat-analysis and the absence of description of possible concomitant treatments and comorbidities. Preliminary data suggest that VRET is as efficacious as traditional exposure treatment and can be especially useful in the treatment of patients who are resistant to traditional exposure.",2012.0,35.0,172.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gonçalves2012EfficacyOV,\n author = {R.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand how to make these apps effective. The therapeutic alliance (TA), or the relationship between healthcare professionals and clients, is considered fundamental to successful treatment outcomes in face-to-face therapy. Thus, understanding the TA in the context of fully automated apps would bring us insights into building effective smartphone apps which engage users. However, the concept of a digital therapeutic alliance (DTA) in the context of fully automated mental health smartphone apps is nascent and under-researched, and only a handful of studies have been published in this area. In particular, no published review paper examined the DTA in the context of fully automated apps. The objective of this review was to integrate the extant literature to identify research gaps and future directions in the investigation of DTA in relation to fully automated mental health smartphone apps. Our findings suggest that the DTA in relation to fully automated smartphone apps needs to be conceptualized differently to traditional face-to-face TA. First, the role of bond in the context of fully automated apps is unclear. Second, human components of face-to-face TA, such as empathy, are hard to achieve in the digital context. Third, some users may perceive apps as more non-judgmental and flexible, which may further influence DTA formation. Subdisciplines of computer science, such as affective computing and positive computing, and some human-computer interaction (HCI) theories, such as those of persuasive technology and human-app attachment, can potentially help to foster a sense of empathy, build tasks and goals and develop bond or an attachment between users and apps, which may further contribute to DTA formation in fully automated smartphone apps.

For two weeks, 89 participants provided daily reports of EA, positive and negative affect, enjoyment of daily events and meaning in life (MIL). Daily EA predicted higher negative affect, lower positive affect, less enjoyment of daily events (exercising, eating food and listening to music) and less MIL.

Our daily measure of EA was a stronger predictor of daily well-being than a traditional trait measure (The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire).

Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate two approaches to reducing the likelihood that patients or consumers will act on the potentially harmful medical information they receive from conversational assistants. Methods Participants were given medical problems to pose to conversational assistants that had been previously demonstrated to result in potentially harmful recommendations. Each conversational assistant’s response was randomly varied to include either a correct or incorrect paraphrase of the query or a disclaimer message—or not—telling the participants that they should not act on the advice without first talking to a physician. The participants were then asked what actions they would take based on their interaction, along with the likelihood of taking the action. The reported actions were recorded and analyzed, and the participants were interviewed at the end of each interaction. Results A total of 32 participants completed the study, each interacting with 4 conversational assistants. The participants were on average aged 42.44 (SD 14.08) years, 53% (17/32) were women, and 66% (21/32) were college educated. Those participants who heard a correct paraphrase of their query were significantly more likely to state that they would follow the medical advice provided by the conversational assistant (χ21=3.1; P=.04). Those participants who heard a disclaimer message were significantly more likely to say that they would contact a physician or health professional before acting on the medical advice received (χ21=43.5; P=.001).

The mechanics of the latter are adequately described, but there is too much emphasis on arithmetic, and little effort is made to intuitively justify the prediction process. At the end of the chapter, there is one paragraph on multiple regression analysis and one sentence on logistic regression. A major disappointment to me was the almost exclusive reliance in the examples on a rather old automobile fuel efficiency dataset (there is one observation for a Datsun 1200 vehicle). I had hoped to see some real business applications. After a four page “Deployment” chapter, the book ends with a “Conclusions” chapter containing one large-scale example involving data on the incidence of diabetes among Pima Indians. Here we find histograms, box plots, a two-sample t test, some derived associative rules which I did not find overly insightful, and a brief summary of prediction results via neural networks. I think students coming out of an undergraduate regression course could do a fine job of analyzing these data without resorting to the bells and whistles of data mining.

Someone considering becoming involved in a data mining project or teaching an introductory course in the subject would be advised to learn much more than what MSD offers.

2559,e385902aeca602abb320769fea10ae836fee3261,Experience Sampling,"Experience Sampling refers to the repeated sampling of momentary experiences in the individual’s natural environment. Methodological advantages include the minimization of retrospective response biases and the maximization of the validity of the assessment. Conceptual benefits include the provision of insights into short-term processes and into the daily-life contexts of the phenomena under study. Making use of the benefits of Experience Sampling while taking its methodological challenges into consideration allows addressing important research questions in the social and behavioral sciences with much precision and clarity. Despite this, experience Sampling information is still rare in the data infrastructure that is publicly available to researchers. This stands in contrast to a current thriving of the methodology in research producing datasets that are not publicly available, as is the case in many psychological investigations. Following a discussion of the benefits and challenges of Experience Sampling, this report outlines its potential uses in social science and economic research and characterizes the status quo of Experience Sampling applications in currently available datasets, focusing primarily on household surveys conducted after 2001. Recommendations are given on how an intensified use of Experience Sampling in large-scale data collections can be facilitated in the future.",2009.0,4.0,75.0,{'name': 'Cognitive Social Science eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Riediger2009ExperienceS,\n author = {M.

Recently, immersive virtual reality has allowed users to experience the same sensations of ownership over a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment, which in turn allows virtual reality users to have the feeling of being “embodied” in a virtual body. Using such virtual embodiment to manipulate body perception is starting to be extensively investigated and may have clinical implications for conditions that involve altered body image such as chronic pain. Here, we review experimental and clinical studies that have explored the manipulation of an embodied virtual body in immersive virtual reality for both experimental and clinical pain relief. We discuss the current state of the art, as well as the challenges faced by, and ideas for, future research. Finally, we explore the potentialities of using an embodied virtual body in immersive virtual reality in the field of neurorehabilitation, specifically in the field of pain.",2019.0,131.0,114.0,"{'volume': '13', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Matamala-Gomez2019ImmersiveVR,\n author = {Marta Matamala-Gomez and T.

They can be used to improve the children’s learning skills to grasp new concepts rapidly in an enjoyable manner. Fun, motivation, and engagement are the most important features in designing attractive serious games. Therefore, designers should always find the best strategies and techniques to keep children playing the game with motivation and enthusiasm. The process is very long and requires different expertise from all the stakeholders. Arcade games are the most played games for fun and amusement in the last decades. Their approach is based on simplicity, easiness, repetitiveness, and soft challenges. The players of arcade games need only to improve their scores in every episode and avoid frustration and hard challenges as in other games. Hence, this arcade-based approach can be used in designing attractive serious games for young children and adolescents. We propose in this research a new serious game for diabetic children to teach them about the disease in a very easy manner. The game uses the arcade approach coupled with useful information about diabetes where the children discover them incrementally during the play. The longer time the child spends on the game, the most she/he can learn and enhance her/his knowledge on the disease. The game success came from its design and implementation with the presence of diabetes children, advisors, and nutritionists. We compare the game with the well-known DEX pet-based game for diabetes awareness on different aspects including user experience, usability, and learning outcomes. The study is conducted on twenty children from a diabetes camp who accepted voluntarily to participate in this research. We evaluate their educational aspects, using an improved version of the MEEGA+ model. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed game in enhancing the children knowledge on diabetes and adopt a new healthy lifestyle.",2020.0,70.0,7.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '222876-222889', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Moosa2020DesigningAM,\n author = {Alaa Mohammed Moosa and Noor Al-Máadeed and M.

These environments can be used for training of dangerous situations (e.g. fire, crashes, etc) or to improve skills with less distraction than regular natural environments would offer. The pilot study described in this paper, puts an athlete rowing on a stationary rowing machine into a virtual environment. The virtual reality receives movement data from several sensors of the rowing machine and displays those in the head-mounted display. In addition, metrics on technique are derived from the sensor data as well as physiological data. All this is used to investigate if and to which extend VR improves the technical skills of an athlete, during the complex sport of rowing.

Through a prosodic analysis of the acoustic signal, we perform an analysis for stress and pitch, relate it to the spoken words and identify the agitation state. Our rule-based system performs a shallow analysis of the utterance text to determine its semantic, pragmatic and rhetorical content. Based on these analyses, the system generates facial expressions and behaviors including head movements, eye saccades, gestures, blinks and gazes. Our technique is able to synthesize the performance and generate novel gesture animations based on coarticulation with other closely scheduled animations. Because our method utilizes semantics in addition to prosody, we are able to generate virtual character performances that are more appropriate than methods that use only prosody.

Unlike previous methods based on phoneme level unit selection or hidden Markov model (HMM), etc., the hybrid concatenation method uses a frame level-based unit selection method combined with a fused HMM, and is able to generate more expressive and stable facial animations. The fused HMM can be used to explicitly model the loose synchronization of tightly coupled streams, with much better results than a normal HMM for audiovisual mapping. After fused HMM is created, facial animation is generated via the unit selection method at the frame level by using the fused HMM output probabilities. To accelerate the computing efficiency of the unit selection on a large corpus, this paper also proposes a two-layer Viterbi search method in which only the subsets that have been selected in the first layer are further checked in the second layer. Using this idea, the system has been successfully integrated into real-time applications. Furthermore, the paper also proposes a mapping method to generate emotional facial expressions from neutral facial expressions based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Final experiments prove that the method described can output synthesized facial parameters with high quality. Compared with other audiovisual mapping methods, our method has better performance with respect to expressiveness, stability, and system running speed.",2009.0,34.0,24.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '469-477', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tao2009RealisticVS,\n author = {J.

This raises practical questions, such as whether the cravings are sufficient to be clinically useful but also manageable enough to remain clinically safe. Pilot data are also needed to test the development of a treatment manual and prepare large randomized control trials. This paper reports on three studies describing (a) cravings induced in VR compared to real gambling and a control game of skill with no money involved (N = 28 frequent gamblers and 36 infrequent gamblers); (b) the usefulness of a treatment protocol with only two CBT sessions using VR (N = 34 pathological gamblers); and (c) the safety of a four-session treatment program of CBT in VR (N = 25 pathological gamblers). Study 1 reveals that immersions in VR can elicit desire and a positive anticipation to gamble in frequent gamblers that are (a) significantly stronger than for infrequent gamblers and for playing a control game of skill and (b) as strong as for gambling on a real video lottery terminal. Study 2 documents the feasibility of integrating VR in CBT, its usefulness in identifying more high-risk situations and dysfunctional thoughts, how inducing cravings during relapse prevention exercises significantly relates to treatment outcome, and the safety of the procedure in terms of cybersickness. Results from Study 3 confirm that, compared to inducing urges to gamble in imagination, using VR does not lead to urges that are stronger, last longer, or feel more out of control. Outcome data and effect sizes are reported for both randomized control pilot trials conducted in inpatient settings.

Two common modes of use are scanning, or general browsing of data; and focused search, or seeking answers to specific questions or well-defined problems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antecedents of these two different modes of EIS use and also to examine their implications for perceived performance changes.The results show that, whenexecutives focus their use of EIS to answer specific questions or solve well-defined problems, they help to fine-tune operations and verify assumptions -- in other words, they help to make the organization more efficient. However, an EIS may also lead an executive to challenge fundamental managerial assumptions and preconceptions when using it to scan through information without having specific questions in mind. In this mode, an EIS may be used to help formulate problems and foster creativity -- thereby improving organizational effectiveness.EISs were found to contribute to gains in efficiency much more frequently than to gains in effectiveness. Companies that want to achieve greater effectiveness should pay attention to the role of the EIS in the scanning behavior of their managers.

Recent research suggests that the experience of time emerges from emotional and interoceptive (bodily) states as processed in the insular cortex. Whether there is an interaction between the conscious awareness of interoceptive states and time distortions induced by emotions has rarely been investigated so far. We aimed to address this question by the use of a retrospective time estimation task comparing two groups of participants. One group had a focus on interoceptive states and one had a focus on exteroceptive information while watching film clips depicting fear, amusement and neutral content. Main results were that attention to interoceptive processes significantly affected subjective time experience. Fear was accompanied with subjective time dilation that was more pronounced in the group with interoceptive focus, while amusement led to a quicker passage of time which was also increased by interoceptive focus. We conclude that retrospective temporal distortions are directly influenced by attention to bodily responses. These effects might crucially interact with arousal levels. Sympathetic nervous system activation affecting memory build-up might be the decisive factor influencing retrospective time judgments. Our data substantially extend former research findings underscoring the relevance of interoception for the effects of emotional states on subjective time experience.",2014.0,40.0,65.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pollatos2014InteroceptiveFS,\n author = {O.

However, the few studies addressing this issue show mixed results and do therefore not allow final conclusions about the effect of gaming on time perception. Even less is known about whether and how time distortion continues after a play session. Therefore, the present experiment tested the effect of gaming on the perception of time subsequent to a game session at a LAN party. 40 players produced standard time intervals of 10 s and 60 s before and after having played computer games. Results show a significant increase in time productions after gaming for the short interval, indicating that game-induced time losses continue even after a game session. In contrast, the reverse was true for the longer interval.

But active experimentation of treatment options can be time-consuming, expensive and altogether unethical in some cases. There is a growing interest in methodological approaches that allow an experimenter to learn and evaluate the usefulness of a new treatment strategy before deployment. We present the first development of a treatment recommender system for emotion regulation using real-world historical mobile digital data from n = 114 high socially anxious participants to test the usefulness of new emotion regulation strategies. We explore a number of offline contextual bandits estimators for learning and propose a general framework for learning algorithms. Our experimentation shows that the proposed doubly robust offline learning algorithms performed significantly better than baseline approaches, suggesting that this type of recommender algorithm could improve emotion regulation. Given that emotion regulation is impaired across many mental illnesses and such a recommender algorithm could be scaled up easily, this approach holds potential to increase access to treatment for many people.

Two studies investigated the empathy model of forgiveness. In Study 1, the authors developed measures of empathy and forgiveness. The authors found evidence consistent with the hypotheses that (a) the relationship between receiving an apology from and forgiving one's offender is a function of increased empathy for the offender and (b) that forgiving is uniquely related to conciliatory behavior and avoidance behavior toward the offending partner. In Study 2, the authors conducted an intervention in which empathy was manipulated to examine the empathy-forgiving relationship more closely.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual therapy in the elderly for whom the previous multimodal, biopsychosocial therapeutic programme had not brought the expected results. Twenty-five elderly women with depressive symptoms were randomly divided into a virtual reality group (VR, n = 13) and a control group (Control, n = 12). The average age was 70.73 and the average intensity of depression symptoms amounted to 12.26 in the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30). As a virtual reality source, the VRTierOne (Stolgraf®) device was used. The therapeutic cycle consisted of eight virtual therapy sessions, twice a week for four weeks. As primary and secondary outcome measures, the GDS-30 was performed at three time points. In the VR group, the GDS-30 score was reduced by 36%, and the result persisted in the follow-up tests. Immersive virtual therapy significantly lowered the intensity of depressive symptoms, as well as stress and anxiety levels in older women taking part in the group-based multimodal therapeutic programme, whose earlier therapy had not brought the expected results.",2021.0,55.0,24.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Szczepańska-Gieracha2021VirtualTG,\n author = {J.

However, in interactions between younger and older adults, there is evidence for a reduced ability to accurately decode emotional facial expressions. Previous studies have often followed up this phenomenon by examining the effect of the observers' age. However, decoding emotional faces is also likely to be influenced by stimulus features, and age-related changes in the face such as wrinkles and folds may render facial expressions of older adults harder to decode. In this paper, we review theoretical frameworks and empirical findings on age effects on decoding emotional expressions, with an emphasis on age-of-face effects. We conclude that the age of the face plays an important role for facial expression decoding. Lower expressivity, age-related changes in the face, less elaborated emotion schemas for older faces, negative attitudes toward older adults, and different visual scan patterns and neural processing of older than younger faces may lower decoding accuracy for older faces. Furthermore, age-related stereotypes and age-related changes in the face may bias the attribution of specific emotions such as sadness to older faces.",2014.0,103.0,105.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fölster2014FacialAA,\n author = {Mara Fölster and U.

Mindfulness, the act of paying a deliberate and non-judgmental attention to the present moment, has been shown to have a positive impact on a person's health and subjective well-being--commonly called ""happiness"". Based on an iterative process with meditation teachers and practitioners, we designed a new tool to support mindfulness practices. This tool takes the shape of an augmented sandbox, designed to inspire the user's self-motivation and curiosity. By shaping the sand, the user creates a living miniature world that is projected back onto the sand. The natural elements of the garden are connected to real-time physiological measurements, such as breathing, helping the user to stay focused on the body. Moreover, using a Virtual Reality headset, they can travel inside their garden for a dedicated meditation session.

As recent reviews highlight, this heterogeneity makes likely that video games have both positive and negative consequences for child development. This study investigated the associations between gaming frequency and psychosocial health among children younger than 12 years of age, an understudied cohort in this field. Both parents and children reported children's gaming frequency, with parents also reporting on children's psychosocial health. Given that children may be too young to report the time they spend playing video games accurately, children's reports were scaffolded by a developmentally appropriate measure. We further investigated the potential bias of having parents report both their children's gaming frequency and their children's psychosocial health (i.e., a single source bias). Parental reports of children's gaming frequency were higher than their children's reports. However, a direct test of the potential single source bias rendered null results. Notably, however, while parental reports showed negative associations between gaming and psychosocial health, children's reports showed no associations. Specifically, based on parent reports, children's gaming was associated with more conduct and peer problems, and less prosocial behavior. As children's reports produced no associations between gaming and psychosocial health, parental reports in this study may belie an erroneous set of conclusions. We therefore caution against relying on just one reporter when assessing children's gaming frequency.",2014.0,26.0,39.0,"{'volume': '17 10', 'pages': '\n          639-43\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lobel2014StressfulGI,\n author = {Adam Lobel and I.

Each participant ( N = 82) filled out self-report questionnaires on impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) and time perspective (Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory). Participants were individually shut into an empty room for exactly 7.5 minutes and afterwards asked to report their subjective impressions regarding the experience of time, self and affective reactions. Correlation analyses showed that being more relaxed and having a positive feeling was related to shorter duration estimates and a perceived faster passage of time. Individual traits of impulsivity, present-hedonistic and present-fatalistic time orientation were associated with relative overestimation of duration and a perceived slower passage of time; future orientation was related to an underestimation of duration and a perceived faster passage of time. Multiple regression models show that impulsivity alone predicts the variance related to time estimation of the waiting period. Multiple path analyses reveal that individuals who are more impulsive are less relaxed while waiting and accordingly overestimate duration and feel a slower passage of time. Negative affect and an impulsive present orientation are related to an overestimation of duration and the feeling of a slower passage of time while waiting.",2018.0,65.0,55.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '71-89', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Jokic2018IndividualDI,\n author = {T.

Commonly used emotion regulation questionnaires, however, are predominantly trait-based, and insensitive to situational choice of regulatory strategy. The current work describes the development and validation of the State Emotion Regulation Inventory (SERI), a brief measure of situational use of distraction, reappraisal, brooding and acceptance. In Study 1, an initial item pool was constructed, based on commonly used trait-based emotion regulation surveys. Then, the psychometric properties of the items were examined with a group of 181 participants who recalled a saddening autobiographical event, identified a distressing thought it triggered, and then waited for 3 minutes without instruction, as an opportunity to allow for spontaneous emotion regulation. Participants then completed the initial item pool, and other relevant trait-based scales. Exploratory factor analysis suggested a 4-factor solution, corresponding to the 4 regulatory strategies measured in the SERI. The 4 items to exclusively load highest on each factor were selected for the final measure. Assembled subscales correlated with relevant trait-based subscales in the expected directions. In Study 2, another sample of 155 participants completed the same procedure and the new SERI, and confirmatory factor analysis supported the 4-factor structure of this instrument. As a brief, validated instrument, the SERI may be a useful measure for studies of state emotion regulation, in protocols that use repeated measures in a single session, over the course of multiple sessions, or via ecological momentary assessments.",2017.0,85.0,24.0,"{'volume': '29', 'pages': '1235–1248', 'name': 'Psychological Assessment'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Katz2017MeasuringRI,\n author = {Benjamin A.

The ability to recognize or predict such patterns, especially in patients showing unpredictable reactions and language deficiencies, might be a major step forward in clinical research. Method Thirteen volunteers with intellectual disabilities, who had suffered of at least one event of overt aggression in the preceding 3 months, participated to the study. The protocol consists in the acquisition of continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) throughout approximately two times of 8 h in natural situation, using a T-shirt integrated with sensors. Simultaneously, an observer evaluates the patient’s level of overt excitation from calm (level 1) to extremely tense (level 5) and send online via Bluetooth these triggers into the ECG signals. The HRV indexes were then estimated offline on the basis of the inter-beat intervals recorded by the ECG, independently for the 30 min preceding each behavioral tension marking point, averaged, and compared through non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. Of these, the RMSSD and LF/HF calculations were used to observe the fluctuations of inhibitory activity and cardiovagal balance through different tension states. Results Seven individuals have sufficient reliable data for analysis. They have reached at least a level 3 of behavioral excitation (moderately tense) or more (very to extremely tense, level 4 and 5) and have been retained for further analysis. In sum, a total of 197 periods of tension were kept, made up of 46 periods of slight excitation (level 2), 18 of moderate excitation (level 3), 10 of high excitation (level 4), and 5 of extreme agitation (level 5). Variations in the HRV as a function of degree of excitation are observed for RMSSD index only (inhibitory parasympathetic activity). The changes from calm to increasing levels of excitation are characterized by a significant downfall in RMSSD index when patients were evaluated to be in a very high level of tension (level 4). Conclusion The presence of precursors to agitation, reflected in the falling-off of parasympathetic activity, offers potentially interesting prospects for therapeutic development.",2017.0,65.0,14.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Palix2017ChangesIH,\n author = {J.

However, a possible new application of VR in psychology is as assessment tool: VEs can be considered as an highly sophisticated form of adaptive testing. This chapter describes the context of current psychological assessment and underlines possible advantages of a VR based assessment tool. The chapter also details the characteristics of BIVRS, Body Image Virtual Reality Scale, an assessment tool designed to assess cognitive and affective components of body image. It consists of a non-immersive 3D graphical interface through which the patient is able to choose between 9 figures of different size which vary in size from underweight to overweight. The software was developed in two architectures, the first (A) running on a single user desktop computer equipped with a standard virtual reality development software and the second (B) splitted into a server (B1) accessible via Internet and actually running the same virtual ambient as in (A) and a VRML client (B2) so that anyone can access the application.",1997.0,23.0,58.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '\n          71-9\n        ', 'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riva1997VirtualRA,\n author = {Giuseppe Riva},\n journal = {Studies in health technology and informatics},\n pages = {\n          71-9\n        },\n title = {Virtual reality as assessment tool in psychology.},\n volume = {44},\n year = {1997}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2245740701', 'name': 'Giuseppe Riva'}]"

The aim of this study was to assess how the individual differences in self-reported emotion regulation strategy use relate to levels of both positive and negative psychological well-being. In total, 56 individuals with ASD aged 14–24 years (Mage = 18.15; SDage = 2.30) completed Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Dimensional Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and Autism-Spectrum Quotient – Short. Individuals were grouped into four clusters based on their Emotion Regulation Questionnaire subscale scores. Individuals in the high suppression and low reappraisal group expressed higher depressive symptoms and lower positive well-being when compared with the low suppression and high reappraisal group. Interestingly, individuals who self-reported using both high suppression and reappraisal expressed relatively high positive well-being and low depression symptoms. We suggest that the maladaptive effect of habitual suppression usage may be buffered by the habitual use of reappraisal, and this interaction between adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategy use has clinical implications.",2019.0,84.0,36.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '737 - 749', 'name': 'Autism'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cai2019EmotionRI,\n author = {R.

In the learning task, Ss decided whether a series of nouns sensibly completed corresponding sentence frames that varied in decision difficulty. For half of the Ss, the focus of attention was unconstrained by the demands of this task. The others, however, were required to repeat the targeted noun at the end of the trial as a means of focusing their attention on the task. Depressed Ss in the unfocused condition subsequently recalled fewer words than did both control groups, but this deficit disappeared in the focused condition. These results suggest that depression might not fundamentally impair the resources required for good performance on such tasks. The results' relevance to resource-allocation, initiative, and inhibition accounts of depressive deficits in memory is discussed.",1991.0,31.0,209.0,"{'volume': '120 3', 'pages': '\n          301-9\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of experimental psychology.

We conduct an experiment to measure and model how these color emotions change when texture is added to the color samples. Using a computer monitor, our subjects arrange samples along four scales: warm-cool, masculine-feminine, hard-soft, and heavy-light. Three sample types of increasing visual complexity are used: UC, grayscale textures, and color textures (CTs). To assess the intraobserver variability, the experiment is repeated after 1 week. Our results show that texture fully determines the responses on the Hard-Soft scale, and plays a role of decreasing weight for the masculine-feminine, heavy- light, and warm-cool scales. Using some 25,000 observer responses, we derive color emotion functions that predict the group-averaged scale responses from the samples’ color and texture parameters. For UC samples, the accuracy of our functions is significantly higher (average R2 ¼ 0.88) than that of previously reported functions applied to our data. The functions derived for CT samples have an accuracy of R2 ¼ 0.80. We conclude that when textured samples are used in color emotion studies, the psychological responses may be strongly affected by texture.",2011.0,32.0,34.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': 'Journal of Multimedia'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lucassen2011TextureAC,\n author = {M.

The results confirmed that the subjects used a variety of coping strategies including diversion, suppression, problem solving, minimization, and retaliation and that certain coping strategies influenced the dysphoria experienced as a result of peer stress. High acculturated children used retaliation significantly more often than their low acculturated counterparts and retaliation was found to be associated with less dysphoria for the high acculturated group. In contrast, low acculturated children who utilized suppression tended to report less dysphoria. Contrary to the hypothesis that general self worth would reduce the relationship between peer stressors and dysphoria, it had no bearing on the association for either acculturated group.

Unfortunately, a longer life does not always correspond to a healthier life, as even normal aging is associated with cognitive decline and increased risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases. Episodic memory (EM) is one of the most vulnerable cognitive functions in aging, and its decline is the hallmark of typical Alzheimer’s disease. This memory system is defined as the ability to acquire and recollect personally experienced episodes associated with a specific affective, spatial, and temporal context. However, most of the neuropsychological and experimental tasks currently employed to assess EM consist in learning simple material (e.g., list of words) in highly stereotyped contexts. In the same vein, classical paper-and-pencil or numeric remediation tools have shown their limitations in the transfer of acquired skills to daily life. Virtual reality (VR), thanks to its immersive properties, and the possibility of delivering realistic and complex scenarios, seems a promising tool to address the limitations of the assessment and remediation of EM. Here, we review existing studies employing VR in normal and pathological aging to assess and reeducate EM. Overall, we show that VR has been mainly used via non-immersive systems. Further studies should, therefore, test the impact of different degrees of immersion. Moreover, there is a lack of VR remediation tools specifically targeting EM. We propose that future studies should fill this gap, addressing in particular the adaptivity of VR remediation protocols.",2019.0,43.0,34.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Corte2019EpisodicMA,\n author = {V.

In the real-time domain, there is also a need to deliver realistic virtual characters, with the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as L.A. Noire™ or Heavy Rain™). There have been mixed reactions from audiences to lifelike characters used in movies and games, with some saying that the increased realism highlights subtle imperfections, which can be disturbing. Some developers opt for a stylized rendering (such as cartoon-shading) to avoid a negative reaction [Thompson 2004]. In this paper, we investigate some of the consequences of choosing realistic or stylized rendering in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating appealing virtual characters. We conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to determine whether render style affects how virtual humans are perceived.

A paradigm that examines whether someone can perceive and benefit from regulatory efforts by another person, represented here by a virtual agent, would be highly relevant for experimental studies investigating social emotion regulation, as well as for interventions in the clinical and sub-clinical context. Virtual reality (VR) provides perhaps the ideal opportunity to test social interactions and difficulties with them, as it counters typical methodological problems of behavioral experiments, such as the trade-off between ecological validity and experimental control, as well as the difficulty of replicating social situations. The goal of the present methods paper is twofold: to provide a detailed description of the development of a novel paradigm consisting of two scenarios in VR designed to test the efficacy of social emotion regulation, and to present the anticipated results for the target populations of typically developing and autistic youth. Participants are presented with a virtual school environment and take part in two activities with a class of students and a teacher, all of whom are virtual agents. In both scenarios, participants experience a potentially stressful situation and are subsequently offered emotional support by a friendly student. Throughout the experiment, self-reports in the form of virtual smiley scales and psychophysiological measurements are collected as markers of the participants’ emotional states. Pilot results will be discussed in line with anticipated outcomes, to indicate that the experiment will be able to show the efficacy of social support by a virtual agent and provide insight into social emotion regulation for different populations. The school environment and the character of the friendly student also have the potential to be adapted for follow-up experiments on additional aspects of social emotion regulation for a variety of contexts.",2022.0,53.0,0.0,{'volume': '3'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Stallmann2022SociallySB,\n author = {Lina Stallmann and Daniel Dukes and Michel Tran and Valentin Durand de Gevigney and D.

Failures to appropriately cope with negative thoughts are related to serious mental health issues, such as depression. Consequently, preventive technology-mediated everyday interventions to support coping with negative thoughts are of interest. One promising platform for mental health applications is personalized virtual reality (VR). We developed an explorative VR prototype based on personally relevant textual messages from email, messengers and alike, which trigger negative thoughts. The prototype presented these messages in VR and allowed to physically manipulate them, for example, by physically punching and trashing them. A qualitative empirical exploration (N=10) revealed a general positive shift in thoughts and emotions after using the prototype, mainly in form of increased relaxation and self-reflection. Based on this and further insights, we derive four themes for VR in mental health, touching upon the importance of personalization, immersion and focus, interaction design and embodiment, as well as, integration into everyday life.",2021.0,29.0,3.0,{'name': 'Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Grieger2021TrashIP,\n author = {Florian Grieger and Holger Klapperich and Marc Hassenzahl},\n journal = {Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems},\n title = {Trash It, Punch It, Burn It – Using Virtual Reality to Support Coping with Negative Thoughts},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2089547603', 'name': 'Florian Grieger'}, {'authorId': '2218619', 'name': 'Holger Klapperich'}, {'authorId': '1679757', 'name': 'Marc Hassenzahl'}]"

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise.

2650,ec0072bc37f83f1a81459df43289613e04cc61e1,A contextual-bandit approach to personalized news article recommendation,"Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements, news articles, etc.) to individual users by making use of both content and user information. Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. Second, the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation.
 In this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks.
 The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory. Second, we argue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline using previously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offline evaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33 million events. Results showed a 12.5% click lift compared to a standard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomes even greater when data gets more scarce.",2010.0,92.0,2488.0,{'pages': '661-670'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Li2010ACA,\n author = {Lihong Li and Wei Chu and J.

Therefore, an exploratory study was conducted to examine whether virtual reality (VR) with real-time biofeedback would have potential in training people in an engaging way to develop a new stress-is-enhancing mindset. Materials and Methods: The specific application to improve people's stress mindset that was used in this study is Stressjam. The application was tested on its attractiveness by 111 healthy participants, specifically on their personal involvement through the Personal Involvement Inventory and its usability through the System Usability Scale. In addition to the healthy participants, a group of 64 patients dealing with stress used Stressjam for at least three sessions. The Stress Mindset Measure was used to assess the stress mindset of both groups, at baseline and after finishing their session(s). Results: Stressjam appears to be an application that is user friendly with good user involvement. The healthy participants and the patient sample both had a more positive stress mindset after using the application than at baseline, t(111) = 4.38, P < 0.001, and F(1,63) = 66.57, P < 0.001, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study give some indications that using VR with biofeedback might be useful in working toward a more positive stress mindset. As such, further research into applications such as Stressjam is warranted.",2019.0,31.0,25.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '326 - 331', 'name': 'Games For Health Journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Maarsingh2019ChangingSM,\n author = {Bernard M.

VR app studies with older adults have primarily focused on rehabilitation and physical function including gait, balance, fall prevention, pain management, and cognition. Several systematic reviews have previously been conducted, but much of the extant literature is focused on rehabilitation or other institutional settings, and little is known about the effectiveness of VR apps using immersive headsets to target health outcomes among community-dwelling older adults. Objective The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of VR apps delivered using commercially available immersive headsets to improve physical, mental, or psychosocial health outcomes in community-dwelling older adults. Methods Peer-reviewed publications that included community-dwelling older adults aged ≥60 years residing in residential aged care settings and nursing homes were included. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for systematic reviews of effectiveness evidence. The title of this review was registered with JBI, and the systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Results In total, 7 studies that specifically included community-dwelling older adults were included in this review. VR apps using a head-mounted display led to improvements in a number of health outcomes, including pain management, posture, cognitive functioning specifically related to Alzheimer disease, and a decreased risk of falls. A total of 6 studies reported a statistically significant difference post VR intervention, and 1 study reported an improvement in cognitive function to reduce navigational errors. Only one study reported on the usability and acceptability of the interventions delivered through VR. While one study used a distraction mechanism for pain management, none of the studies used gaming technology to promote enjoyment. Conclusions Interventions to improve health outcomes through VR have demonstrated potential; however, the ability to synthesize findings by primary outcome for the older adult population is not possible. A number of factors, especially related to frailty, usability, and acceptability, also need to be explored before more substantial recommendations on the effectiveness of VR interventions for older adults can be made.

It is found that inference is not possible unless the researcher has prior information specifying the compisition of reference groups. If this information is available, the prospects for inference depend critically on the population relationship between the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes. Inference is difficult to implossible if these variables are functionally dependent or are statistically independent.

However, the diffusion of this approach is still limited by three main issues: poor usability, lack of technical expertise among clinical professionals, and high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce NeuroVR (http://www.neurovr.org--http://www.neurotiv.org), a cost-free virtual reality platform based on open-source software, that allows non-expert users to adapt the content of a pre-designed virtual environment to meet the specific needs of the clinical or experimental setting. Using the NeuroVR Editor, the user can choose the appropriate psychological stimuli/stressors from a database of objects (both 2D and 3D) and videos, and easily place them into the virtual environment. The edited scene can then be visualized in the NeuroVR Player using either immersive or non-immersive displays. Currently, the NeuroVR library includes different virtual scenes (apartment, office, square, supermarket, park, classroom, etc.), covering two of the most studied clinical applications of VR: specific phobias and eating disorders. The NeuroVR Editor is based on Blender (http://www.blender.org), the open source, cross-platform suite of tools for 3D creation, and is available as a completely free resource. An interesting feature of the NeuroVR Editor is the possibility to add new objects to the database. This feature allows the therapist to enhance the patient's feeling of familiarity and intimacy with the virtual scene, i.e., by using photos or movies of objects/people that are part of the patient's daily life, thereby improving the efficacy of the exposure. The NeuroVR platform runs on standard personal computers with Microsoft Windows; the only requirement for the hardware is related to the graphics card, which must support OpenGL.",2007.0,13.0,82.0,"{'volume': '125', 'pages': '\n          394-9\n        ', 'name': 'Studies in health technology and informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riva2007NeuroVRAO,\n author = {G.

Americans: The Moderating Role of Acculturation","Two widely studied strategies of emotion regulation are suppression (inhibiting emotional response) and reappraisal (reframing an emotional experience). Suppression has been associated with greater instances of internalizing (i.e., depression) and externalizing (i.e., gambling) problems. However, among Asian individuals where suppression is encouraged in their collectivistic culture, the opposite effect has been observed. This, however, does not consider Asian Americans, who may be exposed to both collectivistic and western, individualistic cultural norms. One way to account for this cultural discrepancy is through examining acculturation, the extent to which an individual is assimilated into their host or heritage culture. The present study aimed to examine whether acculturation influences the strength of the association between emotion regulation strategies (suppression and reappraisal) and internalizing/externalizing problems in a sample of Filipino Americans. Participants completed a virtual gambling task assessing their externalizing problems, as well as a series of questionnaires assessing their acculturation, emotion regulation strategy frequencies, and internalizing problems. The results of the study showed that Filipino Americans who retain more Filipino cultural norms may make less low-risk decisions when engaging in cognitive reappraisal.",2023.0,134.0,0.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Manalastas2023EmotionRS,\n author = {G.

One major limitation of this approach has been that it fails to incorporate characters’ psychology, and as a consequence important aesthetic aspects of the narrative cannot be easily captured by Interactive Storytelling. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to Interactive Storytelling which aims at reconciling narrative actions with the characters’ attributed psychology as stated in the narrative. Our long-term goal is to be able to explore Interactive Storytelling for those narrative genres which are based on the characters’ psychology rather than solely on their actions. We used as a starting point the formalisation by Flaubert himself of his novel Madame Bovary, which includes a detailed account of character’s desires and feelings. We describe a prototype in which characters’ behaviour is driven by a real-time searchbased planning system applying operators whose content is based on a specific inventory of feelings. Furthermore, the actual pattern of evolution of the character’s plan, as measured through the variation of the search heuristic, is used to confer a sense of awareness to the characters, which can be used to generate feelings about its overall situation, from feelings of boredom to hope, despair and helplessness.",2007.0,28.0,41.0,{'pages': '111-118'},"{'bibtex': ""@Inproceedings{Pizzi2007AffectiveSB,\n author = {D.

However, the temporal relationship of these variables has not been investigated. It is hypothesised that, in healthy populations, negative schemas will trigger delusional thinking through the mediating influence of negative mood. The strength of this association is predicted to be moderated by psychological flexibility. A total of 700 participants completed a survey assessing negative schemas, delusional thinking, mood, and psychological flexibility. All measures were re-administered six months later with a sub group of participants (204). Negative schemas significantly predicted higher rates of delusional thinking concurrently. Indirect effect testing revealed that the relationship between negative schemas and delusional thinking was partially mediated through anxiety, and that this indirect effect was moderated by psychological flexibility. Longitudinal cross-lag analysis showed that Time 1 anxiety predicted delusional ideation over time and the effect of Time 1 negative schemas on Time 2 delusional ideation was fully mediated by Time 2 anxiety. These results describe the processes by which negative schemas promote delusional thinking in healthy individuals.

Both approaches lead to good performance but at a high cost. To determine the best trade-off between performance and cost, we perform a systematic evaluation of human and synthesized voices with regard to naturalness, conversational aspect, and likability. We vary the type (in-domain vs. out-of-domain), length, and content of utterances, and take into account the age and native language of raters as well as their familiarity with speech synthesis. We present detailed results from two studies, a pilot one and one run on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Our results suggest that a professional human voice can supersede both an amateur human voice and synthesized voices. Also, a high-quality general-purpose voice or a good limited-domain voice can perform better than amateur human recordings. We do not find any significant differences between the performance of a high-quality general-purpose voice and a limited-domain voice, both trained with speech recorded by actors. As expected, the high-quality general-purpose voice is rated higher than the limited-domain voice for out-of-domain sentences and lower for in-domain sentences.

In this paper, we first propose and evaluate plug-and-play methods for controllable response generation, which does not require dialogue specific datasets and does not rely on fine-tuning a large model. While effective, the decoding procedure induces considerable computational overhead, rendering the conversational model unsuitable for interactive usage. To overcome this, we introduce an approach that does not require further computation at decoding time, while also does not require any fine-tuning of a large language model.

Mobile health tools can address this scalability challenge. iREST, or interactive Resilience Enhancing Sleep Tactics, is a mobile health platform designed to provide a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) in the assessment, monitoring, and delivery of evidence-based sleep recommendations in a scalable and personalized manner. The platform includes a mobile phone–based patient app linked to a clinician portal. Objective The first aim of the pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of JITAI using the iREST platform for delivering evidence-based sleep interventions in a sample of military service members and veterans. The second aim was to explore the potential effectiveness of this treatment delivery form relative to habitual in-person delivery. Methods In this pilot study, military service members and veterans between the ages of 18 and 60 years who reported clinically significant service-related sleep disturbances were enrolled as participants. Participants were asked to use iREST for a period of 4 to 6 weeks during which time they completed a daily sleep/wake diary. Through the clinician portal, trained clinicians offered recommendations consistent with evidence-based behavioral sleep treatments on weeks 2 through 4. To explore potential effectiveness, self-report measures were used, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the PSQI Addendum for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Results A total of 27 participants completed the posttreatment assessments. Between pre- and postintervention, clinically and statistically significant improvements in primary and secondary outcomes were detected (eg, a mean reduction on the ISI of 9.96, t26=9.99, P<.001). At posttreatment, 70% (19/27) of participants met the criteria for treatment response and 59% (16/27) achieved remission. Comparing these response and remission rates with previously published results for in-person trials showed no significant differences. Conclusion Participants who received evidence-based recommendations from their assigned clinicians through the iREST platform showed clinically significant improvements in insomnia severity, overall sleep quality, and disruptive nocturnal disturbances.

To assess the effectiveness of a group program aimed at improving well-being among individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Methods. A randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate a residential program designed to teach breathing, movement, and meditation techniques. Sixty-two participants were recruited from community HIV/AIDS organizations. Fifteen withdrawals from the study left 47 study participants. Standardized measures used were the Mental Health Index (MHI), the MOS-HIV Health Survey (MOS), and the Daily Stress Inventory (DSI), along with qualitative interviews. Results. A repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated positive changes in well-being on the MHI and the MOS, where the effect was primarily seen immediately following the program and disappeared at later data points. The DSI indicated an increase in experience and impact of stress over time for the intervention group postprogram. Alternatively, the qualitative interviews described positive changes in how participants were living their day-to-day lives. Conclusion. In order to capture the outcomes of this program properly, both qualitative and quantitative measures are needed.",2006.0,10.0,52.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '192 - 195', 'name': 'American Journal of Health Promotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brazier2006EvaluatingAY,\n author = {Alison S A Brazier and Andrea L.

These findings are consistent with the resource allocation model of mood effects, which attributes impaired comprehension to the activation of intrusive, irrelevant thoughts during reading of the passage.

2698,f0e1a2187c03310fe37ecb6d5cbb50076f0133ae,Treatment gap in mental health care.,"Mental disorders are highly prevalent and cause considerable suffering and disease burden. To compound this public health problem, many individuals with psychiatric disorders remain untreated although effective treatments exist. We examine the extent of this treatment gap. We reviewed community-based psychiatric epidemiology studies that used standardized diagnostic instruments and included data on the percentage of individuals receiving care for schizophrenia and other non-affective psychotic disorders, major depression, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and alcohol abuse or dependence. The median rates of untreated cases of these disorders were calculated across the studies. Examples of the estimation of the treatment gap for WHO regions are also presented. Thirty-seven studies had information on service utilization. The median treatment gap for schizophrenia, including other non-affective psychosis, was 32.2%. For other disorders the gap was: depression, 56.3%; dysthymia, 56.0%; bipolar disorder, 50.2%; panic disorder, 55.9%; GAD, 57.5%; and OCD, 57.3%. Alcohol abuse and dependence had the widest treatment gap at 78.1%. The treatment gap for mental disorders is universally large, though it varies across regions. It is likely that the gap reported here is an underestimate due to the unavailability of community-based data from developing countries where services are scarcer. To address this major public health challenge, WHO has adopted in 2002 a global action programme that has been endorsed by the Member States.",2004.0,111.0,1519.0,"{'volume': '45 2', 'pages': '\n          80-2\n        ', 'name': 'The Israel journal of psychiatry and related sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kohn2004TreatmentGI,\n author = {R.

2699,f106e3afbdd01022962d7a73a847869d0534a036,Hidden Markov model-based speech emotion recognition,In this contribution we introduce speech emotion recognition by use of continuous hidden Markov models. Two methods are propagated and compared throughout the paper. Within the first method a global statistics framework of an utterance is classified by Gaussian mixture models using derived features of the raw pitch and energy contour of the speech signal. A second method introduces increased temporal complexity applying continuous hidden Markov models considering several states using low-level instantaneous features instead of global statistics. The paper addresses the design of working recognition engines and results achieved with respect to the alluded alternatives. A speech corpus consisting of acted and spontaneous emotion samples in German and English language is described in detail. Both engines have been tested and trained using this equivalent speech corpus. Results in recognition of seven discrete emotions exceeded 86% recognition rate. As a basis of comparison the similar judgment of human deciders classifying the same corpus at 79.8% recognition rate was analyzed.,2003.0,6.0,613.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': 'I-401', 'name': ""2003 International Conference on Multimedia and Expo.

The present work investigates the effects of the presence of a pedagogical agent in the learning environment on intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load for the dyscalculia and non- learner population. The proposed system intelligently investigates the learner, recommends an exclusive learning dyscalculia path and after tutoring assesses learning gain, and retention. Learner experience and effects of the pedagogical agent on types of cognitive loads are discussed on basis of post tutoring analysis. Samples of 82 learners have been studied, experimental findings based on research questions have been reported and conclusions discussed. Our assumption that ‘a well-articulated and well-designed instructional design exerts a minimal extraneous cognitive load on learners and facilitates learning gain and retention’ is consistent with the obtained results. The result concludes that pedagogical agent does not add to intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load.

However, whether virtual musical experiences lead to different experiences of social presence or differential use of emotion regulation strategies (ERSs) compared to live musical experiences remains un-researched. We compared the experiences of 1,158 singers in a virtual choir (VC) with the experiences of 1,158 singers from a live choir using propensity score matching based on a range of demographic, social and musical factors. Participants in VCs reported a slightly greater feeling of social presence than participants in live choirs [t(1157) = -19.85, p < 0.002]. They also made less use of overall ERSs [t(1157) = 3.10, p = 0.002], avoidance strategies [t(1157) = 4.51, p < 0.001], and approach strategies [t(1157) = 3.34, p < 0.001]. However, they made greater use of self-development strategies [t(1157) = -3.11, p = 0.002]. Social presence was associated with greater use of all ERSs. This study showed that although a sense of social presence in a choir is not reduced by engagement in VCs compared to live choirs, there is a lowered use of ERSs when engaging in VCs. However, as the difference in use of ERSs is relatively modest, virtual musical experiences may still have a role to play in supporting those who cannot engage in live experiences such as people who are socially isolated.",2019.0,52.0,21.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '10'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fancourt2019PresentIB,\n author = {D.

A 10-question screening scale of psychological distress and a six-question short-form scale embedded within the 10-question scale were developed for the redesigned US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Methods. Initial pilot questions were administered in a US national mail survey (N = 1401). A reduced set of questions was subsequently administered in a US national telephone survey (N = 1574). The 10-question and six-question scales, which we refer to as the K10 and K6, were constructed from the reduced set of questions based on Item Response Theory models. The scales were subsequently validated in a two-stage clinical reappraisal survey (N = 1000 telephone screening interviews in the first stage followed by N = 153 face-to-face clinical interviews in the second stage that oversampled first-stage respondents who screened positive for emotional problems) in a local convenience sample. The second-stage sample was administered the screening scales along with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). The K6 was subsequently included in the 1997 (N = 36116) and 1998 (N = 32440) US National Health Interview Survey, while the K10 was included in the 1997 (N = 10641) Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being. Results. Both the K10 and K6 have good precision in the 90th–99th percentile range of the population distribution (standard errors of standardized scores in the range 0·20–0·25) as well as consistent psychometric properties across major sociodemographic subsamples. The scales strongly discriminate between community cases and non-cases of DSM-IV/SCID disorders, with areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0·87–0·88 for disorders having Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores of 0–70 and 0·95–0·96 for disorders having GAF scores of 0–50. Conclusions. The brevity, strong psychometric properties, and ability to discriminate DSM-IV cases from non-cases make the K10 and K6 attractive for use in general-purpose health surveys. The scales are already being used in annual government health surveys in the US and Canada as well as in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. Routine inclusion of either the K10 or K6 in clinical studies would create an important, and heretofore missing, crosswalk between community and clinical epidemiology.",2002.0,63.0,7503.0,"{'volume': '32', 'pages': '959 - 976', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kessler2002ShortSS,\n author = {R.

2707,f23a67ed6ccb43ba95731bb5867709271ffa7cc8,A first look at individuals' affective ratings of vibrations,"Affective response may dominate users' reactions to the synthesized tactile sensations that are proliferating in today's handheld and gaming devices, yet it is largely unmeasured, modeled or characterized. A better understanding of user perception will aid the design of tactile behavior that engages touch, with an experience that satisfies rather than intrudes. We measured 30 subjects' affective response to vibrations varying in rhythm and frequency, then examined how differences in demographic, everyday use of touch, and tactile processing abilities contribute to variations in affective response. To this end, we developed five affective and sensory rating scales and two tactile performance tasks, and also employed a published `Need for Touch' (NFT) questionnaire. Subjects' ratings, aggregated, showed significant correlations among the five scales and significant effect of the signal content (rhythm and frequency). Ratings varied considerably among subjects, but this variation did not coincide with demographic, NFT score or tactile task performance. The linkages found among the rating scales confirm this as a promising approach. The next step towards a comprehensive picture of individuals' patterns of affective response to tactile sensations entails pruning, integration and redundancy reduction of these scales, then their formal validation.",2013.0,24.0,54.0,"{'pages': '605-610', 'name': '2013 World Haptics Conference (WHC)'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Seifi2013AFL,\n author = {H.

Literature showing that individuals with ASD display deficits in ToM is extensive and robust. However, some related issues deserve more research: the heterogeneous profile of ToM abilities in children with ASD and the association between different levels of ToM development and social, pragmatic, and adaptive behaviors in everyday life. The first objective of this study was to identify profiles of children with ASD without intellectual disability (ID), based on explicit and applied ToM knowledge, and compare these profiles with a group of children with typical development (TD). A second objective was to determine differences in symptom severity, adaptive/social behavior, and pragmatic abilities between the profiles identified. Fifty-two children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD without ID and 37 children with TD performed neuropsychological ToM tasks and two vocabulary and memory tests. In addition, all of their mothers completed different questionnaires about applied ToM abilities, severity of ASD symptoms, adaptive/social skills, and pragmatic competence. Two subgroups were identified in the cluster analysis carried out with explicit and applied ToM indicators. The “Lower ToM abilities” profile obtained significantly lower scores than the “Higher ToM abilities” profile on all the ToM measures. Furthermore, the analysis of covariance, controlling for vocabulary and working memory (ANCOVAs), showed statistically significant differences in applied ToM abilities between the two groups of children with ASD without ID and the group with TD. However, only the group with “Higher ToM abilities” achieved similar performance to the TD group on the verbal task of explicit ToM knowledge. Finally, the “Lower ToM abilities” cluster obtained significantly higher scores on autism symptoms (social and communication domains) and lower scores on adaptive behavior and pragmatic skills than the cluster with “Higher ToM abilities.” Taken together, these findings have implications for understanding the heterogeneity in ToM skills in children with ASD without ID, and their differential impact on social, communicative, and adaptive behaviors.",2020.0,101.0,32.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Roselló2020TheoryOM,\n author = {B.

We developed a protocol for inducing moderate psychologic stress in a functional imaging setting and evaluated the effects of stress on physiology and brain activation.


METHODS
The Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST), derived from the Trier Mental Challenge Test, consists of a series of computerized mental arithmetic challenges, along with social evaluative threat components that are built into the program or presented by the investigator. To allow the effects of stress and mental arithmetic to be investigated separately, the MIST has 3 test conditions (rest, control and experimental), which can be presented in either a block or an event-related design, for use with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET). In the rest condition, subjects look at a static computer screen on which no tasks are shown. In the control condition, a series of mental arithmetic tasks are displayed on the computer screen, and subjects submit their answers by means of a response interface. In the experimental condition, the difficulty and time limit of the tasks are manipulated to be just beyond the individual's mental capacity. In addition, in this condition the presentation of the mental arithmetic tasks is supplemented by a display of information on individual and average performance, as well as expected performance. Upon completion of each task, the program presents a performance evaluation to further increase the social evaluative threat of the situation.


RESULTS
In 2 independent studies using PET and a third independent study using fMRI, with a total of 42 subjects, levels of salivary free cortisol for the whole group were significantly increased under the experimental condition, relative to the control and rest conditions. Performing mental arithmetic was linked to activation of motor and visual association cortices, as well as brain structures involved in the performance of these tasks (e.g., the angular gyrus).

We propose the MIST as a tool for investigating the effects of perceiving and processing psychosocial stress in functional imaging studies.",2005.0,13.0,536.0,"{'volume': '30 5', 'pages': '\n          319-25\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dedovic2005TheMI,\n author = {K.

Methods We employed a scoping review methodology to rapidly map the field of ML in mental health. Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review. Results Three hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering. Conclusions Overall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health.

Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by deep learning a neural embedding across more than 1.8 billion words of modern fiction. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered filter. Empath also analyzes text across 200 built-in, pre-validated categories we have generated from common topics in our web dataset, like neglect, government, and social media.

Data can be collected from the onboard sensors and other phone logs embedded in today’s off-the-shelf smartphone devices. These data permit fine-grained, continuous collection of people’s social interactions (e.g., speaking rates in conversation, size of social groups, calls, and text messages), daily activities (e.g., physical activity and sleep), and mobility patterns (e.g., frequency and duration of time spent at various locations). In this article, we have drawn on the lessons from the first wave of smartphone-sensing research to highlight areas of opportunity for psychological research, present practical considerations for designing smartphone studies, and discuss the ongoing methodological and ethical challenges associated with research in this domain.

Our solution has focused on implementing a platform for reasoning about emotions that supports the testing of such theories. 
In the platform we model a multi-agent world and give simple affective life to agents in the form of rudimentary emotions and emotion-induced actions. In addition the agents are able to reason about emotion episodes that take place in one another's lives. The implementation includes representations for twenty-four emotion types (based on the work Ortony et al., 1988) and 1400 emotion-induced actions. Agents have rudimentary personalities, including an interpretive component which causes them to construe the world in idiosyncratic ways leading to emotional states, and an expressive component which give agents a unique profile for manifesting their emotions. Agents keep internal models of the concerns of other agents which allow them to explain the emotional episodes of other agents by classifying them as instances in which one or more of the twenty-four emotion types arise. 
The implementation is simulation-based. It has been run with up to forty agents at a time. Situations arise in the modeled world, agents respond to some of these in their own unique, emotional, ways. Emotion-induced actions are generated which may be placed back in the simulation queue and further perturb the system. Other agents observe and explain the situations using both strong-theory reasoning based on a set of emotion rules, and weak-theory reasoning using a case-based heuristic classification system.",1992.0,0.0,604.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Elliott1992TheAR,\n author = {C.

The extent to which eight forms of coping mediated each of four sets of emotions was evaluated with a series of hierarchical regression analyses (of residuals).

We investigated the development of emotion recognition abilities through childhood and adolescence, testing the hypothesis that children’s ability to recognize simple emotions is modulated by chronological age, pubertal stage and gender. In order to establish norms, we assessed 478 children aged 6–16 years, using the Ekman-Friesen Pictures of Facial Affect. We then modeled these cross-sectional data in terms of competence in accurate recognition of the six emotions studied, when the positive correlation between emotion recognition and IQ was controlled. Significant linear trends were seen in children’s ability to recognize facial expressions of happiness, surprise, fear, and disgust; there was improvement with increasing age. In contrast, for sad and angry expressions there is little or no change in accuracy over the age range 6–16 years; near-adult levels of competence are established by middle-childhood. In a sampled subset, pubertal status influenced the ability to recognize facial expressions of disgust and anger; there was an increase in competence from mid to late puberty, which occurred independently of age. A small female advantage was found in the recognition of some facial expressions. The normative data provided in this study will aid clinicians and researchers in assessing the emotion recognition abilities of children and will facilitate the identification of abnormalities in a skill that is often impaired in neurodevelopmental disorders. If emotion recognition abilities are a good model with which to understand adolescent development, then these results could have implications for the education, mental health provision and legal treatment of teenagers.",2015.0,93.0,261.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lawrence2015AgeGA,\n author = {K.

2739,f5e61ef588ad90ec1d6349d23c8af8d00eaf457a,Integrating Empathy and Interpersonal Emotion Regulation.,"When individuals experience empathy, they often seek to bolster others' well-being. But what do empathizers want others to feel? Though psychologists have studied empathy and prosociality for decades, this question has yet to be clearly addressed. This is because virtually all existing research focuses on a model under which improving others' well-being also comprises heightening their positive affect or decreasing their negative affect and helping them reach their own emotional goals. In this review, I argue that real-life empathic goals encompass a broader range-including sometimes worsening targets' affect or contravening their wishes in order to improve their well-being-that can be productively integrated into the framework of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). I review the empathic IER spectrum in a number of contexts, including close relationships, professional caregiving, and group-based emotions. Integrating empathy and IER provides a synthetic and generative way to ask new questions about how social emotions produce prosocial actions.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10‐session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods Sixty‐eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent‐, child‐, and clinician‐reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10‐week follow‐up. Results Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow‐up. Conclusions This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD. Additional investigations are needed to further establish its relative efficacy compared to more traditional models of CBT for children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.",2018.0,80.0,95.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '1180 - 1191', 'name': 'Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Weiss2018ARW,\n author = {J.

For instance, cognitive reappraisal (reframing an emotional situation) is generally an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy (i.e., it is associated with increased psychological health). However, a person-by-situation approach suggests that the adaptiveness of different emotion-regulation strategies depends on the context in which they are used. Specifically, reappraisal may be adaptive when stressors are uncontrollable (when the person can regulate only the self) but maladaptive when stressors can be controlled (when the person can change the situation). To test this prediction, we measured cognitive-reappraisal ability, the severity of recent life stressors, stressor controllability, and level of depression in 170 participants. For participants with uncontrollable stress, higher cognitive-reappraisal ability was associated with lower levels of depression. In contrast, for participants with controllable stress, higher cognitive-reappraisal ability was associated with greater levels of depression. These findings support a theoretical model in which particular emotion-regulation strategies are not adaptive or maladaptive per se; rather, their adaptiveness depends on the context.",2013.0,40.0,393.0,"{'volume': '24', 'pages': '2505 - 2514', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Troy2013APA,\n author = {Allison S.

The program was assessed to determine if it improved social skills at school and home, and whether improvements were maintained. Methods: Eighty-four students participated. Key outcomes were parent and teacher ratings of emotion regulation, social skills, and direct child social problem-solving measures. The standard school curriculum served as the control condition. Phase 1 was a two-group waitlist-control comparison of SAS versus the standard curriculum. Phase 2 was a follow up of all participants before and after the intervention and at 12-months post-intervention. Results: Parent and child measures improved after the intervention but not in the waitlist condition. Improvements in parent, child, and teacher measures were apparent at 12 months. Conclusions: The SAS Program warrants further research as a potential program for schools that serve children with ASD.",2018.0,61.0,29.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '29 - 39', 'name': 'Journal of Intellectual & Developmental Disability'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Einfeld2018SchoolbasedSS,\n author = {S.

Antonio Damasio contends that rational decisions are not the product of logic alone - they require the support of emotion and feeling. Drawing on his experience with neurological patients affected with brain damage, Dr Damasio shows how absence of emotions and feelings can break down rationality. He also offers a new perspective on what emotions and feelings actually are: a direct view of our own body states; a link between the body and its survival-oriented regulation on the one hand, and consciousness on the other.

It is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images.

The present research employed a four-year longitudinal design with peer-reported measures of social functioning to examine the long-term social effects of emotion regulation. Individual differences in suppression before entering college predicted weaker social connections (e.g., less close relationships) at the end of college, whereas reappraisal predicted stronger social connections and more favorable sociometric standing (e.g., higher social status). These effects of emotion regulation remained intact even when controlling for baseline social functioning and Big Five personality traits.

However, the literature includes many different emotion regulation strategies but little examination of how they relate to one another, making it difficult to interpret and synthesize findings. The goal of this meta-analysis was to examine the underlying structure of common emotion regulation strategies (i.e., acceptance, behavioral avoidance, distraction, experiential avoidance, expressive suppression, mindfulness, problem solving, reappraisal, rumination, worry), and to evaluate this structure in light of theoretical models of emotion regulation. We also examined how distress tolerance—an important emotion regulation ability — relates to strategy use. We conducted meta-analyses estimating the correlations between emotion regulation strategies (based on 331 samples and 670 effect sizes), as well as between distress tolerance and strategies. The resulting meta-analytic correlation matrix was submitted to confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses. None of the confirmatory models, based on prior theory, was an acceptable fit to the data. Exploratory factor analysis suggested that 3 underlying factors best characterized these data. Two factors— labeled Disengagement and Aversive Cognitive Perseveration— emerged as strongly correlated but distinct factors, with the latter consisting of putatively maladaptive strategies. The third factor, Adaptive Engagement, was a less unified factor and weakly related to the other 2 factors. Distress tolerance was most closely associated with low levels of repetitive negative thought and experiential avoidance, and high levels of acceptance and mindfulness.

Thus, prevention of psychological problems in this population becomes crucial. According to the World Health Organization (1), prevention should also include the promotion and development of the individual’s strengths in order to reduce vulnerability to suffering from mental disorders. In addition, other key elements of prevention are the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of interventions. The information and communication technologies, especially the Internet, have much to offer in terms of the prevention and promotion of positive mental health in adolescents.

Although this research has traditionally focused on men who strongly adhere to traditional gender norms, men who negatively evaluate themselves as falling short of these norms (a construct termed masculine discrepancy stress) have proven to be at increased risk of IPV perpetration. Likewise, men experiencing problems with emotion regulation, a multidimensional construct reflecting difficulties in effectively experiencing and responding to emotional states, are also at risk of IPV perpetration. In the present research, we tested the hypothesis that the link between discrepancy stress and IPV perpetration is mediated via difficulties in emotion regulation. Three hundred fifty-seven men completed online surveys assessing their experience of discrepancy stress, emotion-regulation difficulties, and history of IPV perpetration. Results indicated that discrepancy-stressed men’s use of physical IPV was fully mediated by emotion-regulation difficulties. In addition, emotion-regulation difficulties partially mediated the association between discrepancy stress and sexual IPV.

To the traditional scenario where students interact primarily with a single coach or tutor character on-screen, we introduce the addition of both a social, animate colearner, and the student's own avatar character. Variations of the colearner's attributes, informed by research literature on human partners, are explored through an online testbed application of English language idioms. Results from an experimental study with 76 Japanese college students reveal that cooperative colearners have a positive impact on students' performance and experience, as well as increasing perceptions of the character's intelligence and credibility.

The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanisms underlying the impact of self-stigma on depression and anxiety in a collectivistic culture such as the Philippines. Specifically, this study sought to examine: (1) the mediating role of self-criticism on the impact of self-stigma on depression and anxiety, and (2) the moderating role of interdependent self-construal on the impact of self-criticism on depression and anxiety in Filipinos. Surveys measuring self-stigma, self-criticism, interdependent self-construal, depression, and anxiety symptoms were administered to 312 adolescents in rural communities in the Philippines. Using structural equation modeling, findings revealed indirect effects of self-stigma on both depression and anxiety via self-criticism. Findings confirmed that interdependent self-construal attenuate the detrimental impact of self-criticism on depression and anxiety in collectivistic contexts. This study offers novel insights about the underlying mechanisms that operate in the impact of self-stigma on depression and anxiety symptoms among individuals in collectivist contexts. We highlight that self-criticism may have both adaptive and maladaptive functions in collectivist cultures. The study provides implications on the importance of culturally sensitive clinical interventions in preventing depression and anxiety by combating self-stigma and the negative aspect of self-criticism in collectivist cultures.

Ironically, few studies have investigated the link between how well spouses regulate emotion and how satisfied they are with their marriages. We utilized data from a 13-year, 3-wave longitudinal study of middle-aged (40-50 years old) and older (60-70 years old) long-term married couples, focusing on the associations between downregulation of negative emotion (measured during discussions of an area of marital conflict at Wave 1) and marital satisfaction (measured at all 3 waves). Downregulation of negative emotion was assessed by determining how quickly spouses reduced signs of negative emotion (in emotional experience, emotional behavior, and physiological arousal) after negative emotion events. Data were analyzed using actor-partner interdependence modeling. Findings showed that (a) greater downregulation of wives' negative experience and behavior predicted greater marital satisfaction for wives and husbands concurrently and (b) greater downregulation of wives' negative behavior predicted increases in wives' marital satisfaction longitudinally. Wives' use of constructive communication (measured between Waves 1 and 2) mediated the longitudinal associations. These results show the benefits of wives' downregulation of negative emotion during conflict for marital satisfaction and point to wives' constructive communication as a mediating pathway.",2014.0,164.0,223.0,"{'volume': '14 1', 'pages': '\n          130-44\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Bloch2014EmotionRP,\n author = {L.

Recent empirical evidence in support of the model is reviewed.

However, there are some problems existing in traditional methods: 1) They treat HAR as a single label classification task, and ignore the information from other related tasks, which is helpful for the original task. 2) They need to predesign features artificially, which are heuristic and not tightly related to HAR task. To address these problems, we propose AROMA (human activity recognition using deep multi-task learning). Human activities can be divided into simple and complex activities. They are closely linked. Simple and complex activity recognitions are two related tasks in AROMA. For simple activity recognition task, AROMA utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract deep features, which are task dependent and non-handcrafted. For complex activity recognition task, AROMA applies a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn the temporal context of activity data. In addition, there is a shared structure between the two tasks, and the object functions of these two tasks are optimized jointly. We evaluate AROMA on two public datasets, and the experimental results show that AROMA is able to yield a competitive performance in both simple and complex activity recognitions. 1",2018.0,37.0,84.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '74:1-74:16', 'name': 'Proc.

The relation between strategy understanding and actual self-regulation was also examined. In a sample of 116 boys and girls, 4-year-olds recognized and generated strategies for anger more than 3-year-olds but 3- and 4-year-olds recognized and generated strategies similarly for sadness. Age effects for strategy generation were explained by expressive language skill. Maternal support in response to child distress was related to strategy recognition and generation but in different ways. Maternal structuring was related only to strategy generation for anger. Child strategy understanding of anger and sadness predicted different child behaviors when children had to deal with frustration alone.

Using methods designed to study epistemic trust in human informants (e.g., Koenig, Clement, & Harris, 2004), the current study investigates children’s and adults’ selective trust in a technological and human informant. Children (ages 4 and 5) and adults were presented with queries designed to probe their willingness to seek out and accept information from human versus technological informants.

However, empirical evidence supporting the claim that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and to explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). Results of Study 1 show that over the course of eight weeks participants in both conditions reported feeling empathetic and connected to the homeless at similar rates, however, participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who performed a traditional perspective-taking task. Study 2 compared three different types of perspective-taking tasks with different levels of immersion (traditional vs. desktop computer vs. VR) and a control condition (where participants received fact-driven information about the homeless). Results show that participants who performed any type of perspective-taking task reported feeling more empathetic and connected to the homeless than the participants who only received information. Replicating the results from Study 1, there was no difference in self-report measures for any of the perspective-taking conditions, however, a significantly higher number of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing for the homeless compared to the traditional and less immersive conditions.

One key research question is how to properly express intimate self-disclosure. In this paper we present an extensive study of human nonverbal behavior during intimate self-disclosure. This is an important milestone in creating a virtual counselor. A study of video interactions between human participants demonstrated that people display more head tilts and pauses when they revealed highly intimate information about themselves; they presented more head nods and eye gazes during less intimate sharing. An implementation of these behaviors in a virtual agent suggests that people tend to perceive head tilts, pauses and gaze aversion by the agent as conveying intimate self-disclosure.

Objectives: Physical activity (PA) positively influences several aspects of mental well-being including affect improvements. Yet, the fact that subjective and objective measures of PA often diverge challenges research on the relationship of PA and affect. Methods: Subjective (ecological momentary assessment, EMA) and objective (combined heart rate and accelerometric activity tracker) measures of PA alongside repeated ratings of positive and negative affects were obtained from 37 participants over 7 consecutive days. Results: Subjective and objective PA were significantly positively correlated. Affect improvements, that is, negative affect decrease as well as positive affect increase, were predicted by both subjective (EMA) and objective (activity tracker) data. Conclusions: Measurement concordance supports the validity of both assessment strategies.

With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.",2018.0,102.0,215.0,"{'volume': '21', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fiske2018YourRT,\n author = {A.

Research on this disparity to date is largely predicated on methodology that is insensitive to within day SGM-based discrimination experiences, or their relation to momentary nicotine and substance use risk. We address this knowledge gap in the current study using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Method: Fifty SGM individuals, between 18 and 45 years of age, were recruited from an inland northwestern university, regardless of their nicotine or substance use history, and invited to participate in an EMA study. Each were prompted to provide data, six times daily (between 10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.) for 14 days, regarding SGM-based discrimination, other forms of mistreatment, and nicotine, drug, and alcohol use since their last prompt. Results: Discrimination experiences that occurred since individuals’ last measurement prompt were associated with greater odds of nicotine and substance use during the same measurement window. Substance use was also more likely to occur in relation to discrimination reported two measurements prior in lagged models. Relative to other forms of mistreatment, discrimination effects were consistently larger in magnitude and became stronger throughout the day/evening. Conclusion: This study adds to existing minority stress research by highlighting the both immediate and delayed correlates of daily SGM-based discrimination experiences. These results also contribute to our understanding of daily stress processes and provide insight into ways we might mitigate these effects using real-time monitoring and intervention technology.",2017.0,71.0,64.0,"{'volume': '85', 'pages': '1131–1143', 'name': 'Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Livingston2017EcologicalMA,\n author = {Nicholas A.

As the amount of MVs is explosively increasing, it has become an important task to develop new techniques for effective MV analysis, retrieval, and management. By stimulating the human affective response mechanism, affective video content analysis extracts the affective information contained in videos, and, with the affective information, natural, user-friendly, and effective MV access strategies could be developed. In this paper, a novel integrated system (i.MV) is proposed for personalized MV affective analysis, visualization, and retrieval. In i.MV, we not only perform the personalized MV affective analysis, which is a challenging and insufficiently covered problem in current affective content analysis field, but also propose novel affective visualization to convert the abstract affective states intuitive and friendly to users. Based on the affective analysis and visualization, affective information based MV retrieval is achieved. Both comprehensive experiments and subjective user studies on a large MV dataset demonstrate that our personalized affective analysis is more effective than the previous algorithms. In addition, affective visualization is proved to be more suitable for affective information-based MV retrieval than the commonly used affective state representation strategies.",2010.0,45.0,108.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '510-522', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Multimedia'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2010AffectiveVA,\n author = {Shiliang Zhang and Qingming Huang and Shuqiang Jiang and Wen Gao and Q.

These deficits have been previously linked to problems with social cognition. However, we reasoned that AS/HFA individuals' Theory of Mind deficits also might lead to problems with emotion regulation. To assess emotional functioning in AS/HFA, 27 AS/HFA adults (16 women) and 27 age-, gender-, and education-matched typically developing (TD) participants completed a battery of measures of emotion experience, labeling, and regulation. With respect to emotion experience, individuals with AS/HFA reported higher levels of negative emotions, but similar levels of positive emotions, compared with TD individuals. With respect to emotion labeling, individuals with AS/HFA had greater difficulties identifying and describing their emotions, with approximately two-thirds exceeding the cutoff for alexithymia. With respect to emotion regulation, individuals with AS/HFA used reappraisal less frequently than TD individuals and reported lower levels of reappraisal self-efficacy. Although AS/HFA individuals used suppression more frequently than TD individuals, no difference in suppression self-efficacy was found. It is important to note that these differences in emotion regulation were evident even when controlling for emotion experience and labeling.

 The development of virtual enterprise is inseparable from the support of partners. Due to information asymmetry, the choice of virtual enterprise partners is blind, and simple matching formula is difficult to meet. At the same time, the psychology of the matching subject is based on the maximization of its own interests rather than the maximization of collective interests. There are interest contradictions and conflicts between subjects, and they may eventually fall into a “prisoner's dilemma”. Therefore, how to carry out the research on emotion regulation based on multi-agent heterogeneous game preference and bilateral partner preference is very important.
 
 
 
 Aiming at the contradictions and interest conflicts between subjects in the process of virtual enterprise partner matching, combined with the basic characteristics of subject language preference evaluation, the game idea is introduced into the process of virtual enterprise partner bilateral matching analysis, a bilateral matching game model of heterogeneous multi-attribute preference and subjects' psychological behavior is proposed, and the influence of the changes of subjects' psychological behavior on the evolution law of bilateral matching game system is analyzed, The Nash equilibrium strategy of bilateral matching is discussed. In order to verify the impact of the algorithm on emotion, this study uses relevant scales to investigate. (1) Positive emotion scale. The Panas emotion scale developed by Watson et al. Is widely used to measure emotion. The scale includes two dimensions: positive emotion and negative emotion. There are 6 questions in this dimension, and Likert scores 5 points (1 means “very inconsistent”, 5 means “very consistent”, the same below). The Cronbach coefficient of this questionnaire is 0.90. (2) Motivation. The problem of measuring motivation is mainly the motivation scale compiled by Phan, which has 8 questions and is scored with Likert 5 points. (3) Social support scale. The scale is adapted from the social support scale compiled by Ye Yuemei et al. It has eight questions, using Likert's five points scoring method. Clonbach α the coefficient of the scale is 0.87. (4) Behavioral propensity scale. Propensity dimension in intention measurement. The scale has 6 questions, and Likert scores 5 points. The clonbach coefficient of the scale is 0.95.
 
 
 
 The results of case analysis show that the model can make full use of the multi-attribute preference information of heterogeneous subjects, describe the mechanism of psychological behavior affecting the evolution of game system, and help virtual enterprises match business partners; This has important value and significance for the establishment of virtual enterprises and their industrial agglomeration effect. In the influence process of cooperative anxiety, emotional response plays an intermediary role, psychological elasticity plays a regulatory role, and emotional response to life events plays an intermediary role. That is, the higher the psychological elasticity, the higher the excessive coping style of the game, and vice versa.
 
 
 
 Various stable matching solutions can be obtained by solving the model, and the conclusion is more suitable for the matching decision-making process of both parties in the actual process, which makes the model can be applied to various scenarios, such as the selection of battery suppliers of new energy vehicles and smart phone screen suppliers, which has greater practical value and significance. It should be pointed out that there are some deficiencies in the setting conditions of the model method, mainly because some individuals in the group cooperate to form an alliance, so as to form a community of interests. In the process of game, the individual experience in the group is constrained by more conditions, which makes the results of the model deviate.

Personalization of user experience via affective and cognitive modeling, coupled with real-time adjustment of the content according to user needs and preferences are important steps toward effective and meaningful PCG. Games, Web 2.0, interface, and software design are among the most popular applications of automated content generation. The paper provides a taxonomy of PCG algorithms and introduces a framework for PCG driven by computational models of user experience. This approach, which we call Experience-Driven Procedural Content Generation (EDPCG), is generic and applicable to various subareas of HCI. We employ games as an example indicative of rich HCI and complex affect elicitation, and demonstrate the approach's effectiveness via dissimilar successful studies.",2011.0,124.0,446.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '147-161', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yannakakis2011ExperienceDrivenPC,\n author = {Georgios N.

2833,ff3ac9352702bdf355511edaa1e633273d448dba,The impact of perception and presence on emotional reactions: a review of research in virtual reality,"Virtual reality (VR) has made its way into mainstream psychological research in the last two decades. This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user’s sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR. Gaps in the current literature and future directions are outlined.",2015.0,65.0,586.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Diemer2015TheIO,\n author = {J.

Thus, this paper fills the gap by examining the mediating role of identification trust and affective commitment on members' continuous knowledge sharing intention within business online communities. 220 experienced online community members participated in the web survey. Structural equation modelling technique is used to analyze the data together with Baron and Kenny's (1986) mediating analysis procedure. The research findings reveal that, besides user's level of satisfaction, continuous knowledge sharing intention is partially mediated by affective commitment and identification trust. This paper ends by providing some insights on how to encourage continuous knowledge sharing intention within business online communities from the perspective of commitment-trust theory. Understanding the determinants of this behaviour is important as it helps to build an active community and also provides the opportunities for consumers to channel their ideas and suggestions in co-creating the products in which they are interested in.",,51.0,216.0,,"{'bibtex': ""@Misc{None,\n author = {Kamarul Faizal Hashim and Felix B.

We explored the specificity of atypical face-processing activation and potential alterations to fusiform gyrus (FG) morphology as potential underlying mechanisms. Adolescents with high functioning autism (HFA) and age-matched typically developing (TD) adolescents were scanned with sMRI and fMRI as they observed human and animal faces. In spite of exhibiting comparable face recognition behavior, the HFA adolescents evinced hypo-activation throughout the face-processing system in response to unfamiliar human, but not animal, faces. They also exhibited greater activation in affective regions of the face-processing network in response to animal, but not human, faces. Importantly, this atypical pattern of activation in response to human faces was not related to atypical structural properties of the FG. This atypical neural response to human faces in autism may stem from abnormalities in the ability to represent the reward value of social (i.e. conspecific) stimuli.",2016.0,60.0,41.0,"{'volume': '19 2', 'pages': '\n          306-17\n        ', 'name': 'Developmental science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Whyte2016AnimalBN,\n author = {Elisabeth M.

Wearables come in many different forms and flavors targeting different accessories and clothing that people wear. Although small in size, they are often expected to continuously sense, collect, and upload various physiological data to improve quality of life. These requirements put significant demand on improving communication security and reducing power consumption of the system, fueling new research in these areas. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive survey and classification of commercially available wearables and research prototypes. We then examine the communication security issues facing the popular wearables followed by a survey of solutions studied in the literature.

Similarities between fathers and mothers were found for turntaking control, response referents, and responses to the child's participation. However, fathers differed from mothers in two of the dimensions of directiveness examined: fathers used more response control and topic control than mothers. Both parents reported similarly low levels of child-related and parenting stress, but mothers perceived more stress than fathers related to the responsibilities associated with parenting a child with a handicap. Correlations between directiveness, child characteristics, and stress revealed that fathers used greater turntaking control and topic control with children who were developmentally less mature, whereas mothers used greater topic control with children who were less involved in interaction. Both fathers' and mothers' use of response control was positively related to stress. Implications for involving fathers in parent-focused intervention include screening father-child interactions before intervention, interpreting parent-child interaction styles in terms of their role in enhancing the child's social participation, and acknowledging the role of familial factors (such as stress) on interaction styles.",1994.0,54.0,64.0,"{'volume': '37 5', 'pages': '\n          1178-91\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of speech and hearing research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Girolametto1994CorrelatesOD,\n author = {L.
