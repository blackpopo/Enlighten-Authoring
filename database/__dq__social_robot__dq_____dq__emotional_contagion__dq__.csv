We question the properties of these social robots to afford acceptance and spontaneous emotional interactions. More specifically, in the present study, we report the effects of idle motion frequency in a robot on emotional contagion in a face-to-face interactive task with a human participant. The robotic system Buddy was programmed to adopt a sad posture and facial expression while telling three sad stories and moving its head up/down at low, medium, and high frequency. Each participant (N=15 total) was invited to sit in front of Buddy and listen to the stories. Unconscious changes in posture in the human participant were recorded using a 3D motion capture system (Qualysis). Results show greater inclinations of the shoulder/torso towards the ground in low-frequency trials and more rigid postures in high-frequency trials. The quantity of spontaneous movement was also greater when Buddy moved at slow frequencies. These findings echo results reported in experimental psychology when two individuals are engaged in social interactions. The scores obtained in the Godspeed questionnaire further suggest that emotional contagion may occur when Buddy moves slowly because the robotic system is perceived as more natural and knowledgeable, e.g., at speed coherent with the expressed emotion. Our work explores the importance of body posture and frequency of idle motion in the conception of robotic systems. Such additions could provide social robots that afford emotional contagion in effortless robot-human collaborative tasks.",2022,9,0,"{'name': 'ArXiv', 'volume': 'abs/2209.00983'}","{'model':

Exploring anthropomorphic effects of motion during idle moments', 'abstract': ""In this paper, we explored the effect of a robot's subconscious gestures made during moments when idle (also called adaptor gestures) on anthropomorphic perceptions of five year old children. We developed and sorted a set of adaptor motions based on their intensity. We designed an experiment involving 20 children, in which they played a memory game with two robots. During moments of idleness, the first robot showed adaptor movements, while the second robot moved its head following basic face tracking. Results showed that the children perceived the robot displaying adaptor movements to be more human and friendly. Moreover, these traits were found to be proportional to the intensity of the adaptor movements. For the range of intensities tested, it was also found that adaptor movements were not disruptive towards the task. These findings corroborate the fact that adaptor movements improve the affective aspect of child-robot interactions (CRI) and do not interfere with the child's performances in the task, making them suitable for CRI in educational contexts."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 28, 'citationCount': 18, 'authors': [{'authorId': '9040762', 'name': 'Thibault Asselborn'}, {'authorId': '2963096', 'name': 'W.

In Experiment 1, the musical clips were rated in terms of how clearly the intended emotion was portrayed, and for valence and arousal. In Experiment 2, a gating paradigm was used to evaluate the course for emotion recognition. In Experiment 3, a dissimilarity judgement task and multidimensional scaling analysis were used to probe emotional content with no emotional labels. The results showed that emotions are easily recognised and discriminated on the basis of valence and arousal and with relative immediacy. Happy and sad excerpts were identified after the presentation of fewer than three musical events. With no labelling, emotion discrimination remained highly accurate and could be mapped on energetic and tense dimensions. The present study provides suitable musical material for research on emotions.Keywords.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 60, 'citationCount': 327, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2414848', 'name': 'S.

The system consists of a small creature-like robot whose movement is controlled by a rhythm-based software system. Environmental rhythms can be extracted from auditory or visual sensory stimuli, and the robot synchronizes its movement to a dominant rhythm. The system was demonstrated, and an exploratory study conducted, with children interacting with the robot in a generalized dance task. Through a behavioral analysis of videotaped interactions, we found that the robot's synchronization with the background music had an effect on children's interactive involvement with the robot. Furthermore, we observed a number of expected and unexpected styles and modalities of interactive exploration and play that inform our discussion on the next steps in the design of a socially rhythmic robotic system."", 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 23, 'citationCount': 184, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1711135', 'name': 'Marek P.

Such a motion generator is needed in many cases when one attempts to create an animation sequence out of a set of existing clips. In nature there exists no motionless character, while in computer animation we often encounter cases where no planned actions, such as waiting for another actor finishing his/her part, is implemented as a stop/frozen animation. We identify many situations where a flexible idle motion generator can help: from synchronisation of speech/body animation duration, to dynamic creation of stand still variations in between two active plays. Our approach overcomes the limitations of using a small set of existing clips as a basis for synthesizing idle motions, such as unnatural repetition of movements and difficulties to insert idle motions into an animation without breaking its continuity. A realistic animation is obtained by blending small posture variations with personalised balance shifting animations.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 21, 'citationCount': 87, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2479558', 'name': 'A.

The described approach uses a three-dimensional human head model and kinematic chain of rigid elements. We proposed a method to perform a motion sequence of a virtual head in the idle mode. This mode is a state when a virtual person or robot performs subtle movements during the waiting phases between different interaction intervals. This form of action removes the problem of character freeze in motion and has a higher degree of user acceptance. This research covers issues related to creating trajectories of motion to rotate the head model's rigid objects. The proposed method has been used to trajectory generation for loop animation and executes smooth movements in the idle mode. Since the used algorithm has low computational requirements and introduces low interaction delays, we can use it in real-time operation in the HMI framework."", 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 23, 'citationCount': 3, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3253055', 'name': 'M.

In this work, I describe the use of musical improvisation to generate emotional musical prosody for improved human-robot interaction. This aims to develop a canny approach, where robots perform in a mechanomorphic manner improving collaboration opportunities with humans. I have currently collected a new 12-hour dataset and developed a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to generate new phrases. Generations have then been used to compare the impact of prosody on anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, perceived intelligence, and trust. Future work will incorporate prosody into groups of robots and humans, using personality to drive emotional decisions and emotion contagion.",2021,32,4,{'name': 'Companion of the 2021 ACM/IEEE

We tested participants' responses to interacting with a virtual robot arm that acted as a decision agent, helping participants select the next number in a sequence. We compared results from three versions of the application in a between-group experiment, where the robot had different emotional reactions to the user's input depending on whether the user agreed with the robot and whether the user's choice was correct. In all versions, the robot reacted with emotional gestures. One version used prosody-based emotional audio phrases selected from our dataset of singer improvisations, the second version used audio consisting of a single pitch randomly assigned to each emotion, and the final version used no audio, only gestures. Our results showed no significant difference for the percentage of times users from each group agreed with the robot, and no difference between user's agreement with the robot after it made a mistake.

This has been taken as evidence that music and speech are perceived by largely separate and independent networks in the brain. However, recent studies of congenital amusia have broadened this view by showing that the deficit is associated with problems in perceiving speech prosody, especially intonation and emotional prosody. In the present study the association between the perception of music and speech prosody was investigated with healthy Finnish adults (n = 61) using an on-line music perception test including the Scale subtest of Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) and Off-Beat and Out-of-key tasks as well as a prosodic verbal task that measures the perception of word stress. Regression analyses showed that there was a clear association between prosody perception and music perception, especially in the domain of rhythm perception. This association was evident after controlling for music education, age, pitch perception, visuospatial perception, and working memory. Pitch perception was significantly associated with music perception but not with prosody perception. The association between music perception and visuospatial perception (measured using analogous tasks) was less clear. Overall, the pattern of results indicates that there is a robust link between music and speech perception and that this link can be mediated by rhythmic cues (time and stress).', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 120, 'citationCount': 95, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34852977', 'name': 'M.

Subsequent years saw the appearance of competitors such as Google Now , swiftly followed by consumer products such as Amazon Echo . These devices are seen as the ﬁrst steps towards more advanced ‘conversational’ artefacts (especially robots ). However, evidence suggests that the usage of such voice-enabled devices is surprisingly low, perhaps due to noise in the environment, privacy concerns or manual alternatives.. Another possible contributing factor is that the ubiquitous deployment of inappropriate humanlike voices for non-living artefacts might deceive users into overestimating their capabilities, thereby creating a conﬂict of expectations that ultimately leads to a breakdown in communications. This paper highlights the beneﬁts of providing an appropriate voice for a given artefact based on three separate studies. Results are presented that demonstrate the positive impact of a non-human voice and illustrate how ‘appropriateness’ might be measured objectively. Finally, a worked-example is presented of implementing an appropriate voice for the MiRo biomimetic robot. It is concluded that these insights could be important for the design of future generations of voice-enabled artefacts.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 34, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145914568', 'name': 'Roger K.

On the one hand, people love music and devote much time and effort to putting themselves in the way of it. On the other hand the levels of musical skill achieved by the vast majority of people in contemporary western society are surprisingly low. On the face of it, music has all the characteristics which would lead one to predict that many people should be highly skilled at it. A long tradition of research into skill and its acquisition (cf. Ericsson & Smith, 1991; Ericssson, 1996) suggests that structure plus motivation plus practice leads to skill. In reviewing these four aspects I will first provide evidence that most music has the kind of structure which is easily learned and understood by the human mind. Second I will review evidence relating to motivation, and the very high value which many individuals place on their engagement with music. Third I will review evidence of the intimate link between level and nature of practice activities and achievement in music. Fourthly, and more speculatively, I will outline some potential inhibitors to musical achievement, in an attempt to formulate hypotheses about why, given such an apparently propitious set of circumstances, population outcomes in the area of music achievement are so dire.

To seamlessly integrate humanoid robots into concentration games, an investigation into the impacts of human robot interactive proxemics on concentration-training games is particularly important. In the case of an epidemic diffusion especially—for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic—HRI games may help in the therapeutic phase, significantly reducing the risk of contagion. In this paper, concentration games were designed by action imitation involving 120 participants to verify the hypothesis. Action-imitation accuracy, the assessment of emotional expression, and a questionnaire were compared with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Experimental results showed that a 2 m distance and left-front orientation for a human and a robot are optimal for human robot interactive concentration training. In addition, females worked better than males did in HRI imitation games. This work supports some valuable suggestions for the development of HRI concentration-training technology, involving the designs of friendlier and more useful robots, and HRI game

As a sentence might contain multiple sentiment-target pairs, extracting relevant information concerning the given target entity is the main challenge of this task. We try to overcome the challenge from two aspects. First, the attention mechanism is able to focus on the relevant part of the given entity and is well suited for this task. However, previous attention-based models still suffer from the problem of paying too much attention to some sentiment words that are irrelevant to the target. We call this as attention bias problem. To alleviate the biases, in this work, we introduce an adversarial training method to get unbiased attention. Second, we try to enhance the impact of the target from the perspective of word representations. Thus we propose an Embedding-Preserving Gating (EPGating) Mechanism.

Unfortunately, working memory deficiencies affect performance in work or education related activities, mainly due to lack of concentration, and, with the goal to improve this, many software applications have been developed. However, sometimes the user ends up bored with these games and drops out easily. To cope with this, our work explores the use of intelligent robotics and dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanisms to develop a novel working memory training system. The proposed system, based on the Nao robotic platform, is composed of three main components: First, the N-back task allows stimulating the working memory by remembering visual sequences. Second, a BDI model implements an intelligent agent for decision-making during the progress of the game. Third, a fuzzy controller, as a dynamic difficulty adjustment system, generates customized levels according to the user. The experimental results of our system, when compared to a computer-based implementation of the N-back game, show a significant improvement on the performance of the user in the game, which might relate to an improvement in their working memory.

While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human–machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress.

However, much of this evidence relies on experimenter-provided questions or self-reported judgments. We propose a new way of investigating people's mental state ascriptions to robots by carefully studying explanations of robot behavior. Since people's explanations of human behavior are deeply grounded in assumptions of mind and intentional agency, explanations of robot behavior can reveal whether such assumptions similarly apply to robots. We designed stimulus behaviors that were representative of a variety of robots in diverse contexts and ensured that people saw the behaviors as equally intentional, desirable, and surprising across both human and robot agents. We provided 121 participants with verbal descriptions of these behaviors and asked them to explain in their own words why the agent (human or robot) had performed them. To systematically analyze the verbal data, we used a theoretically grounded classification method to identify core explanation types. We found that people use the same conceptual toolbox of behavior explanations for both human and robot agents, robustly indicating inferences of intentionality and mind. But people applied specific explanatory tools at somewhat different rates and in somewhat different ways for robots, revealing specific expectations people hold when explaining robot behaviors."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 66, 'citationCount': 55, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144232743', 'name': 'M.

The theater play is controlled by a multi-agent system; a director agent synchronizes several robotic actors to perform a theater script. The architectural decisions of the actor agent are based on the BDI model which includes an emotional module that influences the way the agent performs actions. A centralized multi-agent protocol controls the simultaneous motion of several robotic actors. Furthermore, each actor agent has an intermediary module, called SOCA, connecting it with its sensor and action modules. The SOCA module makes flexible and transparent the communication and serves as coordinator and synchronizer; the aim is to make easier to modify the robot physical and logical configuration as required by an actor that must change accordingly to the represented character. A robotic prototype was implemented to validate this architecture and the communication scheme. It includes four modules: processing, mobility, audiovisual and manipulation.

This study examined the impact of the proposed learning system on student learning performance and motivation. The four-stage experimental procedure involved a pre-test, post-test, learning activities, and questionnaire survey. The participants comprised one homeroom teacher and 52 second-grade students from two classes at an elementary school in Taiwan. All of the students were assigned to use either the proposed learning system or a PowerPoint-based learning system. The pre-test and post-test results show that the proposed learning system improved student performance more than the PowerPoint-based learning system did. A questionnaire based on the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was employed to measure four motivational factors (attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction). The IMMS survey results show that satisfaction and relevance were the highest rated motivational factors among students who used the proposed learning system.

The public's perception and acceptance is not well understood. The objective was to investigate the perceptions and emotions toward the utilization of healthcare robots among individuals over 40 years of age, investigate factors contributing to acceptance, and evaluate differences in blood pressure checks taken by a robot and a medical student.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFifty-seven (n = 57) adults aged over 40 years and recruited from local general practitioner or gerontology group lists participated in two cross-sectional studies. The first was an open-ended questionnaire assessing perceptions of robots. In the second study, participants had their blood pressure taken by a medical student and by a robot. Patient comfort with each encounter, perceived accuracy of each measurement, and the quality of the patient interaction were studied in each case. Readings were compared by independent t-tests and regression analyses were conducted to predict quality ratings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants' perceptions about robots were influenced by their prior exposure to robots in literature or entertainment media. Participants saw many benefits and applications for healthcare robots, including simple medical procedures and physical assistance, but had some concerns about reliability, safety, and the loss of personal care. Blood pressure readings did not differ between the medical student and robot, but participants felt more comfortable with the medical student and saw the robot as less accurate. Although age and sex were not significant predictors, individuals who held more positive initial attitudes and emotions toward robots rated the robot interaction more favorably.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMany people see robots as having benefits and applications in healthcare but some have concerns.

The results indicated that robot content focusing on socio-emotional characteristics should be developed for educational purposes and that a robot should be placed in the classroom for individual use.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 3, 'citationCount': 33, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1820058', 'name': 'Eun-ja Hyun'}, {'authorId': '2113737638', 'name': 'Hyunmin Yoon'}, {'authorId': '2378735', 'name': 'Sooryun Son'}]}, {'paperId': 'c38ba14d6e538d32e96d498915398645fa0fb6ba', 'title': 'Influences on proxemic behaviors in human-robot interaction', 'abstract': ""As robots enter the everyday physical world of people, it is important that they abide by society's unspoken social rules such as respecting people's personal spaces. In this paper, we explore issues related to human personal space around robots, beginning with a review of the existing literature in human-robot interaction regarding the dimensions of people, robots, and contexts that influence human-robot interactions. We then present several research hypotheses which we tested in a controlled experiment (N=30). Using a 2 (robotics experience vs. none: between-participants) × 2 (robot head oriented toward a participant's face vs. legs: within-participants) mixed design experiment, we explored the factors that influence proxemic behavior around robots in several situations: (1) people approaching a robot, (2) people being approached by an autonomously moving robot, and (3) people being approached by a teleoperated robot. We found that personal experience with pets and robots decreases a person's personal space around robots. In addition, when the robot's head is oriented toward the person's face, it increases the minimum comfortable distance for women, but decreases the minimum comfortable distance for men. We also found that the personality trait of agreeableness decreases personal spaces when people approach robots, while the personality trait of neuroticism and having negative attitudes toward robots increase personal spaces when robots approach people. These results have implications for both human-robot interaction theory and design."", 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 27, 'citationCount': 394, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1753156', 'name': 'L.

In addition, the paper describes exemplar HRI studies which use psychophysiological measures; these implementations fall into three categories: detection and/or identification of specific emotions of participants from physiological signals, evaluation of participants' responses to a robot through physiological signals, and development and implementation of real-time control and modification of robot behaviors using physiological signals.

This paper discusses a novel framework designed to improve human-robot interaction through robotic imitation of a participant’s gestures. In our experiment, a humanoid robotic agent socializes with and plays games with a participant. For the experimental group, the robot additionally imitates one of the participant’s novel gestures during a play session. We hypothesize that the robot’s use of imitation will increase the participant’s openness towards engaging with the robot. Experimental results from a user study of 12 subjects show that post-imitation, experimental subjects displayed a more positive emotional state, had higher instances of mood contagion towards the robot, and interpreted the robot to have a higher level of autonomy than their control group counterparts did. These results point to an increased participant interest in engagement fueled by personalized imitation during interaction.",2018,19,6,"{'name': 'Applied sciences (Basel, Switzerland)', 'volume':

Our research addresses the question of whether, in a human-humanoid interaction experiment, the human's overall perception of a robot can be improved by realizing motor coordination behavior that allows the robot to adapt in real-time to a person's behavior. A synchrony detection method using information distance was adopted to realize the real-time human-robot motor coordination behavior, which guided the humanoid robot to coordinate its movements to a human by measuring the behavior synchrony between the robot and the human. The feedback of the participants indicated that most of the participants preferred to interact with the humanoid robot with the adaptive motor coordination capability. The results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that the motor coordination mechanism improved humans' overall perception of the humanoid robot. Together with our previous findings, namely that humans actively coordinate their behaviors to a humanoid robot's behaviors, this study further supports the hypothesis that bidirectional motor coordination could be a valid approach to facilitate adaptive human-humanoid interaction."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 24, 'authors': [{'authorId': '33475867', 'name': 'Qiming Shen'}, {'authorId': '1724361', 'name': 'K.

However, it remains unclear how the partner's action features combine or compete to promote or prevent motor resonance during interaction. To clarify this point, the present study tested whether and how the nature of the visual stimulus and the properties of the observed actions influence observer's motor response, being motor contagion one of the behavioral manifestations of motor resonance. Participants observed a humanoid robot and a human agent move their hands into a pre-specified final position or put an object into a container at various velocities. Their movements, both in the object- and non-object- directed conditions, were characterized by either a smooth/curvilinear or a jerky/segmented trajectory. These trajectories were covered with biological or non-biological kinematics (the latter only by the humanoid robot). After action observation, participants were requested to either reach the indicated final position or to transport a similar object into another container. Results showed that motor contagion appeared for both the interactive partner except when the humanoid robot violated the biological laws of motion. These findings suggest that the observer may transiently match his/her own motor repertoire to that of the observed agent. This matching might mediate the activation of motor resonance, and modulate the spontaneity and the pleasantness of the interaction, whatever the nature of the communication partner."", 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 51, 'citationCount': 93, 'authors': [{'authorId': '12598542', 'name': 'A.

Robot mood was displayed by applying a generic framework for mood expression using body language. By modulating the set of available behavior parameters in this framework for controlling pose and motion dynamics, the gestures performed by the humanoid robot NAO were adjusted to display either a positive or negative mood. In the study performed, we varied both mood as well as task difficulty. Our results show that participants are able to differentiate between positive and negative robot mood. Moreover, self-reported mood matches the mood of the robot in the easy task condition.

We present a learning by imitation approach combining the two benefits. It is based on a superposition of virtual spring-damper systems to drive a humanoid robot's movement. The method relies on a statistical description of the springs attractor points acting in different candidate frames of reference. It extends dynamic movement primitives models by formulating the dynamical systems parameters estimation problem as a Gaussian mixture regression problem with projection in different coordinate systems. The robot exploits local variability information extracted from multiple demonstrations of movements to determine which frames are relevant for the task, and how the movement should be modulated with respect to these frames.

However, most previous research works expected the human to consciously give feedback, which might interfere with the aim of interaction. We propose an adaptation mechanism based on reinforcement learning that reads subconscious body signals from a human partner, and uses this information to adjust interaction distances, gaze meeting, and motion speed and timing in human-robot interactions. The mechanism uses gazing at the robot's face and human movement distance as subconscious body signals that indicate a human's comfort and discomfort.

In two other experiments, people complied more with a robot whose demeanor matched the seriousness of the task."", 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 28, 'citationCount': 754, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40533864', 'name': 'Jennifer Goetz'}, {'authorId': '2070796426', 'name': 'Sara Kiesler'}, {'authorId': '2063989220', 'name': 'Aaron Powers'}]}, {'paperId': '9c2f2fe4cbf7c30362f2818392b464e539b5aaca', 'title': 'The Chameleon Effect as Social Glue: Evidence for the Evolutionary Significance of Nonconscious Mimicry', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 932, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5622454', 'name': 'Jessica L.

How can the motor plans necessary for imitating an action derive from the observation of that action? Imitation may be based on a mechanism directly matching the observed action onto an internal motor representation of that action (""direct matching hypothesis""). To test this hypothesis, normal human participants were asked to observe and imitate a finger movement and to perform the same movement after spatial or symbolic cues. Brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. If the direct matching hypothesis is correct, there should be areas that become active during finger movement, regardless of how it is evoked, and their activation should increase when the same movement is elicited by the observation of an identical movement made by another individual. Two areas with these properties were found in the left inferior frontal cortex (opercular region) and the rostral-most region of the right superior parietal lobule.', 'year': 1999, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 2607, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1770382', 'name': 'M.

The results confirmed the occurrence of emotional contagion in ODC, that is, the extent to which the user’s emotion was affected by the received emotion. Our study also found that when positive emotional contagion occurred, the replies contained more hopefulness, and when negative emotional contagion occurred, the replies contained more hopelessness and fear. Second, positive emotions were easier to spread, and people with higher activity in ODC were more susceptible. In addition, nighttime was an active period for user interaction.

Although still a young and scarce subject, research has revealed that social media has addictive potential. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the associations between problematic use of social media and mental distress, problematic gaming and gambling, within the Swedish general population. Methods Data from 2,118 respondents was collected through self-report questions on demographics and validated scales measuring addiction-like experiences of social media, problem gaming, problem gambling, and mental distress. Associations were analyzed in unadjusted analyses and–for variables not exceedingly inter-correlated–in adjusted logistic regression analyses. Results In adjusted analyses, problematic use of social media demonstrated a relationship with younger age, time using instant messaging services, and mental distress, but not with education level, occupational status, or with treatment needs for alcohol or drug problems. Behavioral addictions (internet, gaming and gambling) were substantially inter-correlated, and all were associated with problematic use of social media in unadjusted analyses.

The Effects of Emotion Contagion and Social Media Use on Anxiety in Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic', 'abstract': 'The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, causing substantial anxiety. One potential factor in the spread of anxiety in response to a pandemic threat is emotion contagion, the finding that emotional experiences can be socially spread through conscious and unconscious pathways. Some individuals are more susceptible to social contagion effects and may be more likely to experience anxiety and other mental health symptoms in response to a pandemic threat. Therefore, we studied the relationship between emotion contagion and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We administered the Emotion Contagion Scale (ESC) along with a measure of anxiety in response to COVID-19 (modified from a previous scale designed to quantify fear of the Swine Flu outbreak) and secondary outcome measures of depression, anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. These measures were completed by a large (n = 603) student sample in the United States. Data were collected in the months of April and May of 2020 when the fear of COVID-19 was widespread. Results revealed that greater susceptibility to emotion contagion was associated with greater concern about the spread of COVID-19, more depression, anxiety, stress, and OCD symptoms. Consumption of media about COVID-19 also predicted anxiety about COVID-19, though results were not moderated by emotion contagion. However, emotion contagion did moderate the relationship between COVID-19-related media consumption and elevated OCD symptoms.

In contrast, the article develops a concept of delusion as a disturbance of the enactive and intersubjective constitution of a shared reality. A foundation of this concept is provided by a theory of the objectivity of perception, which is achieved on two levels: 1) On the first level, the sensorimotor interaction with the environment implies a mobility and multiplicity of perspectives that relativizes the momentary point of view. 2) On the second level, the social interaction with others implies a virtual shifting and contrast of perspectives which helps to overcome a merely subject-centered worldview through participatory sense-making. On this basis, the alteration of experience in beginning psychosis is phenomenologically described as a subjectivization of perception, resulting in an overall experience of self-centrality and derealization. Delusion then converts the disturbance of perception into a reframing of the perceived world, namely an assumed persecution by mundane enemies. Through this, a new sense-making is established, yet in a way that is fundamentally decoupled from the shared world. The possibility of intersubjective understanding is thus sacrificed for the new coherence of the delusion. Further implications of the loss of the intersubjective co-constitution of reality are analyzed, in particular related to disturbances of communication.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 22, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144942551', 'name': 'T.

The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based micro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the emotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social network. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they require massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the individuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional contagion using a random sample of Twitter users, whose activity (and the stimuli they were exposed to) was observed during a week of September 2014. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50% more positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and that of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive emotions.

In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.

Current concepts of intersubjectivity are mainly based on a mentalistic approach, assuming that the hidden mental states of others may only be inferred from their external bodily behaviour through ‘mentalizing’ or ‘mindreading’. On this basis, disorders of intersubjectivity for example in autism or schizophrenia are attributed to a dysfunction of Theory of Mind modules. From a phenomenological point of view, however, intersubjectivity is primarily based on a pre-reflective embodied relationship of self and other in an emergent bipersonal field. Instead of a theory deficit, autistic and schizophrenic patients rather suffer from a basic disturbance of being-with-others which they try to compensate by explicit inferences and hypothetical assumptions about others. The paper consequently distinguishes three levels of intersubjectivity: (a) primary intersubjectivity or intercorporeality, (b) secondary intersubjectivity or perspective-taking, and (c) tertiary intersubjectivity, implying a self–other metaperspective. On this basis, disturbances on these different levels in autism and schizophrenia are described.

Under emotional contagion, individual emotions gradually generalized into group emotions. At the same time, the public could not regulate their emotions and lacked access to release them rationally. This study explores the factors influencing the negative emotions' communication among social media users during the COVID-19 epidemic from the perspective of emotion contagion theory to discover the psychological mechanisms among the public. The questionnaire was tested for reliability and validity and then distributed online on Chinese social media platforms, and the data collected were statistically analyzed. The findings show that there are significant differences in negative emotional communication in social media among different age groups; the seven dimensions of deindividuation, risk perception, group identity, group efficacy, event stimulation, event publicness, and emotion contagion all have significant positive effects on users' negative emotional communication. This study aims to raise public awareness of negative emotions and promote the reconstruction and recovery of public mental health in the epidemic era.",2022,71,2,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology',

Despite significant efforts in studying various aspects of COVID-19, there is a dearth of evidence on how negative emotions are associated with behaviors. A comparison across associated factors to different negative emotions by means of a unified model is especially missing from the literature. This study was conducted by using the results of a survey conducted across 2,534 students enrolled in 7 states in the US. Various feelings such as sad, irritable, stress and guilt were analyzed in a unified model by means of seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Questions were asked related to rationally limiting the spread of virus, and questions related to behaviors that seem to be extreme. Irrational behaviors, such as limiting exercise at home due to COVID-19 could be due to experiencing negative emotions, which distort the meaning of events for the students. That behavior, for instance, was found to be positively associated with various negative feelings. In addition, the results highlighted significant differences across emotions in terms of demographic characteristics such as gender and age, and various precautionary actions that students take, such as limiting outdoor activities or limiting social gathering.

Mental health support, in the form of formal or remote sessions, has been shown to be helpful to health care staff, despite the organizational difficulties in an emergency. During the first emergence of COVID-19 in Italy, the Scientific Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Health Care Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation (Pavia, Lombardy), the Italian hospital that treated “patient 1,” has activated an agreement with the Soleterre Foundation, an international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) that manages health emergency projects, to provide psychological support. A task force of psychologists was created with the aim of designing and administering a Therapeutic Mental Health Assessment for COVID-19 Care Workers (TMHA COVID-19 CWs) to evaluate and support health care workers’ mental health. The assessment battery was developed to evaluate symptoms and behaviors associated with trauma and the corresponding maladaptive behaviors (the National Stressful Events Survey for PTSD-Short Scale “NSESSS” and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders “DSM-5” Self-Rated Level 1 transversal Symptom Measure—Adult). Once the TMHA COVID-19 CWs had been developed, the team of psychologists regularly visited healthcare staff in the ward to administer it. One hundred seven care workers (44 males, mean age 40 ± 15) across Intensive Care Units (ICUs), the emergency room and medical ward were administered the TMHA COVID-19 CWs. PTSD symptoms were reported as severe by 13% of the population. Depressive symptoms as severe for 7% and Anxiety symptoms as severe for 14%. Severe psychotic symptoms were experienced by 2% and severe suicidal thoughts by 1% of the population. The possibility of acting upon the results of the TMHA COVID-19 CWs allowed an early intervention through individual session beyond the cut-off level (moderate and severe symptoms) for PTSD in NSESSS. In fact, 280 individual support sessions were offered.

We studied how voluntary health-protective behavior and vaccination willingness impact the long-term dynamics. We analyzed how different levels of mandatory NPIs determine how individuals use their leeway for voluntary actions. If mandatory NPIs are too weak, COVID-19 incidence will surge, implying high morbidity and mortality before individuals react; if they are too strong, one expects a rebound wave once restrictions are lifted, challenging the transition to endemicity. Conversely, moderate mandatory NPIs give individuals time and room to adapt their level of caution, mitigating disease spread effectively. When complemented with high vaccination rates, this also offers a robust way to limit the impacts of the Omicron variant of concern.

Our central idea is that group identification is the key to understanding the process in which empathic emotion causes helping behavior. Empathic emotion causes helping behavior because it involves group identification, which motivates helping behavior toward other members. This paper focuses on a hypothesis, which we call “self-other merging hypothesis (SMH),” according to which empathy-induced helping behavior is due to the “merging” between the helping agent and the helped agent. We argue that SMH should be interpreted in terms of group identification. The group identification interpretation of SMH is both behaviorally adequate (i.e., successfully predicts and explains the helping behavior in the experimental settings) and psychologically plausible (i.e., does not posit psychologically unrealistic beliefs, desires, etc.). Empathy-induced helping behavior, according to the group identification interpretation of the SMH, does not fit comfortably into the traditional egoism/altruism dichotomy.

Based on the marked data set, we explored the potential law between the changes in Internet public opinion and epidemic situation in China.

Secondly, there is a strong correlation between the changes of epidemic situation and people’s emotion. Also, we divided the epidemic into three period. The proportion of people’s negative emotions showed a similar trend with the number of newly confirmed cases in the growth and decay period, and the extinction period. In addition, we also found that women have more positive emotional performance than men, and the high-impact groups is also more positive than the low-impact groups.

Emotional contagion can be a very effective and attractive strategy in communication and advertising, and understanding the mechanisms underlying emotional contagion can help marketers to improve their commercial approaches or develop better ones. The purpose of this study is to review and classify the various methodologies and theoretical approaches on emotional contagion, identify the best practices in this domain, and identify ways of gaging and measuring emotional contagion. The study is based on a mini literature review. We identify different mechanisms and approaches to emotional contagion described in the literature. Emotional contagion can be triggered by facial expressions, indirect human interactions, and/or by observing other people's behavior in direct and indirect interactions. Furthermore, emotional contagion can be triggered physiologically or neurologically by synchronizing with the emotional state of others during human interactions. Regarding the assessment and measurement of emotional contagion, we argue that methods based on neuroscience tools are much more accurate and effective than methods based on traditional research approaches. The study identifies guidelines for research on commercial communication through emotional contagion that can be especially interesting for academia and marketing practitioners.

In the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. Methods Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core discussions were explored measuring tweets’ sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features were considered. Results We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. Conclusions Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust. There is the need to monitor and sustain healthy behaviors as well as community supports also via social media-based preventive interventions.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 28, 'citationCount': 33, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3482113', 'name': 'C.

The strongest predictor of preventive behaviors in general was negative emotions, which had the largest *βh* (.22) among the independent variables considered. The eight negative emotions, identified using factor analysis of a series of 11 emotions, were anger, annoyance, fear, sadness, anxiety, insomnia, helplessness, and stress. Negative emotions themselves were influenced most strongly by the respondent’s anxiety over social safety (*βf*=.286), followed by prediction of COVID-19 spread (*β*=.121, *p*<.001) and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (*β*=.70, p=.023). Females (*β*=-.134) and those who felt less healthy (*βo*=-.097) experienced more negative emotions.

Group identification, joint actions, and collective intentionality', 'abstract': 'ABSTRACT Within social psychology, group identification refers to a mental process that leads an individual to conceive of herself as a group member. This phenomenon has recently attracted a great deal of attention in the debate about shared agency. In this debate, group identification is appealing to many because it appears to explain important forms of intentionally shared actions in a cognitively unsophisticated way. This paper argues that, unless important issues about group identification are not illuminated, the heuristic function ascribed to this notion for an understanding of shared agency remains dubious at best and unfulfilled at worst. This paper offers such a clarification by distinguishing and describing two different mental processes that constitute group identification: adoption of the group perspective and transformation in self-understanding. It is claimed that the latter process consists in the production of what Ruth Millikan labels “Pushmi-Pullyu representations” and that it is developmentally prior with respect to the ability of adopting the group perspective.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 80, 'citationCount': 18, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5687052', 'name': 'Alessandro Salice'}, {'authorId': '5932713', 'name': 'Kengo Miyazono'}]}, {'paperId': '8205d864ecab56c0aae59df2707d33725150e5e3', 'title': 'Unexpected expectations: Public reaction to the Facebook emotional contagion study', 'abstract': 'How to ethically conduct online platform-based research remains an unsettled issue and the source of continued controversy.

The overall scale consists of five sub-scales with a total of 25 items, and an overall alpha of 0.89. Construct validity was established. Specifically, the overall scale, and subscales (except perceived difficulty) plausibly differentiated between low-reform and high-reform practice instructors. Statistically significant differences in attitude were observed with respect to age, but not gender, employment status, membership status in professional organizations, ethnicity, highest academic qualification, and degree concentration. This scale can be considered a reliable and valid measure of instructors' attitudes toward reform-oriented (concept-based or constructivist) teaching of introductory statistics in the health and behavioral sciences at the tertiary level.

Our aim in this paper was to manipulate the Regulatory Focus Theory to assess its impact on the induction of regulatory focus related emotions in children in a pretend play scenario with a social robot. The Regulatory Focus Theory suggests that people follow one of two paradigms while attempting to achieve a goal; by seeking gains (promotion focus - associated with feelings of happiness) or by avoiding losses (prevention focus - associated with feelings of fear). We conducted a study with 69 school children in two different conditions (promotion vs. prevention). We succeeded in inducing happiness emotions in the promotion condition and found a resulting positive effect of the induction on children’s social engagement with the robot. We also discuss the important implications of these results in both educational and child robot interaction fields.",2021,61,9,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in

While different research fields have used this theory, in human-robot interaction (HRI), no real attention has been given to this theory. In this paper, we investigate it in an in the wild scenario. More specifically, we are interested in how individuals react when a robot suddenly appears at their office doors. Will they interact with it or will they ignore it? We report the results from our experimental study in which the robot approaches 42 individuals. Twenty-nine of them interacted with the robot, while the others either ignored it or avoided any interaction with it. The robot displayed two types of behavior (i.e., promotion or prevention). Our results show that individuals that interacted with a robot that matched their regulatory focus type interacted with it significantly longer than individuals that did not experience regulatory fit. Other qualitative results are also reported, together with some reactions from the participants.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 21, 'citationCount': 4, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3373671', 'name': 'Roxana Agrigoroaie'}, {'authorId': '2047384442', 'name': 'Ștefan-Dan Ciocîrlan'}, {'authorId': '1738469', 'name': 'A.

Because rapport in learning scenarios has been shown to lead to improved learning outcomes, we examined whether enabling a social robotic learning companion to perform rapport-building behaviors could improve children's learning and engagement during a storytelling activity. We enabled the social robot to perform two specific rapport and relationship-building behaviors: speech entrainment and self-disclosure (shared personal information in the form of a backstory about the robot's poor speech and hearing abilities). We recruited 86 children aged 3–8 years to interact with the robot in a 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental study testing the effects of robot entrainment Entrainment vs. No entrainment and backstory about abilities Backstory vs. No Backstory. The robot engaged the children one-on-one in conversation, told a story embedded with key vocabulary words, and asked children to retell the story. We measured children's recall of the key words and their emotions during the interaction, examined their story retellings, and asked children questions about their relationship with the robot. We found that the robot's entrainment led children to show more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions. Children who heard the robot's backstory were more likely to accept the robot's poor hearing abilities. Entrainment paired with backstory led children to use more of the key words and match more of the robot's phrases in their story retells. Furthermore, these children were more likely to consider the robot more human-like and were more likely to comply with one of the robot's requests. These results suggest that the robot's speech entrainment and backstory increased children's engagement and enjoyment in the interaction, improved their perception of the relationship, and contributed to children's success at retelling the story."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 125, 'citationCount': 33, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2716110', 'name': 'J.

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT.

One aim is to specify this thesis with respect to language development. The empirical investigations show that language is the central means of creating pretence. By explicit metacommunication, children collaboratively negotiate the plot, transform meanings and distinguish fiction from reality. Thus, metacommunication functions as a verbal frame, determining the meanings within play. Thereby children overcome sympraxic language use which is characteristic of toddlers. Another result is that role play changes during the preschool years. The paper argues that these changes can be subsumed under a general developmental phenomenon, namely the transition of interpsychic into intrapsychic processes. A point of special interest is why preschoolers, through role play, can act in the ZPD, although their ability to cooperate with other children is only at a nascent stage.

The use of robots can promote and facilitate play for children with disabilities. Robot play could give insight to the developmental level of play of children with disabilities who are difficult to assess with standardized tests. The purpose of this study was to develop scenarios with and without a robot where children could demonstrate play at different developmental levels. Validation of the scenarios was done through direct observation of 10 typically developing children playing with and without a robot with conventional toys and unstructured materials. A play coding system was used to classify the levels of play (no play, functional play or pretend play). Analysis showed that the scenarios could elicit play as expected (young children did more functional play and older children did more pretend play). However, children presented less pretend play with the robot than they did without the robot. This could be because typically developing children are accustomed to manipulating toys directly and the robot posed a higher level of cognitive difficulty. Next steps will be to address the effect of the robot, and trial the scenarios with children with disabilities.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '116246037', 'name': 'Paola Esquivel'}, {'authorId': '31520489', 'name': 'Adriana Rios'}, {'authorId': '144455694', 'name': 'Lina Becerra'}, {'authorId': '144966378', 'name': 'K.

Children with autism have difficulties with social interaction and several studies indicate that they show preference toward interaction with objects, such as computers and robots, rather than with humans. In 1991, Carol Gray developed Social Stories, an intervention tool aimed to increase children’s social skills. Social stories are short scenarios written or tailored for autistic individuals to help them understand and behave appropriately in social situations. This study shows that, in specific situations, the social performance of autistic children improves when using the robot Probo, as a medium for social story telling, than when a human reader tells the stories. The robot tells Social Stories to teach ASD children how to react in situations like saying “hello”, saying “thank you” and “sharing toys”. The robot has the capability of expressing emotions and attention via its facial expressions and its gaze. The paper discusses the use of Probo as an added-value therapeutic tool for social story telling and presents the first experimental results.

Coding can take place at the level of the utterance, of the exchange or of the whole question–answer sequence. If the sequence is used as a coding unit, the complexity of the coding scheme will be low but so will the amount of information in the data. If the utterance is used as a coding unit, it is possible to apply full coding (i.e., all utterances are coded) or selective coding (only relevant utterances are coded). Full coding of utterances with preservation of sequence information is by far the most laborintensive but also the most informative, as a lot of information can be derived from sequence analyses.

 Decisions in social contexts might lead to choices favoring self- or others-interest, depending on the relationships between individuals. Prosocial and helping behaviors are evolutionary conserved across mammals. However, the neurobiological bases of choices that benefit others at a personal cost are not understood. Here, we revealed the role of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in altruistic and selfish choices. We developed a two-choice social decision-making task in which mice could decide to share or not a positive reinforcement with their conspecifics. Preference for altruistic choices was more evident in males and if the conspecific was familiar. In particular, altruistic choices were associated with social dominance and affective state matching between individuals. Chemogenetic BLA neuronal silencing induced lower ranking hierarchy and less preference for altruistic choices. This provides a neurobiological comparative model of altruistic and selfish choices versus dominance hierarchy and emotional contagion, with relevance to pathologies associated with dysfunctions in social decision-making.",2021,55,2,"{'name': '', 'volume': ''}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-4.635434627532959, -2.6505236625671387, 1.662514567375183, 2.5543437004089355, 5.091516017913818,

While kin selection explains such ""selfless"" acts among relatives, only reciprocity (paying back received favors) entails fitness benefits for unrelated individuals [2]. So far, experimental evidence for both prosocial helping (providing voluntary assistance for achieving an action-based goal) and reciprocity has been reported in a few mammals but no avian species [3]. In order to gain insights into the evolutionary origins of these behaviors, the capacity of non-mammalian species for prosociality and for reciprocity needs to be investigated. We tested two parrot species in an instrumental-helping paradigm involving ""token transfer."" Here, actors could provide tokens to their neighbor, who could exchange them with an experimenter for\xa0food. To verify whether the parrots understood the task\'s contingencies, we systematically varied the presence of a partner and the possibility for exchange. We found that African grey parrots voluntarily and spontaneously transferred tokens to conspecific partners, whereas significantly fewer transfers occurred in the control conditions. Transfers were affected by the strength of the dyads\' affiliation and partially by the receivers\' attention-getting behaviors. Furthermore, the birds reciprocated the help once the\xa0roles were reversed. Blue-headed macaws, in contrast, transferred hardly any tokens. Species differences in social tolerance might explain this discrepancy. These findings show that instrumental helping based on a prosocial attitude, accompanied but potentially not sustained by reciprocity, is present in parrots, suggesting that this capacity evolved convergently in this avian group and mammals.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4016388', 'name': 'Désirée Brucks'}, {'authorId': '145550643', 'name': 'A.

Its centrality in everyday life reflects the neural complexity of social processing and the ubiquity of social cognitive deficits in different pathological conditions. Social cognitive processes can be clustered in three domains associated with (a) perceptual processing of social information such as faces and emotional expressions (social perception), (b) grasping others' cognitive or affective states (social understanding), and (c) planning behaviors taking into consideration others', in addition to one's own, goals (social decision-making). We review these domains from the lens of cognitive neuroscience, i.e., in terms of the brain areas mediating the role of such processes in the ability to make sense of others' behavior and plan socially appropriate actions. The increasing evidence on the “social brain” obtained from healthy young individuals nowadays constitutes the baseline for detecting changes in social cognitive skills associated with physiological aging or pathological conditions. In the latter case, impairments in one or more of the abovementioned domains represent a prominent concern, or even a core facet, of neurological (e.g., acquired brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases), psychiatric (e.g., schizophrenia), and developmental (e.g., autism) disorders. To pave the way for the other papers of this issue, addressing the social cognitive deficits associated with severe acquired brain injury, we will briefly discuss the available evidence on the status of social cognition in normal aging and its breakdown in neurodegenerative disorders. Although the assessment and treatment of such impairments is a relatively novel sector in neurorehabilitation, the evidence summarized here strongly suggests that the development of remediation procedures for social cognitive skills will represent a future field of translational research in clinical neuroscience."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 289, 'citationCount': 67, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31442866', 'name': 'Maria Arioli'}, {'authorId': '46862684', 'name': 'C.

Direct transfers buffer hunter-gatherers against foraging shortfalls. The emergence and elaboration of this behaviour thus likely played a key role in human evolution by promoting cooperative interdependence and ensuring that humans' growing energetic needs (e.g. for increasing brain size) were more reliably met. According to the strong prosociality hypothesis, among great apes only humans exhibit sufficiently strong prosocial motivations to directly transfer food. The versatile prosociality hypothesis suggests instead that while other apes may make transfers in constrained settings, only humans share flexibly across food and non-food contexts. In controlled experiments, chimpanzees typically transfer objects but not food, supporting both hypotheses. In this paper, we show in two experiments that bonobos directly transfer food but not non-food items.

Altruistic responding is most salient during heroic acts of helping but is also observed any time one perceives another's distress or need, which in turn motivates one to help at a current cost to the self. Such aid is simple, observable across species, and rooted in the instincts and circuits that evolved to maximize inclusive fitness through the care of helpless offspring. By design, the system already biases aid to both kin and nonkin under conditions that are largely adaptive. These inherent benefits are also buttressed in primates and humans by known, later-arriving benefits to helping in group-living animals. Evidence for the proposed homology between altruistic responding and offspring retrieval is presented through 10 key shared factors. Conceptually, both require (a) participation by nonmothers, (b) motor competence and expertise, (c) an adaptive opponency between avoidance and approach, and a facilitating role of (d) neonatal vulnerability, (e) salient distress, and (f) rewarding close contact. Physiologically, they also share neurohormonal support from (g) oxytocin, (h) the domain-general mesolimbocortical system, (i) the cingulate cortex, and (j) the orbitofrontal cortex.

This puzzling phenomenon has led many to suggest that sharing with strangers originates from human-unique language, social norms, warfare and/or cooperative breeding. However, bonobos, our closest living relative, are highly tolerant and, in the wild, are capable of having affiliative interactions with strangers. In four experiments, we therefore examined whether bonobos will voluntarily donate food to strangers. We show that bonobos will forego their own food for the benefit of interacting with a stranger. Their prosociality is in part driven by unselfish motivation, because bonobos will even help strangers acquire out-of-reach food when no desirable social interaction is possible. However, this prosociality has its limitations because bonobos will not donate food in their possession when a social interaction is not possible. These results indicate that other-regarding preferences toward strangers are not uniquely human. Moreover, language, social norms, warfare and cooperative breeding are unnecessary for the evolution of xenophilic sharing. Instead, we propose that prosociality toward strangers initially evolves due to selection for social tolerance, allowing the expansion of individual social networks.

Here we show experimentally that cooperative behavior of female rats is influenced by prior receipt of help, irrespective of the identity of the partner. Rats that were trained in an instrumental cooperative task (pulling a stick in order to produce food for a partner) pulled more often for an unknown partner after they were helped than if they had not received help before. This alternative mechanism, called generalized reciprocity, requires no specific knowledge about the partner and may promote the evolution of cooperation among unfamiliar nonrelatives.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 274, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34992030', 'name': 'C.

There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views, applying in varying degrees across species. An adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism can integrate these views. Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups. This view can advance our evolutionary understanding of empathy beyond inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism and can explain different levels of empathy across individuals, species, stages of development, and situations."", 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 681, 'citationCount': 3392, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5011255', 'name': 'S.

The model shows how selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in the system. Three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and (3) human reciprocal altruism. Regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. Specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system.

However, it is unclear whether non-human animals can make and observe rules to resolve conflict without aggression. Here we report a new behavioral paradigm for mice: a modified two-armed maze that uses wireless electrical brain stimulation as reward. First, the mice were individually operant-trained to initiate and then receive the reward at the signaled arm. Next, two mice were coupled and had to cooperate to initiate reward but then to compete over reward allocation. Mice develop and observe a rule of reward zone allocation that increases the total amount of reward and reward equity between the pair. In the mutual rule-observance behavior, positive reciprocity and tolerance to the other’s violation are also observed. These findings suggest that rodents can learn to make and observe rules to resolve conflict, enhancing long-term benefit and payoff equity.

Kin-based altruism benefits biological relatives and, according to the theory of inclusive fitness, is ultimately beneficial to the altruist from a genetic standpoint. Kin selection adequately explains some altruistic behavior, but it is not applicable to much human altruism. Little is known about the neural processes that support it, but they may include cortical regions involved in processing autobiographical memory and the identities of familiar others. Reciprocity-based altruism is performed in expectation of future rewards and is supported by dopaminergic cortico-striatal networks that guide behavior according to anticipated rewards. Care-based altruism is aimed at improving the well-being of distressed and vulnerable individuals and is closely linked to empathic concern. This form of altruism is thought to rely on the subcortical neural systems that support parental care, particularly structures densely populated with receptors for the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin, including the amygdala, stria terminalis, and striatum. The amygdala may be a particularly important convergence point for care-based altruism because of its dual role in responding both to cues that signal infantile vulnerability and those that signal distress. Research on altruism continues to converge across disciplines, but more research linking molecular-level neural processes to altruistic behavior in humans and other species is needed, as is research on how various forms of altruism intersect.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking.

Human/COVID-19 interactions cause different outcomes ranging from minor health consequences to death. Since social interaction is the default mode by which individuals communicate with their surroundings, different modes of contagion can play a role in determining the long-term consequences for mental health and emotional well-being. We examined some basic aspects of human social interaction, emphasizing some particular features of the emotional contagion. Moreover, we analyzed the main report that described brain damage related to the COVID-19 infection. Indeed, the goal of this review is to suggest a possible explanation for the relationships among emotionally impaired people, brain damage, and COVID-19 infection. Results: COVID-19 can cause several significant neurological disorders and the pandemic has been linked to a rise in people reporting mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with COVID-19 include delirium, both acute and chronic attention and memory impairment related to hippocampal and cortical damage, as well as learning deficits in both adults and children. Conclusions: Although our knowledge on the biology and long-term clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 infection is largely limited, approaching the pandemic based on lessons learnt from previous outbreaks of infectious diseases and the biology of other coronaviruses will provide a suitable pathway for developing public mental health strategies, which could be positively translated into therapeutic approaches, attempting to improve stress coping responses, thus contributing to alleviate the burden driven by the pandemic.",2020,72,30,"{'name': 'Medicina', 'volume': '56'}","{'model':

A systematic review is provided with the aim of summarizing all autopsy studies up to February 2020 in which a complete post-mortem investigation in patients with COVID-19 disease was performed, focusing on histopathological features. We included case reports, case series, retrospective and prospective studies, letters to the editor, and reviews. A total of 28 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, producing a pooled dataset of 407 full autopsies. Analyzing the medical history data, only 12 subjects had died without any comorbidities (for 15 cases the data were not available). The post-mortem investigation highlighted that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure represent the main clinical features of COVID-19 disease, often leading to pulmonary thromboembolism and superimposed bronchopneumonia.

Despite this, to date, very few studies have been performed concerning autoptic specimens. Therefore, this study aimed: (i) to reiterate the importance of the autoptic examination, the only method able to precisely define the cause of death; (ii) to provide a complete post-mortem histological and immunohistochemical investigation pattern capable of diagnosing death from COVID-19 infection. (2) Methods: In this paper, the lung examination of two subjects who died from COVID-19 are discussed, comparing the obtained data with those of the control, a newborn who died from pneumonia in the same pandemic period. (3) Results: The results of the present study suggest that COVID-19 infection can cause different forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to diffuse alveolar damage and diffuse endothelial damage. Nevertheless, different patterns of cellular and cytokine expression are associated with anti-COVID-19 antibody positivity, compared to the control case. Moreover, in both case studies, it is interesting to note that COVID-19, ACE2 and FVIII positivity was detected in the same fields. (4) Conclusions: COVID-19 infection has been initially classified as exclusively interstitial pneumonia with varying degrees of severity. Subsequently, vascular biomarkers showed that it can also be considered a vascular disease. The data on Factor VIII discussed in this paper, although preliminary and limited in number, seem to suggest that the thrombogenicity of Sars-CoV2 infection might be linked to widespread endothelial damage. In this way, it would be very important to investigate the pro-coagulative substrate both in all subjects who died and in COVID-19 survivors. This is because it may be hypothesized that the different patterns with which the pathology is expressed could depend on different individual susceptibility to infection or a different personal genetic-clinical background. In light of these findings, it would be important to perform more post-mortem investigations in order to clarify all aspects of the vascular hypothesis in the COVID-19 infection.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 68, 'citationCount': 54, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4712263', 'name': 'L.

Although there are numerous potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated AKI, our current knowledge of kidney pathologic findings in COVID-19 is limited.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe examined the postmortem kidneys from 42 patients who died of COVID-19. We reviewed light microscopy findings in all autopsies and performed immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and in situ hybridization studies for SARS-CoV-2 on a subset of samples.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe cohort had a median age of 71.5 years (range, 38-97 years); 69% were men, 57% were Hispanic, and 73% had a history of hypertension. Among patients with available data, AKI developed in 31 of 33 patients (94%), including 6 with AKI stage 1, 9 with stage 2, and 16 with stage 3. The predominant finding correlating with AKI was acute tubular injury. However, the degree of acute tubular injury was often less severe than predicted for the degree of AKI, suggesting a role for hemodynamic factors, such as aggressive fluid management. Background changes of hypertensive arterionephrosclerosis and diabetic glomerulosclerosis were frequent but typically mild. We identified focal kidney fibrin thrombi in 6 of 42 (14%) autopsies. A single Black patient had collapsing FSGS. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were largely unrevealing, and in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 showed no definitive positivity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong a cohort of 42 patients dying with COVID-19, autopsy histologic evaluation revealed acute tubular injury, which was typically mild relative to the degree of creatinine elevation.

Although the main clinical manifestations are respiratory, an increase in neurological conditions, specifically acute cerebrovascular disease, has been detected. We present cerebrovascular disease case incidence in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were confirmed by microbiological/serological testing, or on chest CT semiology. Available data on comorbidity, laboratory parameters, treatment administered, neuroimaging, neuropathological studies and clinical evolution during hospitalization, measured by the modified Rankin scale, were analysed. A bivariate study was also designed to identify differences between ischaemic and haemorrhagic subtypes. A statistical model of binary logistic regression and sensitivity analysis was designed to study the influence of independent variables over prognosis. In our centre, there were 1683 admissions of patients with COVID-19 over 50 days, of which 23 (1.4%) developed cerebrovascular disease. Within this group of patients, cerebral and chest CT scans were performed in all cases, and MRI in six (26.1%). Histological samples were obtained in 6/23 cases (two brain biopsies, and four arterial thrombi). Seventeen patients were classified as cerebral ischaemia (73.9%, with two arterial dissections), five as intracerebral haemorrhage (21.7%), and one leukoencephalopathy of posterior reversible encephalopathy type. Haemorrhagic patients had higher ferritin levels at the time of stroke (1554.3 versus 519.2, P = 0.004). Ischaemic strokes were unexpectedly frequent in the vertebrobasilar territory (6/17, 35.3%). In the haemorrhagic group, a characteristic radiological pattern was identified showing subarachnoid haemorrhage, parieto-occipital leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds and single or multiple focal haematomas. Brain biopsies performed showed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy and endothelial injury, with no evidence of vasculitis or necrotizing encephalitis. The functional prognosis during the hospital period was unfavourable in 73.9% (17/23 modified Rankin scale 4–6), and age was the main predictive variable (odds ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.012–2.225; P = 0.043). Our series shows cerebrovascular disease incidence of 1.4% in patients with COVID-19 with high morbidity and mortality.

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported around the world; indeed, this infection has been declared a pandemic. Consequently, the scientific community is working hard to gain useful information about the history of this virus, its transmission, diagnosis, clinical features, radiological findings, research and development of candidate therapeutics as well as vaccines. This review aims to analyze the diagnostic techniques used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection, critically reviewing positive points and criticism for forensic implications, obviously including autopsy. Finally, this review proposes a practical workflow to be applied in the management of corpses during this outbreak of the COVID-19 infection, which could be useful in cases of future infectious disease emergencies. Analyzing the diagnostic methods, to date, virus nucleic acid RT-PCR represents the standard method used to ascertain the COVID-19 infection in living subjects and corpses, even if this technique has several criticisms: mainly, the staff should be highly specialized, working in high-throughput settings, able to handle high workloads and aware of health risks and the importance of the results. Thus, IgG/IgM serological tests have been developed, overcoming RT-qPCR duration, costs, and management, not requiring highly trained personnel. Nevertheless, serological tests present problems; the WHO recommends the use of these new point-of-care immunodiagnostic tests only in research settings. Furthermore, nothing has yet been published regarding the possibility of applying these methods during post-mortem investigations. In light of this scenario, in this review, we suggest a flow chart for the pathologist called on to ascertain the cause of death of a subject with historical and clinical findings of COVID-19 status or without any anamnestic, diagnostic, or exposure information. Indeed, the literature data confirmed the analytical vulnerabilities of the kits used for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly during postmortem examinations. For these reasons, autopsy remains the gold standard method to ascertain the exact cause of death (from or with COVID-19 infection, or other causes), to consequently provide real data for statistical evaluations and to take necessary measures to contain the risks of the infection. Moreover, performing autopsies could provide information on the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 infection with obvious therapeutic implications.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 90, 'citationCount': 47, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46538295', 'name': 'F.

The incidence and characteristics of neurological complications are unclear. For this reason, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) core COVID‐19 Task Force initiated a survey on neurological symptoms observed in patients with COVID‐19 infection. Methods A 17‐question online survey was made available on the EAN website and distributed to EAN members and other worldwide physicians starting on 9 April 2020. Results By 27 April 2020, proper data were collected from 2343 responders (out of 4199), of whom 82.0% were neurologists, mostly from Europe. Most responders (74.7%) consulted patients with COVID‐19 mainly in emergency rooms and in COVID‐19 units. The majority (67.0%) had evaluated fewer than 10 patients with neurological manifestations of COVID‐19 (neuro COVID‐19). The most frequently reported neurological findings were headache (61.9%), myalgia (50.4%), anosmia (49.2%), ageusia (39.8%), impaired consciousness (29.3%) and psychomotor agitation (26.7%). Encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disorders were reported at 21.0%. Neurological manifestations were generally interpreted as being possibly related to COVID‐19; they were most commonly recognized in patients with multiple general symptoms and occurred at any time during infection.

A comprehensive, integrative autopsy series that advances the mechanistic discussion surrounding this disease process is still lacking. METHODS Autopsies were performed at the Mount Sinai Hospital on 67 COVID-19 positive patients and data from the clinical records were obtained from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. The experimental design included a comprehensive microscopic examination carried out by a team of expert pathologists, along with transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, as well as immunology and serology assays. RESULTS Laboratory results of our COVID-19 cohort show elevated inflammatory markers, abnormal coagulation values, and elevated cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF. Autopsies revealed large pulmonary emboli in four cases. We report microthrombi in multiple organ systems including the brain, as well as conspicuous hemophagocytosis and a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome in many of our patients. We provide electron microscopic, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical evidence of the presence of the virus and the ACE2 receptor in our samples. CONCLUSIONS We report a comprehensive autopsy series of 67 COVID-19 positive patients revealing that this disease, so far conceptualized as a primarily respiratory viral illness, also causes endothelial dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, and an imbalance of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Novel findings reported here include an endothelial phenotype of ACE2 in selected organs, which correlates with clotting abnormalities and thrombotic microangiopathy, addressing the prominent coagulopathy and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Another original observation is that of macrophage activation syndrome, with hemophagocytosis and a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like disorder, underlying the microangiopathy and excessive cytokine release.

Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19, in all the examined studies the lack of a well-defined pathophysiology of death among patients who died following COVID-19 infection is evident. Autopsy should be considered mandatory to define the exact cause of death, thus providing useful clinical and epidemiologic information as well as pathophysiological insights to further provide therapeutic tools. Methods: A literature review was performed on PubMed database, using the key terms: “COVID-19”, “nCov 19”, and “Sars Cov 2”. 9709 articles were retrieved; by excluding all duplicated articles, additional criteria were then applied: articles or abstracts in English and articles containing one of the following words: “death”, “died”, “comorbidity”, “cause of death”, “biopsy”, “autopsy”, or “pathological”. Results: A total of 50 articles met the inclusion criteria. However, only 7 of these studies reported autopsy-based data. Discussion: The analysis of the main data from the selected studies concerns the complete analysis of 12,954 patients, of whom 2269 died (with a mortality rate of 17.52%). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection was obtained in all cases and comorbidities were fully reported in 46 studies. The most common comorbidities were: cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and coronary artery disease), metabolic disorders (diabetes, overweight, or obesity), respiratory disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cancer. The most common reported complications were: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, liver insufficiency, and septic shock. Only 7 papers reported histological investigations. Nevertheless, only two complete autopsies are described and the cause of death was listed as COVID-19 in only one of them. The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection. Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients. As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary. Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 84, 'citationCount': 99, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34192476', 'name': 'M.

The infection spread first in China and then in the rest of the world, and on the 11th of March, the WHO declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. Taking into consideration the mortality rate of COVID-19, about 5–7%, and the percentage of positive patients admitted to intensive care units being 9–11%, it should be mandatory to consider and take all necessary measures to contain the COVID-19 infection. Moreover, given the recent evidence in different hospitals suggesting IL-6 and TNF-α inhibitor drugs as a possible therapy for COVID-19, we aimed to highlight that a dietary intervention could be useful to prevent the infection and/or to ameliorate the outcomes during therapy. Considering that the COVID-19 infection can generate a mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with a consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α, a dietary regimen modification in order to improve the levels of adiponectin could be very useful both to prevent the infection and to take care of patients, improving their outcomes.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 108, 'citationCount': 135, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145188467', 'name': 'G.

Due to the scientific community’s efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus’ biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines. Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens. Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights. Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures. In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities. Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.

The current pandemic is changing priorities for the general population, but it is also challenging the agenda of health professionals, including that of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals [3]. Everywhere in the world, psychiatric clinics are modifying their practice in order to guarantee care and support to persons with mental health problems, but also to those who are not mentally ill and are suffering from the psychosocial consequences of the pandemic. The number of those who will need psychiatric help is going to increase in the next weeks or months, requiring a reconsideration of our current practices. From a psychopathological viewpoint, the current pandemic is a relatively new form of stressor or trauma for mental health professionals [4]. It has been compared with natural disasters, such as earthquakes or tsunamis [5]. But in those cases, the emergencies are usually localized, limited to a specific area and to a given time; people know that they can escape, if they want to or if they have the possibility to do so [6]. It has also been compared with wars and international mass conflicts. But in those circumstances, the enemy is easily recognizable, while in pandemic the “ threat ” can be everywhere and it can be carried by the person next to us [7].

As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the host–virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak.

A Literature Review', 'abstract': 'Background and Objectives: Anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) are a complex group of molecules that include both steroidal androgens and synthetic compounds, derived from testosterone. AASs are commonly used to support pharmacological therapy in cases of primary or secondary hypogonadism, major burns, and neoplastic cachexia. Their prolonged and supra-physiological consumption can provoke several adverse effects on various organs and systems. Among these, the physiopathological mechanisms that induce neuropsychiatric disorders related to AAS abuse are poorly known. For this reason, the proposed review aims to retrace the pathway of action of testosterone to focus on the effects on the central nervous system and specifically highlight the effects of AASs on neuropsychiatric and behavioral functions, as well as on lifestyle. Materials and Methods: This review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. On these database websites, we searched for articles from 1 January 1980 to March 2019 using the key terms: “AAS,” “Anabolic Androgenic Steroids,” “brain,” and “neurology.” Results: The use of AASs through self-administration yields circulating androgens levels, inducing neuron apoptosis, which is linked to thinner cortex and, in general, less cortical volume. The same alterations affect the putamen. These differences were more evident when correlated with longer use. From a functional point of view, prolonged AAS consumption seemed to be related to lower connectivity between amygdala and frontal, striatal, limbic, hippocampal and visual cortical areas. On the other hand, AAS use seems to negatively condition the positive effects of the sport exercise, reducing its important anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative functions on the hippocampus, implicated in anxiolytic control. Conclusion: This review clarifies the major aspects of the side effects related to AAS use/abuse highlighting the complex mechanisms on neuropsychiatric and cognitive pathological alterations and also the emotional and behavioral dysfunctions.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 100, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '11928964', 'name': 'G.

This could involve focusing on the identity of an object while ignoring identity-preserving transformations such as changes in viewpoint or focusing on its current viewpoint while ignoring its identity. To effectively filter out variation due to the irrelevant dimension, performing either type of task is likely to require high-level, abstract search templates. Past work has found target recognition signals in areas of ventral visual cortex and in subregions of parietal and frontal cortex. However, target status in these tasks is typically associated with the identity of an object, rather than identity-orthogonal properties such as object viewpoint. In this study, we used a task that required subjects to identify novel object stimuli as targets according to either identity or viewpoint, each of which was not predictable from low-level properties such as shape. We performed functional MRI in human subjects of both sexes and measured the strength of target-match signals in areas of visual, parietal, and frontal cortex. Our multivariate analyses suggest that the multiple-demand (MD) network, including subregions of parietal and frontal cortex, encodes information about an object\'s status as a target in the relevant dimension only, across changes in the irrelevant dimension. Furthermore, there was more target-related information in MD regions on correct compared with incorrect trials, suggesting a strong link between MD target signals and behavior. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Real-world target detection tasks, such as searching for a car in a crowded parking lot, require both flexibility and abstraction. We investigated the neural basis of these abilities using a task that required invariant representations of either object identity or viewpoint. Multivariate decoding analyses of our whole brain functional MRI data reveal that invariant target representations are most pronounced in frontal and parietal regions, and the strength of these representations is associated with behavioral performance.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 64, 'citationCount': 12, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153298430', 'name': 'Margaret M.

One hundred and thirty-three participants were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and then asked to complete the Cope Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory.

The 5HTT-LPR was significantly associated with Neuroticism, the coping strategy of Focus on and Venting of Emotions’ (FVE) and symptoms of anxiety. FVE and Neuroticism mediated the association between the 5HTT-LPR and symptoms of anxiety (i.e., Cognitive Anxiety and Emotional Arousal Control). Also, Neuroticism was a mediator of the association between the 5HTT-LPR and FVE. Finally, FVE also mediated effects on the relationship between Neuroticism and symptoms of anxiety.

The multidimensional nature of host manipulation has only recently been recognised: parasites do not target single host traits, but instead suites of interrelated traits. Here, I use recent research on animal personality (behavioural differences among individuals consistent across time and situations) and behavioural syndromes (correlations at the population level among distinct behavioural traits, or between the same trait expressed in different contexts) to provide a framework from which simple testable patterns of host behavioural changes can be predicted. Following infection, a manipulative parasite could (i) change the temporal consistency of its host’s behavioural responses, (ii) change the slope of a host reaction norm, i.e. the way host behavioural traits are expressed as a function of an environmental gradient, or (iii) decouple two or more host behavioural traits and/or change the way in which they correlate with each other. Two case studies involving trematode parasites and their freshwater hosts are used to provide empirical illustrations of the above scenarios. These clearly illustrate the full richness of behavioural alterations induced by parasites, and how these effects would go unnoticed using the classical trait-by-trait comparisons of mean values between parasitised and non-parasitised individuals. However, the power of animal personality and behavioural syndromes to inform research on host manipulation by parasites will only be fully realised when underlying mechanisms are elucidated and linked to their phenotypic impacts.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 141, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145836042', 'name': 'R.

However, in recent years, the need to go beyond traditional ToM accounts for understanding real life social interactions has become all the more pressing. At the same time it remains unclear whether alternative accounts, such as interactionism, can yield a sufficient description and explanation of social interactions. We argue that instead of considering ToM and interactionism as mutually exclusive opponents, they should be integrated into a more comprehensive account of social cognition. We draw on dual process models of social cognition that contrast two different types of social cognitive processing. The first type (labeled Type 1) refers to processes that are fast, efficient, stimulus-driven, and relatively inflexible. The second type (labeled Type 2) refers to processes that are relatively slow, cognitively laborious, flexible, and may involve conscious control. We argue that while interactionism captures aspects of social cognition mostly related to Type 1 processes, ToM is more focused on those based on Type 2 processes. We suggest that real life social interactions are rarely based on either Type 1 or Type 2 processes alone. On the contrary, we propose that in most cases both types of processes are simultaneously involved and that social behavior may be sustained by the interplay between these two types of processes.

Here we delineated brain networks subserving social perception under naturalistic conditions in 19 healthy humans who watched, during 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a set of 137 short (approximately 16\u2009s each, total 27\u2009min) audiovisual movie clips depicting pre-selected social signals. Two independent raters estimated how well each clip represented eight social features (faces, human bodies, biological motion, goal-oriented actions, emotion, social interaction, pain, and speech) and six filler features (places, objects, rigid motion, people not in social interaction, non-goal-oriented action, and non-human sounds) lacking social content. These ratings were used as predictors in the fMRI analysis. The posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) responded to all social features but not to any non-social features, and the anterior STS responded to all social features except bodies and biological motion. We also found four partially segregated, extended networks for processing of specific social signals: (1) a fronto-temporal network responding to multiple social categories, (2) a fronto-parietal network preferentially activated to bodies, motion, and pain, (3) a temporo-amygdalar network responding to faces, social interaction, and speech, and (4) a fronto-insular network responding to pain, emotions, social interactions, and speech.

This approach gave rise to the immensely successful field of social cognition and fundamentally changed the way in which social psychological phenomena are studied. More recently, social scientists of many stripes have turned to the methods of cognitive neuroscience to understand the neural basis of social cognition. A pervasive finding from this research is that social knowledge, be it about one's self or of others, is represented in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). This review focuses on the social cognitive neuroscience of self and person knowledge in the MPFC.

However, averaged ERP waveforms provide only limited information about the neuronal mechanisms underlying stimulus processing, motor preparation, and response production or inhibition. In this study, we examine the cortical representation of conflict monitoring and response inhibition using time-frequency analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during continuous performance Go/NoGo task in 50 young adult females.

Overall, phase synchronization across trials measured by Phase Locking Index and phase synchronization between electrode sites measured by Phase Coherence were the highest in the Go and NoGo conditions, intermediate in the Warning condition, and the lowest under Neutral condition.

However, it is unclear how these shared representations can be controlled and distinguished. Brain imaging suggests that controlling shared representations, indexed by the ability to control automatic imitative responses, activates anterior fronto‐median cortex (aFMC), and temporo‐parietal junction (TPJ). Crucially, these regions are also consistently implicated in mental state attribution and have provided an alternative account for higher‐level social cognition. Here, we directly tested whether social‐cognitive processes involve similar key computational mechanisms as the control of shared representations by using functional brain imaging to reveal overlapping brain circuits. We show in a within‐subject design that commonly activated regions occurred selectively in aFMC and TPJ. Mentalizing and self‐referential thoughts recruited a region in aFMC, which was also activated when controlling imitation. In the TPJ, an area overlapped between mentalizing, agency processing, and imitative control. Behavioral and neural correlates of mentalizing were further related to the individual ability for controlling imitation. Our findings support the assumption of shared key processes and suggest a novel link between embodied and social cognition.

Since neurovirulence may be determined at the early stages of infection of the central nervous system (CNS), we hypothesize that it may depend on the ability of the virus to induce proinflammatory signals from brain cells for the recruitment of blood-derived inflammatory cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied the interaction between coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus) of different neurovirulences with primary cell cultures of brain immune cells (astrocytes and microglia) and mouse tissues. We found that the level of neurovirulence of the virus correlates with its differential ability to induce proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 12 [IL-12] p40, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, IL-15, and IL-1β) in astrocytes and microglia and in mouse brains and spinal cords. These findings suggest that coronavirus neurovirulence may depend on a novel discriminatory ability of astrocytes and microglia to induce a proinflammatory response in the CNS.', 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 135, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2117014703', 'name': 'Yun Li'}, {'authorId': '50660673', 'name': 'L.

To examine the specificity of brain regions responsive to biological motion, brain activations obtained during a “walker vs. non-walker” discrimination task were compared with those elicited by two other tasks: (i) non-rigid motion (NRM), involving the discrimination of overall motion direction in the same “point-lights” display, and (ii) face-gender discrimination, involving the discrimination of gender in briefly presented photographs of men and women. Brain activity specific to “biological motion” recognition arose in the lateral cerebellum and in a region in the lateral occipital cortex presumably corresponding to the area KO previously shown to be particularly sensitive to kinetic contours. Additional areas significantly activated during the biological motion recognition task involved both, dorsal and ventral extrastriate cortical regions. In the ventral regions both face-gender discrimination and biological motion recognition elicited activation in the lingual and fusiform gyri and in the Brodmann areas 22 and 38 in superior temporal sulcus (STS). Along the dorsal pathway, both biological motion recognition and non-rigid direction discrimination gave rise to strong responses in several known motion sensitive areas. These included Brodmann areas 19/37, the inferior (Brodmann Area 39), and superior parietal lobule (Brodmann Area 7). Thus, we conjecture that, whereas face (and form) stimuli activate primarily the ventral system and motion stimuli primarily the dorsal system, recognition of biological motion stimuli may activate both systems as well as their confluence in STS. This hypothesis is consistent with our findings in stroke patients, with unilateral brain lesions involving at least one of these areas, who, although correctly reporting the direction of the point-light walker, fail on the biological motion task.', 'year': 2001, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 510, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1697005', 'name': 'L.

We aimed to clarify the temporal dynamics of this cortical activation by neuromagnetic recordings during execution, on-line imitation, and observation of right-hand reaching movements that ended with a precision pinch of the tip of a manipulandum. During execution, the left inferior frontal cortex [Brodmann\'s area (BA) 44] was activated first (peak approximately 250 ms before the pinching); this activation was followed within 100-200 ms by activation in the left primary motor area (BA4) and 150-250 ms later in the right BA4. During imitation and observation, the sequence was otherwise similar, but it started from the left occipital cortex (BA19). Activation was always strongest during action imitation. Only the occipital activation was detected when the subject observed the experimenter reaching his hand without pinching. These results suggest that the left BA44 is the orchestrator of the human ""mirror neuron system"" and is strongly involved in action imitation.

Implicit mentalizing is present in infants less than one year old as well as in some nonhuman species. Explicit mentalizing is a meta-cognitive process and enhances the ability to learn about the world through self-monitoring and reflection, and may be uniquely human. Meta-cognitive processes can also exert control over automatic behavior, for instance, when short-term gains oppose long-term aims or when selfish and prosocial interests collide.

We assessed both between-person and within-person associations using a quasi-experiment (Study 1) and a 7-day diary study (Study 2). Results suggest that the mechanisms behind affect and life satisfaction differ. In terms of affect, the emotional contagion perspective was supported. Participants tended to report more positive affect and less negative affect when browsing more positive posts, irrespective of social comparison directionality. By contrast, life satisfaction was associated with both mechanisms.

Yet, previous research has exclusively focused on the negative side of social comparison and envy on SNS. Thereby, it has neglected two important aspects: (a) comparison processes can also elicit a beneficial emotional reaction to other users' online self-presentations (i.e., benign envy) and, thus, (b) comparisons can be motivating, with positive outcomes for well-being. The present study aims at closing this research gap by investigating how social comparisons and envy on SNS are related to inspiration, a complex motivational state. Due to its specific characteristics of a creative and aesthetic visual culture, we focus our investigation on Instagram. A structural equation modeling mediation analysis with data from N\u2009=\u2009385 Instagram users reveals that the intensity of social comparisons on Instagram was positively related to inspiration and that this relationship was fully mediated by benign envy. Furthermore, inspiration on Instagram was related to increased positive affect.

From a social comparison perspective, strangers’ positive posts on social media are expected to negatively affect viewers’ emotions. From an emotional contagion perspective, strangers’ positive posts should positively affect viewers’ emotions. The current lab experiment examines both the social comparison and the emotional contagion perspective while taking individual differences into account. Participants viewed positive, neutral, or no posts of confederates. In support of the social comparison perspective, individuals who tend to compare themselves to others reported lower positive affect if they had viewed positive posts than if they had viewed neutral or no posts. In support of the emotional contagion perspective, individuals who tend not to engage in social comparison reported higher positive affect after viewing positive posts than after viewing neutral or no posts. These findings indicate that individual differences in processing tendencies lead people to respond to social information on social media in opposite ways.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 143, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3175517', 'name': 'D.

Selection studies offering 2 options (up or down) showed a strong preference (and no evidence of publication bias) for upward choices when there was no threat; there was no evidence for downward comparison as a dominant choice even when threatened. Selections became less differentiable when a lateral choice was also provided. For reaction studies, contrast was, by far, the dominant response to social comparison, with ability estimates most strongly affected. Moderator analyses, tests and adjustments for publication bias showed that contrast is stronger when the comparison involves varying participants’ standing for ability (effect estimates, −0.75 to −0.65) and affect (−0.83 to −0.65). Novel personal attributes were subject to strong contrast for ability (−0.5 to −0.6) and affect (−0.6 to −0.7). Dissimilarity priming was associated with contrast (−0.44 to −0.27; no publication bias), consistent with Mussweiler (2003). Similarity priming provided modest support for Collins (1996) and Mussweiler (2003), with very weak assimilation effects, depending on the publication bias estimator. Studies including control groups indicated effects in response to upward and downward targets were comparable in size and contrastive. Limitations of the literature (e.g., small number of studies including no-comparison control conditions), unresolved issues, and why people choose to compare upward when the most likely result is self-deflating contrast are discussed.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 106, 'citationCount': 310, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2067217', 'name': 'J.

Some research suggests that Facebook use can have negative consequences for well-being. Instagram, a photo-sharing social network created in 2010, has particular characteristics that may make users susceptible to negative consequences. This study tested a theoretically grounded moderated meditation model of the association between Instagram use and depressive symptoms through the mechanism of negative social comparison, and moderation by amount of strangers one follows. One hundred and seventeen 18-29 year olds completed online questionnaires containing demographics, frequency of Instagram use, amount of strangers followed on Instagram, the Center for Epidemiological Resources Scale for Depression, and the Social Comparison Rating Scale. Instagram use was marginally positively associated with depressive symptoms, and positive social comparison was significantly negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Amount of strangers followed moderated the associations of Instagram use with social comparison (significantly) and depressive symptoms (marginally), and further significantly moderated the indirect association of Instagram use with depressive symptoms through social comparison. Findings generally suggest that more frequent Instagram use has negative associations for people who follow more strangers, but positive associations for people who follow fewer strangers, with social comparison and depressive symptoms. Implications of negative associations of social networking for people who follow strangers and the need for more research on Instagram use given its increasing popularity are explored.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 375, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2044916', 'name': 'Katerina Lup'}, {'authorId': '3184703', 'name': 'Leora Trub'}, {'authorId': '80726473', 'name': 'L.

In four studies (N = 1,094)—using the newly developed Benign and Malicious Envy Scale (BeMaS)—we show that dispositional envy is also characterized by two independent dimensions related to distinct motivational dynamics and behavioral consequences. Dispositional benign and malicious envy uniquely predict envious responding following upward social comparisons. Furthermore, they are differentially connected to hope for success and fear of failure. Corresponding to these links, dispositional benign envy predicted faster race performance of marathon runners mediated via higher goal setting.

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others.

In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.

Supporting evidence for each of these models is reviewed, strengths and weaknesses are evaluated, and commonalities and discrepancies among approaches are described.

Second, we propose that the influence of personality traits on life satisfaction is mediated by the use of chronically accessible sources because traits produce stability of these sources. Most important, the influence of extraversion and neuroticism is mediated by use of memories of past emotional experiences. To test this model, participants repeatedly judged life-satisfaction over the course of a semester. After each assessment, participants reported sources that they used for these judgments. Changes in reported sources were related to changes in life-satisfaction judgments. A path model demonstrated that chronically accessible and stable sources are related to stable individual differences in life-satisfaction. Furthermore, the model supported the hypothesis that personality effects were mediated by chronically accessible and stable sources. In sum, the results are consistent with our theory that life-satisfaction judgments are based on chronically accessible sources.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 207, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3888371', 'name': 'U.

Major results were (a) comparison direction varied with relationship with the target; (b) precomparison negative mood led more often to upward comparison than to downward comparison, supporting a selective affect-cognition priming model in which dysphoria primes negative thoughts about the self (Bower, 1991; Forgas, Bower, & Moylan, 1990) rather than a motivational self-enhancement model (Wills, 1981,1991); (c) upward comparison decreased subjective well-being, whereas downward comparison increased it; and (d) high self-esteem individuals engaged in more self-enhancing comparison. Festinger\'s theory of social comparison processes (Festinger, 1954) continues to be an active arena for theory and research. A new edited book (Suls & Wills, 1991), a symposium at the 1990 meeting of the Society for Experimental Social Psychology (SESP), and frequent journal articles attest to this vigor. Yet underlying the vitality is a feeling of uneasiness, obvious in the comments occasioned by the SESP symposium, in which a group of extraordinari ly knowledgeable participants showed little agreement about such apparently basic questions as ""Do people compare at all (or very much)? When do people compare? How do people balance upward and downward comparisons? How much does similarity count in comparison? Do people compare with actual targets, or are all comparisons constructed in people\'s heads? The problem is that there are many measures of social comparison, and they do not agree well with one another, leading to theoretical proliferation lacking a coherent empirical base. These measures may not agree with one another because of difficulties with the measures themselves (Wood, 1991), because they measure different motives for social comparison (cf. Wood & Taylor, 1991), or because they have been used in different contexts.

While opinions and abilities may, at first glance, seem to be quite different things, there is a close functional tie between them. They act together in the manner in which they affect behavior. A person’s cognition (his opinions and beliefs) about the situation in which he exists and his appraisals of what he is capable of doing (his evaluation of his abilities) will together have bearing on his behavior. The holding of incorrect opinions and/or inaccurate appraisals of one’s abilities can be punishing or even fatal in many situations. It is necessary, before we proceed, to clarify the distinction between opinions and evaluations of abilities since at first glance it may seem that one’s evaluation of one’s own ability is an opinion about it. Abilities are of course manifested only through performance which is assumed to depend upon the particular ability. The clarity of the manifestation or performance can vary from instances where there is no clear ordering criterion of the ability to instances where the performance which reflects the ability can be clearly ordered. In the former case, the evaluation of the ability does function like other opinions which are not directly testable in “objective reality’. For example, a person’s evaluation of his ability to write poetry will depend to a large extent on the opinions which others have of his ability to write poetry. In cases where the criterion is unambiguous and can be clearly ordered, this furnishes an objective reality for the evaluation of one’s ability so that it depends less on the opinions of other persons and depends more on actual comparison of one’s performance with the performance of others. Thus, if a person evaluates his running ability, he will do so by comparing his time to run some distance with the times that other persons have taken. In the following pages, when we talk about evaluating an ability, we shall mean specifically the evaluation of that ability in situations where the performance is unambiguous and is known. Most situations in real life will, of course, present situations which are a mixture of opinion and ability evaluation. In a previous article (7) the author posited the existence of a drive to determine whether or not one’s opinions were “correct”. We are here stating that this same drive also produces behavior in people oriented toward obtaining an accurate appraisal of their abilities. The behavioral implication of the existence of such a drive is that we would expect to observe behaviour on the part of persons which enables them to ascertain whether or not their opinions are correct and also behavior which enables them accurately to evaluate their abilities.

Sometimes self-evaluations are assimilated toward a given standard. At other times, they are contrasted away from the standard. On the basis of the selective accessibility model (T. Mussweiler, 2003a), the authors hypothesized that assimilation results if judges engage in the comparison process of similarity testing and selectively focus on similarities to the standard, whereas contrast occurs if judges engage in dissimilarity testing and selectively focus on differences. If these alternative comparison mechanisms are indeed at play, then assimilative and contrastive social comparisons should be accompanied by diverging informational foci on similarities versus differences. Results of 5 studies support this reasoning, demonstrating that assimilation results under conditions that foster similarity testing, whereas contrast occurs under conditions that foster dissimilarity testing. Furthermore, assimilative social comparisons are accompanied by a general informational focus on similarities, whereas contrastive comparisons are accompanied by a focus on differences. Life confronts people with an endless stream of social comparison opportunities. No matter whether they go to school, church, or the Oktoberfest, the other people who surround them exhibit vast amounts of information indicating how smart, wealthy, or brave they are. Neighbors may brag about the amount of money they earn, or—more subtly— convey this information by buying a gas-guzzling sport utility vehicle. High school friends may show off with their grades, or—more subtly—mention the Ivy League colleges that have offered them scholarships. No matter how shrewdly such intimidating details are conveyed, people as egocentric social information processors tend to process, comprehend, and evaluate such news by relating the details to themselves (Dunning & Hayes, 1996). In evaluating the bravery of a 16-year-old who is lining up for a ride on the latest roller coaster at the Oktoberfest, people typically use themselves as social comparison standards. To what effect? How do such social comparisons influence the way people see themselves? Will they feel richer, smarter, and braver when confronted with sport-utility-vehicle-driving neighbors, prospective Ivy League students, and daring youngsters? Or will such exposures shed doubt on their own qualities? Social comparison research provides a clear answer to these questions: It depends. In fact, it depends on a great many things.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that comprehensively takes both emotional contagion and evacuation assistant into account in the relevant studies of Social Force Model. Firstly, we optimize the original Social Force Model to offset the overlapping phenomenon caused by pedestrians’ body compression and relative tangential motion. Secondly, we construct an emotional-contagion-based model, which is integrated into the self-driving force of the Social Force Model, to dynamically adjust pedestrian’s velocity and direction. Finally, specific evacuation strategies are adopted for different types of pedestrians, and evacuation assistants are set to guide the evacuees who are panic about the hazards in a rational way. Obviously, shown by extensive evaluations and experimental results, the model presented in this article reflects the influence of Emotional Contagion and Evacuation Assistant on crowd evacuation genuinely and efficiently, outperforming mainstream approaches in evacuation efficiency.",2020,31,7,"{'name': 'IEEE Access', 'pages': '195989-196001', 'volume': '8'}","{'model': 'specter_v1',

'title': 'Strategies to Utilize the Positive Emotional Contagion Optimally in Crowd Evacuation', 'abstract': 'In a crisis situation, negative emotions often spread among the crowd, and they have adverse impacts on human decisions, resulting in stampedes and crushes. Safety officers are often dispatched to scenes of emergencies because their positive emotions can calm the crowd down and avoid serious accidents. However, how to utilize the positive emotional contagion to maximize the “calm-down” effect remains a challenging problem in crowd evacuation. In this paper, we present an approach for optimizing positive emotional contagion in crowd evacuation. First, a computational model of positive emotional contagion is proposed to describe how safety officers calm a crowd down. To capture important influential factors for positive emotional contagion, such as the trust relationships among the individuals involved in a crisis situation and the variations of emotional contagion speed, we construct a trust-based emotional contagion network (Trust-ECN) and a heterogeneous emotional contagion speed computation model (HECS-CM). Based on these models, the emotional contagion process can be analyzed in a parametric way, and the infection probability for each individual in a given time window can be computed analytically with a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). Second, a maximization problem of emotional contagion is formulated. Since this optimization problem is NP-hard, an artificial bee colony optimized emotional contagion (ABCEC) algorithm is used to solve for the optimal positions of safety officers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world data at different scales. Finally, we implement a crowd simulation system to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis in a graphical manner. The proposed method can provide guidance for emergency response management.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 45, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}, {'authorId': '2118902760', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}]}, {'paperId': '82b9d02d3ab9e49d8b63e589d284f8b1bdf53463', 'title': 'Learning crowd behavior from real data: A residual network method for crowd simulation', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 26, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2113322333', 'name': 'Zhenzhen Yao'}, {'authorId': '3172102', 'name': 'Guijuan Zhang'}, {'authorId': '7382513', 'name': 'Dianjie Lu'}, {'authorId': '2118902760', 'name': 'Hong Liu'}]}, {'paperId': '48d2a6f63c60a1ee10177e94868bda6b16febb91', 'title': 'IoT-Based Positive Emotional Contagion for Crowd Evacuation', 'abstract': 'In emergency evacuations, crowds often become congested and stampeded because of extreme panic, resulting in injuries and fatalities. Safety officers can spread positive emotions and reduce crowd panic by issuing information or appeasement, which is an effective way to ensure evacuation safety. However, how to deploy safety officers appropriately and maximize positive emotional contagion to cover the largest number of chaotic individuals is still a challenging problem. To solve this problem, we propose an IoT-based positive emotional contagion (IoT-PEC) method for crowd evacuation. First, we employ IoT technologies to capture the attributes of crowd movement, such as position and velocity. Based on these attributes, the crowd chaos can be quantified by calculating the macroscopic and microscopic entropies. Second, we propose an entropy-based anisotropic emotional contagion model (E-AECM) to achieve the nonuniform positive emotional contagion considering the influence of chaos on the propagation rate. Third, we formulate the problem of safety officer placement as an optimization problem to maximize the positive emotional contagion on the chaos individuals. Finally, we implement a simulation system for crowd evacuation to visualize the results of positive emotion contagion.

The number, location, and the actions of the leaders are the most important elements in an evacuation strategy and have a great impact on evacuation efficiency. This paper proposes a hybrid bi-level model to optimize the number and initial locations of leaders as well as the routes of leaders during the evacuation, which explicitly incorporates the passengers’ guidance demand and multi-leader coordination mechanism. The leaders’ initial locations are generated by solving the maximal covering location problem (upper level model) and their evacuation routes are determined by a co-simulation heuristic approach (lower level model). The social force model and its modifications are used to model the dynamics of common evacuees, leaders, and followers in simulation models. The convergence performance of the proposed co-simulation heuristic approach and the effectiveness of the optimal evacuation strategy have been investigated and demonstrated using a case study of a typical island platform of Beijing’s URT station. Three other evacuation strategies are considered for comparison purposes in order to show the influence of the number and initial locations of leaders as well as the multi-leader coordination mechanism during the evacuation process. Our analysis supported by simulations shows the following: 1) the optimal number of leaders exists for a given human cost and guidance demand constraints; 2) the distribution of leaders for maximal covering makes the evacuation of the followers more efficient; and 3) the proposed optimal evacuation strategy has better performance in terms of shorter evacuation time and higher utilization of exits compared with other considered strategies.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 59, 'authors': [{'authorId': '51508619', 'name': 'Min Zhou'}, {'authorId': '3046943', 'name': 'Hai-rong Dong'}, {'authorId': '2109706353', 'name': 'Yanbo Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2663035', 'name': 'Petros A.

Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together.

It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect.

Inspired by this field, this paper proposes a method for simulating group interactions during emergency evacuation. First, each individual is assigned with dynamic survival needs and psychological quality based on urgent event and the external influence. Second, the emotional interaction of the group is realized based on OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) personality trait and the improved CA-SIRS (Cellular Automaton-Susceptible Infected Recovered Susceptible) model. Third, after the perception of the external environment changes, the accident experience and panic level are used as factors of emotion update. At last, the environmental familiarity and nearby flow factors are introduced to path planning process. Based on emotion contagion, this method explores individual’s emotional changes in different scenarios and situations. Combined with personality traits and emotional contagion, the experimental results show that the proposed method can simulate dynamic emotional changes in emergency situations in both efficient and reasonable way and provide guidance for emergency evacuation.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 14, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2068016746', 'name': 'Rui Zhou'}, {'authorId': '1646697180', 'name': 'Yi Ou'}, {'authorId': '2116723934', 'name': 'Wei Tang'}, {'authorId': '2183688578', 'name': 'Qian Wang'}, {'authorId': '2110431559', 'name': 'Bao Yu'}]}, {'paperId': '20dc4631cc4d3df3c9e35aef3c3674ffb847bf51', 'title': 'Optimal Number and Location Planning of Evacuation Signage in Public Space', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 45, 'citationCount': 61, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2117994844', 'name': 'Zhe Zhang'}, {'authorId': '144191107', 'name': 'L.

Wundt (1897) was concerned with the underlying structure of emotions, and his conclusions were similar to those of recent investigators concerning the dimensions of emotional quality (e.g., Russell, 1980). But James was more concerned with function than structure.

While facial expressions can be a voluntary reaction, the change of temperature in the body is often not. Thus, a facial expression may not always be consistent with the emotional state that is expressed by the body temperature. This article aims to study the human perception of the emotional expression and the emotional state of a robot that simultaneously uses its face and body temperature. To this end, a robot, named TherMoody, which has the capability to change its body temperature from 10–55℃, was used. Then, 25 combinations (5x5: one facial expression and one thermal expression for anger, joy, fear, sadness, and neutral state) were evaluated by 15 participants. Thermal expressions were designed based on the metaphors of emotions related to temperature. The results show people tend to base their judgment of the robot’s emotional expression exclusively in its facial expression, regardless of the change of its body temperature. However, there are combinations where the thermal expression predominates over the facial expression when judging the robot’s emotional state. Thus, these combinations may produce the perception that the robot’s emotional expression is, in fact, genuine, simulated, masked, or neutralized.",2020,55,10,"{'name': 'ACM Transactions on

Based on emotion metaphors that capture mental models of emotions, we systematically designed and validated a set of 28 different uni- and multimodal expressions for the basic emotions joy, sadness, fear and anger using the most common output modalities color, motion and sound. Classification accuracy and users’ confidence of emotion assignment were evaluated in an empirical study with 33 participants and a robot probe.

Therefore, the research in this paper mapped subjective ratings of a range of thermal stimuli to the circumplex model to understand the range of emotions that might be conveyed through thermal feedback. However, as the suitability of the model varies depending on the type of emotional stimuli [31], we also compared the goodness of fit of ratings between the circumplex and vector [8,31] models of emotion. The results showed that thermal feedback was interpreted as representing a limited range of emotions concentrated in just two quadrants or categories of the circumplex: high valence, low arousal and low valence, high arousal.

Even though we are often consciously aware of our current emotional state, such as anger or happiness, the mechanisms giving rise to these subjective sensations have remained unresolved. Here we used a topographical self-report tool to reveal that different emotional states are associated with topographically distinct and culturally universal bodily sensations; these sensations could underlie our conscious emotional experiences. Monitoring the topography of emotion-triggered bodily sensations brings forth a unique tool for emotion research and could even provide a biomarker for emotional disorders. Emotions are often felt in the body, and somatosensory feedback has been proposed to trigger conscious emotional experiences. Here we reveal maps of bodily sensations associated with different emotions using a unique topographical self-report method. In five experiments, participants (n = 701) were shown two silhouettes of bodies alongside emotional words, stories, movies, or facial expressions. They were asked to color the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing while viewing each stimulus. Different emotions were consistently associated with statistically separable bodily sensation maps across experiments. These maps were concordant across West European and East Asian samples. Statistical classifiers distinguished emotion-specific activation maps accurately, confirming independence of topographies across emotions.

For expressions based on Body Movement and other signals than facial expressions, like Sound, no common grounds have been established so far. Based on psychological research on human expression of emotions and perception of emotional stimuli we created eight different expressional designs for the emotions Anger, Sadness, Fear and Joy, consisting of Body Movements, Sounds and Eye Colors. In a large pre-test we evaluated the recognition ratios for the different expressional designs. In our main experiment we separated the expressional designs into their single cues (Body Movement, Sound, Eye Color) and evaluated their expressivity. The detailed view at the perception of our expressional cues, allowed us to evaluate the appropriateness of the stimuli, check our implementations for flaws and build a basis for systematical revision. Our analysis revealed that almost all Body Movements were appropriate for their target emotion and that some of our Sounds need a revision.

Experiment 1 compared a colorful and a gray room, whereas in experiments 2 and 3 red and blue rooms were compared. The results indicate that the color of an interior space will have effects on many different levels. The perception of the room itself was affected, and the colors also had an impact on the emotions and physiology of those who stayed in the rooms. Strong, especially red, colors and patterns put the brain into a more excited state, sometimes to such an extent as to cause a paradoxical slowing of the heart rate. Introvert persons, as well as those already in a negative mood, became more affected than others, which caused severe changes in their performance. The series of experiments described here were among the first to be carried out in full-scale rooms painted or otherwise decorated in various colors. One practical implication is that a moderate use of good color design will serve to improve the overall mood and well-being of people. In future research more emphasis should be placed on color, as just one component in the highly complex real-life situations. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

There are situations, however, when touch cannot be exchanged. Although mobile phones and web-based communication are ubiquitous, touch—a communication modality that conveys powerful messages—is inexistent in modern communications media. This paper describes a tele-touch device that transfers affective touch to another person through the internet. Commands for vibration, warmth, and tickle were sent over the internet to a haptic device at the subjects’ forearm. With a heart rate (HR) monitor and a galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor, the physiological effect of the tele-touch device was evaluated as the subjects watched an emotionally-laden movie. We compared these to one group of subjects who were touched by their spouse or girlfriend and to subjects of a control group where no touch was provided. Results show that the HR of the subjects with the tele-touch device was not significantly different from those subjects who were touched by their loved ones. These results were in contrast to the subjects who were not provided with any form of touch.

However, pain empathic responses encompass emotional contagion as well as unspecific arousal and overlapping functional activations are not sufficient to determine shared and process-specific neural representations. We employed multivariate pattern analyses to fMRI data acquired during physical and affective vicarious pain induction and found spatially and functionally similar cross-modality (physical versus affective) whole-brain vicarious pain-predictive patterns. Further analyses consistently identified shared neural representations in the bilateral mid-insula. Mid-insula vicarious pain patterns were not sensitive to capture non-painful arousing negative stimuli but predicted self-experienced pain during thermal stimulation, suggesting process-specific representation of emotional contagion for pain. Finally, a domain-general vicarious pain pattern which predicted vicarious as well as self-experienced pain was developed. Our findings demonstrate a generalizable neural expression of vicarious pain and suggest that the mid-insula encodes emotional contagion for pain.",2020,67,5,{'name': 'bioRxiv'},"{'model':

Fig. S1 and Table S1; for all online suppl. material, see www. karger.com/doi/10.1159/000504180). Categorical diagnostics were conducted during hospital admission and independently confirmed by a standardized clinical interview according to DSM IV criteria. In addition, GAD and MDD symptom load was dimensionally assessed using validated self-report scales (Penn State Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ; Beck Depression Inventory II, BDIII), indicating that depressive symptom load was higher in MDD compared to both, GAD patients and HC, while GAD symptom load was higher in both patient groups relative to HC (all psBonferroni-corrected < 0.001) but comparable between patient groups (p > 0.1). MRI data collection, preprocessing, and modeling adhered to evaluated standard protocols (online suppl. material). The main interaction contrast of interest ([affective pain > affective control] > [physical pain > physical control]) was subjected to a voxelwise mixed ANOVA, including group as between-subject factor (FWE-pcluster = 0.05, whole-brain). Results of this categorial strategy revealed a significant interaction effect of diagnosis in a cluster predominantly located in the right dorsal anterior insula (rdAI) spreading into the adjacent vlPFC (FWE-pcluster = 0.023, k = 119). Post hoc analyses demonstrated that compared to HC, MDD patients exhibited exaggerated neural reactivity during affective pain yet attenuated reactivity during physical pain observation in this region, whereas GAD patients did not (Fig. 1b). Based on the contribution of both the insula and right amygdala to emotional empathy [7], functional connectivity alterations between these regions were examined in MDD relative to HC (contrast [affective pain > affective control] > [physical pain > physical control]) which revealed aberrant rdAI-right basolateral amygdala (rBLA) functional communication in MDD (FWE-psvc < 0.05, k = 5, MNI peak coordinates x/y/z: 24/3/–30, Fig. 1c). Post hoc analyses revealed decreased rdAI-rBLA functional connectivity during affective yet increased connectivity during physical pain observation in MDD patients relative to HC. Further exploratory voxel-wise ANOVAs separately examined empathy-specific neural activation differences ([physical pain > physical control]; [affective pain > affective control]) and revealed that both diagnostic groups demonstrated decreased bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, FWE-pcluster = 0.05, k = 95, Fig. 1d) reactivity during observation of physical pain. To explore empathic differences in daily life, the personal distress scale from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index was assessed, revealing that MDD patients reported higher discomfort when confronted with suffering of others compared to both, HC and GAD patients (Fig. 1e, online suppl. Table S1). Finally, a confirmatory dimensional approach was employed to examine associations between MDD and GAD symptom load, and personal distress with rdAI pain empathic reactivity and connecAnxiety disorders and depression are highly prevalent, debilitating, and commonly comorbid mental disorders. Epidemiological, symptomatic, and pathogenetic perspectives suggest a particularly strong relationship between generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), leading to a continuous debate about their nosological and neurobiological uniqueness [1]. Traditional case control studies in either MDD or GAD patients suggest shared dysregulations in emotional and cognitive domains and underlying amygdala-frontal circuits [1, 2], while initial studies have reported disorder-specific dysregulations in the insular and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) [3]. During recent years, dysregulations in social processes, such as emotional empathy, have gained increasing attention as transdiagnostic etiological and diagnostic factors for internalizing disorders, including both depression and anxiety [4]. Expression of emotional empathy is dependent on the integrity of the anterior insula (AI) and adjacent ventral frontal regions, but while initial evidence suggests that empathic experience is impaired in MDD [5], common and distinct neural alterations in this domain between MDD and GAD and whether these vary between physical and affective pain observation have not been examined. To this end, the present neuroimaging study examined neural empathic reactivity and everyday empathic experience in unmedicated, treatment-naïve first-episode GAD (n = 35) and MDD (n = 37) patients and healthy controls (HC, n = 35) by means of a validated blocked-design emotional (pain) empathy fMRI paradigm [6] employing visually presented physical and affective pain stimuli, as well as corresponding control stimuli (Fig. 1a). To account for potential cognitive alterations during the symptomatic state, participants were asked to passively view the stimuli.

Inter-subject phase synchronization (ISPS) is an approach for exploratory analysis of task-based fMRI data that reveals brain networks dynamically synchronized to task-features across subjects. We applied ISPS to task-fMRI data assessing vicarious pain empathy in healthy subjects (n=238). The task employed physical (limb) and affective (faces) painful and corresponding non-painful visual stimuli. ISPS revealed two distinct networks synchronized during physical pain observation, one encompassing anterior insula and midcingulate regions strongly engaged in (vicarious) pain, and another encompassing parietal and inferior frontal regions associated with social cognitive processes which may further modulate and support the pain empathic response. No robust network synchronization was observed while processing facial expressions of pain, possibly reflecting high inter-individual variation in response to socially transmitted pain experience. ISPS also revealed networks related to task onset or general processing of physical (limb) or affective (face) stimuli which encompassed networks engaged in object manipulation or face processing, respectively.

In some cases, however, acute pain can impair function and lead to other morbidities. Chronic pain, meanwhile, can present as a psychopathological condition that significantly interferes with daily living. Most basic and translational pain research has focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms in the spinal and peripheral nervous systems. In contrast, the brain plays a key role in the affective manifestation and cognitive control of pain. In particular, several cortical regions, such as the somatosensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular, and anterior cingulate cortex, are well-known to be activated by acute pain signals, and neurons in these regions have been demonstrated to undergo changes in response to chronic pain. Furthermore, these cortical regions can project to a number of forebrain and limbic structures to exert powerful top-down control of not only sensory pain transmission but also affective pain expression, and such cortical regulatory mechanisms are particularly relevant in chronic pain states. Newer techniques have emerged that allow detailed studies of central pain circuits in animal models, as well as how such circuits are modified by the presence of chronic pain and other predisposing psychosomatic factors. These mechanistic approaches can complement imaging in human studies. At the therapeutic level, a number of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have recently been shown to engage these top-down control systems to provide analgesia. In this review, we will discuss how pain signals reach important cortical regions, and how these regions in turn project to sub-cortical areas of the brain to exert profound modulation of the pain experience. In addition, we will discuss the clinical relevance of such top-down pain regulation mechanisms.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 160, 'citationCount': 19, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6213409', 'name': 'Louise Urien'}, {'authorId': '2152441884', 'name': 'Jing Wang'}]}, {'paperId': '64a86d71889b347f3f6900bf504f1c67e1408e0b', 'title': 'A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on pain empathy: investigating the role of visual information and observers’ perspective', 'abstract': ""Abstract Empathy relies on brain systems that support the interaction between an observer’s mental state and cues about the others’ experience.

A coordinate-based meta-analysis of fMRI experiments on pain empathy was conducted to obtain activation likelihood estimates along three factors and seven conditions: visual cues (body parts, facial expressions), visuospatial (first-person, thirdperson), and cognitive (self-, stimuli-, other-oriented tasks) perspectives. The core network was found across cues and perspectives, and common activation was observed in higher-order visual areas. Body-parts distinctly activated areas related with sensorimotor processing (superior and inferior parietal lobules, anterior insula) while facial expression distinctly involved the inferior frontal gyrus. Self- compared to other-perspective produced distinct activations in the left insula while stimulus- versus other-perspective produced distinctive responses in the inferior frontal and parietal lobules, precentral gyrus, and cerebellum.

During early extinction, losartan enhanced threat-signal specific ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation and its coupling with the basolateral amygdala. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed that losartan reduced whole brain, particularly vmPFC, threat expression and voxel-wise mediation analyses further confirmed that losartan-accelerated extinction crucially involved vmPFC processing.

Though data collection and analyses are conducted at the voxel level, inferences are often based on anatomical regions. The discrepancy between the unit of analysis and the unit of inference leads to ambiguity and flexibility in analyses that can create a false sense of reproducibility. For example, hypothesizing effects on “amygdala activity” does not provide a falsifiable and reproducible definition of precisely which voxels or which patterns of activation should be observed. Rather, it comprises a large number of unspecified sub-hypotheses, leaving room for flexible interpretation of findings, which we refer to as “model degrees of freedom.” From a survey of 135 functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies in which researchers claimed replications of previous findings, we found that 42.2% of the studies did not report any quantitative evidence for replication such as activation peaks. Only 14.1% of the papers used exact coordinate-based or a priori pattern-based models. Of the studies that reported peak information, 42.9% of the ‘replicated’ findings had peak coordinates more than 15 mm away from the ‘original’ findings, suggesting that different brain locations were activated, even when studies claimed to replicate prior results. To reduce the flexible and qualitative region-level tests in neuroimaging studies, we recommend adopting quantitative spatial models and tests to assess the spatial reproducibility of findings.

A Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Studies of Empathy', 'abstract': ""Empathy is an essential component of our social lives, allowing us to understand and share other people's affective and sensory states, including pain. Evidence suggests a core neural network—including anterior insula (AI) and mid-cingulate cortex (MCC)—is involved in empathy for pain. However, a similar network is associated to empathy for non-pain affective states, raising the question whether empathy for pain is unique in its neural correlates. Furthermore, it is yet unclear whether neural correlates converge across different stimuli and paradigms that evoke pain-empathy. We performed a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify neural correlates of empathy, assess commonalities and differences between empathy for pain and for non-pain negative affective states, and differences between pain-empathy evoking stimuli (i.e., facial pain expressions vs. acute pain inflictions) and paradigms (i.e., perceptual/affective vs. cognitive/evaluative paradigms). Following a systematic search, data from 128 functional brain imaging studies presenting whole-brain results of an empathy condition vs. baseline/neutral condition were extracted. Synthesizing neural correlates of empathy confirmed a core network comprising AI, MCC, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, thalamus, amygdala, and brainstem. There was considerable overlap in networks for empathy for pain and empathy for non-pain negative affective states. Important differences also arose: empathy for pain uniquely activated bilateral mid-insula and more extensive MCC. Regarding stimuli, painful faces and acute pain inflictions both evoked the core empathy regions, although acute pain inflictions activated additional regions including medial frontal and parietal cortex. Regarding paradigms, both perceptual/affective and cognitive/evaluative paradigms recruited similar neural circuitry, although cognitive/evaluative paradigms activated more left MCC regions while perceptual/affective paradigms activated more right AI. Taken together, our findings reveal that empathy for pain and empathy for non-pain negative affective states share considerable neural correlates, particularly in core empathy regions AI and MCC. Beyond these regions, important differences emerged, limiting generalizability of findings across different affective/sensory states. Within pain-empathy studies, the core regions were recruited robustly irrespective of stimuli or instructions, allowing one to tailor designs according to specific needs to some extent, while ensuring activation of core regions."", 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 94, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4791548', 'name': 'I.

Accumulating evidence suggests that interoceptive dysfunctions that underpin the core symptomatic emotion recognition and empathy deficits in ASD may be contributed to by high levels of alexithymia rather than autistic symptoms per se. However, previous findings are hampered by generally elevated alexithymia in ASD patients, and thus were not able to differentiate common and distinct contributions across the entire spectrum of variations of autism and alexithymia. Moreover, the multi-factorial nature of the domains affected, such as distinct neural reactivity towards perceiving physical and affective pain, has not been accounted for. Against this background the present fMRI study employed a dimensional trait approach in n = 242 healthy subjects to determine common and distinct associations between both traits and pain empathic responses towards physical and affective pain. Higher levels of alexithymia associated with increased left anterior insula pain empathic reactivity. Disentangling these effects revealed a positive association during perceived physical pain, but a negative one during affective pain. No significant associations with trait autism were found, but an interaction effect between the trait dimensions was observed in the mid-cingulate cortex. Moderation analysis demonstrated that trait autism only impacted mid-cingulate reactivity towards physical pain in high alexithymia subjects, whereas reactivity towards affective pain was specifically associated with trait autism in low alexithymia subjects. Findings confirm previous patient studies suggesting that alexithymia rather than autism per se may drive altered insula pain empathic reactivity. Importantly, the present approach allowed for the first time to demonstrate that the impact of alexithymia on insula reactivity varies as a function of the pain empathic domain and that effects on other core empathy nodes evolve in interaction with trait autism.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2108960971', 'name': 'Jialin Li'}, {'authorId': '46265559', 'name': 'Lei Xu'}, {'authorId': '50432723', 'name': 'Xiaoxiao Zheng'}, {'authorId': '3894640', 'name': 'M.

Animal models indicate that this process is neurally underpinned by a shift in ventral–dorsal striatal control of behavior; however, this shift has not been directly examined in humans. The present resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study employed a two‐step approach to: (a) precisely map striatal alterations using a novel, data‐driven network classification strategy combining intrinsic connectivity contrast with multivoxel pattern analysis and, (b) to determine whether a ventral to dorsal striatal shift in connectivity with reward and regulatory control regions can be observed in abstinent (28 days) male cannabis‐dependent individuals (n =\u200924) relative to matched controls (n =\u200928). Network classification revealed that the groups can be reliably discriminated by global connectivity profiles of two striatal regions that mapped onto the ventral (nucleus accumbens) and dorsal striatum (caudate). Subsequent functional connectivity analysis demonstrated a relative shift between ventral and dorsal striatal communication with fronto‐limbic regions that have been consistently involved in reward processing (rostral anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]) and executive/regulatory functions (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex [PFC]). Specifically, in the cannabis‐dependent subjects, connectivity between the ventral striatum with the rostral ACC increased, whereas both striatal regions were uncoupled from the regulatory dorsomedial PFC. Together, these findings suggest a shift in the balance between dorsal and ventral striatal control in cannabis dependence.

Combining functional neuroimaging with multivariate pattern analyses, we identified dissociable patterns that predicted somatic (high versus low: 100%) and vicarious (high versus low: 100%) pain intensity in out-of-sample individuals. Critically, each pattern was at chance in predicting the other experience, demonstrating separate modifiability of both patterns. Somatotopy (upper versus lower limb: 93% accuracy for both conditions) was also distinct, located in somatosensory versus mentalizing-related circuits for somatic and vicarious pain, respectively. Two additional studies demonstrated the generalizability of the somatic pain pattern (which was originally developed on thermal pain) to mechanical and electrical pain, and also demonstrated the replicability of the somatic/vicarious dissociation. These findings suggest possible mechanisms underlying limitations in feeling others’ pain, and present new, more specific, brain targets for studying pain empathy.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been identified.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn four studies involving a total of 114 participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1, we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI activity across brain regions--a neurologic signature--that was associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent remifentanil.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn study 1, the neurologic signature showed sensitivity and specificity of 94% or more (95% confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall. In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and nonpainful warmth with 93% sensitivity and specificity (95% CI, 84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain and social pain with 85% sensitivity (95% CI, 76 to 94) and 73% specificity (95% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95% sensitivity and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil was administered.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is possible to use fMRI to assess pain elicited by noxious heat in healthy persons. Future studies are needed to assess whether the signature predicts clinical pain.

However, this overlap raises the question of whether it may reflect a unique distributed population of bimodal neurons or, alternatively, the activity of intermingled but independent populations. We used fMRI on 28 female volunteers and used multivariate pattern analysis techniques to probe for more fine-grain spatial representations of seen and felt pain. Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only in the anterior insula (bilaterally) the distribution of cortical activity evoked by seeing another person's hand in pain was spatially similar to that of pain felt on one's own hand. Subsequent region of interest analyses also implicated the middle insula (right hemisphere) and the middle cingulate cortex. Furthermore, for the anterior insula, the spatial distribution of activity associated with one's pain also replicates that of the perception of negative but painless stimuli.

Part of the neural activation shared between self‐ and other‐related experiences seems to be rather automatically activated.

However, it is not clear whether these two systems are part of a single interacting empathy system or whether they are independent. Additionally, the neuroanatomical bases of these systems are largely unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that emotional empathic abilities (involving the mirror neuron system) are distinct from those related to cognitive empathy and that the two depend on separate anatomical substrates. Subjects with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal (VM) or inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) cortices and two control groups were assessed with measures of empathy that incorporate both cognitive and affective dimensions. The findings reveal a remarkable behavioural and anatomic double dissociation between deficits in cognitive empathy (VM) and emotional empathy (IFG). Furthermore, precise anatomical mapping of lesions revealed Brodmann area 44 to be critical for emotional empathy while areas 11 and 10 were found necessary for cognitive empathy. These findings are consistent with these cortices being different in terms of synaptic hierarchy and phylogenetic age. The pattern of empathy deficits among patients with VM and IFG lesions represents a first direct evidence of a double dissociation between emotional and cognitive empathy using the lesion method.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 87, 'citationCount': 1370, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1397560295', 'name': 'S.

Single-unit responses in area 24 of cingulate cortex were examined in halothane-anesthetized rabbits during stimulation of the skin with transcutaneous electrical (TCES, 3-10 mA), mechanical (smooth or serrated forceps to the dorsal body surface or graded pressures of 100-1,500 g to the stabilized ear) and thermal (> 25 degrees C) stimulation. 2. Of 542 units tested in cingulate cortex, 150 responded to noxious TCES (> or = 6 mA), 93 of 221 units tested responded to noxious mechanical (serrated forceps) and 9 of 47 units tested responded to noxious heat (> 43 degrees C) stimuli. Twenty-five percent of the units that responded to noxious mechanical stimuli also responded to noxious heat stimuli. The only innocuous stimulus that evoked activity in cingulate cortex was a ""tap"" to the skin and this was effective for 11 of 14 tested units. 3. In 74 units that produced excitatory responses to TCES of the contralateral ear, response latency was 166 +/- 11.3 (SE) ms and response duration was 519 +/- 52.1 ms. 4. Twenty of the 150 units that responded to noxious TCES were initially inhibited. These responses were usually < 1 s in duration (17 of 20 units), whereas responses in the other 3 lasted for over 20 s. 5. Most units had broad receptive fields, because noxious mechanical stimuli anywhere on the dorsal surface of the rabbits, including the face and ears, evoked responses. A small number of units for which the entire body surface was tested (3 of 15 units) had receptive fields limited to the ears, rostral back, and forepaws. 6. Fifteen of 33 units tested had no preferential responses to noxious TCES of the ipsilateral and contralateral ears. Of the remaining units, 10 had a greater response to contralateral and 8 had a greater response to ipsilateral stimuli. 7. The locations of 186 units were histologically verified. Most nociceptive cingulate units were in dorsal area 24b in layers III (n = 35), II (n = 13), or V (n = 9). 8. Cortical knifecut lesions were made in five rabbits to determine if the responses in area 24 were dependent on lateral or posterior cortical inputs. These lesions did not alter the percentage of units driven by noxious stimuli nor response latency. 9.

Our stereological counts of VENs in FI and LA show them to be more numerous in humans than in apes. In humans, small numbers of VENs appear the 36 th week post conception, with numbers increasing during the first eight months after birth. There are significantly more VENs in the right hemisphere in postnatal brains; this may be related to asymmetries in the autonomic nervous system. VENs are also present in elephants and whales and may be a specialization related to very large brain size. The large size and simple dendritic structure of these projection neurons suggest that they rapidly send basic information from FI and LA to other parts of the brain, while slower neighboring pyramids send more detailed information.

Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.', 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 83, 'citationCount': 2624, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3351205', 'name': 'N.

However, there is limited research examining the phenomenon of emotional contagion in social anxiety, which is the topic of the current study. Design and Methods An experimental design was used in which undergraduate psychology students (N = 128) were assigned to either an experimental condition (watching a video of a socially anxious presenter) or a control condition (watching a video of a nonanxious presenter). Various measures were administered to assess social anxiety, emotional contagion, state anxiety, and related constructs. Results After controlling for baseline anxiety levels, participants in the experimental condition reported significantly higher levels of anxiety during and immediately after watching the video compared to individuals in the control condition (multivariate analysis of covariance, analysis of variance). Similar results were found across both conditions in participants with higher levels of trait social anxiety and higher public speaking anxiety (moderated regression analyses). Conclusions The findings suggest that social anxiety may be emotionally contagious, and provides insight into the role that emotional contagion may play in the association between social anxiety and

This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life. This research is crucial to provide consumers of emotion research with the translational information they require.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 478, 'citationCount': 775, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1731779', 'name': 'L.

It describes that the retrospective evaluation of pain is largely based on the discomfort experienced at the most intense point (peak) and at the end of the episode. This is notable because it means that longer episodes with a better ending can be remembered as less aversive than shorter ones; this is even if the former had the same peak in painfulness and an overall longer duration of pain. Until now, this bias has not been studied in the domain of anxiety despite the high relevance of variable levels of anxiety in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Therefore, we set out to replicate the original studies but with an induction of variable levels of anxiety. Of 64 women, half watched a clip from a horror movie which ended at the most frightening moment. The other half watched an extended version of this clip with a moderately frightening ending. Afterward, all participants were asked to rate the global anxiety which was elicited by the video. When the film ended at the most frightening moment, participants retrospectively reported more anxiety than participants who watched the extended version. This is the first study to document that the peak-end bias can be found in the domain of anxiety. These findings require replication and extension to a treatment context to evaluate its implications for exposure therapy.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 14, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2054335862', 'name': 'U.

However, the phenomenon of vicarious anxiety—the experience of anxiety in response to observing others expressing anxiety—and the interpersonal mechanisms underlying it have not been fully investigated in prior research. In 4 studies, we investigate the role of empathy in experiencing vicarious anxiety, using film clips depicting target victims facing threats. In Studies 1 and 2, trait emotional empathy was associated with greater self-reported anxiety when observing target victims, and with perceiving greater anxiety to be experienced by the targets. Study 3 extended these findings by demonstrating that trait empathic concern—the tendency to feel concern and compassion for others—was associated with experiencing vicarious anxiety, whereas trait personal distress—the tendency to experience distress in stressful situations—was not. Study 4 manipulated state empathy to establish a causal relationship between empathy and experience of vicarious anxiety. Participants who took an empathic perspective when observing target victims, as compared to those who took an objective perspective using reappraisal-based strategies, reported experiencing greater anxiety, risk-aversion, and sleep disruption the following night. These results highlight the impact of one’s social environment on experiencing anxiety, particularly for those who are highly empathic. In addition, these findings have implications for extending basic models of anxiety to incorporate interpersonal processes, understanding the role of empathy in social learning, and potential applications for therapeutic contexts.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 87, 'citationCount': 37, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2174637', 'name': 'Jocelyn Shu'}, {'authorId': '40269007', 'name': 'S.

In order to test the internal consistency reliability, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used and was found satisfactory at 0.72. The sample was randomly split and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in the even subsample, justifying the one-factor solution, with the only discrepancy of the low loading of an item. In the odd subsample a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to confirm the one-factor model identified by the EFA. The chi square test (χ2) of the model was significant (p < 0.05), while the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI) and the goodness of fit index (GFI) values were 0.078, 0.969 and 0.960, respectively, further supporting the model’s fit. Student’s t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that women, teachers with children of their own, those working full-time in public schools, those with students who needed special education, and those who had received mental health promotion training, scored higher. Additionally, multiple linear regression analysis revealed that sex, working status, having students who needed special education, and having attended mental health training courses were independently associated with TEQ score.

The presentation is designed for use in the upcoming DSM‐5 manual to provide more coherent estimates than would otherwise be available. Prevalence estimates are presented for the age groups proposed by DSM‐5 workgroups as the most useful to consider for policy planning purposes. The LMR/12‐month prevalence estimates ranked by frequency are as follows: major depressive episode: 29.9%/8.6%; specific phobia: 18.4/12.1%; social phobia: 13.0/7.4%; post‐traumatic stress disorder: 10.1/3.7%; generalized anxiety disorder: 9.0/2.0%; separation anxiety disorder: 8.7/1.2%; panic disorder: 6.8%/2.4%; bipolar disorder: 4.1/1.8%; agoraphobia: 3.7/1.7%; obsessive‐compulsive disorder: 2.7/1.2. Four broad patterns of results are most noteworthy: first, that the most common (lifetime prevalence/morbid risk) lifetime anxiety‐mood disorders in the United States are major depression (16.6/29.9%), specific phobia (15.6/18.4%), and social phobia (10.7/13.0%) and the least common are agoraphobia (2.5/3.7%) and obsessive‐compulsive disorder (2.3/2.7%); second, that the anxiety‐mood disorders with the earlier median ages‐of‐onset are phobias and separation anxiety disorder (ages 15–17) and those with the latest are panic disorder, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder (ages 23–30); third, that LMR is considerably higher than lifetime prevalence for most anxiety‐mood disorders, although the magnitude of this difference is much higher for disorders with later than earlier ages‐of‐onset; and fourth, that the ratio of 12‐month to lifetime prevalence, roughly characterizing persistence, varies meaningfully in ways consistent with independent evidence about differential persistence of these disorders.

In this paper, we examine these areas and suggest that affect in groups, as well as specific mechanisms to regulate and maintain certain affective states in groups, have had important roles in promoting group survival over evolutionary history. Specifically, we suggest that affect in groups serves a coordination function, which can take one of two forms. First, affect in groups quickly provides information about the environment and group structure to other group members, thus coordinating group activity via a communication function. Second, shared affect in groups coordinates group activity through fostering group bonds and group loyalty. These two functions of affect in groups are closely related and mutually reinforcing.

The two imagine perspectives produced the predicted distinct pattern of emotions, suggesting different motivational consequences: Imagining how the other feels produced empathy, which has been found to evoke altruistic motivation; imagining how you would feel produced empathy, but it also produced personal distress, which has been found to evoke egoistic motivation.', 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 1067, 'authors': [{'authorId': '88089335', 'name': 'C.

The present research assessed the accuracy of the assumption in terms of self‐report measures of social‐communicative anxiety. Fourteen instruments, representative of three conceptual groups (performance, communicative and social anxiety) were completed by a group of undergraduates. Three major tests of empirical equivalence were completed (correlations, factor analysis, classification analysis). Results indicated that virtually every measure was significantly and strongly associated with most other measures and most reflected the same general construct. The classification analysis revealed only moderate agreement among measures. A replication was completed which supported the conclusion of the primary study.

15,15,15,15,19,c70dbe9c42871cb9ac837c14deb144feda3510be,The Influence of Social Networks on Team Performance: Moderating Effect of Emotional Contagion,"With the development of the Internet, the use of social networks has 
become more and more important in team management. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
impact of social networks use on team performance and the moderating role of 
emotional contagion plays in this relationship. 80 college students from 20 innovation and entrepreneurship teams 
completed questionnaires on team social networks use scale and team performance 
scale, and then performed team tasks. Three video clips were used as emotionally 
induced materials. Results showed that the use of social networks can 
positively predict team performance, and that positive emotional contagion also 
has the predictive effect. Critically, emotional contagion 
acts as a moderator in the relationship between the use of social networks and 
team performance. Specifically, under 
the condition of positive emotional contagion, the high-level use of 
social networks can positively predict better team performance; under the 
condition of negative emotional contagion, there is no significant difference 
in team performance at different uses of 
social network service levels. These findings suggest that managers should pay 
more attention to the dissemination of positive emotional information in social 
networks to improve team performance.",2020,0,1,"{'name': 'Open Journal of Social Sciences', 'pages': '553-565', 'volume': '08'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-4.493009090423584,

PsyCap questionnaire (PCQ), leader-member exchange scale, and the positive affect scale in the positive and negative affect scale (PANAS) were adopted to measure variables. A total of 430 questionnaires were distributed in 2014 and the response rates were 90.2%. Structural equation model and hierarchical linear model were applied to analyze the survey data. The results revealed that leaders’ psychological capital had a positive influence on their followers’ psychological capital. Leader-member exchange was the cross-level mediator between leaders’ psychological capital and their followers’. The cross-level mediating effect of leaders’ positive emotions perceived by followers was not significant. The results of this study extended the social exchange theory and enriched researches on leadership. The implication was discussed in details.",2019,45,27,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '10'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-0.25280624628067017, -3.88541316986084,

To that end, CQC has developed statistical surveillance tools that periodically aggregate large numbers of quantitative performance measures to identify risks to the quality of care and prioritise its limited inspection resource. These tools have, however, failed to successfully identify poor-quality providers. Facing continued budget cuts, CQC is now further reliant on an ‘intelligence-driven’, risk-based approach to prioritising inspections and a new effective tool is required. Objective To determine whether the near real-time, automated collection and aggregation of multiple sources of patient feedback can provide a collective judgement that effectively identifies risks to the quality of care, and hence can be used to help prioritise inspections. Methods Our Patient Voice Tracking System combines patient feedback from NHS Choices, Patient Opinion, Facebook and Twitter to form a near real-time collective judgement score for acute hospitals and trusts on any given date. The predictive ability of the collective judgement score is evaluated through a logistic regression analysis of the relationship between the collective judgement score on the start date of 456 hospital and trust-level inspections, and the subsequent inspection outcomes. Results Aggregating patient feedback increases the volume and diversity of patient-centred insights into the quality of care. There is a positive association between the resulting collective judgement score and subsequent inspection outcomes (OR for being rated ‘Inadequate’ compared with ‘Requires improvement’ 0.35 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.76), Requires improvement/Good OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.44), and Good/Outstanding OR 0.13 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.84), with p<0.05 for all). Conclusions The collective judgement score can successfully identify a high-risk group of organisations for inspection, is available in near real time and is available at a more granular level than the majority of existing data sets. The collective judgement score could therefore be used to help prioritise inspections.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 71, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145669742', 'name': 'A.

However, the use of control variables can produce uninterpretable parameter estimates, erroneous inferences, irreplicable results, and other barriers to scientific progress. As a result, methodologists have provided a great deal of advice regarding the use of statistical control, to the point that researchers might have difficulties sifting through and prioritizing the available suggestions. We integrate and condense this literature into a set of 10 essential recommendations that are generally applicable and which, if followed, would substantially enhance the quality of published organizational research.

As consequence, more and more organizations shifted from work organized around individual-base job to team-based work structures. Recent organizational researches confirmed that work team members’ organizational citizenship behavior had unique meaning to facilitate the effective functioning of work team. The purpose of this article was to explore how work team leaders’ psychological capital influenced on their direct followers’ organizational citizenship behavior. Sixty-six work teams (66 work team leaders and their 303 followers) were sampled from a large State-owned enterprise in eastern China. Data were collected from leaders and their direct followers respectively. Both work team leaders and their followers self-rated their own level of psychological capital. Besides, work team members also finished an organizational citizenship behavior self-report questionnaire. Structural equation model (SEM) and hierarchical linear mode (HLM) were applied to analyze the survey data. After controlling demographic and human capital variables, such as, gender, age, marriage, educational level and organizational tenure, hierarchical linear modeling results revealed that work team leaders’ psychological capital was positively related to their direct followers’ organizational citizenship behavior, work team members’ psychological capital was a cross-level mediator between work team leaders’ psychological capital and their followers’ organizational citizenship behavior. However, this research didn’t support the hypothesis that the relationship between work team members’ psychological capital and organizational citizenship behavior was moderated by work team leaders’ psychological capital such that the relationship was stronger when work team leaders’ psychological capital was perceived to be high versus low. This finding was different from that of western organizational background. Our findings revealed that both work team leaders and members’ psychological capital were positively associated with work team members’ organizational citizenship behavior. The result suggested that psychological capital, especially work team leaders’ psychological capital, was a key element for constructing efficient work teams.

In this review we survey the research findings documenting the functions of emotion and link these to new discoveries about how emotion is accurately processed and transmitted. We focus specifically on emotion processing in dyads and groups, which reflects the current scientific trend. Within dyads, emotional expressions and learning and understanding through vicarious emotion are the phenomena of interest. Behavioral and brain mechanisms supporting their successful occurrence are evaluated. At the group level, group emotions and group-based emotions, two very different phenomena, are discussed, and mechanistic accounts are reviewed.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 223, 'citationCount': 292, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1986858', 'name': 'P.

To address this uncertainty, this paper attempts to systematically examine the impact of CMV on the inferences drawn from survey research in the IS area. First, we describe the available approaches for assessing CMV and conduct an empirical study to compare them. From an actual survey involving 227 respondents, we find that although CMV is present in the research areas examined, such biases are not substantial. The results also suggest that few differences exist between the relatively new marker-variable technique and other well-established conventional tools in terms of their ability to detect CMV. Accordingly, the marker-variable technique was employed to infer the effect of CMV on correlations from previously published studies. Our findings, based on the reanalysis of 216 correlations, suggest that the inflated correlation caused by CMV may be expected to be on the order of 0.10 or less, and most of the originally significant correlations remain significant even after controlling for CMV. Finally, by extending the marker-variable technique, we examined the effect of CMV on structural relationships in past literature. Our reanalysis reveals that contrary to the concerns of some skeptics, CMV-adjusted structural relationships not only remain largely significant but also are not statistically differentiable from uncorrected estimates. In summary, this comprehensive and systematic analysis offers initial evidence that (1) the marker-variable technique can serve as a convenient, yet effective, tool for accounting for CMV, and (2) common method biases in the IS domain are not as serious as those found in other disciplines.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 2693, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40240832', 'name': 'N.

Generated from both the positive psychology movement and the authors' pioneering work on positive organizational behavior, PsyCap goes beyond traditionally recognized human and social capital. But PsyCap is not a vague or unscientific concept: to be included in PsyCap, a given positive construct must be based on theory, research, and valid measurement, must be open to development, and must have measurable performance impact. The positive constructs that have been determined to best meet these PsyCap criteria, efficacy (confidence), hope, optimism, and resiliency, are covered in separate chapters in Psychological Capital. After exploring other potential positive constructs such as creativity, wisdom, well being, flow, humor, gratitude, forgiveness, emotional intelligence, spirituality, authenticity, and courage, the authors summarize the research demonstrating the performance impact of PsyCap. They go on to provide the PsyCap Questionnaire (PCQ) as a measurement tool, and the PsyCap Intervention (PCI) as a development aid.

Purpose
This study aims to examine the impacts of restaurant servers’ actions on the customers’ emotional contagion and the impacts of customers’ emotional contagion on their intention to tip and the likelihood of tipping. This study also explores social compliance and examines its impacts on customers’ intentions to tip and the likelihood of tipping.


Design/methodology/approach
Taking a restaurant in Taiwan as an example, this study uses questionnaires to investigate five constructs of the research framework, which are restaurant servers’ actions, restaurant customers’ susceptibility to emotional contagion, customers’ intention to tip, customers’ likelihood of tipping and customers’ social compliance. The questionnaires were distributed online using Surveycake website. A total of 310 completed questionnaires were collected.


Findings
The results indicate the following: restaurant servers’ actions positively affect customers’ susceptibility to emotional contagion; customers’ emotional contagion positively affects their intention to tip and likelihood of tipping; customers’ social compliance positively affects their intentions to tip and the likelihood of tipping; and customers’ emotional contagion partially mediates the effects of restaurant servers’ actions on customers’ intention to tip and likelihood of tipping.


Originality/value
The hypothesis test results in this article not only successfully integrate or confirm the research findings of past scholars, but also expand the scope of research on related topics. Furthermore, the research findings of this study provide restaurant practitioners with rich marketing implications.

This study aims to fill this gap and explores the mediating role of emotional contagion and what kind of response helps better deter their negative effect.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis research is conducted through a one-panel study and three experimental studies. SAS enterprise miner is used for text mining analysis and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Process macro models are used to analyze the experimental data.\n\n\nFindings\nNegative reviews related to the tangibility, responsiveness and empathy dimensions have a more detrimental effect on brand equity than negative reviews related to the assurance and reliability dimensions. The results also provide evidence that emotional contagion is more prevalent when consumers read reviews that are specific to the empathy and responsiveness dimensions. Finally, accommodative responses from the service provider are more effective in deterring the effect of a negative online review on brand equity.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe generalizability of this study is limited to the restaurant and hotel industry.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe findings will also help the brand manager in understanding the comparative effect of service quality-specific negative reviews on brand equity and also the type of responses that brand managers should give to negative reviews.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nDespite online reviews receiving increased attention in academic research, Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimension-specific reviews have not been studied until now. This study contributes to the service quality-related literature by providing evidence that not all negative online reviews related to different Service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions equally affect brand equity.\n', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 121, 'citationCount': 10, 'authors': [{'authorId': '121564865', 'name': 'Fayez Ahmad'}, {'authorId': '123479765', 'name': 'Francisco Guzmán'}]}, {'paperId': '04a94fdf47e03af701ae027c50bf7e466c80a4ee', 'title': 'Reinterpreting the theory of planned behavior and its application to green hotel consumption intention', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 46, 'authors': [{'authorId': '116407189', 'name': 'S.

Because there is no detailed research into this issue with regard to consumers in Central and East European countries, the authors conducted research aimed at learning about the tipping behaviour of the Poles.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study was carried out in 2018, using the computer-assisted web interviewing method, for a sample of 1,000 people. Six research questions were asked: How often the Poles give tips in eating establishments? What is an average size of a tip? What determinants influence the frequency and magnitude of tips? Who is likely to give a tip every one to two visits? Who is likely to tip more than the standard 10%? What influences the reasons why Polish consumers tend to tip?\n\n\nFindings\nThe findings show the strong relationships between both a consumers’ tipping frequency and magnitude and the frequency at which these consumers eat out. This study also implicates income and education as essential factors influencing tipping behaviour and the lack of gender effect on consumers’ decision to tip. It was also noticed that such reasons as the quality of service, a taste of the dishes and a belief that it is proper to tip have a significant impact on the frequency of giving the tips. A significant diversity of the reasons’ meaning for tipping among Polish consumers depending upon their age was also stated.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nIt would be interesting to compare the results of the current study with studies concerning consumer tipping behaviours in other Central and Eastern European countries historically and culturally similar to Poland to investigate whether the specifics of tipping behaviour noticed in Poland apply elsewhere.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study shows the specifics of Polish people’s tipping behaviour and partially fulfills the gap in the knowledge of this aspect of consumers’ from Central and Eastern Europe behaviour. The obtained results suggest that with the increasing incomes and the widespread use of food services, tipping is likely to become more common in Poland. Furthermore, the pragmatic reasons for tipping will become more important than social and psychological motivators.\n', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2071674745', 'name': 'I.

The effect of EI on improving business performance is widely acknowledged in business and management studies. However, there is limited research in the context of tourism and hospitality industries. The paper contributes to the literature through a qualitative study of the perceptions and experiences of middle-level managers. Data was collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted in tourism and hospitality organisations in the UK. The findings of the study reveal that EI can have a positive contribution to improving staff satisfaction, motivation and overall business productivity. They highlight the importance of building quality relationships among staff and the critical role middle management has in an organisation. Based on the finding from the qualitative inquiry, the authors propose a model conceptualising the role of managers’ EI in creating a competitive advantage for the organisation.

Predictor variables were tipping motivations and demographic characteristics (age, gender and income). Target variable was loyalty to the server.,The findings suggest that social norm, food quality and income influence customers’ loyalty toward the same server on future visits. Social norm turned out to be the strongest predictor. If consumers did not have high social norm on tipping, their loyalty toward a particular server was affected by the combination of determinants such as server quality, social norm, income and food quality.,Future research can identify or develop scales of tipping motivations with stronger reliabilities in the context of restaurants.

Given the significance of the perception of the provision of service to the consumer, it is important to study every aspect of the interaction.

This research used three independent variables (emotional labor, service quality and purpose of consumption), each with two levels in a between-subjects 2 × 2 × 2 factorial experimental design. Eight scenarios were used to represent the eight different combinations of variables to test their effects.\n\n\nFindings\nTwo very interesting findings emerged from this study. The first was that consumers’ purpose of consumption, whether dining for leisure or business, had no significant impact on their satisfaction or loyalty, either independently or in conjunction with emotional labor or service quality. The second most interesting finding was that the interaction of service quality and emotional labor did have a significant impact on satisfaction but not loyalty.\n\n\nPractical implications\nA restaurants’ standards of service should be the same, regardless of the business or leisure demographic being served. Authenticity matters, and therefore, employers should incorporate personality evaluation into the hiring process. Perhaps, focusing more on attitude and less on skill would lead to great customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis article furthers the relatively young research stream examining the impacts of emotional labor on the consumer.\n', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 22, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39849125', 'name': 'Andrew Moreo'}, {'authorId': '50058716', 'name': 'R.

To better understand the depersonalisation process, this study applies Self-Categorisation Theory to a post-disaster tourism site. Using personal pronouns and specific identities as markers, we explore the cognitive processing of visitors’ experience by analysing online comments posted after visiting one of two disaster sites: the Beichuan earthquake relics and the Yingxiu earthquake relics in China. The analysis revealed that three levels of self-categorisation were evident in visitors’ experience of disaster sites; particularly depersonalisation was uncovered through (i) ‘human being’, ‘China and/or Chinese’ statements, (ii) ‘we’, ‘they’ and ‘you’ statements, and (iii) individualisation through ‘I’ statements. As the theory predicted, depersonalising statements tended to be other-focused and co-occurred with the awareness of group prototype, collective action, positive in-group attitude and cohesion, ethnocentrism, and shared norms.

This debate, termed ‘dilemma of authenticity’, centres around conflicting stances among tourism theorists, practitioners, marketers, and host communities with regards to how authenticity is perceived and how it influences tourists’ decision-making. This uncertainty has hindered agritourism entrepreneurs who remain unsure of how they may rely on authenticity to attract tourists. This paper examines perceptions of authenticity in working agricultural landscapes through two between-subject experiments to investigate how appealing the self-expressed authentic agricultural elements appear to potential tourists. One experiment was carried out in a controlled laboratory experiment employing Immersive Virtual Environment technology, and the second via a web-based survey using two-dimensional photos.

Yet despite the obvious importance of customer loyalty to all businesses, and in particular to services, there is still much to be learnt. The purpose of this study is to analyse the impact of service quality, satisfaction and trust on customer loyalty to the service provider by means of structural equation modelling. The results of the empirical research on travel agencies reveal how loyalty depends on the customer's degree of satisfaction and trust. In turn, satisfaction is influenced by service quality. Most previous studies have focused on quality and satisfaction but in this study, we extend the list of factors which predict loyalty by emphasising the importance of trust.

My focus is on the vital issue of combining methods or methodologies. There has been mixed views on the uses of triangulation in researches. Some authors argue that triangulation is just for increasing the wider and deep understanding of the study phenomenon, while others have argued that triangulation is actually used to increase the study accuracy, in this case triangulation is one of the validity measures. Triangulation is defined as the use of multiple methods mainly qualitative and quantitative methods in studying the same phenomenon for the purpose of increasing study credibility. This implies that triangulation is the combination of two or more methodological approaches, theoretical perspectives, data sources, investigators and analysis methods to study the same phenomenon.However, using both qualitative and quantitative paradigms in the same study has resulted into debate from some researchers arguing that the two paradigms differ epistemologically and ontologically. Nevertheless, both paradigms are designed towards understanding about a particular subject area of interest and both of them have strengths and weaknesses. Thus, when combined there is a great possibility of neutralizing the flaws of one method and strengthening the benefits of the other for the better research results. Thus, to reap the benefits of two paradigms and minimizing the drawbacks of each, the combination of the two approaches have been advocated in this article.

I address these issues using two data sources: a field survey and laboratory experiments. Customers were surveyed individually as they left a set of restaurants in Richmond, Virginia. The laboratory experiments vary service quality, table size, and information about others' tips in a controlled setting. Results from both data sets show support for reciprocity and letdown aversion, and that tip size decreases with table size.

To test the study hypotheses, 223 consumers participated in a simulated service encounter in which actors played the roles of service employees. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, the employees varied both the extent of their smiling behavior and their emotional labor display by engaging in surface or deep acting.

A convenient, although not comprehensive, presentation of required sample sizes is provided here. Effect-size indexes and conventional values for these are given for operationally defined small, medium, and large effects. The sample sizes necessary for .80 power to detect effects at these levels are tabled for eight standard statistical tests: (a) the difference between independent means, (b) the significance of a product-moment correlation, (c) the difference between independent rs, (d) the sign test, (e) the difference between independent proportions, (f) chi-square tests for goodness of fit and contingency tables, (g) one-way analysis of variance, and (h) the significance o f a multiple or multiple partial correlation. The preface to the first edition of my power handbook (Cohen, 1969) begins: During my first dozen years o f teaching and consulting o n applied statistics with behavioral scientists, 1 became increasingly impressed with the importance of statistical power analysis, an importance which was increased an order of magnitude by its neglect in our textbooks and curricula. The case for its importance is easily made: What behavioral scientist would view with equanimity the question of the probability that his investigation would lead to statistically significant results, i.e., its power? (p. vii) This neglect was obvious through casual observation and had been confirmed by a power review of the 1960 volume of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, which found the mean power to detect medium effect sizes to be .48 (Cohen, 1962). Thus, the chance of obtaining a significant result was about that of tossing a head with a fair coin. I attributed this disregard of power to the inaccessibility of a meager and mathematically difficult literature, beginning with its origin in the work of Neyman and Pearson (1928,1933). The power handbook was supposed to solve the problem. It required no more background than an introductory psychological statistics course that included significance testing. The exposition was verbal-intuitive and carried largely by many worked examples drawn from across the spectrum of behavioral science. In the ensuing two decades, the book has been through revised (1977) and second (1988) editions and has inspired dozens of power and effect-size surveys i n many areas of the social and life sciences (Cohen, 1988, pp. xi-xii).

While existing research has typically explored the effects of active interactions among consumers, this study aims to better understand the effects of passive interactions. Accordingly, this research conceptualizes the hotel social servicescape as a function of the mere presence of the other social actors that occupy the hotel’s shared consumption space.Design/methodology/approachTo operationalize this construct, data were collected from a sample of 1,019 recent consumers of full-service hotel experience in the USA.FindingsThe findings suggest that the social servicescape can significantly affect satisfaction and behavioral intentions in the domain of leisure-driven hotel experiences.Research limitations/implicationsThe results support the hypothesis that the mere presence of others significantly affects leisure travelers’ perceptions of the hotel consumption experience. Accordingly, these findings indicate that the makeup of the hotel servicescape is not limited to the traditionally acknowledged physical elements of the space.Practical implicationsThe results suggest that in addition to managing the physical aspects of the service environment, hotel managers should take steps to manage the social aspects of the servicescape as well.Originality/valueThis paper is the first to provide an operational account of the social servicescape in the domain of full-service hotels. Additionally, nomological validity is established by examining the downstream effects on satisfaction and behavioral intentions.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 44, 'authors': [{'authorId': '118409185', 'name': 'Nathaniel D.

Using the Osun Osogbo Sacred Grove (a UNESCO World Heritage Site in southwestern Nigeria) as a study site, this research examines the role visitors’ attachment to the place plays in explaining their perceived solidarity with area residents. From confirmatory factor analysis, a measurement model was established, which revealed strong psychometric properties for the two place attachment factors (i.e., place identity and place dependence) and the three emotional solidarity factors (i.e., feeling welcomed, emotional closeness, and sympathetic understanding). Structural equation modeling demonstrated that each of the place attachment factors explained a high degree of variance (e.g., R2 ranging between 45% and 54%) in visitors’ emotional solidarity with residents.

While the traditional view of a destination has largely focused geographical features and the systemic concept of tourism destinations has focused on the interaction between tourists, the staff in industries providing tourism services, and the local population, more recent conceptualizations of tourism destinations treat destinations as complex adaptive systems that adapt to ever-changing economic, political, and social trends. As well, recent work on integrative conceptual frameworks of tourism destinations highlights the importance of particular geographical elements in the emergence and development of destinations which affect the structure of the mode of production, the range of stakeholders involved in tourism activity, and the entire process of destinations evolution. Although the traditional – geographic concept of destination, from today's point of view, is one-sided and not comprehensive, geographical elements, however, are the nucleus from which a tourism destination occurs and develops. In this regard, it is indisputable that the geographical attributes of tourism destinations represent the key component of their resource base.

This paper introduces affective process theory (APT), which unifies these mechanisms and identifies others. Using a rule-governed theoretical process, APT reveals 10 distinct mechanisms that connect people’s affective states, which fall into three types. Convergent linkage occurs when individuals share the same vantage point and interpretations of emotionally evocative stimuli. Divergent linkage occurs with a shared vantage point but different interpretations. Complementary linkage occurs when the other person is itself the stimulus.

As we watch and listen to what is happening on screen, we immediately begin to experience feelings that mirror those of the characters. During the beginning of the Omaha Beach sequence, we see different groups of soldiers riding in amphibious landing crafts. The camera shows us several characters but does not focus on any one soldier in particular. There are no cutaway shots showing us what the characters see, and there is almost no dialogue to tell us about the characters’ identities, relationships, thoughts, or feelings. In spite of our lack of information, we have an immediate emotional response to what we perceive. While the soldiers are still in the boats, we are presented with eight close-ups in a row of different soldiers’ faces. Some of the characters express fear, some anticipation, some anxiety, and others depressed resignation. While watching them, most spectators end up experiencing the same sorts of feelings that the characters are experiencing. This kind of mimicry is a result of emotional contagion, an automatic and involuntary affective process that can occur when we observe others experiencing emotions. In this paper, I examine the role of emotional contagion in our affective engagement with narrative fiction film, focusing in particular on how spectator responses based on emotional contagion differ from those based on more sophisticated emotional processes. Cognitive film theory has produced a rich literature on spectators’ emotional responses to narrative fiction films, but almost all of it has focused on sophisticated emotional processes involving the imagination or cognitive evaluations. More primitive emotional processes and reactions, like emotional contagion, have received far less attention. Emotional contagion is a significant feature of spectators’ emotional engagement for at least two reasons. First, because emotional contagion requires direct sensory engagement and involves automatic processes, it is unique to our experience of audiovisual narratives and thus represents one way in which our emotional engagement with film narratives differs from our emotional engagement with literary narratives. Second, because emotional contagion responses do not involve beliefs or the imagination but are based on automatic and involuntary processes, spectators’ experiences of emotional contagion will be virtually identical to real world experiences of emotional contagion. I begin by briefly explaining emotional contagion and the processes involved in it. Next, I consider how film elicits emotional contagion. I then argue that spectator responses based on emotional contagion are unique and should be clearly distinguished from responses based on Catching Characters’ Emotions: Emotional Contagion Responses to Narrative Fiction Film', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 84, 'authors': [{'authorId': '114413702', 'name': 'Amy Coplan'}]}, {'paperId': '58fdc8995ad14f6d396efb6db971bb4356803395', 'title': 'Family Holidays.

Family holidays are not always all harmony and may generate stress and conflicts at times. But families also experience good moments. Some family holidays – or at least some situations in family holidays – are perceived as successful and just the way they were supposed to be.

This article is about the special context of family holidays and the successful moments in the family holiday from the perspective of parents and children, based on an empirical analysis of 26 extensive interviews with German and Danish families and a literature review on family holidays.

First, we provide a review of the extant literature drawing on four major streams of research from (1) previous marketing (servicescapes); (2) environmental psychology (approach–avoidance theory, behavior setting theory); (3) social psychology (social facilitation theory); and (4) organizational behavior (affective events theory).

Specifically, the emotional contagion hypothesis explains how the emotions of two people (e.g., salesperson and customer) during a conversation are transmitted from one to the other via facial cues, and that these emotions affect the outcome of that interaction. The emotional contagion hypothesis implies that there are definitive individual differences concerning whether someone is either sensitive to emotions from others or able to transmit his or her emotions onto others. This study explores whether these individual differences are assets or liabilities over the long term for salespersons in a sales organization. The data in this study show that a salesperson's ability to infect others with his or her emotions is an asset (because it can lead to higher performance). In addition, being sensitive to the emotions of others is an asset (it can also lead to better performance); at the same time it is a liability (because of the higher risk of burnout).

 This paper describes a social robotic game player that is able to successfully play a team card game called Sueca. The question we will address in this paper is: how can we build a social robot player that is able to balance its ability to play the card game with natural and social behaviours towards its partner and its opponents. The first challenge we faced concerned the development of a competent artificial player for a hidden information game, whose time constraint is the average human decision time. To accomplish this requirement, the Perfect Information Monte Carlo (PIMC) algorithm was used. Further, we have performed an analysis of this algorithm's possible parametrizations for games trees that cannot be fully explored in a reasonable amount of time with a MinMax search. Additionally, given the nature of the Sueca game, such robotic player must master the social interactions both as a partner and as an opponent. To do that, an emotional agent framework (FAtiMA) was used to build the emotional and social behaviours of the robot. At each moment, the robot not only plays competitively but also appraises the situation and responds emotionally in a natural manner. To test the approach, we conducted a user study and compared the levels of trust participants attributed to the robots and to human partners. Results have shown that the robot team exhibited a winning rate of 60%. Concerning the social aspects, the results also showed that human players increased their trust in the robot as their game partners (similar to the way to the trust levels change towards human partners).

However, there are still many open issues regarding the social capabilities that those robots should have in order to make daily interactions with humans more natural. For example, the role of affective interactions is still unclear. This paper presents an ethnographic study conducted in an elementary school where 40 children interacted with a social robot capable of recognising and responding empathically to some of the children's affective states. The findings suggest that the robot's empathic behaviour affected positively how children perceived the robot. However, the empathic behaviours should be selected carefully, under the risk of having the opposite effect. The target application scenario and the particular preferences of children seem to influence the “degree of empathy” that social robots should be endowed with."", 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 30, 'citationCount': 118, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39799707', 'name': 'Iolanda Leite'}, {'authorId': '39540970', 'name': 'Ginevra Castellano'}, {'authorId': '11845717', 'name': 'André Pereira'}, {'authorId': '145813496', 'name': 'C.

Background: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes. Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r̄ = +0.26, with an experimental effect size of d̄ = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role. Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors. Application: The findings provide quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors influencing HRI trust. Specifically, the current summary provides effect size estimates that are useful in establishing design and training guidelines with reference to robot-related factors of HRI trust. Furthermore, results indicate that improper trust calibration may be mitigated by the manipulation of robot design.

Although PIMC search has been criticized in the past for its theoretical deficiencies, in practice it has often produced strong results in a variety of domains. In this paper, we set out to resolve this discrepancy. The contributions of the paper are twofold. First, we use synthetic game trees to identify game properties that result in strong or weak performance for PIMC search as compared to an optimal player. Second, we show how these properties can be detected in real games, and demonstrate that they do indeed appear to be good predictors of the strength of PIMC search. Thus, using the tools established in this paper, it should be possible to decide a priori whether PIMC search will be an effective approach to new and unexplored games.\n \n', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 86, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47824021', 'name': 'J.

Emotional contagion can be a very effective and attractive strategy in communication and advertising, and understanding the mechanisms underlying emotional contagion can help marketers to improve their commercial approaches or develop better ones. The purpose of this study is to review and classify the various methodologies and theoretical approaches on emotional contagion, identify the best practices in this domain, and identify ways of gaging and measuring emotional contagion. The study is based on a mini literature review. We identify different mechanisms and approaches to emotional contagion described in the literature. Emotional contagion can be triggered by facial expressions, indirect human interactions, and/or by observing other people's behavior in direct and indirect interactions. Furthermore, emotional contagion can be triggered physiologically or neurologically by synchronizing with the emotional state of others during human interactions. Regarding the assessment and measurement of emotional contagion, we argue that methods based on neuroscience tools are much more accurate and effective than methods based on traditional research approaches. The study identifies guidelines for research on commercial communication through emotional contagion that can be especially interesting for academia and marketing practitioners. The findings are important for field marketers interested in developing new individualized approaches in their commercial strategies and marketing in general. In addition, the study can become the basis of research that further refines and compares the efficacy of the various techniques and tools involved.",2021,110,34,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology',

Drawing on this specific property, the theory of social learning, and the most direct implications of emotional contagion, our pilot experiment (N = 49) aimed to test whether the exposure to others’ grateful interactions on Facebook enhances (a) users’ felt gratitude, (b) expressed gratitude, and (c) their subjective well-being. For the threefold purpose, we created ad hoc Facebook groups in which the exposure to some accomplices’ exchange of grateful messages for 2 weeks was experimentally manipulated and users’ felt/expressed gratitude and well-being were consequently assessed. Results partially supported both hypotheses. Observing others’ exchange of grateful posts/comments on Facebook appeared to enhance participants’ in-person expression of gratitude (i.e., self-reported gratitude expression within face-to-face interactions), but not their direct and subjective experiences of gratitude. Similarly, exposure to others’ grateful messages improved some components of subjective well-being, such as satisfaction with life, but not negative and positive affect. Taken together, however, our preliminary findings suggest for the first time that social networking sites may actually amplify the spreading of gratitude and its benefits.

However, recent research empirically proves that hedonic products are more affect-rich only for some consumer segments or for specific consumption contexts. We argue that such inconsistency may derive from the nature of the emotions assessed that is strictly dependent on their empirical measurement and not from the mere existence of emotions themselves. Self-reported methods of evaluating consumer experience, on which prior studies are grounded, only assess conscious emotions the consumer can recognize and report, but not unconscious feelings, happening without individual awareness. The present work takes this challenge by conducting a laboratory experiment in which subjects are exposed to both a utilitarian product and a hedonic product. Physiological measures have been adopted to investigate unconscious emotional responses and self-reported measures to assess conscious emotions toward the products. Specifically, physiological data regarding the subjects’ cardiac activity, respiratory activity, electrodermal activity, and cerebral activity have been collected and complemented with a survey. Results confirm that both functional and hedonic products generate emotional responses in consumers. Further, findings show that when a consumer is exposed to a functional product, the physiological emotional responses are disassociated from the self-reported ones. A diverse pattern is depicted for hedonic products. We suggest an alternative explanation for the apparent lack of affect-rich experiences elicited by functional products and the need to reconsider emotional responses for these products.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 107, 'citationCount': 16, 'authors': [{'authorId': '27031448', 'name': 'Debora Bettiga'}, {'authorId': '145691035', 'name': 'A.

Previous neuroscience studies suggest that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) participates in social conformity, especially when it comes to the value integration process, but the specific mechanism of vmPFC is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify a direct link between the vmPFC and conformity tendencies by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Conformity tendencies are measured by the probability that participants change their decisions when they observe the majority responses. In our experiment, subjects could make two decisions in each trial, once without social information and once with social information, which allowed us to directly observe the conformity tendency of subjects in different conditions. We found that cathodal stimulation of the vmPFC significantly increased conformity tendency and decreased response time when the initial decision of participants differs from the majority opinion. Based on the experimental results, our study suggests that the vmPFC mainly inhibits and regulates the informational conformity behavior.

In Homo sapiens and some non-human primates contagious yawning is higher between strongly than weakly bonded individuals. Up to date, it is still unclear whether this social asymmetry underlies emotional contagion (a basic form of empathy preferentially involving familiar individuals) as predicted by the Emotional Bias Hypothesis (EBH) or is linked to a top-down, selective visual attention bias (with selective attention being preferentially directed toward familiar faces) as predicted by the Attentional Bias Hypothesis (ABH). To verify whether the visual attentional bias explained the yawn contagion bias or not, in this study, we considered only yawns that could be heard but not seen by potential responders (auditory yawns). Around 294 of auditory yawning occurrences were extrapolated from over 2000 yawning bouts collected in free ranging humans for over nine years. Via GLMM, we tested the effect of intrinsic features (i.e., gender and age) and social bond (from strangers to family members) on yawn. The individual identity of the subjects (trigger and potential responder) was included as random factor. The social bond significantly predicted the occurrence of auditory yawn contagion, which was highest between friends and family members. A gender bias was also observed, with women responding most frequently to others’ yawns and men being responded to most frequently by others. These results confirm that social bond is per se one of the main drivers of the differences in yawn contagion rates between individuals in support of the EBH of yawn contagion.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 74, 'citationCount': 24, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3334949', 'name': 'I.

A Three-Dimensional Model', 'abstract': 'Affective states can propagate in a group of people and influence their ability to judge others’ affective states. In the present paper, we present a simple mathematical model to describe this process in a three-dimensional affective space. We obtained data from 67 participants randomly assigned to two experimental groups. Participants watched either an upsetting or uplifting video previously calibrated for this goal. Immediately, participants reported their baseline subjective affect in three dimensions: (1) positivity, (2) negativity, and (3) arousal. In a second phase, participants rated the affect they subjectively judged from 10 target angry faces and ten target happy faces in the same three-dimensional scales. These judgments were used as an index of participant’s affective state after observing the faces. Participants’ affective responses were subsequently mapped onto a simple three-dimensional model of emotional contagion, in which the shortest distance between the baseline self-reported affect and the target judgment was calculated. The results display a double dissociation: negatively induced participants show more emotional contagion to angry than happy faces, while positively induced participants show more emotional contagion to happy than angry faces. In sum, emotional contagion exerted by the videos selectively affected judgments of the affective state of others’ faces. We discuss the directionality of emotional contagion to faces, considering whether negative emotions are more easily propagated than positive ones. Additionally, we comment on the lack of significant correlations between our model and standardized tests of empathy and emotional contagion.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2068036977', 'name': 'Andres Pinilla'}, {'authorId': '5668725', 'name': 'Ricardo M.

Many studies are striving to find the localization of basic emotions in the brain but failed. Thus, many psychologists suspect the specific neural loci for basic emotions, but instead, some proposed that there are specific neural structures for the core affects, such as arousal and hedonic value. The reason for this widespread difference might be that basic emotions used previously can be further divided into more “basic” emotions. Here we review brain imaging data and neuropsychological data, and try to address this question with an integrative model. In this model, we argue that basic emotions are not contrary to the dimensional studies of emotions (core affects). We propose that basic emotion should locate on the axis in the dimensions of emotion, and only represent one typical core affect (arousal or valence). Therefore, we propose four basic emotions: joy-on positive axis of hedonic dimension, sadness-on negative axis of hedonic dimension, fear, and anger-on the top of vertical dimensions.

Structural equation modeling was used to examine the universality and cultural specificity in the relations among emotional contagion, emotion regulation, and mood state. The results revealed that emotion regulation mediated the relation between emotional contagion and mood state: positive emotional contagion increased positive mood state and decreased negative mood state by the mediated role of reappraisal, negative emotional contagion decreased positive contagion and increased negative mood state by the inconsistent mediated role of reappraisal; negative contagion increased negative mood state by the mediated role of suppression. We found both universality and cultural specificity in the relations among emotional contagion, emotion regulation, and mood state. Regarding cultural specificity, among Dai and Jingpo participants, negative contagion positively predicted reappraisal, while for Han participants, it did not; Jingpo participants demonstrated a weaker negative relation between reappraisal and negative mood state, and a stronger positive relation between negative contagion and suppression; and Dai participants were the only ethnic group that showed a negative connection between negative contagion and positive mood state. Regarding emotion universality, the three ethnic groups all showed positive relations between negative contagion and negative mood, and between suppression and negative mood; additionally, positive contagion positively predicted positive mood state, mediated by reappraisal.

To date, minimal research has been conducted on the causes of collective team collapse. Thus, goals of this study were to explore perceived causes of collective team collapse in different sports and to define team collapse in contrast to negative momentum. To investigate factors causing and maintaining collective sport team collapse, an inductive, exploratory qualitative analysis of individual interviews was conducted. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 10 athletes of professional German teams of various sports playing in between first and fourth division. Participants were interviewed about a team collapse event they had experienced with their team during the past year. Data were collected and analyzed using a grounded theory methodology. Collective team collapse appeared to be induced by a temporal cascade of causes rather than by single triggers. This cascade included antecedents, which represent factors that make the occurrence of a team collapse more likely; critical events, which include specific events within the game that trigger a team collapse; as well as affective, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes that foster a maintenance of the collapse. Within this theoretical framework, social factors, such as decreased performance contagion or emotional contagion, played crucial roles in causing a team collapse. These results illustrate that collective team collapse is more than the sum of individual choking of multiple players at the same time. In conclusion, a new definition, differentiating team collapse from negative momentum, is introduced. Furthermore, a process model of causes of collective team collapse is proposed. The results provide first insights into causes of collective collapse in a variety of team sports. The developed model is supposed to help future research to better connect to practice and to support athletes, coaches, and sport psychologists.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 58, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2094785077', 'name': 'V.

Interestingly, increased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (an area related to value encoding) predicted more positive attitudes toward congruent commercials.

A synthesis of the extant literature suggests that inspecting other individuals’ positive news on Facebook brings about contentment through emotional contagion, whereas negative news causes discomfort as a consequence of mood contagion, the transmissible effect being more powerful when the news is associated with a strong tie. The outcomes of this research back the argument that self-confidence and dispositional envy are instrumental in producing Facebook envy. These findings highlight that the emotional results of browsing Facebook are considerably affected by the substance of the comment, the personal attributes of the Facebook user, and link between the reader and the poster. As limitations in the current review, more hypotheses need to be tested and future directions for subsequent multilevel research on the behavioral and cognitive outcomes of Facebook should illuminate why when individuals achieve belongingness demands on Facebook, they feel in a superior way about themselves and their reputation in social circles.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 28, 'citationCount': 39, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34568875', 'name': 'Aurel Pera'}]}, {'paperId': '34d2a5ae87f6565881724cbe9c54e31f45ff3ed7', 'title': 'Matching Your Face or Appraising the Situation: Two Paths to Emotional Contagion', 'abstract': 'Emotions are believed to converge both through emotional mimicry and social appraisal.

With respect to emotion, interpreted as a discrete affective process, mood is more controllable, more nebulous, and more related to mind/cognition; in addition, causes are less well-defined than those eliciting emotion. Therefore, firstly, the rational for the distinction between emotion and mood was provided. Then, the main frontal EEG asymmetry models were presented, such as the motivational approach/withdrawal, valence/arousal, capability, and inhibition asymmetric models. Afterward, the frontal EEG asymmetry of mood was investigated following three research lines, that is considering studies involving different mood induction procedures, dispositional mood (positive and negative affect), and mood alterations in both healthy and clinical populations. In general, results were found to be contradictory, no model is unequivocally supported regardless the research line considered. Different methodological issues were raised, such as: the composition of samples used across studies, in particular, gender and age were found to be critical variables that should be better addressed in future studies; the importance of third variables that might mediate the relationship between frontal EEG asymmetries and mood, for example bodily states and hormonal responses; the role of cognition, namely the interplay between mood and executive functions. In light of these issues, future research directions were proposed.

Recently, neuroimaging evidence, especially related to the advent of neuroimaging meta-analytic methods, has revitalized this debate in the endeavor of systems and human neuroscience. The core theme focuses on the existence of unique neural bases that are specific and characteristic for each instance of basic emotion. Here we review this evidence, outlining contradictory findings, strengths and limits of different approaches. Constructionism dismisses the existence of dedicated neural structures for basic emotions, considering that the assumption of a one-to-one relationship between neural structures and their functions is central to basic emotion theories. While these critiques are useful to pinpoint current limitations of basic emotions theories, we argue that they do not always appear equally generative in fostering new testable accounts on how the brain relates to affective functions. We then consider evidence beyond PET and fMRI, including results concerning the relation between basic emotions and awareness and data from neuropsychology on patients with focal brain damage. Evidence from lesion studies are indeed particularly informative, as they are able to bring correlational evidence typical of neuroimaging studies to causation, thereby characterizing which brain structures are necessary for, rather than simply related to, basic emotion processing. These other studies shed light on attributes often ascribed to basic emotions, such as automaticity of perception, quick onset, and brief duration. Overall, we consider that evidence in favor of the neurobiological underpinnings of basic emotions outweighs dismissive approaches. In fact, the concept of basic emotions can still be fruitful, if updated to current neurobiological knowledge that overcomes traditional one-to-one localization of functions in the brain. In particular, we propose that the structure-function relationship between brain and emotions is better described in terms of pluripotentiality, which refers to the fact that one neural structure can fulfill multiple functions, depending on the functional network and pattern of co-activations displayed at any given moment.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 182, 'citationCount': 102, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4248404', 'name': 'A.

Crowdfunding represents a significant and growing platform for funding new and unique projects, causes, and products. To test whether neural activity could forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes weeks later, 30 human subjects (14 female) decided whether to fund proposed projects described on an Internet crowdfunding website while undergoing scanning with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although activity in both the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex predicted individual choices to fund on a trial-to-trial basis in the neuroimaging sample, only NAcc activity generalized to forecast market funding outcomes weeks later on the Internet. Behavioral measures from the neuroimaging sample, however, did not forecast market funding outcomes. This pattern of associations was replicated in a second study. These findings demonstrate that a subset of the neural predictors of individual choice can generalize to forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes—even better than choice itself. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Forecasting aggregate behavior with individual neural data has proven elusive; even when successful, neural forecasts have not historically supplanted behavioral forecasts. In the current research, we find that neural responses can forecast market-level choice and outperform behavioral measures in a novel Internet crowdfunding context. Targeted as well as model-free analyses convergently indicated that nucleus accumbens activity can support aggregate forecasts.

However, we lack an integrative framework for understanding how different emotion-related functions are organized across the entire expanse of the PFC, as prior reviews have generally focused on specific emotional processes (e.g., decision making) or specific anatomical regions (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex). Additionally, psychological theories and neuroscientific investigations have proceeded largely independently because of the lack of a common framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, lesion, and structural connectivity studies on the emotion-related functions of 8 subregions spanning the entire PFC. We introduce the appraisal-by-content model, which provides a new framework for integrating the diverse range of empirical findings. Within this framework, appraisal serves as a unifying principle for understanding the PFC’s role in emotion, while relative content-specialization serves as a differentiating principle for understanding the role of each subregion. A synthesis of data from affective, social, and cognitive neuroscience studies suggests that different PFC subregions are preferentially involved in assigning value to specific types of inputs: exteroceptive sensations, episodic memories and imagined future events, viscero-sensory signals, viscero-motor signals, actions, others’ mental states (e.g., intentions), self-related information, and ongoing emotions. We discuss the implications of this integrative framework for understanding emotion regulation, value-based decision making, emotional salience, and refining theoretical models of emotion. This framework provides a unified understanding of how emotional processes are organized across PFC subregions and generates new hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying adaptive and maladaptive emotional functioning.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 501, 'citationCount': 365, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4296355', 'name': 'Matthew L.

They provide interlocutors with resources to express and interpret verbal messages, which may affect their cognitive and emotional processing. Contrarily, computer-mediated communication (CMC), particularly text-based communication, is limited to the use of symbols to convey a message, where facial expressions cannot be transmitted naturally. In this scenario, people use emoticons as paralinguistic cues to convey emotional meaning. Research has shown that emoticons contribute to a greater social presence as a result of the enrichment of text-based communication channels. Additionally, emoticons constitute a valuable resource for language comprehension by providing expressivity to text messages. The latter findings have been supported by studies in neuroscience showing that particular brain regions involved in emotional processing are also activated when people are exposed to emoticons. To reach an integrated understanding of the influence of emoticons in human communication on both socio-cognitive and neural levels, we review the literature on emoticons in three different areas. First, we present relevant literature on emoticons in CMC. Second, we study the influence of emoticons in language comprehension. Finally, we show the incipient research in neuroscience on this topic.

One hundred and two participants were drawn from a representative sample to minimize self-selection bias. The results suggest that the emotional responses induced by unfamiliar sad music could be characterized in terms of three underlying factors: Relaxing sadness, Moving sadness, and Nervous sadness. Relaxing sadness was characterized by felt and perceived peacefulness and positive valence. Moving sadness captured an intense experience that involved feelings of sadness and being moved. Nervous sadness was associated with felt anxiety, perceived scariness and negative valence. These interpretations were supported by indirect measures of felt emotion. Experiences of Moving sadness were strongly associated with high trait empathy and emotional contagion, but not with other previously suggested traits such as absorption or nostalgia-proneness.

The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based micro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the emotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social network. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they require massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the individuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional contagion using a random sample of Twitter users, whose activity (and the stimuli they were exposed to) was observed during a week of September 2014. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50% more positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and that of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive emotions.

When people unconsciously mimic their interaction partner’s expressions of emotion, they come to feel reflections of those companions’ emotions, which in turn influence the observer’s own emotional and empathic behavior. The majority of research has focused on facial actions as expressions of emotion. However, the fact that emotions are not just expressed by facial muscles alone is often still ignored in emotion perception research. In this article, I therefore argue for a broader exploration of emotion signals from sources beyond the face muscles that are more automatic and difficult to control. Specifically, I will focus on the perception of implicit sources such as gaze and tears and autonomic responses such as pupil-dilation, eyeblinks and blushing that are subtle yet visible to observers and because they can hardly be controlled or regulated by the sender, provide important “veridical” information. Recently, more research is emerging about the mimicry of these subtle affective signals including pupil-mimicry.

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others.

In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed.

Despite its importance, adults show remarkable individual variation in this ability. Revealing the factors responsible for these huge individual differences is a key challenge in this domain. Here we investigated, on a large sample of participants, whether individual differences in smile authenticity recognition are accounted for by differences in the predisposition to experience other people's emotions, i.e., by susceptibility to emotional contagion.

Consistent evidence shows that sharing the emotions of others is associated with activation in neural structures that are also active during the first‐hand experience of that emotion. Part of the neural activation shared between self‐ and other‐related experiences seems to be rather automatically activated. However, recent studies also show that empathy is a highly flexible phenomenon, and that vicarious responses are malleable with respect to a number of factors—such as contextual appraisal, the interpersonal relationship between empathizer and other, or the perspective adopted during observation of the other. Future investigations are needed to provide more detailed insights into these factors and their neural underpinnings.

The theories that have been developed in recent decades have focused on the social structures created by repeated exchanges and the ways in which these structures both constrain and enable actors to exercise power and influence. Other related social processes addressed within the exchange tradition include interpersonal commitment, trust, fairness, procedural and distributive justice, coalition formation and collective action. Recent work also focuses on emotions and their role in social exchange. The methodological challenges of studying social exchange in the laboratory and in the world outside the lab are addressed as well as links between exchange theory and topics under study by economic sociologists and network scholars more broadly, including Internet-mediated exchanges and their growing significance.', 'year': 1989, 'referenceCount': 215, 'citationCount': 2351, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3634969', 'name': 'K.

Since we are aware of a variety of feeling and emotion states, it should follow from James\' proposition that the various emotions will be accompanied by a variety of differentiable bodily states.

The scores used were the maximum rise and maximum fall from the preceding resting level and the number of responses of a critical value per unit time. Of the 14 scores thus obtained, 7 showed significant discrimination between anger and fear. Diastolic blood pressure rises, heart rate falls, number of rises in skin conductance, and muscle potential increases, were greater for anger than for fear, whereas skin conductance increases, number of muscle potential increases, and respiration rate increases were greater for fear than for anger. Profile difference scores, computed from appropriate combinations of these differences, were found to be greater than zero in 42 of the 43 cases and to have a mean which deviated very significantly from zero, which rejects the null hypothesis that there is no difference in physiological reaction between anger and fear. The patterns obtained for anger and fear argue against the Arnold proposal that anger is a strong reaction of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous systems, whereas fear is but a sympathetic reaction. Another finding was the very low correlations among the physiological reactions and the significantly higher intercorrelations for anger than for fear, which was interpreted as indicating greater physiological integration during anger. Between‐subject variance was significantly greater than within‐subject variance, which supports the findings of Lacey and Malmo that there is considerable specificity in physiological response patterns. The physiological response patterns of anger were suggested as being similar to those produced by injections of epinephrine and nor‐epinephrine combined, and those of fear as being similar to injections of epinephrine.', 'year': 1953, 'referenceCount': 11, 'citationCount': 909, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3719848', 'name': 'A.

From a biological perspective, this idea is manifested in the belief that there might be neurophysiological and anatomical substrates corresponding to the basic emotions. From a psychological perspective, basic emotions are often held to be the primitive building blocks of other, nonbasic emotions. The content of such claims is examined, and the results suggest that there is no coherent nontrivial notion of basic emotions as the elementary psychological primitives in terms of which other emotions can be explained. Thus, the view that there exist basic emotions out of which all other emotions are built, and in terms of which they can be explained, is questioned, raising the possibility that this position is an article of faith rather than an empirically or theoretically defensible basis for the conduct of emotion research.

This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities.

In the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. Methods Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core discussions were explored measuring tweets’ sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features were considered. Results We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. Conclusions Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust. There is the need to monitor and sustain healthy behaviors as well as community supports also via social media-based preventive interventions.",2021,28,33,"{'name': 'European Psychiatry', 'volume':

In particular, frustration, loneliness, and worries about the future are common reactions and represent well-known risk factors for several mental disorders, including anxiety, affective, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The vast majority of available studies have been conducted in China, where the pandemic started. Italy has been severely hit by the pandemic, and the socio-cultural context is completely different from Eastern countries. Therefore, there is the need for methodologically rigorous studies aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and quarantine measures on the mental health of the Italian population. In fact, our results will help us to develop appropriate interventions for managing the psychosocial consequences of pandemic. The “COVID-IT-mental health trial” is a no-profit, not-funded, national, multicentric, cross-sectional population-based trial which has the following aims: a) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures on mental health of the Italian population; b) to identify the main areas to be targeted by supportive long-term interventions for the different categories of people exposed to the pandemic. Data will be collected through a web-platform using validated assessment tools. Participants will be subdivided into four groups: a) Group 1—COVID-19 quarantine group. This group includes the general population which are quarantined but not isolated, i.e., those not directly exposed to contagion nor in contact with COVID-19+ individuals; b) Group 2—COVID-19+ group, which includes isolated people directly/indirectly exposed to the virus; c) Group 3—COVID-19 healthcare staff group, which includes first- and second-line healthcare professionals; d) Group 4—COVID-19 mental health, which includes users of mental health services and all those who had already been diagnosed with a mental disorder. Mental health services worldwide are not prepared yet to manage the short- and long-term consequences of the pandemic. It is necessary to have a clear picture of the impact that this new stressor will have on mental health and well-being in order to develop and disseminate appropriate interventions for the general population and for the other at-risk groups.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 100, 'citationCount': 184, 'authors': [{'authorId': '10694335', 'name': 'V.

CT-BERT is specifically designed to be used on COVID-19 content, particularly from social media, and can be utilized for various natural language processing tasks such as classification, question-answering, and chatbots. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of CT-BERT on different classification datasets and compare it with BERT-LARGE, its base model. Methods The study utilizes CT-BERT, which is pre-trained on a large corpus of COVID-19 related Twitter messages. The authors evaluated the performance of CT-BERT on five different classification datasets, including one in the target domain. The model's performance is compared to its base model, BERT-LARGE, to measure the marginal improvement. The authors also provide detailed information on the training process and the technical specifications of the model. Results The results indicate that CT-BERT outperforms BERT-LARGE with a marginal improvement of 10-30% on all five classification datasets. The largest improvements are observed in the target domain. The authors provide detailed performance metrics and discuss the significance of these results. Discussion The study demonstrates the potential of pre-trained transformer models, such as CT-BERT, for COVID-19 related natural language processing tasks. The results indicate that CT-BERT can improve the classification performance on COVID-19 related content, especially on social media. These findings have important implications for various applications, such as monitoring public sentiment and developing chatbots to provide COVID-19 related information. The study also highlights the importance of using domain-specific pre-trained models for specific natural language processing tasks. Overall, this work provides a valuable contribution to the development of COVID-19 related NLP models."", 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 15, 'citationCount': 231, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144053995', 'name': 'Martin Müller'}, {'authorId': '3046313', 'name': 'M.

the COVID-19 pandemic not only affects physical health, but also mental health and well-being [1,2]. The current pandemic is changing priorities for the general population, but it is also challenging the agenda of health professionals, including that of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals [3]. Everywhere in the world, psychiatric clinics are modifying their practice in order to guarantee care and support to persons with mental health problems, but also to those who are not mentally ill and are suffering from the psychosocial consequences of the pandemic. The number of those who will need psychiatric help is going to increase in the next weeks or months, requiring a reconsideration of our current practices. From a psychopathological viewpoint, the current pandemic is a relatively new form of stressor or trauma for mental health professionals [4]. It has been compared with natural disasters, such as earthquakes or tsunamis [5]. But in those cases, the emergencies are usually localized, limited to a specific area and to a given time; people know that they can escape, if they want to or if they have the possibility to do so [6]. It has also been compared with wars and international mass conflicts. But in those circumstances, the enemy is easily recognizable, while in pandemic the “ threat ” can be everywhere and it can be carried by the person next to us [7]. We consider that the mental health and psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may be particularly serious for at least four groups of people: (a) those who have been in contact the (b) those who are already to biological or psychosocial stressors people', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 8, 'citationCount': 891, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3380465', 'name': 'A.

By following a data-driven approach focusing on User-Generated Content, we aimed to detect potential binge drinkers through the investigation of their language and shared topics. First, we gathered Twitter threads quoting BD and alcohol-related behaviours, by considering unequivocal keywords, identified by experts, from previous evidence on BD. Subsequently, a random sample of the gathered tweets was manually labelled, and two supervised learning classifiers were trained on both linguistic and metadata features, to classify tweets of genuine unique users with respect to media, bot, and commercial accounts. Based on this classification, we observed that approximately 55% of the 1 million alcohol-related collected tweets was automatically identified as belonging to non-genuine users. A third classifier was then trained on a subset of manually labelled tweets among those previously identified as belonging to genuine accounts, to automatically identify potential binge drinkers based only on linguistic features. On average, users classified as binge drinkers were quite similar to the standard genuine Twitter users in our sample. Nonetheless, the analysis of social media contents of genuine users reporting risky behaviours remains a promising source for informed preventive programs.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 65, 'citationCount': 10, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3482113', 'name': 'C.

After defining emotion contagion, we suggest that one unique feature of digital emotion contagion is that it is mediated by digital media platforms that are motivated to upregulate user emotions.

The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based micro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the emotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social network. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they require massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the individuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional contagion using a random sample of Twitter users, whose activity (and the stimuli they were exposed to) was observed during a week of September 2014. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50% more positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and that of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive emotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much greater than that of negative emotions.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 65, 'citationCount': 340, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48898287', 'name': 'Emilio Ferrara'}, {'authorId': '121937545', 'name': 'Zeya Yang'}]}, {'paperId': 'bcdc102c04fb0e7d4652e8bcc7edd2983bb9576d', 'title': 'VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-Based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text', 'abstract': '\n \n The inherent nature of social media content poses serious challenges to practical applications of sentiment analysis. We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.\n \n', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 3316, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40320059', 'name': 'C.

In this paper, we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be used to generate a large, high‐quality, word–emotion and word–polarity association lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help to identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help to obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion‐annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher interannotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 122, 'citationCount': 1921, 'authors': [{'authorId': '143880621', 'name': 'Saif M.

Yet despite anecdotal reports suggesting that progress has been made, it is unclear whether these investments have left the nation better prepared to respond to a bioterrorist attack, pandemic influenza, or any other large-scale public health emergency. \n \nThis situation is not because of a shortage of measures of preparedness. Over the past 5 years, federal agencies, state health departments, and various nongovernmental organizations have proposed and implemented myriad measures of public health emergency preparedness. But these efforts have not resulted in a clear picture of the nation’s preparedness owing to ambiguous and uncertain preparedness goals, a lack of agreement about what the measures should aim at and how they should be interpreted, and a weak system of accountability for producing results.1 Measures often vary considerably across agencies and shift dramatically from year to year, leaving state and local health officials, businesses, nonprofits, and citizens confused and perplexed by a maze of overlapping and sometimes contradictory requirements, checklists, and ideas about what constitutes preparedness.2–4 \n \nWhat our nation needs in order to bring coherence to the debate is a clear definition of public health emergency preparedness and an articulation of the key elements that characterize a well-prepared community. In this editorial, we propose a candidate definition of public health emergency preparedness and describe its key elements. Both the definition and the elements were developed by a diverse panel of experts convened by RAND in February 2007. \n \nWe propose the following definition: public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is the capability of the public health and health care systems, communities, and individuals, to prevent, protect against, quickly respond to, and recover from health emergencies, particularly those whose scale, timing, or unpredictability threatens to overwhelm routine capabilities. Preparedness involves a coordinated and continuous process of planning and implementation that relies on measuring performance and taking corrective action. \n \nIn developing the definition, we considered what constitutes a public health emergency, what public health emergency preparedness requires, and who is involved in it.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 20, 'citationCount': 282, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46384109', 'name': 'Christopher D.

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 63, 'citationCount': 59519, 'authors': [{'authorId': '39172707', 'name': 'Jacob Devlin'}, {'authorId': '1744179', 'name': 'Ming-Wei Chang'}, {'authorId': '2544107', 'name': 'Kenton Lee'}, {'authorId': '3259253', 'name': 'Kristina Toutanova'}]}, {'paperId': '2e2e6076151633c7d7de42eb6cdfa8b63fc93f97', 'title': 'Sentiment Analysis Using Lexicon and Machine Learning-Based Approaches: A Survey', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 24, 'authors': [{'authorId': '36245597', 'name': 'Binita Verma'}, {'authorId': '2268179', 'name': 'R.

SFUs are an auditory interaction means for machines that allow emotion and intent expression, which are composed of vocalizations and sounds without semantic content or language dependence. Currently, SFUs are most commonly utilized in animation movies (e.g., R2-D2, WALL-E, Despicable Me), cartoons (e.g., “Teletubbies,” “Morph,” “La Linea”), and computer games (e.g., The Sims) and hold significant potential for applications in HRI.

With an implicit assumption that social and adaptive behaviour is desirable, it is therefore of interest to determine precisely how these aspects of behaviour may be exploited in robots to support children in their learning. In this paper, we explore this issue by evaluating the effect of a social robot tutoring strategy with children learning about prime numbers. It is shown that the tutoring strategy itself leads to improvement, but that the presence of a robot employing this strategy amplifies this effect, resulting in significant learning. However, it was also found that children interacting with a robot using social and adaptive behaviours in addition to the teaching strategy did not learn a significant amount. These results indicate that while the presence of a physical robot leads to improved learning, caution is required when applying social behaviour to a robot in a tutoring context.

However, social psychological studies of the potentially reverse process to anthropomorphisation - known as dehumanization - indicate that there are two distinct senses of humanness with different consequences for people who are dehumanized by deprivation of some of the aspects of these dimensions. These attributes are crucial for perception of others as humans. Therefore, we hypothesized that the same attributes could be used to anthropomorphize a robot in HRI and only a two-dimensional measures would be suitable to distinguish between different forms of making a robot more humanlike. In a study where participants played a quiz based on the TV show “Jeopardy!” we manipulated a NAO robot’s intelligence and emotionality. The results suggest that only emotionality, not intelligence, makes robots be perceived as more humanlike.

Toward this goal, in this paper we present an integrated socio-cognitive architecture to endow an anthropomorphic robot with the ability to infer mental states such as beliefs, intents, and desires from the observable behavior of its human partner. The design of our architecture is informed by recent findings from neuroscience and embodies cognition that reveals how living systems leverage their physical and cognitive embodiment through simulation-theoretic mechanisms to infer the mental states of others. We assess the robot's mindreading skills on a suite of benchmark tasks where the robot interacts with a human partner in a cooperative scenario and a learning scenario. In addition, we have conducted human subjects experiments using the same task scenarios to assess human performance on these tasks and to compare the robot's performance with that of people. In the process, our human subject studies also reveal some interesting insights into human behavior."", 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 126, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

There are a growing number of applications for robots that people can engage as capable creatures or as partners rather than tools, yet little is understood about how to best design robots that interact with people in this way. The related field of human-computer interaction (HCI) offers important insights, however autonomous robots are a very different technology from desktop computers. In this paper, we look at the field of HRI from an HCI perspective, pointing out important similarities yet significant differences that may ultimately make HRI a distinct area of inquiry. One outcome of this discussion is that it is important to view the design and evaluation problem from the robot's perspective as well as that of the human. Taken as a whole, this paper provides a framework with which to design and evaluate sociable robots from a HRI perspective."", 'year': 2004, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 457, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1711777', 'name': 'C.

Constructing dialogue benchmarks can have a meaning only if researchers take into account the evaluation of robot, human, and their interaction. This paper describes a study aiming at finding an objective evaluation procedure of the dialogue with a social robot. The goal is to build an empathic robot (JOKER project) and it focuses on elderly people, the end-users expected by ROMEO2 project. The authors carried out three experimental sessions. The first time, the robot was NAO, and it was with a Wizard of Oz (emotions were entered manually by experimenters as inputs to the program). The other times, the robot was Pepper, and it was totally autonomous (automatic detection of emotions and decision according to). Each interaction involved various scenarios dealing with emotion recognition, humor, negotiation and cultural quiz. The paper details the system functioning, the scenarios and the evaluation of the experiments.

Much has been written about the possibility of human trust in robots. In this article we consider a more specific relationship: that of a human follower’s obedience to a social robot who leads through the exercise of referent power and what Weber described as ‘charismatic authority.’ By studying robotic design efforts and literary depictions of robots, we suggest that human beings are striving to create charismatic robot leaders that will either (1) inspire us through their display of superior morality; (2) enthrall us through their possession of superhuman knowledge; or (3) seduce us with their romantic allure. Rejecting a contractarian-individualist approach which presumes that human beings will be able to consciously ‘choose’ particular robot leaders, we build on the phenomenological-social approach to trust in robots to argue that charismatic robot leaders will emerge naturally from our world’s social fabric, without any rational decision on our part. Finally, we argue that the stability of these leader-follower relations will hinge on a fundamental, unresolved question of robotic intelligence: is it possible for synthetic intelligences to exist that are morally, intellectually, and emotionally sophisticated enough to exercise charismatic authority over human beings—but not so sophisticated that they lose the desire to do so?', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 10, 'citationCount': 9, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48270766', 'name': 'Matthew E.

In this article, we present a novel multimodal emotional HRI architecture to promote natural and engaging bidirectional emotional communications between a social robot and a human user. User affect is detected using a unique combination of body language and vocal intonation, and multimodal classification is performed using a Bayesian Network. The Emotionally Expressive Robot utilizes the user’s affect to determine its own emotional behavior via an innovative two-layer emotional model consisting of deliberative (hidden Markov model) and reactive (rule-based) layers. The proposed architecture has been implemented via a small humanoid robot to perform diet and fitness counseling during HRI. In order to evaluate the Emotionally Expressive Robot’s effectiveness, a Neutral Robot that can detect user affects but lacks an emotional display, was also developed. A between-subjects HRI experiment was conducted with both types of robots. Extensive results have shown that both robots can effectively detect user affect during the real-time HRI. However, the Emotionally Expressive Robot can appropriately determine its own emotional response based on the situation at hand and, therefore, induce more user positive valence and less negative arousal than the Neutral Robot.",2020,0,33,"{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics', 'pages': '5954-5968', 'volume': '51'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-5.6274614334106445,

In recent years evidence on emotional contagion in different animal species has accumulated. However, despite its adaptative advantages and its presumed simplicity, the study and direct demonstration of this phenomenon present more complexities than previously thought. For these reasons, a review of the literature on emotional contagion in nonhuman species is timely to integrate current findings. In this paper thus, we carry out a comprehensive review of the most relevant studies on emotional contagion in animals and discuss the main problems and challenges of the field. We conclude that more research is needed to broaden our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of emotional contagion and the extent to which this process is present in a wide variety of species. Furthermore, the comparative study of emotional contagion would benefit from the use of systematized paradigms including both behavioral and physiological measures and the simultaneous recording of the responses of the interacting individuals to reliably assess an emotional state‐matching between them and reliable controls.

However, the extent to which these helpful behaviors are prosocially motivated remains unclear. To assess the propensity of pet dogs to actively rescue distressed humans without explicit training, this study tested whether sixty pet dogs would release their seemingly trapped owners from a large box. To examine the causal mechanisms that shaped this behavior, the readiness of each dog to open the box was tested in three conditions: 1) the owner sat in the box and called for help (distress test), 2) an experimenter placed high-value food rewards in the box (food test), and 3) the owner sat in the box and calmly read aloud (reading test). Dogs were as likely to release their distressed owner as to retrieve treats from inside the box, indicating that rescuing an owner may be a highly rewarding action for dogs. After accounting for opening ability, dogs released the owner more often when the owner called for help than when the owner read aloud calmly. In addition, opening latencies decreased with test number in the distress test but not the reading test. Thus, rescuing the owner could not be attributed solely to social facilitation, stimulus enhancement, or social contact-seeking behavior. Dogs displayed more stress behaviors in the distress test than in the reading test, and stress scores decreased with test number in the reading test but not in the distress test. This evidence of emotional contagion supports the hypothesis that rescuing the distressed owner was an empathetically-motivated prosocial behavior. Success in the food task and previous (in-home) experience opening objects were both strong predictors of releasing the owner. Thus, prosocial behavior tests for dogs should control for physical ability and previous experience.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 19, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1638736128', 'name': 'Joshua Van Bourg'}, {'authorId': '1638738498', 'name': 'Jordan Elizabeth Patterson'}, {'authorId': '7516261', 'name': 'C.

In particular, it is of interest to determine whether animals can link emotion stimuli of different modalities (e.g., visual and oral) based on the emotions that are expressed (i.e., to recognize emotions cross-modally). For domestic species that share a close relationship with humans, we might even wonder whether this ability extends to human emotions. Here, we investigated whether domestic horses recognize human emotions cross-modally. We simultaneously presented two animated pictures of human facial expressions, one typical of joy and the other of anger; simultaneously, a speaker played a human non-verbal vocalization expressing joy or anger. Horses looked at the picture that did not match the emotion of the vocalization more (probably because they were intrigued by the paradoxical combination). Moreover, their behavior and heart rate differed depending on the vocalization: they reacted more negatively to the anger vocalization and more positively to the joy vocalization. These results suggest that horses can match visual and vocal cues for the same emotion and can perceive the emotional valence of human non-verbal vocalizations. Abstract Over the last few years, an increasing number of studies have aimed to gain more insight into the field of animal emotions. In particular, it is of interest to determine whether animals can cross-modally categorize the emotions of others. For domestic animals that share a close relationship with humans, we might wonder whether this cross-modal recognition of emotions extends to humans, as well. In this study, we tested whether horses could recognize human emotions and attribute the emotional valence of visual (facial expression) and vocal (non-verbal vocalization) stimuli to the same perceptual category. Two animated pictures of different facial expressions (anger and joy) were simultaneously presented to the horses, while a speaker played an emotional human non-verbal vocalization matching one of the two facial expressions. Horses looked at the picture that was incongruent with the vocalization more, probably because they were intrigued by the paradoxical combination. Moreover, horses reacted in accordance with the valence of the vocalization, both behaviorally and physiologically (heart rate). These results show that horses can cross-modally recognize human emotions and react emotionally to the emotional states of humans, assessed by non-verbal vocalizations.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 48, 'citationCount': 33, 'authors': [{'authorId': '51922686', 'name': 'Miléna Trösch'}, {'authorId': '1388884247', 'name': 'Florent Cuzol'}, {'authorId': '51070623', 'name': 'C.

However, the main approach on offer, the mimicry theory, fails to properly account for its many facets. In particular, we focus on two shortcomings: the elicitation of emotional contagion is not context-independent, and there can be cases of emotional contagion without motor mimicry. We contend that a general theory of emotion elicitation (such as Scherer’s Component Process Model of Emotion) is better suited to account for these features, because of its multi-level appraisal component.

Recent studies reported that emotional contagion exists not only between humans but also among various animal species. The dog (Canis familiaris) is a unique animal and the oldest domesticated species. Dogs have coexisted with humans for more than 30,000 years and are woven into human society as partners bonding with humans. Dogs have acquired human-like communication skills and, likely as a result of the domestication process, the ability to read human emotions; therefore, it is feasible that there may be emotional contagion between human and dogs. However, the higher time-resolution of measurement of emotional contagion between them is yet to be conducted. We assessed the emotional reactions of dogs and humans by heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects emotion, under a psychological stress condition on the owners. The correlation coefficients of heart beat (R-R) intervals (RRI), the standard deviations of all RR intervals (SDNN), and the square root of the mean of the sum of the square of differences between adjacent RR intervals (RMSSD) between dogs and owners were positively correlated with the duration of dog ownership. Dogs’ sex also influenced the correlation coefficients of the RRI, SDNN, and RMSSD in the control condition; female showed stronger values.

Impairment of empathy can definitely lead to deficits in social communication and sociability (attachment, bond, reciprocity, altruism and morality) that may be fundamental to some psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), psychopathy, misconduct, antisocial personality disorder and schizophrenia. So far, the underlying mechanisms of empathy are poorly known due to lack of animal models and scarce understanding of its biological basis. Recently, we have successfully identified and validated the behavioral identities of empathy for pain in rats that can be widely used as a rodent model for studying the underlying biological mechanisms of empathy. Priming dyadic social interaction between a naive cagemate observer (CO) and a cagemate demonstrator (CD), rather than a non-cagemate, in pain for 30 min in a testing box can repeatedly and constantly result in empathic responses of the CO toward the familiar CD's distressing condition, displaying as allo-licking at the injury site, allo-grooming at the body and social transfer of pain. The familiarity-based, distress-specific social consolation and subsequent social transfer of pain can be qualitatively and quantitatively rated as experimental biomarkers for empathy for pain. The rodent model of empathy for pain is state-of-the-art and has more advantages than the existing ones used for social neuroscience since it can reflect sensory, emotional and cognitive processes of the brain in running the prosocial and altruistic behaviors in animals who could not report verbally.

Emotional contagion has been suggested to facilitate such information transmission, yet it remains difficult to measure this in animals. Previous research has often focused on overt behavior but lacked additional methods for investigating emotional valence. This study provides a solution by integrating data on behavior and responses to a cognitive bias test, which is designed to infer a subject’s underlying emotional state. We demonstrate that after witnessing a conspecific in a negative state, ravens perform in a negatively biased manner on a judgment task. Our findings thus suggest negative emotional contagion in ravens, and in turn advance our understanding of the evolution of empathy. Emotional contagion is described as an emotional state matching between subjects, and has been suggested to facilitate communication and coordination in complex social groups. Empirical studies typically focus on the measurement of behavioral contagion and emotional arousal, yet, while highly important, such an approach often disregards an additional evaluation of the underlying emotional valence. Here, we studied emotional contagion in ravens by applying a judgment bias paradigm to assess emotional valence. We experimentally manipulated positive and negative affective states in demonstrator ravens, to which they responded with increased attention and interest in the positive condition, as well as increased redirected behavior and a left-eye lateralization in the negative condition. During this emotion manipulation, another raven observed the demonstrator’s behavior, and we used a bias paradigm to assess the emotional valence of the observer to determine whether emotional contagion had occurred. Observers showed a pessimism bias toward the presented ambiguous stimuli after perceiving demonstrators in a negative state, indicating emotional state matching based on the demonstrators’ behavioral cues and confirming our prediction of negative emotional contagion. We did not find any judgment bias in the positive condition. This result critically expands upon observational studies of contagious play in ravens, providing experimental evidence that emotional contagion is present not only in mammalian but also in avian species. Importantly, this finding also acts as a stepping stone toward understanding the evolution of empathy, as this essential social skill may have emerged across these taxa in response to similar socioecological challenges.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 86, 'citationCount': 36, 'authors': [{'authorId': '117783530', 'name': 'J.

We tested whether the sight of a distressed conspecific elicited fear in zebrafish, and whether this was modulated by familiarity. Groups of six zebrafish were housed together in the same tanks for 7 days to create familiar conditions. The behaviour of individual fish was then recorded in paired tanks within sight of either a familiar or an unfamiliar individual, before and after distilled water or an alarm substance was added to the demonstrator, but not to the observer. As expected, addition of distilled water did not elicit any behavioural change in either the demonstrator or the observer. However, addition of an alarm cue triggered anti-predatory behaviours in the demonstrator which caused the expression of anti-predatory behaviours in the observer, suggesting the existence of fear contagion. Furthermore, the extent of fear contagion was affected by familiarity, and observers were more active, swam closer to the bottom and further away from the demonstrator when they watched a distressed familiar neighbour than when they watched an unfamiliar fish. Our results have implications for fish welfare because they show that fish can become stressed by simply watching others become stressed.

We explored the impact on female Barbary macaques of observing grooming, a behaviour that physiological and behavioural studies indicate has a relaxing effect on the animals involved. We compared females' behaviour between two conditions: after observing conspecifics groom, and in a matched control period. We found that observing grooming was associated with reduced behavioural indicators of anxiety, suggesting that seeing others groom is, in itself, relaxing. Observing grooming was also associated with a shorter latency to becoming involved in a grooming bout (and higher likelihood both of initiating that bout and being the groomer rather than groomee), and with elevated rates of other affiliative behaviours. These results provide evidence for positive visual contagion; this phenomenon may contribute fundamentally to group cohesion not just in this species, but also in the many mammal and bird species where grooming occurs.

Either experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event during adolescence can increase the risk of psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD. The present study attempted to establish an improved social stress model to better distinguish the effects of physical and emotional social stress on the behavior and physiology of adolescent mice. In addition, we investigated how social support affected these stress-induced changes in social behavior. On PND 28, male littermates were exposed to either physical stress (PS) or emotional stress (ES), afterwards, half of them were paired-housed and the others were singly housed. The PS exposed mice were directly confronted with a violent aggressor using the social defeat stress (SDS) paradigm for 15 min/trial (with the total of 10 trials randomly administered over a week), while the ES exposed mice were placed in a neighboring compartment to witness the PS procedure. Our results indicate that both stressors induced an effective stress response in adolescent mice, but PS and ES had differential influence in the context of relevant social anxiety/fear and social interaction with peers. Additionally, social support following stress exposure exerted beneficial effects on the social anxiety/fear in ES exposed mice, but not on PS exposed mice, suggesting that the type of stressor may affect the intervention efficacy of social support. These findings provide extensive evidence that physical and emotional stressors induce different effects. Moreover, ES exposed mice, rather than PS exposed mice, seemed to benefit from social support.

To validate rat model of empathy for pain, effects of pain expressions in a cagemate demonstrator (CD) in pain on empathic pain responses in a naïve cagemate observer (CO) after 30 min priming dyadic social interactions (PDSI) were evaluated. The CD rats were prepared with four pain models: bee venom (BV), formalin, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), and spared nerve injury (SNI). Both BV and formalin tests are characterized by displayable and eye-identifiable spontaneous pain-related behaviors (SPRB) immediately after treatment, while CFA and SNI models are characterized by delayed occurrence of evoked pain hypersensitivity but with less eye-identifiable SPRB. After 30 min PDSI with a CD immediately after BV and formalin, respectively, the empathic mechanical pain hypersensitivity (EMPH) could be identified at both hind paws in CO rats. The BV—or formalin-induced EMPH in CO rats lasted for 4–5 h until full recovery. However, EMPH failed to develop in CO after socially interacting with a CD immediately after CFA, or 2 h after BV when SPRB completely disappeared. The CO's EMPH was partially relieved when socially interacting with an analgecized CD whose SPRB had been significantly suppressed. Moreover, repeated exposures to a CD in pain could enhance EMPH in CO. Finally, social transfer of pain hypersensitivity was also identified in CO who was being co-housed in pairs with a conspecific treated with CFA or SNI. The results suggest that development of EMPH in CO rats would be determined not only by extent of familiarity but also by visually identifiable pain expressions in the social partners during short period of PDSI. However, the visually unidentifiable pain can also be transferred to naïve cagemate when being co-housed in pairs with a distressed conspecific. In summary, the vicariously social contagion of pain between familiar rats is dependent upon not only expressions of pain in social partners but also the time that dyads spent in social communications.

While affiliation represents a stronger relation between individuals than mere familiarity, it remains understudied whether affiliation modulates emotional reactions as well. Using cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus), we played back three types of audio stimuli to individual birds: a partner’s distress call (emitted when birds are caught or forcibly restrained), a non-partner’s distress call, and a control sound (white noise). The calls were recorded from familiar birds with either low (non–partners) or high levels of affiliation (partners). The subjects’ response was scored using four behavioural parameters: the time spent near the loudspeaker, the amount of movements, the number of calls emitted, and the position of the crest. Across all variables, birds were more attentive and active when confronted to distress calls compared to control sounds, particularly when the distress call was emitted from a partner rather than a non-partner.

In primates, playful facial expressions and mimicry can be performed to signal and share playful motivation. Here we compare play facial expressions (play face [PF]: lower teeth exposed; full play face [FPF]: upper and lower teeth exposed) and their mimicry in captive chimpanzees and lowland gorillas, during play fighting. These two species have different social dynamics, with social cohesion being lower-and play possibly riskier-in gorillas than in chimpanzees. Thus, we hypothesized that gorillas would perform redundant PFs more often to avoid misunderstanding (Prediction 1). However, the two species are phylogenetically very close and possess a similar biology. Thus, we hypothesized that both species could perform rapid facial mimicry (RFM: response within 1 s) and delayed facial mimicry (DFM: response occurring between 1 s and 5 s), which may have different roles in play modulation (Prediction 2). Gorillas performed more FPF than chimpanzees and FPFs lasted longer than the less intense PF (Prediction 1 supported). RFM was present in both species, whereas DFM was present only in chimpanzees (Prediction 2 not fully supported). DFM may be performed by chimpanzees to modulate the session at a later stage of the interaction and favor interindividual cohesion. RFM prolonged play sessions and may be performed to communicate playful motivation to the playmate thus demonstrating that animals integrate contextual information into their understanding of others' states and intentions.

Moreover, when emotions are transmitted from one individual to the next, leading to state matching (emotional contagion), information transfer and coordination between group members are facilitated. Despite the high potential for vocalizations to influence the affective state of surrounding individuals, vocal contagion of emotions has been largely unexplored in non-human animals. In this paper, I review the evidence for discrimination of vocal expression of emotions, which is a necessary step for emotional contagion to occur. I then describe possible proximate mechanisms underlying vocal contagion of emotions, propose criteria to assess this phenomenon and review the existing evidence. The literature so far shows that non-human animals are able to discriminate and be affected by conspecific and also potentially heterospecific (e.g. human) vocal expression of emotions. Since humans heavily rely on vocalizations to communicate (speech), I suggest that studying vocal contagion of emotions in non-human animals can lead to a better understanding of the evolution of emotional contagion and empathy.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 85, 'citationCount': 57, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4679108', 'name': 'E.

The study of animal empathy has developed using different paradigms, different concepts of the phenomena involved, and the absence of a systematic program. Herein, we carry out a comprehensive review of the literature on complex forms of empathy in non‐human animals: sympathetic concern and empathic perspective‐taking. In particular, we focus on consolation and targeted helping, as the best examples of each category. In so doing, we try to shed light on the current debate concerning whether these phenomena are exclusively human traits. First, we try to clarify the terminology and taxonomy of forms of empathy, providing operative criteria for these phenomena that are applicable to both human and non‐human animals. Second, we discuss whether the available evidence qualifies such behaviour as empathic. Third, we aim to provide an integrative view of the field, clarifying the challenges and conditions to satisfy.

Limited sensitivity to punishment, shallow or deficient affect and reduced physiological reactivity to environmental stressors have been often reported to co-occur with limited empathy and contribute to the onset of antisocial phenotypes. Empathy in its simplest form (i.e. emotional contagion) is addressed in preclinical models through the evaluation of the social transmission of emotional states: mice exposed to a painful stimulus display a higher response if in the presence of a familiar individual experiencing a higher degree of discomfort, than in isolation. In the present study, we investigated whether a reduction of emotional contagion can be considered a predictor of reduced sociality, sensitivity to punishment and physiological stress reactivity. To this aim, we first evaluated emotional contagion in a group of Balb/cJ mice and then discretised their values in four quartiles. The upper (i.e. Emotional Contagion Prone, ECP) and the lower (i.e. Emotional Contagion Resistant, ECR) quartiles constituted the experimental groups. Our results indicate that mice in the lower quartile are characterized by reduced sociability, impaired memory of negative events and dampened hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical reactivity to external stressors. Furthermore, in the absence of changes in oxytocin receptor density, we show that these mice exhibit elevated concentrations of oxytocin and vasopressin and reduced density of BDNF receptors in behaviourally-relevant brain areas. Thus, not only do present results translate to the preclinical investigation of psychiatric disturbances, but also they can contribute to the study of emotional contagion in terms of its adaptive significance.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 118, 'citationCount': 30, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1837749', 'name': 'G.

Recently, we have developed a rat model of empathy for pain in which pain can be transferred from a cagemate demonstrator (CD) in pain to a naïve cagemate observer (CO) after 30 min dyadic priming social interaction. The naïve CO rats display both mechanical pain hypersensitivity (hyperalgesia) and enhanced spinal nociception. Chemical lesions of bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) abolish the empathic pain response completely, suggesting existence of a top-down facilitation system in production of empathy for pain. However, the social transfer of pain was not observed in non-cagemate observer (NCO) after dyadic social interaction with a non-cagemate demonstrator (NCD) in pain. Here we showed that dyadic social interaction with a painful CD resulted in elevation of circulating norepinephrine (NE) and increased neuronal activity in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the CO rats. Meanwhile, CO rats also had over-expression of P2X3, but not TRPV1, in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Chemical lesion of the LC-NE neurons by systemic DSP-4 and pharmacological inhibition of central synaptic release of NE by clonidine completely abolished increase in circulating NE and P2X3 receptor expression, as well as the sympathetically-maintained development of empathic mechanical hyperalgesia. However, in the NCO rats, neither the LC-NE neuronal activity nor the P2X3 receptor expression was altered after dyadic social interaction with a painful NCD although the circulating corticosterone and NE were elevated. Finally, in the periphery, both P2X3 receptor and α1 adrenergic receptor were found to be involved in the development of empathic mechanical hyperalgesia. Taken together with our previous results, empathy for pain observed in the CO rats is likely to be mediated by activation of the top-down mPFC-LC/NE-sympathoadrenomedullary (SAM) system that further up-regulates P2X3 receptors in the periphery, however, social stress observed in the NCO rats is mediated by activation of both hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and SAM axis.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 30, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40463760', 'name': 'Yun-Fei Lü'}, {'authorId': '2108850218', 'name': 'Yan Yang'}, {'authorId': '2109497113', 'name': 'Chun-Li Li'}, {'authorId': '2152542739', 'name': 'Yan Wang'}, {'authorId': '2145255640', 'name': 'Zhen Li'}, {'authorId': '81677355', 'name': 'Jun Chen'}]}, {'paperId': '71bdcf329f4a3a22cb96cb2918bb5c7a43d1ae20', 'title': 'Stress responses to conspecific visual cues of predation risk in zebrafish', 'abstract': 'Chemical communication relating to predation risk is a trait common among fish species.

Here, we explored whether these behavioral changes act as visual alarm signals to conspecific fish that are not initially under risk. We show that shoals of zebrafish (Danio rerio) visually exposed to a predator display antipredator behaviors. In addition, these defensive maneuvers trigger antipredator reactions in conspecifics and, concomitantly, stimulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis, leading to cortisol increase.

Frans de Waal (de Waal FBM. Putting the altruism back into altruism: the evolution of empathy. Annu Rev Psychol 2008, 59:279-300. doi:10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093625) used empathy as an umbrella term and proposed a comprehensive model for the evolution of empathy with some of its basic elements in nonhuman animals. In de Waal's model, empathy consists of several layers distinguished by required cognitive levels; the perception-action mechanism plays the core role for connecting ourself and others. Then, human-like empathy such as perspective-taking develops in outer layers according to cognitive sophistication, leading to prosocial acts such as targeted helping. I agree that animals demonstrate many empathy-related phenomena; however, the species differences and the level of cognitive sophistication of the phenomena might be interpreted in another way than this simple linearly developing model. Our recent studies with chimpanzees showed that their perspective-taking ability does not necessarily lead to proactive helping behavior. Herein, as a springboard for further studies, I reorganize the empathy-related phenomena by proposing a combination model instead of the linear development model. This combination model is composed of three organizing factors: matching with others, understanding of others, and prosociality. With these three factors and their combinations, most empathy-related matters can be categorized and mapped to appropriate context; this may be a good first step to discuss the evolution of empathy in relation to the neural connections in human and nonhuman animal brains. I would like to propose further comparative studies, especially from the viewpoint of Homo-Pan (chimpanzee and bonobo) comparison.

While a major component of social stress often encompasses physical interactions, purely psychological stressors (i.e. witnessing a traumatic event) also fall under the scope of social stress. The current study determined whether the acute stress response and susceptibility to stress-related consequences differed based on whether the stressor consisted of physical versus purely psychological social stress. Using a modified resident-intruder paradigm, male rats were either directly exposed to repeated social defeat stress (intruder) or witnessed a male rat being defeated. Cardiovascular parameters, behavioral anhedonia, and inflammatory cytokines in plasma and the stress-sensitive locus coeruleus were compared between intruder, witness, and control rats. Surprisingly intruders and witnesses exhibited nearly identical increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate during acute and repeated stress exposures, yet only intruders exhibited stress-induced arrhythmias. Furthermore, re-exposure to the stress environment in the absence of the resident produced robust pressor and tachycardic responses in both stress conditions indicating the robust and enduring nature of social stress. In contrast, the long-term consequences of these stressors were distinct. Intruders were characterized by enhanced inflammatory sensitivity in plasma, while witnesses were characterized by the emergence of depressive-like anhedonia, transient increases in systolic blood pressure and plasma levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase. The current study highlights that while the acute cardiovascular responses to stress were identical between intruders and witnesses, these stressors produced distinct differences in the enduring consequences to stress, suggesting that witness stress may be more likely to produce long-term cardiovascular dysfunction and comorbid behavioral anhedonia while exposure to physical stressors may bias the system towards sensitivity to inflammatory disorders.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 97, 'citationCount': 79, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2238740982', 'name': 'Finnell Je'}, {'authorId': '2238823341', 'name': 'Lombard Cm'}, {'authorId': '2238823759', 'name': 'Padi Ar'}, {'authorId': '2238658578', 'name': 'Moffitt Cm'}, {'authorId': '2238820232', 'name': 'Wilson Lb'}, {'authorId': '2238820433', 'name': 'Wood Cs'}, {'authorId': '2238823276', 'name': 'Wood Sk'}]}, {'paperId': 'b555c60ddb91af55c8fd3632cd5592462b8730c9', 'title': 'Perception of emotional valence in horse whinnies', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 41, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4679108', 'name': 'E.

While most studies have investigated how animals reacted in response to conspecifics’ distress, dogs so far have mainly been targeted to examine cross-species empathic responses. To investigate whether dogs would respond with empathy-like behavior also to conspecifics, we adopted a playback method using conspecifics’ vocalizations (whines) recorded during a distressful event as well as control sounds. Our subjects were first exposed to a playback phase where they were subjected either to a control sound, a familiar whine (from their familiar partner) or a stranger whine stimulus (from a stranger dog), and then a reunion phase where the familiar partner entered the room. When exposed to whines, dogs showed a higher behavioral alertness and exhibited more stress-related behaviors compared to when exposed to acoustically similar control sounds. Moreover, they demonstrated more comfort-offering behaviors toward their familiar partners following whine playbacks than after control stimuli. Furthermore, when looking at the first session, this comfort offering was biased towards the familiar partner when subjects were previously exposed to the familiar compared to the stranger whines. Finally, familiar whine stimuli tended to maintain higher cortisol levels while stranger whines did not. To our knowledge, these results are the first to suggest that dogs can experience and demonstrate “empathic-like” responses to conspecifics’ distress-calls.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 67, 'citationCount': 40, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1401509134', 'name': 'M.

This phenotype conceptually lies within the domain of empathy, a bio-psycho-social process through which individuals come to share each other\'s emotion. Using a model of cue-conditioned fear, we show here that the expression of vicarious fear varies with respect to whether mice are raised socially or in solitude during adolescence. The impact of the adolescent housing environment was selective: (a) vicarious fear was more influenced than directly acquired fear, (b) ""long-term"" (24-h postconditioning) vicarious fear memories were stronger than ""short-term"" (15-min postconditioning) memories in socially reared mice whereas the opposite was true for isolate mice, and (c) females were more fearful than males. Housing differences during adolescence did not alter the general mobility of mice or their vocal response to receiving the unconditioned stimulus. Previous work with this mouse model underscored a genetic influence on vicarious fear learning, and the present study complements these findings by elucidating an interaction between the adolescent social environment and vicarious experience. Collectively, these findings are relevant to developing models of empathy amenable to mechanistic exploitation in the laboratory.

We have previously developed an observational fear learning (OFL) behavioral assay to measure empathic fear in mice. In the OFL task, a mouse is conditioned for context‐dependent fear when it observes a conspecific demonstrator receiving aversive stimuli. In the present study, by comparing 11 different inbred mouse strains that are commonly used in the laboratory, we found that empathic fear response was highly variable between different strains. Five strains – C57BL/6J, C57BL/6NTac, 129S1/SvImJ, 129S4/SvJae and BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J – showed observational fear (OF) responses, whereas AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ and NOD/ShiLtJ mice exhibited low empathic fear response. Importantly, day 2 OF memory was significantly correlated with contextual memory in the classical fear conditioning among the 11 strains. Innate differences in anxiety, locomotor activity, sociability and preference for social novelty were not significantly correlated with OFL. Interestingly, early adolescent C57BL/6J mice exhibited an increase in acquisition of OF. The level of OFL in C57BL/6J strain was not affected by sex or strains of the demonstrator. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that there are naturally occurring OFL‐specific genetic variations modulating empathic fear behaviors in mice.

In North America alone, ∼30% of individuals who witness a traumatic event develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While effects of direct trauma are evident, consequences of indirect or secondary trauma are often ignored. Also unclear is the role of social support in the consequences of these experiences. The social defeat paradigm, which involves aggressive encounters by a large Long-Evans male rat (resident) towards a smaller Sprague-Dawley male rat (intruder), is considered a rodent model of PTSD. We have modified this model to create a trauma witness model (TWM) and have used our TWM model to also evaluate social support effects. Basically, when an intruder rat is placed into the home cage of a resident rat, it encounters an agonistic behavior resulting in intruder subordination. The socially defeated intruder is designated the SD rat. A second rat, the cage mate of the SD, is positioned to witness the event and is the trauma witnessing (TW) rat. Experiments were performed in two different experimental conditions. In one, the SD and TW rats were cagemates and acclimatized together. Then, one SD rat was subjected to three sessions of social defeat for 7 d. TW rat witnessed these events. After each social defeat exposure, the TW and SD rats were housed together. In the second, the TW and SD rats were housed separately starting after the first defeat. At the end of each protocol, depression-anxiety-like behavior and memory tests were conducted on the SD and TW rats, blood withdrawn and specific organs collected.

However, little is known about the consequences of emotional stress (ES) or physical stress (PS) on neurobiology. Therefore, the following set of experiments was designed to assess changes in transcription and translation of key proteins within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Male adolescent (postnatal day 35) or adult (8-week-old) mice were exposed to ES or PS using a witness social defeat paradigm. Then, 24 h after the last stress session, we measured levels of specific mRNAs and proteins within the NAc. Spine density was also assessed in separate groups of mice. Exposure to ES or PS disrupted extracellular signal-related kinase 2 (ERK2), reduced transcription of ΔFosB and had no effect on cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) mRNA. Western blots revealed that exposure to ES or PS decreased ERK2 phosphorylation in adolescents, whereas the same stress regimen increased ERK2 phosphorylation in adults. Exposure to ES or PS had no effect on ΔFosB or CREB phosphorylation. ES and PS increased spine density in the NAc of adolescent exposed mice, but only exposure to PS increased spine density in adults. Together, these findings demonstrate that exposure to ES or PS is a potent stressor in adolescent and adult mice and can disturb the integrity of the NAc by altering transcription and translation of important signaling molecules in an age-dependent manner.

In the field of cognitive zoology, contagious behaviors have also received attention. Several such behaviors have been documented in various species. Nevertheless, emotional and behavioral contagion differ. Emotional contagion – a term predominantly used in human psychology – requires that the contagious behavior leads to converging emotional states. In non-linguistic animals, it is difficult to determine whether a behavior “caught” from someone else results in a similar affective state or remains a purely behavioral response. Some studies suggest the latter as a possibility. To disentangle the problem, we explored instances of contagious behaviors within the play domain. In several species, play involves a variety of behaviors falling into different categories: social, object and locomotor play. If a category of play in one individual induces a different category of play in another, this suggests the spread of a generally playful mood rather than a species-specific motor response. Although some studies suggest emotional contagion in mammals, it is not known whether it occurs in birds. We investigated play contagion in a group of ravens, well known for their complex social skills. The results indicate emotional contagion: the birds engaged in all categories of play on a higher level under the condition where contagion was likely to occur.

Whereas the typical agonistic context of such contact is relatively rare within natural elephant families, other causes of distress may trigger similar, other-regarding responses. In a study carried out at an elephant camp in Thailand, we found that elephants affiliated significantly more with other individuals through directed, physical contact and vocal communication following a distress event than in control periods. In addition, bystanders affiliated with each other, and matched the behavior and emotional state of the first distressed individual, suggesting emotional contagion. The initial distress responses were overwhelmingly directed toward ambiguous stimuli, thus making it difficult to determine if bystanders reacted to the distressed individual or showed a delayed response to the same stimulus. Nonetheless, the directionality of the contacts and their nature strongly suggest attention toward the emotional states of conspecifics. The elephants’ behavior is therefore best classified with similar consolation responses by apes, possibly based on convergent evolution of empathic capacities.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 76, 'citationCount': 93, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5675701', 'name': 'Joshua M.

In humans, empathy for others is facilitated by having had a similar prior experience. It increases with the intensity of distress that observers believe is occurring to others, and is associated with acute emotional responses to witnessing others’ distress. We sought to develop a relatively simple and fast mouse model of human empathy that resembled these characteristics. We modeled empathy by measuring the freezing of observer mice to observing the footshock of a subject mouse. Observer mice froze to subject footshocks only when they had a similar shock experience 24 hours earlier. Moreover, this freezing increased with the number of footshocks given to the subject and it was accentuated within seconds after footshock delivery. Freezing was not seen in naïve observers or in experienced observers that observed a subject who was spared footshock. Observers did not freeze to a subject’s footshock when they had experienced a swim stress 24 hours prior, demonstrating a specific effect for shared experience, as opposed to a generalized stressor in eliciting observer mouse freezing.

During each test, the observer hens' behaviour and physiology were measured throughout a 10 min pre-treatment and a 10 min treatment period. Despite showing signs of distress in response to an aversive stimulus directed at themselves (APH), and using methodology sufficiently sensitive to detect empathy-like responses previously, observer hens showed no behavioural or physiological responses to the mild distress of a familiar adult conspecific.

A simpler animal model would pave the way for systematic single cell recordings and invasive manipulations of the brain regions implicated in empathy. Recent evidence has been put forward for the existence of empathy in rodents. In this study, we describe a potential model of empathy in female rats, in which we studied interactions between two rats: a witness observes a demonstrator experiencing a series of footshocks. By comparing the reaction of witnesses with or without previous footshock experience, we examine the role of prior experience as a modulator of empathy. We show that witnesses having previously experienced footshocks, but not naïve ones, display vicarious freezing behavior upon witnessing a cage-mate experiencing footshocks. Strikingly, the demonstrator's behavior was in turn modulated by the behavior of the witness: demonstrators froze more following footshocks if their witness froze more. Previous experiments have shown that rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when receiving footshocks. Thus, the role of USV in triggering vicarious freezing in our paradigm is examined. We found that experienced witness-demonstrator pairs emitted more USVs than naïve witness-demonstrator pairs, but the number of USVs was correlated with freezing in demonstrators, not in witnesses. Furthermore, playing back the USVs, recorded from witness-demonstrator pairs during the empathy test, did not induce vicarious freezing behavior in experienced witnesses. Thus, our findings confirm that vicarious freezing can be triggered in rats, and moreover it can be modulated by prior experience. Additionally, our result suggests that vicarious freezing is not triggered by USVs per se and it influences back onto the behavior of the demonstrator that had elicited the vicarious freezing in witnesses, introducing a paradigm to study empathy as a social loop."", 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 161, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4487960', 'name': 'P.

Converging evidence from neuroimaging and lesion studies shows that a neural network that includes the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule is necessary for emotion recognition and emotional contagion. On the other hand, the involvement of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and the medial temporal lobe in self-reflection and autobiographical memory places these key regions as necessary for cognitive empathy. The proposed dissociation between these systems is supported by recent neurochemical experiments involving administration of oxytocin as well as by ethological, psychiatric, and developmental studies.

Certain ‘stress-related behaviors’ such as autopreening, body shaking, scratching and vigilance have been suggested to indicate an individual's emotional state. Such behaviors may also alleviate stress, but the behavioral context and physiological basis of those behaviors is still poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We recorded beat-to-beat heart rates (HR) of 22 greylag geese in response to agonistic encounters using fully implanted sensor-transmitter packages.

Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge this is the first study to quantify the physiological and behavioral responses to single agonistic encounters and to link this to post conflict behavior. Our results demonstrate that ‘stress-related behaviors’ are flexibly modulated by the characteristics of the preceding aggressive interaction and reflect the individual's emotional strain, which is linked to autonomic arousal.

Methodology/Principal Findings The present study investigated, in pair-housed male rats, whether and how the conditioned fear-induced 22-kHz USVs emitted by the ‘sender’ animal affect the behavior of its partner, the ‘receiver’ animal, when both are placed together in a novel chamber. The sender rats’ conditioned fear responses evoked significant freezing (an overt evidence of fear) in receiver rats that had previously experienced an aversive event but not in naïve receiver rats. Permanent lesions and reversible inactivations of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) of the thalamus effectively blocked the receivers’ freeezing response to the senders' conditioned fear responses, and this occurred in absence of lesions/inactivations impeding the receiver animals' ability to freeze and emit 22-kHz USVs to the aversive event per se. Conclusions/Significance These results—that prior experience of fear and intact auditory system are required for receiver rats to respond to their conspecifics' conditioned fear responses—indicate that the 22-kHz USV is the main factor for social transmission of fear and that learning plays a crucial role in the development of social signaling of danger by USVs."", 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 180, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2110112491', 'name': 'Eun Joo Kim'}, {'authorId': '5156210', 'name': 'Earnest S.

This correlation persisted after controlling for the effect of spatial association. Thus, emotional proximity rather than spatial proximity best predicts yawn contagion.

When discomfort or alarm is detected in another, a variety of behavioral responses can follow, including greater levels of nurturing, consolation or increased vigilance towards a threat. Moreover, changes in systemic physiology often accompany the recognition of distressed states in others. Employing a mouse model of cue-conditioned fear, we asked whether exposure to conspecific distress influences how a mouse subsequently responds to environmental cues that predict this distress. We found that mice are responsive to environmental cues that predict social distress, that their heart rate changes when distress vocalizations are emitted from conspecifics, and that genetic background substantially influences the magnitude of these responses. Specifically, during a series of pre-exposure sessions, repeated experiences of object mice that were exposed to a tone-shock (CS-UCS) contingency resulted in heart rate deceleration in subjects from the gregarious C57BL/6J (B6) strain, but not in subjects from the less social BALB/cJ (BALB) strain. Following the pre-exposure sessions, subjects were individually presented with the CS-only for 5 consecutive trials followed by 5 consecutive pairings of the CS with the UCS. Pre-exposure to object distress increased the freezing responses of B6 mice, but not BALB mice, on both the CS-only and the CS-UCS trials. These physiological and behavioral responses of B6 mice to social distress parallel features of human empathy.

We next examined the influence of the demonstrators on the exploratory behavior of their cagemates (called ""observers"") and the observers\' performance of the acoustic startle response. We report that we can distinguish both groups of observers from the control animals (as shown by startle-response measure) and distinguish between observers (by means of indexing the exploration), with respect to whether they were paired with demonstrators treated to different experimental conditions. Furthermore, we show that the observers have most of their amygdala activated (as revealed by c-Fos mapping) to the same level as the demonstrators and, in the case of the central amygdala, to an even higher level. Moreover, the level of c-Fos expression in the observers reflected the specific behavioral treatment of the demonstrators with whom they were paired. Thus, in this study, we have shown that undefined emotional information transferred by a cohabitant rat can be evaluated and measured and that it evokes very strong and information-specific activation of the amygdala.', 'year': 2006, 'referenceCount': 50, 'citationCount': 133, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3765282', 'name': 'E.

Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups.

Children were categorized as low, moderate, or high risk for developing disruptive behavior disorders, depending on severity of current behavior problems. Hypothetical and real encounters with others in distress were used to examine children's affect, behavior, autonomic activity, and social cognitions. When children witnessed someone in distress, empathic concern and prosocial behaviors were present at similar levels for all risk groups. However, moderate and high-risk children were less able than low-risk children to remain positively engaged with distress victims. Girls showed more prosocial behavior than boys, and boys showed more anger than girls. During sadness mood inductions to assess autonomic activity, risk groups did not differ on heart rate or vagal tone. Girls showed higher skin conductance than boys, with high-risk girls showing the highest levels. Higher heart rate (and heart rate deceleration) predicted empathic concern and prosocial behavior, whereas lower heart rate was associated with aggression and avoidance, irrespective of risk. Although biological correlates of emotions and behaviors that reflect caring versus indifference to others' distress are identified, they do not support an early direct link to externalizing psychopathologies."", 'year': 1995, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 216, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1398158374', 'name': 'C.

Chimpanzee screams evoked typical deceleratory cardiac orienting responses. Analysis of stimulus-evoked changes in respiratory sinus arrhythmia suggested that this cardiac deceleration arose from an increase in parasympathetic activity. In contrast, chimpanzee laughter evoked notable cardiac acceleration. Laughter also evoked vocalizations from the infant subjects, which were reminiscent of adult threat-barks. Analysis of respiratory sinus arrhythmia suggested that the cardioacceleratory response likely resulted from sympathetic activation, and was not associated with an inhibition of parasympathetic activity. The autonomic and vocal responses to laughter emerged early in development, were minimally dependent on social contact with adults, and declined in magnitude with increasing age.

In areas where elephants are living at high densities such damage can constitute an important management problem. A partial solution is to reduce elephant numbers by culling but this still leaves the problem of protecting specimen trees in amenity areas. In such cases an effective chemical repellent would be of great value. Elephants possess a pair of temporal scent glands. In the African Elephant, Loxodonta africana, there is evidence that the glands are particularly active in stressed or aggressive individuals, for example bulls in Musth (Buss et al. 1976, Poole & Moss 1981). Thus, the secretion may signal that an individual is frightened or aggressive and best avoided, and might therefore be potentially useful as a repellent. The secretion contains 5 volatile compounds; p-cresol, phenol, farnesol, farnesol hydrate and a farnesol dihydrate (Wheeler et al. 1982). The aims of this study were to investigate the behavioural responses of African Elephants to these chemicals; in particular, to determine whether they are repelled by them. The study was carried out in the Kruger National Park during July and August 1985. Observations were made on 7 young animals in captivity and on adults in the wild. Synthetic volatiles were used throughout. An equimolar mixture of acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acids was used as a control olfactory stimulus.

In its simplest form, empathy can be characterized as the capacity to be affected by and/or share the emotional state of another. However, to date, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which animals that are not in direct danger share emotions. In the present study, we used a model of between-subject transfer of fear to characterize the social interaction during which fear is transmitted, as well as the behavioral effects of socially transmitted fear. We found that (1) during social interaction with a recently fear-conditioned partner, observers and demonstrators exhibit social exploratory behaviors rather than aggressive behaviors; (2) learning and memory in a shock-motivated shuttle avoidance task are facilitated in rats that underwent a social interaction with a partner that had been fear conditioned; and (3) a brief social interaction with a recently fear-conditioned partner immediately before fear conditioning increases conditioned freezing measured on the next day. The observed effects were not due to a stress-induced increase in pain sensitivity or analgesia. Collectively, these data suggest that a brief social interaction with a cage mate that has undergone an aversive learning experience promotes aversive learning in an otherwise naïve animal. We argue that socially transferred fear is an adaptation that promotes defensive behavior to potentially dangerous situations in the environment.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 22, 'citationCount': 141, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3765282', 'name': 'E.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory."", 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 169, 'citationCount': 1031, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3533326', 'name': 'F.

Adult Asian (Elephas maximus) and African (Loxodonta africana) elephants have complex social societies that differ markedly between the sexes. Elephant social structure and cooperative behavior may have evolved in part to prepare young elephants to meet the challenges of an expansive environment, predators and parasites. In captivity, such forces are relaxed or eliminated, yet captive elephants display a similar repertoire of behaviors as their wild counterparts. Elephants live in herds of related adult females from several generations. This female social unit is centered on calves and the matriarch. Adult males reside in bachelor herds, singly, or frequent female groups, depending on male age and reproductive condition. In captivity, female elephants are usually housed together, although group size is smaller than in the wild, whereas adult males are generally housed separately from other elephants. Beyond these general similarities between wild and captive settings, captive elephants are housed in a wider range of group sizes, degrees of relatedness, and age structures than would be typical in the wild. This variation in social structure can be used to explore questions about cooperative behavior. Following a comparison of wild and captive social structures for elephants, three such potential avenues for study are discussed. Specifically, research with captive elephants could shed light on the development of social behavior, the functional significance of allomothering, and the ability of elephants to recognize kin or social group members. Beside the potential theoretical implications and insight into wild elephant behavior, the examination of social behavior also has important ramifications for the management of animals in captivity.

Since interactions with social robots are novel and exciting for many people, one particular concern is the extent to which people's behavioural and emotional engagement with robots might develop from initial interactions with a robot, when a robot's novelty is especially salient, and be sustained over time. The aim of this paper is to introduce a research protocol for a mediated long-term online experiment for testing the extent to which social robots’ cognitive architectures can elicit emotionally rich disclosures and expressions from people to identify their needs and emotional states over time. Moreover, this protocol introduces experimental methods for investigating people's perceptions of a social robot in their natural settings during prolonged and regular interactions, and evaluating how novelty effects on human-robot interactions change over time.",2021,0,8,,"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-5.349364280700684, -1.570699691772461, -1.8173372745513916, 4.370339870452881,

The Effects of Emotion Contagion and Social Media Use on Anxiety in Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, causing substantial anxiety. One potential factor in the spread of anxiety in response to a pandemic threat is emotion contagion, the finding that emotional experiences can be socially spread through conscious and unconscious pathways. Some individuals are more susceptible to social contagion effects and may be more likely to experience anxiety and other mental health symptoms in response to a pandemic threat. Therefore, we studied the relationship between emotion contagion and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. We administered the Emotion Contagion Scale (ESC) along with a measure of anxiety in response to COVID-19 (modified from a previous scale designed to quantify fear of the Swine Flu outbreak) and secondary outcome measures of depression, anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. These measures were completed by a large (n = 603) student sample in the United States. Data were collected in the months of April and May of 2020 when the fear of COVID-19 was widespread. Results revealed that greater susceptibility to emotion contagion was associated with greater concern about the spread of COVID-19, more depression, anxiety, stress, and OCD symptoms. Consumption of media about COVID-19 also predicted anxiety about COVID-19, though results were not moderated by emotion contagion. However, emotion contagion did moderate the relationship between COVID-19-related media consumption and elevated OCD symptoms. Although limited by a cross-sectional design that precludes causal inferences, the present results highlight the need for study of how illness fears may be transmitted socially during a pandemic.",2021,43,96,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '11'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector': [-2.6345925331115723, -3.8919777870178223, -1.4317210912704468, 2.9963512420654297,

A close examination of the extensive body of research on social network sites suggests that conflicting results can be reconciled by a single theoretical approach: the interpersonal-connection-behaviors framework. Specifically, we suggest that social network sites benefit their users when they are used to make meaningful social connections and harm their users through pitfalls such as isolation and social comparison when they are not. The benefits and drawbacks of using social network sites shown in existing research can largely be explained by this approach, which also posits the need for studying specific online behaviors in future research.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 212, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31622253', 'name': 'Jenna L.

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others.

In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.

A smiling face can signal the experience of enjoyable emotions, but people can also smile to convince another person that enjoyment is occurring when it is not.

Despite its importance, adults show remarkable individual variation in this ability. Revealing the factors responsible for these huge individual differences is a key challenge in this domain. Here we investigated, on a large sample of participants, whether individual differences in smile authenticity recognition are accounted for by differences in the predisposition to experience other people's emotions, i.e., by susceptibility to emotional contagion. Results showed that susceptibility to emotional contagion for negative emotions increased smile authenticity detection, while susceptibility to emotional contagion for positive emotions worsened detection performance, because it leaded to categorize most of the faked smiles as sincere.

This naturalistic study investigates the effectiveness of new web-based methodologies in assessing anxiety and information seeking in response to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak by examining language use in weblogs (“blogs”), newspaper articles, and web-based information seeking. Language use in blogs and newspaper articles was assessed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and information seeking was examined using the number of daily visits to H1N1-relevant Wikipedia articles. The results show that blogs mentioning “swine flu” used significantly higher levels of anxiety, health, and death words and lower levels of positive emotion words than control blogs. Change in language use on blogs was strongly related to change in language use in newspaper coverage for the same day. Both the measure of anxiety in blogs mentioning ”swine flu” and the number of Wikipedia visits followed similar trajectories, peaking shortly after the announcement of H1N1 and then declining rapidly. Anxiety measured in blogs preceded information seeking on Wikipedia. These results show that the public reaction to H1N1 was rapid and short-lived.

To provide normative data for the general adult population.\n\n\nDESIGN\nCross-sectional, correlational and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe DASS-21 was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,794). Competing models of the latent structure of the DASS-21 were evaluated using CFA.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe model with optimal fit (RCFI = 0.94) had a quadripartite structure, and consisted of a general factor of psychological distress plus orthogonal specific factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. This model was a significantly better fit than a competing model that tested the possibility that the Stress scale simply measures NA.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe DASS-21 subscales can validly be used to measure the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, each of these subscales also taps a more general dimension of psychological distress or NA. The utility of the measure is enhanced by the provision of normative data based on a large sample.', 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 21, 'citationCount': 4084, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2149900272', 'name': 'J.

Differences between subjects high and low in emotional empathy were investigated. The parameters compared were facial mimicry reactions, as represented by electromyographic (EMG) activity when subjects were exposed to pictures of angry or happy faces, and the degree of correspondence between subjects\' facial EMG reactions and their self-reported feelings. The comparisons were made at different stimulus exposure times in order to elicit reactions at different levels of information processing. The high-empathy subjects were found to have a higher degree of mimicking behavior than the low-empathy subjects, a difference that emerged at short exposure times (17-40 ms) that represented automatic reactions. The low-empathy subjects tended already at short exposure times (17-40 ms) to show inverse zygomaticus muscle reactions, namely ""smiling"" when exposed to an angry face. The high-empathy group was characterized by a significantly higher correspondence between facial expressions and self-reported feelings. No differences were found between the high- and low-empathy subjects in their verbally reported feelings when presented a happy or an angry face. Thus, the differences between the groups in emotional empathy appeared to be related to differences in automatic somatic reactions to facial stimuli rather than to differences in their conscious interpretation of the emotional situation.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 78, 'citationCount': 365, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1404580609', 'name': 'M.

While emotional contagion has been traditionally considered to be a prerogative of mammals and birds, recent findings are demonstrating otherwise. Here, we investigate emotional contagion in groups of zebrafish, a freshwater model species which is gaining momentum in preclinical studies. Zebrafish have high genetic homology to humans, and they exhibit a complex behavioral repertoire amenable to study social behavior. To investigate whether individual emotional states can be transmitted to group members, we pharmacologically modulated anxiety-related behaviors of a single fish through Citalopram administration and we assessed whether the altered emotional state spread to a group of four untreated conspecifics. By capitalizing upon our in-house developed tracking algorithm, we successfully preserved the identity of all the subjects and thoroughly described their individual and social behavioral phenotypes. In accordance with our predictions, we observed that Citalopram administration consistently reduced behavioral anxiety of the treated individual, in the form of reduced geotaxis, and that such a behavioral pattern readily generalized to the untreated subjects. A transfer entropy analysis of causal interactions within the group revealed that emotional contagion was directional, whereby the treated individual influenced untreated subjects, but not vice-versa. This study offers additional evidence that emotional contagion is biologically preserved in simpler living organisms amenable to preclinical investigations.",2021,63,4,"{'name': 'Frontiers in

In recent years evidence on emotional contagion in different animal species has accumulated. However, despite its adaptative advantages and its presumed simplicity, the study and direct demonstration of this phenomenon present more complexities than previously thought. For these reasons, a review of the literature on emotional contagion in nonhuman species is timely to integrate current findings. In this paper thus, we carry out a comprehensive review of the most relevant studies on emotional contagion in animals and discuss the main problems and challenges of the field. We conclude that more research is needed to broaden our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of emotional contagion and the extent to which this process is present in a wide variety of species. Furthermore, the comparative study of emotional contagion would benefit from the use of systematized paradigms including both behavioral and physiological measures and the simultaneous recording of the responses of the interacting individuals to reliably assess an emotional state‐matching between them and reliable controls.

For social organisms travelling in groups, like the fish in a school or the birds in a flock, sharing information can further improve their situational awareness and reaction times. Data on the benefits and costs of social coordination, however, have largely allowed our understanding of why collective behaviours have evolved to outpace our mechanistic knowledge of how they arise. Recent studies have begun to correct this imbalance through fine-scale analyses of group movement data. One approach that has received renewed attention is the use of information theoretic (IT) tools like mutual information, transfer entropy and causation entropy, which can help identify causal interactions in the type of complex, dynamical patterns often on display when organisms act collectively. Yet, there is a communications gap between studies focused on the ecological constraints and solutions of collective action with those demonstrating the promise of IT tools in this arena. We attempt to bridge this divide through a series of ecologically motivated examples designed to illustrate the benefits and challenges of using IT tools to extract deeper insights into the interaction patterns governing group-level dynamics. We summarize some of the approaches taken thus far to circumvent existing challenges in this area and we conclude with an optimistic, yet cautionary perspective.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 118, 'citationCount': 26, 'authors': [{'authorId': '50033609', 'name': 'K.

Although the behavioral repertoire of this species manifests along three-dimensional (3D), most of the efforts in behavioral pharmacology rely on two-dimensional (2D) projections acquired from a single overhead or front camera. We recently showed that, compared to a 3D scoring approach, 2D analyses could lead to inaccurate claims regarding individual and social behavior of drug-free experimental subjects. Here, we examined whether this conclusion extended to the field of behavioral pharmacology by phenotyping adult zebrafish, acutely exposed to citalopram (30, 50, and 100 mg/L) or ethanol (0.25%, 0.50%, and 1.00%), in the novel tank diving test over a 6-min experimental session. We observed that both compounds modulated the time course of general locomotion and anxiety-related profiles, the latter being represented by specific behaviors (erratic movements and freezing) and avoidance of anxiety-eliciting areas of the test tank (top half and distance from the side walls). We observed that 2D projections of 3D trajectories (ground truth data) may introduce a source of unwanted variation in zebrafish behavioral phenotyping. Predictably, both 2D views underestimate absolute levels of general locomotion. Additionally, while data obtained from a camera positioned on top of the experimental tank are similar to those obtained from a 3D reconstruction, 2D front view data yield false negative findings.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 55, 'citationCount': 7, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145838336', 'name': 'S.

Husbandry procedures found today in zebrafish facilities are numerous. While the vast majority of these practices are perfectly acceptable in terms of zebrafish physiology and welfare, the reproducibility of experimental results could be improved by further standardisation of husbandry procedures and exchange of husbandry information between laboratories. Standardisation protocols providing ranges of husbandry parameters are likely to be more successful and appropriate than the implementation of a set of fixed guidance values neglecting the empirically successful daily routines of many facilities and will better reflect the wide range of environmental parameters that characterise the natural habitats occupied by zebrafish.

Emotional contagion has been suggested to facilitate such information transmission, yet it remains difficult to measure this in animals. Previous research has often focused on overt behavior but lacked additional methods for investigating emotional valence. This study provides a solution by integrating data on behavior and responses to a cognitive bias test, which is designed to infer a subject’s underlying emotional state. We demonstrate that after witnessing a conspecific in a negative state, ravens perform in a negatively biased manner on a judgment task. Our findings thus suggest negative emotional contagion in ravens, and in turn advance our understanding of the evolution of empathy. Emotional contagion is described as an emotional state matching between subjects, and has been suggested to facilitate communication and coordination in complex social groups. Empirical studies typically focus on the measurement of behavioral contagion and emotional arousal, yet, while highly important, such an approach often disregards an additional evaluation of the underlying emotional valence. Here, we studied emotional contagion in ravens by applying a judgment bias paradigm to assess emotional valence. We experimentally manipulated positive and negative affective states in demonstrator ravens, to which they responded with increased attention and interest in the positive condition, as well as increased redirected behavior and a left-eye lateralization in the negative condition. During this emotion manipulation, another raven observed the demonstrator’s behavior, and we used a bias paradigm to assess the emotional valence of the observer to determine whether emotional contagion had occurred. Observers showed a pessimism bias toward the presented ambiguous stimuli after perceiving demonstrators in a negative state, indicating emotional state matching based on the demonstrators’ behavioral cues and confirming our prediction of negative emotional contagion. We did not find any judgment bias in the positive condition. This result critically expands upon observational studies of contagious play in ravens, providing experimental evidence that emotional contagion is present not only in mammalian but also in avian species. Importantly, this finding also acts as a stepping stone toward understanding the evolution of empathy, as this essential social skill may have emerged across these taxa in response to similar socioecological challenges.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 86, 'citationCount': 36, 'authors': [{'authorId': '117783530', 'name': 'J.

We tested whether the sight of a distressed conspecific elicited fear in zebrafish, and whether this was modulated by familiarity. Groups of six zebrafish were housed together in the same tanks for 7 days to create familiar conditions. The behaviour of individual fish was then recorded in paired tanks within sight of either a familiar or an unfamiliar individual, before and after distilled water or an alarm substance was added to the demonstrator, but not to the observer. As expected, addition of distilled water did not elicit any behavioural change in either the demonstrator or the observer. However, addition of an alarm cue triggered anti-predatory behaviours in the demonstrator which caused the expression of anti-predatory behaviours in the observer, suggesting the existence of fear contagion. Furthermore, the extent of fear contagion was affected by familiarity, and observers were more active, swam closer to the bottom and further away from the demonstrator when they watched a distressed familiar neighbour than when they watched an unfamiliar fish. Our results have implications for fish welfare because they show that fish can become stressed by simply watching others become stressed.

We propose that individuals have influence if their actions result in some behavioural change among their group-mates, and are leaders if they consistently influence others. We highlight three components of influence (influence instances, total influence and consistency of influence), which can be assessed at two levels (individual-to-individual and individual-to-group). We then review different methods, ranging from individual positioning within groups to information-theoretic approaches, by which influence has been operationally defined in empirical studies, as well as how such observations can be aggregated to give insight into the underlying decision-making process.

We show that shoals of zebrafish (Danio rerio) visually exposed to a predator display antipredator behaviors. In addition, these defensive maneuvers trigger antipredator reactions in conspecifics and, concomitantly, stimulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis, leading to cortisol increase.

In the technical literature of coupled dynamical systems, several methods have been proposed to reconstruct interaction networks, including linear correlation analysis, transfer entropy, and event synchronization. While these analyses have been helpful in reconstructing network models from neuroscience to public health, rules on the most appropriate method to use for a specific dataset are lacking. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of detecting leaders in a group from raw positional data in a model-free approach that combines multiple methods in a maximum likelihood sense. We test our framework on synthetic data of groups of self-propelled Vicsek particles, where a single agent acts as a leader and both the size of the interaction region and the level of inherent noise are systematically varied. To assess the feasibility of detecting leaders in real-world applications, we study a synthetic dataset of fish shoaling, generated by using a recent data-driven model for social behavior, and an experimental dataset of pharmacologically-treated zebrafish.

We asked if a comparable phenomenon exists in zebrafish (Danio rerio) that live in shoals in the wild. In the first experiment, we observed that most quantifiable parameters of swimming behavior were similar when zerbafish swam alone or with companions. However, after exposure to an alarm substance (Schreckstoff), individuals recovering alone continued to display behaviors associated with fear after removal of the stimulus, while those recovering with companions did not. In the next two experiments, we examined the role of familiarity of companions. Subjects spent more time in the vicinity of familiar companions in a two-choice assay. While both familiar and unfamiliar companions reduced behavioral signs of distress, familiar companions additionally modulated cortisol and endogenous isotocin in subjects. Shortly after being united with familiar companions, isotocin spiked followed by a dampening of circulating cortisol levels. These results suggest that zebrafish experience fear attenuation in the presence of others and familiar companions are more effective at buffering the stress associated with escaping predation. Changes in behavior, circulating cortisol and isotocin levels due to social partners are reminiscent of changes due to amelioration of fear in some mammalian species in the presence of companions.

In the past 2 decades, the zebrafish (Danio rerio; Cyprinidae) has emerged as a versatile, reliable vertebrate model organism for the in vivo study of development, gene function, and numerous aspects of human pathologies. Small size, high fecundity, rapid external development, transparency, genetic tractability, and high genetic and physiologic homology with humans are among the factors that have contributed to the success with this small fish in different biomedical research areas. Recent findings indicate that, despite the anatomical differences in the brain structure of teleosts and tetrapods, fish possess a structure homologous to the mammalian amygdala, a hypothesis that is supported by the expression of molecular markers, analyses of neuronal projections in different brain areas, and behavioral studies.

Detecting and classifying leader-follower relationships is central to elucidate the behavioral and physiological causes of leadership and understand its consequences. Here, we demonstrate an information-theoretic approach to infer leadership from positional data of fish swimming. In this framework, we measure social interactions between fish pairs through the mathematical construct of transfer entropy, which quantifies the predictive power of a time series to anticipate another, possibly coupled, time series. We focus on the zebrafish model organism, which is rapidly emerging as a species of choice in preclinical research for its genetic similarity to humans and reduced neurobiological complexity with respect to mammals. To overcome experimental confounds and generate test data sets on which we can thoroughly assess our approach, we adapt and calibrate a data-driven stochastic model of zebrafish motion for the simulation of a coupled dynamical system of zebrafish pairs. In this synthetic data set, the extent and direction of the coupling between the fish are systematically varied across a wide parameter range to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of transfer entropy in inferring leadership.

Here, we tested whether body (play bow, PBOW) and facial (relaxed open-mouth, ROM) rapid mimicry is present in domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) during dyadic intraspecific play. During their free playful interactions, dogs showed a stronger and rapid mimicry response (less than 1\u2009s) after perceiving PBOW and ROM (two signals typical of play in dogs) than after perceiving JUMP and BITE (two play patterns resembling PBOW and ROM in motor performance). Playful sessions punctuated by rapid mimicry lasted longer that those sessions punctuated only by signals. Moreover, the distribution of rapid mimicry was strongly affected by the familiarity linking the subjects involved: the stronger the social bonding, the higher the level of rapid mimicry.

Results were also frequently misinterpreted and not replicable, so claims that fish feel pain remain unsubstantiated. Comparable problems exist in studies of invertebrates. In contrast, an extensive literature involving surgeries with fishes shows normal feeding and activity immediately or soon after surgery. C fiber nociceptors, the most prevalent type in mammals and responsible for excruciating pain in humans, are rare in teleosts and absent in elasmobranchs studied to date. A-delta nociceptors, not yet found in elasmobranchs, but relatively common in teleosts, likely serve rapid, less noxious injury signaling, triggering escape and avoidance responses. Clearly, fishes have survived well without the full range of nociception typical of humans or other mammals, a circumstance according well with the absence of the specialized cortical regions necessary for pain in humans. We evaluate recent claims for consciousness in fishes, but find these claims lack adequate supporting evidence, neurological feasibility, or the likelihood that consciousness would be adaptive. Even if fishes were conscious, it is unwarranted to assume that they possess a human-like capacity for pain.

Physiological similarity to mammals, ease of genetic manipulations, sensitivity to pharmacological and genetic factors, robust behavior, low cost, and potential for high-throughput screening contribute to the growing utility of zebrafish models in this field. Understanding zebrafish behavioral phenotypes provides important insights into neural pathways, physiological biomarkers, and genetic underpinnings of normal and pathological brain function. Novel zebrafish paradigms continue to appear with an encouraging pace, thus necessitating a consistent terminology and improved understanding of the behavioral repertoire. What can zebrafish 'do', and how does their altered brain function translate into behavioral actions? To help address these questions, we have developed a detailed catalog of zebrafish behaviors (Zebrafish Behavior Catalog, ZBC) that covers both larval and adult models. Representing a beginning of creating a more comprehensive ethogram of zebrafish behavior, this effort will improve interpretation of published findings, foster cross-species behavioral modeling, and encourage new groups to apply zebrafish neurobehavioral paradigms in their research. In addition, this glossary creates a framework for developing a zebrafish neurobehavioral ontology, ultimately to become part of a unified animal neurobehavioral ontology, which collectively will contribute to better integration of biological data within and across species."", 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 187, 'citationCount': 758, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1851740', 'name': 'A.

Zebrafish are now gaining popularity in genetics, pharmacological and behavioural research. As a vertebrate, zebrafish share considerable genetic sequence similarity with humans and are being used as an animal model for various human disease conditions. The advantages of zebrafish in comparison to other common vertebrate models include high fecundity, low maintenance cost, transparent embryos, and rapid development. Due to the spur of interest in zebrafish research, the need to establish and maintain a productive zebrafish housing facility is also increasing. Although literature is available for the maintenance of a zebrafish laboratory, a concise video protocol is lacking. This video illustrates the protocol for regular housing, feeding, breeding and raising of zebrafish larvae. This process will help researchers to understand the natural behaviour and optimal conditions of zebrafish husbandry and hence troubleshoot experimental issues that originate from the fish husbandry conditions. This protocol will be of immense help to researchers planning to establish a zebrafish laboratory, and also to graduate students who are intending to use zebrafish as an animal model.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 13, 'citationCount': 251, 'authors': [{'authorId': '6075102', 'name': 'Avdesh Avdesh'}, {'authorId': '48622881', 'name': 'Mengqi Chen'}, {'authorId': '1398908353', 'name': 'M.

For example, groups of fish can either be ‘shoals’ or ‘schools’: shoals are simply aggregations of individuals; schools are shoals exhibiting polarized, synchronized motion. Here we demonstrate that polarization distributions of groups of zebrafish (Danio rerio) are bimodal, showing two distinct modes of collective motion corresponding to the definitions of shoaling and schooling. Other features of the group's motion also vary consistently between the two modes: zebrafish schools are faster and less dense than zebrafish shoals. Habituation to an environment can also alter the proportion of time zebrafish groups spend schooling or shoaling. Models of collective motion suggest that the degree and stability of group polarization increases with the group's density. Examining zebrafish groups of different sizes from 5 to 50, we show that larger groups are less polarized than smaller groups. Decreased fearfulness in larger groups may function similarly to habituation, causing them to spend more time shoaling than schooling, contrary to most models' predictions."", 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 186, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2051997', 'name': 'Noam Y.

However, recent reports suggest they may have a much earlier therapeutic onset. A reduction in amygdala responsivity has been implicated in the therapeutic action of SSRIs. Aims To investigate the effect of a single dose of an SSRI on the amygdala response to emotional faces. Method Twenty-six healthy volunteers were randomised to receive a single oral dose of citalopram (20 mg) or placebo. Effects on the processing of facial expressions were assessed 3 h later using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results Volunteers treated with citalopram displayed a significantly reduced amygdala response to fearful facial expressions compared with placebo.

In recent years social neuroscience made considerable progress in revealing the mechanisms that enable a person to feel what another is feeling. The present review provides an in‐depth and critical discussion of these findings. Consistent evidence shows that sharing the emotions of others is associated with activation in neural structures that are also active during the first‐hand experience of that emotion. Part of the neural activation shared between self‐ and other‐related experiences seems to be rather automatically activated. However, recent studies also show that empathy is a highly flexible phenomenon, and that vicarious responses are malleable with respect to a number of factors—such as contextual appraisal, the interpersonal relationship between empathizer and other, or the perspective adopted during observation of the other. Future investigations are needed to provide more detailed insights into these factors and their neural underpinnings. Questions such as whether individual differences in empathy can be explained by stable personality traits, whether we can train ourselves to be more empathic, and how empathy relates to prosocial behavior are of utmost relevance for both science and society.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 111, 'citationCount': 1930, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47272511', 'name': 'T.

The results showed that about one‐third of mouth motor neurons also discharge when the monkey observes another individual performing mouth actions. The majority of these ‘mouth mirror neurons’ become active during the execution and observation of mouth actions related to ingestive functions such as grasping, sucking or breaking food. Another population of mouth mirror neurons also discharges during the execution of ingestive actions, but the most effective visual stimuli in triggering them are communicative mouth gestures (e.g. lip smacking).

Whereas specific features of aggregations are often visually striking to human eyes, a heuristic analysis based on human vision is usually not sufficient to answer fundamental questions about how and why organisms aggregate. What are the individual-level behavioral traits that give rise to these features? When qualitatively similar spatial patterns arise from purely physical mechanisms, are these patterns in organisms biologically significant, or are they simply epiphenomena that are likely characteristics of any set of interacting autonomous individuals? If specific features of spatial aggregations do confer advantages or disadvantages in the fitness of group members, how has evolution operated to shape individual behavior in balancing costs and benefits at the individual and group levels? Mathematical models of social behaviors such as schooling in fishes provide a promising avenue to address some of these questions. However, the literature on schooling models has lacked a common framework to objectively and quantitatively characterize relationships between individual-level behaviors and group-level patterns. In this paper, we briefly survey similarities and differences in behavioral algorithms and aggregation statistics among existing schooling models.

The detrimental effects of anthropomorphic thinking and the importance of an evolutionary perspective for understanding the neurobehavioral differences between fishes and humans are discussed. The differences in central nervous system structure that underlie basic neurobehavioral differences between fishes and humans are described. The literature on the neural basis of consciousness and of pain is reviewed, showing that: (1) behavioral responses to noxious stimuli are separate from the psychological experience of pain, (2) awareness of pain in humans depends on functions of specific regions of cerebral cortex, and (3) fishes lack these essential brain regions or any functional equivalent, making it untenable that they can experience pain. Because the experience of fear, similar to pain, depends on cerebral cortical structures that are absent from fish brains, it is concluded that awareness of fear is impossible for fishes. Although it is implausible that fishes can experience pain or emotions, they display robust, nonconscious, neuroendocrine, and physiological stress responses to noxious stimuli. Thus, avoidance of potentially injurious stress responses is an important issue in considerations about the welfare of fishes.', 'year': 2002, 'referenceCount': 126, 'citationCount': 428, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145628542', 'name': 'J.

We accordingly think that only the individual bearers of these brains can have emotions. Of course, some of these emotions are directed at the individual’s social concerns. It is also common for individuals to influence each other’s emotions, sometimes in a very rapid and reciprocal manner. But it is commonly presumed that this is as far as we need to go to explain all instances of emotion. On the other hand, there are a range of social phenomena that encourage us to look at things rather differently. As the authors of this volume variously observe, protest movements, religious rituals, joint musical performances, large sporting events, mass celebrations and intractable decades-long conflicts display emotional characteristics that are hard to reduce to the individuals involved. Moreover, participants may well report a sense of being carried away by the mood of the occasion, or the ‘emotional atmosphere’. Perhaps the best way to make sense of these phenomena is to allow for ‘collective emotions’. And if one is willing to admit collective emotions in such large scale cases, one may well return to ordinary interpersonal interactions with a different perspective, recognizing that some of these, too, may qualify as cases of collective emotion. After all, the small group is often capable of more intensive forms of interaction than large scale social movements. Certainly all parties seem to agree that it would not do justice to these phenomena to simply aggregate the set of individual emotions, or even to add the condition that they all focus on the same target.

Behavior was observed in the dive tank for 5 min, immediately followed by 5 min in the light/dark plus maze.

Here, we used a battery of nociceptive behavioral tests to assess sensory alterations in two commonly used mouse models of ASD, BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR), and fragile‐X mental retardation‐1 knockout (Fmr1‐KO) mice. We also asked whether emotional contagion, a primitive form of empathy, was altered in BTBR and Fmr1 KO mice when experiencing pain with a social partner. BTBR mice demonstrated mixed nociceptive responses with hyporesponsivity to mechanical/thermal stimuli and intraplantar injections of formalin and capsaicin while displaying hypersensitivity on the acetic acid test. Fmr1‐KO mice were hyposensitive to mechanical stimuli and intraplantar injections of capsaicin and formalin. BTBR and Fmr1‐KO mice developed significantly less mechanical allodynia following intraplantar injections of complete Freund's adjuvant, while BTBR mice developed slightly more thermal hyperalgesia. Finally, as measured by the formalin and acetic acid writhing tests, BTBR and Fmr1‐KO mice did not show emotional contagion of pain.

Neurons in a brain region called the anterior cingulate cortex in the bystander animal mediate these transfers. However, the specific anterior cingulate projections involved in such empathy-related behaviors are unknown. Smith et al. found that projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to the nucleus accumbens are necessary for the social transfer of pain in mice (see the Perspective by Klein and Gogolla). Fear, however, was mediated by projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to the basolateral amygdala. Interestingly, in animals with pain, analgesia can also be transferred socially. Science, this issue p. 153; see also p. 122 In mice, distinct neuronal circuits are involved in empathy for companion animals who are observed to be experiencing pain or pain relief versus fear. INTRODUCTION Empathy, the adoption of another’s sensory and emotional state, plays a critical role in social interactions. Although, historically, empathy was often considered to be an affective-cognitive process experienced solely by humans, it is now appreciated that many species, including rodents, display evolutionarily conserved behavioral antecedents of empathy such as observational fear. It is therefore possible to begin to define the neural mechanisms that mediate behavioral manifestations of empathy in species that are optimal for application of modern circuit neuroscience tools. RATIONALE In both humans and rodents, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) appears to encode information about the affective state of others. However, little is known about which downstream targets of the ACC contribute to empathy-related behaviors. To address this topic, we optimized a protocol for the social transfer of pain behavior in mice and compared the ACC-dependent neural circuitry responsible for this behavior with the ACC neural circuitry required for the social transfer of two related behavioral states: analgesia and fear. These behaviors exhibit a key component of empathy, the adoption of another’s sensory and affective state. RESULTS A 1-hour social interaction between a bystander mouse and a cagemate experiencing inflammatory pain led to mechanical hyperalgesia in the bystander mouse, which lasted 4 hours but not 24 hours. This social transfer of pain was also evident after thermal testing and led to affective changes that were detected by a conspecific. The social interaction led to activation of neurons in the ACC and several downstream targets, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which was revealed by monosynaptic rabies virus tracing to be directly connected to the ACC. Bidirectional manipulation of activity in ACC-to-NAc inputs influenced the acquisition of socially transferred pain but not the expression of the mechanical sensitivity used to assay pain thresholds. A behavioral protocol revealed the rapid social transfer of analgesia, which also required activity in ACC-to-NAc inputs. By contrast, ACC-to-NAc input activity was not required for the social transfer of fear, which instead required activity in ACC projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). CONCLUSION We established that mice rapidly adopt the sensory-affective state of a social partner, regardless of the valance of the information (that is, pain, fear, or pain relief). We find that the ACC generates specific and appropriate empathic behavioral responses through distinct downstream targets. Specifically, ACC-to-NAc input activity is necessary for the social transfer of pain and analgesia but not the social transfer of fear, which instead requires ACC-to-BLA input activity. Elucidating circuit-specific mechanisms that mediate various forms of empathy in experimentally accessible animal models is necessary for generating hypotheses that can be evaluated in human subjects using noninvasive assays. More sophisticated understanding of evolutionarily conserved brain mechanisms of empathy will also expedite the development of new therapies for the empathy-related deficits associated with a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Distinct ACC neural circuits mediate social transfer of pain states and fear. Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)–induced pain is transferred from cagemates to bystanders after a 1-hour social interaction. Bystanders also exhibit pain relief after interacting with cagemates that are experiencing pain and morphine analgesia. The social transfer of pain and analgesia both require ACC-to-NAc projections, whereas the social transfer of fear requires ACC projections to the BLA. Data represent mean ± SEM; dashed line indicates mean baseline threshold for all groups; **P < 0.01 and ****P < 0.0001. Empathy is an essential component of social communication that involves experiencing others’ sensory and emotional states. We observed that a brief social interaction with a mouse experiencing pain or morphine analgesia resulted in the transfer of these experiences to its social partner. Optogenetic manipulations demonstrated that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and its projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were selectively involved in the social transfer of both pain and analgesia. By contrast, the ACC→NAc circuit was not necessary for the social transfer of fear, which instead depended on ACC projections to the basolateral amygdala. These findings reveal that the ACC, a brain area strongly implicated in human empathic responses, mediates distinct forms of empathy in mice by influencing different downstream targets.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 53, 'citationCount': 108, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48533903', 'name': 'Monique L.

Although TD children showed equal amounts of emotional contagion across conditions, children with ASD were highly influenced by the familiarity of the target stimulus, as well as task instructions that encourage eye gaze to target. More specifically, children with ASD exhibited less contagious yawning and laughter than their TD peers except when their attention was explicitly directed to the eyes or (and even more so) when their parents served as the stimulus targets.

The maternal UBE3A allele is expressed in nearly all neurons of the brain and spinal cord, whereas the paternal UBE3A allele is repressed by an extremely long antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS). Little is known about expression of UBE3A in the peripheral nervous system, where loss of maternal UBE3A might contribute to AS phenotypes. Here we sought to examine maternal and paternal Ube3a expression in DRGs neurons and to evaluate whether nociceptive responses were affected in AS model mice (global deletion of maternal Ube3a allele; Ube3am−/p+). We found that most large-diameter proprioceptive and mechanosensitive DRG neurons expressed maternal Ube3a and paternal Ube3a-ATS. In contrast, most small-diameter neurons expressed Ube3a biallelically and had low to undetectable levels of Ube3a-ATS. Analysis of single-cell DRG transcriptomes further suggested that Ube3a is expressed monoallelically in myelinated large-diameter neurons and biallelically in unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Behavioral responses to some noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli were enhanced in male and female AS model mice; however, nociceptive responses were not altered by the conditional deletion of maternal Ube3a in the DRG. These data suggest that the enhanced nociceptive responses in AS model mice are due to loss of maternal Ube3a in the central, but not peripheral, nervous system. Our study provides new insights into sensory processing deficits associated with AS. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss or mutation of the maternal UBE3A allele. While sensory processing deficits are frequently associated with AS, it is currently unknown whether Ube3a is expressed in peripheral sensory neurons or whether maternal deletion of Ube3a affects somatosensory responses. Here, we found that Ube3a is primarily expressed from the maternally inherited allele in myelinated large-diameter sensory neurons and biallelically expressed in unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Nociceptive responses to select noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli were enhanced following global, but not sensory neuron-specific, deletion of maternal Ube3a in mice.

Using rats with disrupted methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) expression characteristic of Rett syndrome, we found that MeCP2 deficiency in sensory neurons led to augmented pressure and cold sensitivity but hyposensitivity to heat, accompanied by respective changes in cutaneous innervation. Transcriptome analysis of MeCP2-deficient ganglia showed up-regulation of genes associated with actin cytoskeletal dynamics and adhesion formation; down-regulating key genes in vivo normalized both mechanical sensitivity and innervation density. These findings provide evidence that ganglion cytoskeletal genes play key roles in determining mechanosensory properties, which may contribute to altered pain sensitivity in Rett syndrome and other painful conditions. Children with Rett syndrome show abnormal cutaneous sensitivity. The precise nature of sensory abnormalities and underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Rats with methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) mutation, characteristic of Rett syndrome, show hypersensitivity to pressure and cold, but hyposensitivity to heat. They also show cutaneous hyperinnervation by nonpeptidergic sensory axons, which include subpopulations encoding noxious mechanical and cold stimuli, whereas peptidergic thermosensory innervation is reduced. MeCP2 knockdown confined to dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons replicated this phenotype in vivo, and cultured MeCP2-deficient ganglion neurons showed augmented axonogenesis. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes associated with cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly those controlling actin polymerization and focal-adhesion formation necessary for axon growth and mechanosensory transduction. Down-regulation of these genes by topoisomerase inhibition prevented abnormal axon sprouting. We identified eight key affected genes controlling actin signaling and adhesion formation, including members of the Arhgap, Tiam, and cadherin families. Simultaneous virally mediated knockdown of these genes in Rett rats prevented sensory hyperinnervation and reversed mechanical hypersensitivity, indicating a causal role in abnormal outgrowth and sensitivity. Thus, MeCP2 regulates ganglion neuronal genes controlling cytoskeletal dynamics, which in turn determines axon outgrowth and mechanosensory function and may contribute to altered pain sensitivity in Rett syndrome.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 73, 'citationCount': 37, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5582941', 'name': 'A.

In mouse models of ASDs, there is mounting evidence of neuronal and circuit hyperexcitability in several brain regions, which could contribute to sensory hypersensitivity. However, it is not yet known whether or how sensory stimulation might trigger abnormal sensory processing at the circuit level or abnormal behavioral responses in ASD mouse models, especially during an early developmental time when experience-dependent plasticity shapes such circuits. Using a novel assay, we discovered exaggerated motor responses to whisker stimulation in young Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice (postnatal days 14–16), a model of FXS. Adult Fmr1 KO mice actively avoided a stimulus that was innocuous to wild-type controls, a sign of tactile defensiveness. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons expressing GCaMP6s, we found no differences between wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice in overall whisker-evoked activity, though 45% fewer neurons in young Fmr1 KO mice responded in a time-locked manner. Notably, we identified a pronounced deficit in neuronal adaptation to repetitive whisker stimulation in both young and adult Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, impaired adaptation in cortical sensory circuits is a potential cause of tactile defensiveness in autism. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We use a novel paradigm of repetitive whisker stimulation and in vivo calcium imaging to assess tactile defensiveness and barrel cortex activity in young and adult Fmr1 knock-out mice, the mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS). We describe evidence of tactile defensiveness, as well as a lack of L2/3 neuronal adaptation in barrel cortex, during whisker stimulation. We propose that a defect in sensory adaptation within local neuronal networks, beginning at a young age and continuing into adulthood, likely contributes to sensory overreactivity in FXS and perhaps other ASDs.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 62, 'citationCount': 84, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2140210077', 'name': 'Cynthia X.

Evidence suggests that features of autism are not restricted to individuals with ASD, and that autistic traits vary throughout the general population. To investigate the association between autistic traits and the responses to others’ pain in typically developing adults, we employed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) to quantify autistic traits in a group of 1670 healthy adults and explored whether 60 participants (30 males and 30 females) with 10% highest AQ scores (High-AQ) would exhibit difficulties in the responses to others’ pain relative to 60 participants (30 males and 30 females) with 10% lowest AQ scores (Low-AQ). This study included a Visual Task and an Auditory Task to test behavioral differences between High-AQ and Low-AQ groups’ responses to others’ pain in both modalities. For the Visual Task, participants were instructed to respond to pictures depicting others’ pain. They were instructed to judge the stimuli type (painful or not), judge others’ pain intensity, and indicate the unpleasantness they personally felt. For the Auditory Task, experimental procedures were identical to the Visual Task except that painful voices were added. Results showed the High-AQ group was less accurate than the Low-AQ group in judging others’ pain. Moreover, relative to Low-AQ males, High-AQ males had significantly longer reaction times in judging others’ pain in the Auditory Task.

In this study, we found that serotonin tissue content and the density of serotonin axons is reduced in the hippocampus of BTBR mice in comparison to C57BL/6J (C57) mice. This was accompanied by possible compensatory changes in serotonin neurons that were most pronounced in regions known to provide innervation to the hippocampus: the caudal dorsal raphe (B6) and the median raphe. These changes included increased numbers of serotonin neurons and hyperactivation of Fos expression. Metrics of serotonin neurons in the rostral 2/3 of the dorsal raphe and serotonin content of the prefrontal cortex were less impacted.

Increased phosphorylation of eIF2α has been described in peripheral neurons from neuropathic and diabetic rats. However, the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in pain has not been reported. Here we show that phosphorylation of eIF2α controls thermal, but not mechanical, sensation via modulation of the activity of a major heat transducer, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. We also find that chronic inflammation-induced eIF2α phopshorylation contributes to inflammation-induced thermal hypersensitivity. These results demonstrate that eIF2α phosphorylation plays a major role in controlling noxious heat sensitivity. A response to environmental stress is critical to alleviate cellular injury and maintain cellular homeostasis. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a key integrator of cellular stress responses and an important regulator of mRNA translation. Diverse stress signals lead to the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 (Ser51), resulting in inhibition of global protein synthesis while promoting expression of proteins that mediate cell adaptation to stress. Here we report that eIF2α is instrumental in the control of noxious heat sensation. Mice with decreased eIF2α phosphorylation (eIF2α+/S51A) exhibit reduced responses to noxious heat. Pharmacological attenuation of eIF2α phosphorylation decreases thermal, but not mechanical, pain sensitivity, whereas increasing eIF2α phosphorylation has the opposite effect on thermal nociception. The impact of eIF2α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) on thermal thresholds is dependent on the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. Moreover, we show that induction of eIF2α phosphorylation in primary sensory neurons in a chronic inflammation pain model contributes to thermal hypersensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the cellular stress response pathway, mediated via p-eIF2α, represents a mechanism that could be used to alleviate pathological heat sensation.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 32, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5757262', 'name': 'A.

We have previously developed an observational fear learning (OFL) behavioral assay to measure empathic fear in mice. In the OFL task, a mouse is conditioned for context‐dependent fear when it observes a conspecific demonstrator receiving aversive stimuli. In the present study, by comparing 11 different inbred mouse strains that are commonly used in the laboratory, we found that empathic fear response was highly variable between different strains. Five strains – C57BL/6J, C57BL/6NTac, 129S1/SvImJ, 129S4/SvJae and BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J – showed observational fear (OF) responses, whereas AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ and NOD/ShiLtJ mice exhibited low empathic fear response. Importantly, day 2 OF memory was significantly correlated with contextual memory in the classical fear conditioning among the 11 strains. Innate differences in anxiety, locomotor activity, sociability and preference for social novelty were not significantly correlated with OFL. Interestingly, early adolescent C57BL/6J mice exhibited an increase in acquisition of OF. The level of OFL in C57BL/6J strain was not affected by sex or strains of the demonstrator. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that there are naturally occurring OFL‐specific genetic variations modulating empathic fear behaviors in mice. The identification of causal genes may uncover novel genetic pathways and underlying neural mechanisms that modulate empathic fear and, ultimately, provide new targets for therapeutic intervention in human mental disorders associated with impaired empathy.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 52, 'citationCount': 71, 'authors': [{'authorId': '112991589', 'name': 'S.

Prior studies have demonstrated that the black and tan, brachyury (BTBR) T+ Itpr3tf/J mouse strain displays a behavioral phenotype with ASD-like features. BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J mice (referred to simply as BTBR) display deficits in social functioning, lack of communication ability, and engagement in stereotyped behavior. Despite extensive behavioral phenotypic characterization, little is known about the genes and proteins responsible for the presentation of the ASD-like phenotype in the BTBR mouse model. In this study, we employed bioinformatics techniques to gain a wide-scale understanding of the transcriptomic and proteomic changes associated with the ASD-like phenotype in BTBR mice. We found a number of genes and proteins to be significantly altered in BTBR mice compared to C57BL/6J (B6) control mice controls such as BDNF, Shank3, and ERK1, which are highly relevant to prior investigations of ASD. Furthermore, we identified distinct functional pathways altered in BTBR mice compared to B6 controls that have been previously shown to be altered in both mouse models of ASD, some human clinical populations, and have been suggested as a possible etiological mechanism of ASD, including “axon guidance” and “regulation of actin cytoskeleton.” In addition, our wide-scale bioinformatics approach also discovered several previously unidentified genes and proteins associated with the ASD phenotype in BTBR mice, such as Caskin1, suggesting that bioinformatics could be an avenue by which novel therapeutic targets for ASD are uncovered.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted to provide an accurate prevalence estimate for this disorder using primary publications in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library. Data were pooled using Bayesian fixed‐effects and random‐effects models. Primary analyses assessed the frequency of the full mutation and premutation in males and females in the total population (no bias against individuals with intellectual disability) and in female carriers of the premutation in normal populations (biased against individuals with intellectual disability), based on diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction or Southern blotting. A sensitivity analysis included studies using any diagnostic testing method and conference abstracts. Sixty‐eight recorded observations provided data for the primary (56 observations) and sensitivity (12 observations) analysis. Using the random‐effects model, frequency of the full mutation was 1.4 (95% CI: 0.1–3.1) per 10,000 males and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.0–2.9) per 10,000 females (1:7,143 and 1:11,111, respectively) in the total population. The premutation frequency was 11.7 (95% CI: 6.0–18.7) per 10,000 males and 34.4 (95% CI: 6.3–83.3) per 10,000 for females (1:855 and 1:291, respectively) in the total population. The prevalence of female carriers of the premutation in the normal population was 34.4 (95% CI: 8.9–60.3) per 10,000, or 1:291. Sensitivity analyses resulted in similar prevalence estimates but with wider heterogeneity.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of research investigating GI symptoms among children with ASD. METHODS: We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases (1980–2012) in peer-reviewed journals. Analysis involved studies with a comparison group presenting quantitative data on GI symptoms using combinations of terms for ASD and GI indicators. The systematic search yielded 15 studies. We calculated effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Children with ASD experience significantly more general GI symptoms than comparison groups, with a standardized mean difference of 0.82 (0.24) and a corresponding odds ratio (OR) of 4.42 (95% CI, 1.90–10.28). Analysis also indicated higher rates of diarrhea (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.82–7.23), constipation (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 2.23–6.71), and abdominal pain (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.19–5.07). CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate greater prevalence of GI symptoms among children with ASD compared with control children. Identified studies involved high methodological variability and lack of comprehensive data prohibited analysis of GI pathophysiologies (eg, gastroesophageal reflux) typically associated with organic etiologies, limiting conclusions about the underpinnings of the observed association. Future research must address critical questions about the causes and long-term impact of GI symptoms in ASD. Such analyses will require more systematic research and clinical activities, including improved diagnostic screening, standardized assessment, and exploration of potential moderators (eg, dietary restrictions).', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 69, 'citationCount': 561, 'authors': [{'authorId': '10188565', 'name': 'B.

To determine whether an abnormal immune profile was present at a cellular level that may predispose female carriers to autoinflammatory conditions, we investigated dynamic cytokine production following stimulation of blood cells. In addition, splenocyte responses were examined in an FMR1 CGG knock-in mouse model of the fragile X premutation. Methods Human monocyte and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were isolated from the blood of 36 female FMR1 premutation carriers and 15 age-matched controls. Cells were cultured with media alone, LPS or PHA. In the animal model, splenocytes were isolated from 32 CGG knock-in mice and 32 wild type littermates. Splenocytes were cultured with media alone or LPS or PMA/Ionomycin. Concentrations of cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IFNγ, TNFα, and MCP-1) were determined from the supernatants of cellular cultures via Luminex multiplex assay. Additionally, phenotypic cellular markers were assessed on cells isolated from human subjects via flow cytometry. Results We found decreases in cytokine production in human premutation carriers as well as in the FMR1 knock-in mice when compared with controls. Levels of cytokines were found to be associated with CGG repeat length in both human and mouse. Furthermore, T cells from human premutation carriers showed decreases in cell surface markers of activation when compared with controls. Conclusions In this study, FMR1 CGG repeat expansions are associated with decreased immune responses and immune dysregulation in both humans and mice. Deficits in immune responses in female premutation carriers may lead to increased susceptibility to autoimmunity and further research is warranted to determine the link between FMR1 CGG repeat lengths and onset of autoinflammatory conditions.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 37, 'citationCount': 23, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3944905', 'name': 'M.

The aim of the present systematic PRIMSA review was twofold: first, to see what evidence there is for the widely held belief that individuals with ASD are insensitive to pain or have a high pain threshold in the peer-reviewed literature and, second, to examine whether individuals with ASD react or express pain differently. Fifteen studies investigating pain in individuals with ASD were identified. The case studies all reported pain insensitivity in individuals with ASD. However, the majority of the ten experimental studies reviewed indicate that the idea that individuals with ASD are pain insensitive needs to be challenged. The findings also highlight the strong possibility that not all children with ASD express their physical discomfort in the same way as a neurotypical child would (i.e., cry, moan, seek comfort, etc.) which may lead caregivers and the medical profession to interpret this as pain insensitivity or incorrectly lead them to believe that the child is in no pain.

Autism frequently presents with additional cognitive symptoms, including attentional deficits and intellectual disability. Preclinical models are important tools for studying the behavioral domains and biological underpinnings of autism, and potential treatment targets. The inbred BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mouse strain has been used as an animal model of core behavioral deficits in autism. BTBR mice exhibit repetitive behaviors and deficits in sociability and communication, but other aspects of their cognitive phenotype, including attentional performance, are not well characterized. We examined the attentional abilities of BTBR mice in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) using an automated touchscreen testing apparatus. The 5-CSRTT is an analogue of the human continuous performance task of attention, and so both the task and apparatus have translational relevance to human touchscreen cognitive testing. We also measured basal extracellular levels of a panel of neurotransmitters within the medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region critically important for performing the 5-CSRTT. We found that BTBR mice have increased impulsivity, defined as an inability to withhold responding, and decreased motivation, as compared to C57Bl/6J mice. Both of these features characterize attentional deficit disorders in humans. BTBR mice also display decreased accuracy in detecting short stimuli, lower basal levels of extracellular acetylcholine and higher levels of kynurenic acid within the prefrontal cortex. Intact cholinergic transmission in prefrontal cortex is required for accurate performance of the 5-CSRTT, consequently this cholinergic deficit may underlie less accurate performance in BTBR mice. Based on our findings that BTBR mice have attentional impairments and alterations in a key neural substrate of attention, we propose that they may be valuable for studying mechanisms for treatment of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with attention deficits and autism.', 'year': 2013, 'referenceCount': 75, 'citationCount': 103, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35028454', 'name': 'S.

Moreover, individuals affected by ID disorders may initiate self-injurious behaviour to address irritating or painful sensations. In normal individuals, a negative feedback loop decreases sensation of pain, which involves descending inhibitory neurons in the CNS that attenuate spinal nociceptive processing. If spinal nociceptive signalling is impaired in these developmental disorders, an exaggerated painful stimulus may be required in order to engage descending anti-nociceptive signals.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing electronic databases, we conducted a review of publications regarding the incidence of chronic pain or altered pain sensation in ID patients or corresponding preclinical models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere is a body of evidence indicating that individuals with fragile X mental retardation and/or Rett syndrome have altered pain sensation. These findings in humans are supported by mechanistic studies using genetically modified mice harbouring mutations consistent with the human disease. Thus, once self-injurious behaviour is initiated, the signal to stop may be missing. Several developmental disorders that cause ID are associated with increased incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can cause severe visceral pain. Individuals affected by these disorders who also have GERD may self-injure as a mechanism to engage descending inhibitory circuits to quell visceral pain. In keeping with this hypothesis, pharmacological treatment of GERD has been shown to be effective for reducing self-injurious behaviour in some patients. Hence, multiple lines of evidence suggest aberrant nociceptive processing in developmental disorders that cause ID.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is evidence that pain pathways and pain amplification mechanisms are altered in several preclinical models of developmental disorders that cause ID. We present hypotheses regarding how impaired pain pathways or chronic pain might contribute to self-injurious behaviour. Studies evaluating the relationship between pain and self-injurious behaviour will provide better understanding of the mechanisms underlying self-injurious behaviour in the ID population and may lead to more effective treatments.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 94, 'citationCount': 52, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40380308', 'name': 'K.

We have analyzed the functional impact caused by two inherited and one de novo SHANK2 mutations from ASD individuals (L1008_P1009dup, T1127M, R462X). Although all three variants affect spine volume and have smaller SHANK2 cluster sizes, T1127M additionally fails to rescue spine volume in Shank2 knock-down neurons. R462X is not able to rescue spine volume and dendritic branching and lacks postsynaptic clustering, indicating the most severe dysfunction. To demonstrate that R462X when expressed in mouse can be linked to physiological effects, we analyzed synaptic transmission and behavior. Principal neurons of mice expressing rAAV-transduced SHANK2-R462X present a specific, long-lasting reduction in miniature postsynaptic AMPA receptor currents.

In addition to cognitive impairment, patients may exhibit hyperactivity, attention deficits, social difficulties and anxiety, and autistic‐like behaviors. The degree to which patients display these behaviors varies considerably and is influenced by family history, suggesting that genetic modifiers play a role in the expression of behaviors in FXS. Several studies have examined behavior in a mouse model of FXS in which the Fmr1 gene has been ablated. Most of those studies were done in Fmr1 knockout mice on a pure C57BL/6 or FVB strain background. To gain a better understanding of the effects of genetic background on behaviors resulting from the loss of Fmr1 gene expression, we generated F1 hybrid lines from female Fmr1 heterozygous mice on a pure C57BL/6J background bred with male Fmr1 wild‐type (WT) mice of various background strains (A/J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, 129S1/SvImJ and CD‐1). Male Fmr1 knockout and WT littermates from each line were examined in an extensive behavioral test battery.

This study investigated the nature and prevalence of atypical pain responses in Rett syndrome and their relationships with specific MECP2 mutations. Families enrolled in the Australian Rett Syndrome Database (ARSD) and InterRett database participated in this study. Cases with a known MECP2 pathogenic mutation, whose families had completed a questionnaire on registration and had answered questions on pain sensitivity were included (n\u2009=\u2009646). Logistic regression was used to analyze relationships between the atypical pain responses and genotype. Descriptions of decreased pain sensitivity were content analyzed. The prevalence estimate of reporting an abnormal pain response was 75.2% and a decreased sensitivity to pain was 65.0% in the population‐based ARSD. Families of ARSD and InterRett subjects with a C‐terminal (OR 2.6; 95% CI 0.8–8.0), p.R168X (OR 2.1; 95% CI 0.7–6.1), or p.R306C (OR 2.7; 95% CI 0.8–9.6) mutation were more likely to report decreased sensitivity to pain. Parents and carers described decreased and delayed responses in situations judged likely to cause pain such as injections, falls, trauma, and burns. This study has provided the first precise estimate of the prevalence of abnormal sensitivity to pain in Rett syndrome but specific relationships with genotype are not yet clear. Clinical practice should include a low threshold for the clinical assessment of potential injuries in Rett syndrome. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 41, 'citationCount': 89, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145055084', 'name': 'J.

It is argued that a formulation of pain that explicitly focuses upon social factors would more readily address human needs than models that focus upon biophysical and/or psychological factors alone (intrapersonal processes).

We report that transiently decreased amygdala Mecp2 expression during a sensitive period of brain sexual differentiation disrupts the organization of sex differences in juvenile social play behavior. Interestingly, neonatal treatment with Mecp2 small interfering RNA within the developing amygdala reduced juvenile social play behavior in males but not females. Reduced Mecp2 expression did not change juvenile sociability or anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that this disruption is associated with subtle behavioral modification.

A prominent feature of the human disorder is self-injurious behavior, suggesting an abnormality in pain processing. Moreover, FMRP regulates group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1/5)-dependent plasticity, which is known to contribute to nociceptive sensitization. We demonstrate here, using the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse, that FMRP plays an important role in pain processing because Fmr1 KO mice showed (1) decreased (∼50%) responses to ongoing nociception (phase 2, formalin test), (2) a 3 week delay in the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced allodynia, and (3) a near absence of wind-up responses in ascending sensory fibers after repetitive C-fiber stimulation. We provide evidence that the behavioral deficits are related to a mGluR1/5- and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated mechanism because (1) spinal mGluR5 antagonism failed to inhibit the second phase of the formalin test, and we observed a marked reduction in nociceptive response to an intrathecal injection of an mGluR1/5 agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in Fmr1 KO mice; (2) peripheral DHPG injection had no effect in KO mice yet evoked thermal hyperalgesia in wild types; and (3) the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin inhibited formalin- and DHPG-induced nociception in wild-type but not Fmr1 KO mice. These experiments show that translation regulation via FMRP and mTOR is an important feature of nociceptive plasticity. These observations also support the hypothesis that the persistence of self-injurious behavior observed in fragile X mental retardation patients could be related to deficits in nociceptive sensitization.', 'year': 2007, 'referenceCount': 75, 'citationCount': 195, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144336540', 'name': 'Theodore John Price'}, {'authorId': '14312957', 'name': 'M.

Their presence was highlighted both in early accounts of autism and in more recent first-person descriptions. There is a widespread belief that sensory symptoms characterize autism and differentiate it from other disorders. This paper examines the empirical evidence for this assumption.\n\n\nMETHOD\nAll controlled experimental laboratory investigations published since 1960 were identified through systematic searches using Medline/PubMed and PsycInfo search engines. A total of 48 empirical papers and 27 theoretical or conceptual papers were reviewed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSensory symptoms are more frequent and prominent in children with autism than in typically developing children, but there is not good evidence that these symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Certain groups, including children with fragile X syndrome and those who are deaf-blind, appear to demonstrate higher rates of sensory symptoms than children with autism. In reviewing the evidence relevant to two theories of sensory dysfunction in autism, over- and under-arousal theory, we find that there is very little support for hyper-arousal and failure of habituation in autism. There is more evidence that children with autism, as a group, are hypo-responsive to sensory stimuli, but there are also multiple failures to replicate findings and studies that demonstrate lack of group differences.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of different methods, the study of different sensory modalities, and the changing scientific standards across decades complicate interpretation of this body of work.

We demonstrate that FMR1 knock-out mice show a defect in trace fear memory without changes in locomotion, anxiety, and pain sensitivity. Whole-cell path-clamp recordings in the ACC show that long-term potentiation (LTP) was completely abolished. A similar decrease in LTP was found in the lateral amygdala, another structure implicated in fear memory. No significant changes were found in basal synaptic transmission.

In 26 the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of 27 COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. 28 Methods : Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based 29 analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal 30 trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core 31 discussions were explored measuring tweets' sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound 32 score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large 33 corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features 34 were considered. 35 Results : We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health 36 Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as 37 expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative 38 among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global 39 emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. 40 Conclusions : Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management 41 of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder 42 emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust. There is the need to 43 monitor and sustain healthy behaviors as well as community supports also via social media-based 44 preventive interventions. 45",2021,40,3,,"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

In particular, frustration, loneliness, and worries about the future are common reactions and represent well-known risk factors for several mental disorders, including anxiety, affective, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The vast majority of available studies have been conducted in China, where the pandemic started. Italy has been severely hit by the pandemic, and the socio-cultural context is completely different from Eastern countries. Therefore, there is the need for methodologically rigorous studies aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and quarantine measures on the mental health of the Italian population. In fact, our results will help us to develop appropriate interventions for managing the psychosocial consequences of pandemic. The “COVID-IT-mental health trial” is a no-profit, not-funded, national, multicentric, cross-sectional population-based trial which has the following aims: a) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures on mental health of the Italian population; b) to identify the main areas to be targeted by supportive long-term interventions for the different categories of people exposed to the pandemic. Data will be collected through a web-platform using validated assessment tools. Participants will be subdivided into four groups: a) Group 1—COVID-19 quarantine group. This group includes the general population which are quarantined but not isolated, i.e., those not directly exposed to contagion nor in contact with COVID-19+ individuals; b) Group 2—COVID-19+ group, which includes isolated people directly/indirectly exposed to the virus; c) Group 3—COVID-19 healthcare staff group, which includes first- and second-line healthcare professionals; d) Group 4—COVID-19 mental health, which includes users of mental health services and all those who had already been diagnosed with a mental disorder. Mental health services worldwide are not prepared yet to manage the short- and long-term consequences of the pandemic.

CT-BERT is specifically designed to be used on COVID-19 content, particularly from social media, and can be utilized for various natural language processing tasks such as classification, question-answering, and chatbots. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of CT-BERT on different classification datasets and compare it with BERT-LARGE, its base model. Methods The study utilizes CT-BERT, which is pre-trained on a large corpus of COVID-19 related Twitter messages. The authors evaluated the performance of CT-BERT on five different classification datasets, including one in the target domain. The model's performance is compared to its base model, BERT-LARGE, to measure the marginal improvement. The authors also provide detailed information on the training process and the technical specifications of the model. Results The results indicate that CT-BERT outperforms BERT-LARGE with a marginal improvement of 10-30% on all five classification datasets. The largest improvements are observed in the target domain. The authors provide detailed performance metrics and discuss the significance of these results. Discussion The study demonstrates the potential of pre-trained transformer models, such as CT-BERT, for COVID-19 related natural language processing tasks. The results indicate that CT-BERT can improve the classification performance on COVID-19 related content, especially on social media. These findings have important implications for various applications, such as monitoring public sentiment and developing chatbots to provide COVID-19 related information. The study also highlights the importance of using domain-specific pre-trained models for specific natural language processing tasks.

By following a data-driven approach focusing on User-Generated Content, we aimed to detect potential binge drinkers through the investigation of their language and shared topics. First, we gathered Twitter threads quoting BD and alcohol-related behaviours, by considering unequivocal keywords, identified by experts, from previous evidence on BD. Subsequently, a random sample of the gathered tweets was manually labelled, and two supervised learning classifiers were trained on both linguistic and metadata features, to classify tweets of genuine unique users with respect to media, bot, and commercial accounts. Based on this classification, we observed that approximately 55% of the 1 million alcohol-related collected tweets was automatically identified as belonging to non-genuine users. A third classifier was then trained on a subset of manually labelled tweets among those previously identified as belonging to genuine accounts, to automatically identify potential binge drinkers based only on linguistic features. On average, users classified as binge drinkers were quite similar to the standard genuine Twitter users in our sample.

The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based micro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the emotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social network. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they require massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the individuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional contagion using a random sample of Twitter users, whose activity (and the stimuli they were exposed to) was observed during a week of September 2014. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50% more positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and that of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive emotions.

Yet despite anecdotal reports suggesting that progress has been made, it is unclear whether these investments have left the nation better prepared to respond to a bioterrorist attack, pandemic influenza, or any other large-scale public health emergency. \n \nThis situation is not because of a shortage of measures of preparedness. Over the past 5 years, federal agencies, state health departments, and various nongovernmental organizations have proposed and implemented myriad measures of public health emergency preparedness. But these efforts have not resulted in a clear picture of the nation’s preparedness owing to ambiguous and uncertain preparedness goals, a lack of agreement about what the measures should aim at and how they should be interpreted, and a weak system of accountability for producing results.1 Measures often vary considerably across agencies and shift dramatically from year to year, leaving state and local health officials, businesses, nonprofits, and citizens confused and perplexed by a maze of overlapping and sometimes contradictory requirements, checklists, and ideas about what constitutes preparedness.2–4 \n \nWhat our nation needs in order to bring coherence to the debate is a clear definition of public health emergency preparedness and an articulation of the key elements that characterize a well-prepared community. In this editorial, we propose a candidate definition of public health emergency preparedness and describe its key elements.

The task continues to be very popular, with a total of 48 teams participating this year.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 470, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144063596', 'name': 'Sara Rosenthal'}, {'authorId': '2881964', 'name': 'N.

Comparing to facts that could be labeled as true or false, we are more concerned about contaminative negative emotions transferring digitally among users. In this study, we explored an emotional contagion effect among misinformation discussion participants on Twitter. We analyzed the sentiment of 573 tweets in 192 discussion threads. Our result revealed that highly emotional tweets do not have a universal effect on the online discussions, but it affects those individuals with limited social and personal identity cues (i.e., being anonymous). We found that anonymous members of the online discussion are more susceptible to emotional contagions than those are not. We also suggest coping strategies that protect social media users’ emotional well-being during the era COVID-19. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,0,1,"{'name': '', 'volume':

In the context of therapy for children with socio-emotional impairments, for example autism spectrum conditions, the first approaches have already been successfully evaluated in research. In this context, the robot can be seen as a tool for therapists to foster interaction with the children. To ensure a successful integration of social robots into therapy sessions, an intuitive and comprehensive interface for the therapist is needed to guarantee save and appropriate human-robot interaction. This publication addresses the development of a graphical user interface for robot-assisted therapy to train socio-emotional skills in children on the autism spectrum. The software follows a generic and modular approach. Furthermore, a robotic middleware is used to control the robot and the user interface is based on a local web application. During therapy sessions, the therapist interface is used to control the robot’s reactions and provides additional information from emotion and arousal recognition software. The approach is implemented with the humanoid robot Pepper (Softbank Robotics). A pilot study is carried out with four experts from a child and youth psychiatry to evaluate the feasibility and user experience of the therapist interface. In sum, the user experience and usefulness can be rated positively.",2022,29,0,"{'name': '2022 31st IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)', 'pages':

Based on related conceptions, we propose affinity for technology interaction (ATI), defined as the tendency to actively engage in intensive technology interaction, as a key personal resource for coping with technology. We present the 9-item ATI scale, an economical unidimensional scale that assesses ATI as an interaction style rooted in the construct need for cognition (NFC). Results of multiple studies (n > 1500) showed that the scale achieves good to excellent reliability, exhibits expected moderate to high correlations with geekism, technology enthusiasm, NFC, self-reported success in technical problem-solving and technical system learning success, and also with usage of technical systems. Further, correlations of ATI with the Big Five personality dimensions were weak at most. Based on the results, the ATI scale appears to be a promising tool for research applications such as the characterization of user diversity in system usability tests and the construction of general models of user-technology interaction.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 70, 'citationCount': 310, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144935541', 'name': 'T.

Although autistic caregivers as well as physicians and researchers would like to know the exact cause of ASD and find a definitive cure for it, this goal still seems to be distant. Accordingly, the realistic achievable goal in dealing with ASD is to try to direct all the available resources to help its sufferers to improve their skills and functioning and get the utmost benefits of their strengths aiming at improving their quality of life. Social and economic support for autistic caregivers is also essential to empower them in helping their children across their journey for a better tomorrow.

This review will examine the differences in neurodevelopmental disorders between these two systems. First, we will review the important revisions made from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) to the DSM-5, with respect to ASD and ADHD. Next, we will cover the similarities and differences between ASD and ADHD classification in the DSM-5 and the ICD-10, and how these differences may have an effect on neurodevelopmental disorder diagnostics and classification. By examining the changes made for the DSM-5 in 2013, and critiquing the current ICD-10 system, we can help to anticipate and advise on the upcoming ICD-11, due to come online in 2017. Overall, this review serves to highlight the importance of progress towards complementary diagnostic classification systems, keeping in mind the difference in tradition and purpose of the DSM and the ICD, and that these systems are dynamic and changing as more is learned about neurodevelopmental disorders and their underlying etiology. Finally this review will discuss alternative diagnostic approaches, such as the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, which links symptom domains to underlying biological and neurological mechanisms.

This study sought to elicit the views and preferences of UK autism community members – autistic people, parents and their broader support network – about the terms they use to describe autism. In all, 3470 UK residents responded to an online survey on their preferred ways of describing autism and their rationale for such preferences. The results clearly show that people use many terms to describe autism. The most highly endorsed terms were ‘autism’ and ‘on the autism spectrum’, and to a lesser extent, ‘autism spectrum disorder’, for which there was consensus across community groups. The groups disagreed, however, on the use of several terms. The term ‘autistic’ was endorsed by a large percentage of autistic adults, family members/friends and parents but by considerably fewer professionals; ‘person with autism’ was endorsed by almost half of professionals but by fewer autistic adults and parents. Qualitative analysis of an open-ended question revealed the reasons underlying respondents’ preferences. These findings demonstrate that there is no single way of describing autism that is universally accepted and preferred by the UK’s autism community and that some disagreements appear deeply entrenched.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 87, 'citationCount': 1162, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5550913', 'name': 'Lorcan Kenny'}, {'authorId': '6075053', 'name': 'C.

The aim of this article is to carry out a systematic literature review of the studies on this topic that were published in the last 10 years. We tried to address the following questions: can social robots be a useful tool in autism therapy? We followed the PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered within PROSPERO database (CRD42015016158). We found many positive implications in the use of social robots in therapy as for example: ASD subjects often performed better with a robot partner rather than a human partner; sometimes, ASD patients had, toward robots, behaviors that TD patients had toward human agents; ASDs had a lot of social behaviors toward robots; during robotic sessions, ASDs showed reduced repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and, social robots manage to improve spontaneous language during therapy sessions. Therefore, robots provide therapists and researchers a means to connect with autistic subjects in an easier way, but studies in this area are still insufficient. It is necessary to clarify whether sex, intelligence quotient, and age of participants affect the outcome of therapy and whether any beneficial effects only occur during the robotic session or if they are still observable outside the clinical/experimental context.

With reference to the historical context, this paper reviews recent research addressing 4 major issues: early detection, intervention, education, and psychopharmacological management of children with autism and related (autistic) spectrum disorders (hereafter, “autism”). We conclude from our review of the evidence that, in the absence of additional, more compelling data, the clinical usefulness of existing screening instruments remains questionable. However, the potential importance of such research is underscored by the clear benefits of early behavioural intervention: despite differences in orientation, outcomes for children with autism can be significantly enhanced with early intensive intervention. Although many questions remain (notably, What are the critical therapeutic components? For whom? For what domains of development? For what level of intensity and duration?), interventions shown to be effective are all carefully planned, engineered, monitored, and designed to target specific skill domains. Including children with autism in regular classes within the public school system poses several challenges, the most pressing of which is the large number of school personnel who need to be trained in evidence-based teaching and behavioural management practices. Finally, psychotropic drugs may help to reduce some symptoms, but they are neither curative nor a substitute for other forms of support and intervention.', 'year': 2003, 'referenceCount': 113, 'citationCount': 290, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2860324', 'name': 'S.

The consequences of this disorder for everyday life adaptation are extremely variable. The general public is now more aware of the high prevalence of this lifelong disorder, with ca. 0.6% of the population being affected. However, the signs and symptoms of autism are still puzzling. Since a biological basis of autism was accepted, approaches from developmental cognitive neuroscience have been applied to further our understanding of the autism spectrum. The study of the behavioural and underlying cognitive deficits in autism has advanced ahead of the study of the underlying brain abnormalities and of the putative genetic mechanisms. However, advances in these fields are expected as methodological difficulties are overcome. In this paper, recent developments in the field of autism are outlined.

In order to adapt robot behavior in real time to different situations that arise when interacting with human subjects, robots need to be able to train themselves without requiring human labels, as well as make fast action decisions and generalize the acquired knowledge to diverse and new contexts. We addressed this challenge by designing a physical animatronic robotic face with soft skin and by developing a vision-based self-supervised learning framework for facial mimicry. Our algorithm does not require any knowledge of the robot's kinematic model, camera calibration or predefined expression set.

Purpose The current study used mouse-tracking technique and the seven-point Likert scale to examine the effect of emotional visual context on face trustworthiness judgment at the levels of the early evaluation process and final evaluation result. Methods Experiment 1 used mouse-tracking technique to study the impact of different contexts on the judgment of face trustworthiness at the early evaluation process. Experiment 2 used the seven-point Likert scale to study the effect of different contexts on the judgment of face trustworthiness at the final evaluation result. Results Experiment 1 found that when faces are embedded in threatening negative contexts, the mouse trajectories are more tortuous for trustworthy responses and straighter for untrustworthy responses than in neutral contexts. When faces are embedded in non-threatening negative contexts, the mouse trajectories are more tortuous for trustworthy responses but did not significantly differ for untrustworthy responses than in neutral contexts. When faces are embedded in positive contexts, the mouse trajectories are straighter for trustworthy responses and more tortuous for untrustworthy responses than in neutral contexts.

In this regard, it is important that robots’ behavioural skills are developed and researched so that people have appropriate and comfortable interactions. Smiling and use of first name are two more important social communication skills used during human interactions. While smiling and use of first name are often employed by robots in human interactions, the effect of these behaviours on perceptions of receptionist robots has not yet been experimentally investigated. This study explored the effects of robot smiling and robot use of the participant’s first name on perceptions of robot friendliness, mind, and personality, as well as attitudes and smiling behaviour. Forty participants interacted with a medical receptionist robot four times, in a two by two repeated measures design. Both smiling and use of first name had significant positive effects on participants’ perceptions of robot personality. Robot smiling also showed significant effects on participants’ overall attitudes towards robots, ratings of robot friendliness, and perceptions of the robot’s mind, and increased the frequency of participants’ own smiling. There were no significant interaction effects.

As a multimodal phenomenon, previous research argued that a mismatch in the expressive channels provides evidence of joint audio-video emotional processing. However, while previous work studied this from the point of view of emotion recognition and processing, not much is known about what effect a multimodal agent would have on a human-agent interaction task. Also, agent appearance could influence this interaction too. Here we manipulated the agent’s multimodal emotional expression (”smiling face” and ”smiling voice”, or both) and agent type (photorealistic or cartoon-like virtual human) and assessed people’s trust toward this agent. We measured trust using a mixed-methods approach, combining behavioural data from a survival task, questionnaire ratings and qualitative comments. These methods gave different results: while people commented on the importance of emotional expressivity in the agent’s voice, this factor had limited influence on trusting behaviours; while people rated the cartoon-like agent on several traits higher than the photorealistic one, the agent’s style also was not the most influential feature on people’s trusting behaviour. These results highlight the contribution of a mixed-methods approach in human-machine interaction, as both explicit and implicit perception and behaviour will contribute to the success of the interaction.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 38, 'citationCount': 17, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1996210170', 'name': 'Ilaria Torre'}, {'authorId': '3493587', 'name': 'E.

All participants were assigned to be the proposer and were instructed to decide their offer within 1 min by controlling a slider bar. The corners of the robot's mouth, as indicated by the line drawing, simply moved upward, or downward depending on the position of the slider bar.

Clearly, negotiations represent motivated performance situations to interested partners. And, experimental negotiation tasks are no exception, including those involving real human players (Van Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004) and digital agents (i.e., player representations driven by computer algorithms, de Melo, Carnevale, & Gratch, 2011). The current work examines individuals’ motivational responses, using physiological indexes, to emotionally expressive virtual characters in a multi-issue negotiation task. Specifically, we focus on the question of how situational context affects emotion perception from facial expressions. In person-to-agent negotiation tasks, experimenters often insert communicative cues such as agent facial expressions intended to strategically manipulate user’s emotions. Agents that show emotion have now been used in several domains such as education, entertainment, training, therapy and commerce (for a review see Beale & Creed, 2009). In a multi-issue negotiation task, de Melo and colleagues (2011) reported that participants made more concessions to a virtual human that displayed an angry facial expression compared to a happy facial expression. Most research on the effects of virtual characters’ emotional facial expressions has relied on subjective responses from participants (e.g., Beale & Creed, 2009). However, given the evidence that emotion is processed via non-conscious pathways, perhaps more so than conscious pathways (Tamietto & De Gelder, 2010), validated physiological measures related to affect should provide confirmation of the operation of non-conscious emotional processes involved in motivated performance tasks such as negotiation (Blascovich & Mendes, 2010). Abstract Affect is important in motivated performance situations such as negotiation. Longstanding theories of emotion suggest that facial expressions provide enough information to perceive another person’s internal affective state. Alternatively, the contextual emotion hypothesis posits that situational factors bias the perception of emotion in others’ facial displays. This hypothesis predicts that individuals will have different perceptions of the same facial expression depending upon the context in which the expression is displayed. In this study, cardiovascular indexes of motivational states (i.e., challenge vs. threat) were recorded while players engaged in a multi- issue negotiation where the opposing negotiator (confederate) displayed emotional facial expressions (angry vs. happy); the confederate’s negotiation strategy (cooperative vs. competitive) was factorially crossed with his facial expression. During the game, participants’ eye fixations and cardiovascular responses, indexing task engagement and challenge/threat motivation, were recorded. Results indicated that participants playing confederates with incongruent facial expressions (e.g., cooperative strategy, angry face) exhibited a greater threat response, which arises due to increased uncertainty. Eye fixations also suggest that participants look at the face more in order to acquire information to reconcile their uncertainty in the incongruent condition. Taken together, these results suggest that context matters in the perception of emotion. Keywords: facial expressions, negotiation, context in emotion Introduction Negotiation is relatively common in personal and professional settings. A child might ask a parent whether she can leave the dinner table. The parent might sternly command the child to finish her vegetables and the child could make a counter offer to finish the peas but not the broccoli. This could ensue into a strategic and emotionally charged social interaction.

For decades, the dominant research paradigm has been characterized by a focus on the decision maker’s own positive or negative mood. We argue that a full understanding of the role of emotion in social decision making requires a complementary focus on interpersonal effects (i.e., the effects of one individual’s emotions on the other’s behavior); a focus on discrete emotions rather than general mood states; and a distinction between cooperative and competitive settings. To advance insight into these issues, we present the Emotions as Social Information (EASI) model. The model is grounded in two basic assumptions, namely that individuals use others’ emotions to make sense of ambiguous situations, and that the effects of others’ emotions and the processes that drive them depend critically on the cooperative or competitive nature of the situation. A review of recent research supports our analysis. We demonstrate that the interpersonal effects of emotions are pervasive and can be better understood in terms of the unique social functions of each emotion than in terms of valence. Effects in cooperative settings are best explained in terms of affective reactions (i.e., emotional contagion, affect infusion, and mood management), whereas effects in competitive contexts are better understood in terms of the strategic inferences Emotions as Social Information 47 individuals draw from other’s emotions. We conclude by discussing the implications of our model and highlighting avenues for future research. Would you trust a salesperson who smiles at you, or give money to a grumpy beggar muttering angry phrases? How would you react to a friend who arrives late for an appointment looking guilty and ashamed? Would you work harder when your team leader appears upbeat and cheerful or rather irritated and moody? Reversing the roles, would you show that you are angry or happy about your negotiation partner’s insultingly low or surprisingly generous offer? If you wanted to solicit help, which emotions would you show? Diverse as they may seem, all these questions revolve around one fundamental issue: How do emotional expressions shape social interactions and decisions? This is the focus of the chapter. Emotions have long been regarded as disruptive forces that interfere with rational decision making. Increasingly, however, this view has given way to a functional perspective on emotions. Contemporary scholars share the idea that emotions signal the importance of events to relevant concerns, help prioritize goals, and generate a state of action readiness that prepares the individual to respond to changes in the environment (see, e.g., Frijda, 1986). This not only applies to individual goals and actions but also, and perhaps especially, to social interaction and decision making—situations in which one’s own behavior influences and is influenced by one or more others. Indeed, social interactions are among themost commonly reported antecedents of emotions (Anderson& Guerrero, 1998; Shaver et al., 1992), and emotions have plenty of potential to shape behavior (Frijda, 1986; Manstead, 1991; Van Kleef, 2009). Although the last decades have witnessed a growing attention to the role of emotion in social decision making, we believe that this research has not done justice to the inherently social nature of emotion. The reason is that most research has addressed the intrapersonal effects of affective states (especially positive vs. negative moods), demonstrating that individuals’ judgments and decisions are influenced by their mood state (for reviews, see e.g., Ashby et al., 1999; Forgas, 1995; Isen, 1987; Schwarz et al., 1991; Wyer et al., 1999). Although much of this work involved social situations, the role of emotion itself has been studied in a rather a-social way, ignoring the role of the interaction partner. In this article, we advocate a more social approach, advancing a new model of the interpersonal effects of emotion in social decision making. 1. Concerns with Past Research and Aims of the Present Article The chapter—and much of the research reviewed in it—is motivated by three key concerns about the dominant research focus. The first concern is the prevailing focus on intrapersonal effects. We contend that the role of 48 Gerben A. Van Kleef et al. emotion in social decision making cannot be fully understood by merely considering the decision maker’s own emotions. We don’t just feel our emotions; we also express them in social interaction. This means that other people may observe our emotions, and may be influenced by them. Parkinson’s (1996) article, entitled ‘‘Emotions are social,’’ aptly notes that our emotions are not only often evoked by social interaction; but they also influence the behavior of social interaction partners by serving as a form of communication (Ekman, 1993; Fridlund, 1994; Frijda, 1986; Knutson, 1996). A true understanding of the role of emotion in social decision making therefore requires an additional focus on the interpersonal effects of emotions—the effects of one individual’s emotions on the other’s social decisions and behavior. Despite the growing popularity of social-functional approaches to emotion (e.g., Elfenbein, 2007; Fischer & Manstead, 2008; Frijda & Mesquita, 1994; Keltner & Haidt, 1999; Morris & Keltner, 2000; Oatley & Jenkins, 1992; Van Kleef, 2009), a systematic analysis in the context of social decision making is missing. Accordingly, our first objective is to fill this void. Our second concern is with the tendency to focus on positive versus negative mood as opposed to discrete emotions. We argue that this emphasis on diffuse mood states blurs our understanding of the multifaceted role of emotion in social decision making. As explained in more detail below, each discrete emotion has its own antecedents, appraisal components, relational themes, and action tendencies (Frijda et al., 1989; Lazarus, 1991; Manstead & Tetlock, 1989; Roseman et al., 1994; Smith et al., 1993). Emotions therefore provide more differentiated information and carry more clearcut behavioral implications than moods (Weiner, 1986). Our second goal, accordingly, is to highlight these specific functions of discrete emotions in the context of social decision making. We will show that discrete emotions (e.g., happiness, anger, sadness, guilt) have differential effects on social behavior that cannot be understood in terms of valence. Our final concern is the relative neglect of the social context within which emotions are expressed and behavioral actions emerge. Although emotions have been studied in various domains of social decision making, context has seldom been varied within studies, and it has not been common to compare the effects of emotions across different social settings. We argue that it is important to consider the social context. In particular, we propose that the same emotions may have entirely different effects depending on whether they are expressed in a predominantly cooperative or competitive setting. Cooperative settings are generally characterized by higher levels of trust and benevolence and greater motivation to work together; competitive settings typically breed distrust, more selfish motivations, and strategic behavior (De Dreu et al., 2007). It stands to reason that people respond differently to a smile or frown from a partner in a cooperative setting than from an adversary in a competitive situation (Lanzetta & Englis, 1989). Emotions as Social Information 49 Motivated by these observations, we present the Emotions as Social Information (EASI) model (see also Van Kleef, 2009) to enhance understanding of the interpersonal effects of emotions in social decision making. The model is grounded in two basic assumptions. The first is that social decision-making situations are fuzzy and are characterized by insufficient information about interdependent others’ goals, desires, and intentions. In such an uncertain environment, people rely on additional cues to make sense of the situation. We propose that people use their partner’s emotions to disambiguate the situation and to inform their social decisions. Our second assumption is that the nature of the situation fundamentally shapes the interpersonal effects of emotions. In predominantly cooperative situations, where parties’ goals are aligned and trust is high, people are likely to assimilate to the emotions of their partner, and their social decisions are likely to be influenced by their resulting emotional state. In more competitive settings, in contrast, where parties’ goals conflict and trust tends to be low, individuals use their counterpart’s emotions as strategic information to inform their behavior. This distinction has important implications for our understanding of the interpersonal effects of emotions in social decision making, as we demonstrate below. This model helps us to generate and address new questions about the role of emotion in social life. How do the emotional expressions of one party influence the social decisions of interdependent others?What are the distinct social signals that are conveyed by discrete emotions, and how do individuals respond to those signals? When do emotions spread from one individual to the other, and how does this affect social decision making? What strategic information do people distill from their counterpart’s emotional expressions, and how do they act on those inferences? We rely on the EASI model and recent empirical work to provide preliminary answers to these and other questions. To do so, we proceed as follows. We first build on the aforementioned assumptions to develop our model. Next, empirical support for the main propositions of themodel is reviewed by considering research evidence from our own and others’ laboratories.

To date there has been no consistent or reliable system for designing and transferring affective emotional eye gestures to anthropomorphized social robots. Combining research findings from Oculesics, Laban Movement Analysis and the Twelve Principles of Animation, this paper discusses the design and evaluation of the prototype LMA12-O framework for the purpose of maximising the emotive communication potential of eye gestures in anthropomorphized social robots. Results of initial user testings evidenced LMA12-O to be effective in designing affective emotional eye gestures in the test robot with important considerations for future iterations of this framework.",2022,28,0,"{'name': '2022 31st IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)', 'pages': '442-449'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.', 'year': 2023, 'referenceCount': 131, 'citationCount': 1940, 'authors': [{'authorId': '47016130', 'name': 'C.

This study aimed to identify, using Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), the Laban motor elements (motor characteristics) that characterize movements whose execution enhances each of the basic emotions: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. LMA provides a system of symbols describing its motor elements, which gives a written instruction (motif) for the execution of a movement or movement-sequence over time. Six senior LMA experts analyzed a validated set of video clips showing whole body dynamic expressions of anger, fear, happiness and sadness, and identified the motor elements that were common to (appeared in) all clips expressing the same emotion. For each emotion, we created motifs of different combinations of the motor elements common to all clips of the same emotion. Eighty subjects from around the world read and moved those motifs, to identify the emotion evoked when moving each motif and to rate the intensity of the evoked emotion. All subjects together moved and rated 1241 motifs, which were produced from 29 different motor elements. Using logistic regression, we found a set of motor elements associated with each emotion which, when moved, predicted the feeling of that emotion. Each emotion was predicted by a unique set of motor elements and each motor element predicted only one emotion. Knowledge of which specific motor elements enhance specific emotions can enable emotional self-regulation through adding some desired motor qualities to one's personal everyday movements (rather than mimicking others' specific movements) and through decreasing motor behaviors which include elements that enhance negative emotions."", 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 79, 'citationCount': 80, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3424994', 'name': 'T.

As these precepts are widely known and can be referenced in The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation, I will briefly paraphrase them here and apply them in context throughout this chapter.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 14, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2156790', 'name': 'Leslie Bishko'}]}, {'paperId': 'd42797b7dd1d055bb547a350f63ca5e6c5136d24', 'title': 'Eye Movements, Saccades, and Multiparty Conversations', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2008, 'referenceCount': 40, 'citationCount': 19, 'authors': [{'authorId': '143694708', 'name': 'Erdan Gu'}, {'authorId': '2117180593', 'name': 'Sooha Park Lee'}, {'authorId': '1697165', 'name': 'J.

Older adults focused significantly more on the robot’s face and paid little attention to the rest of the body. In contrast, the younger adults gazed at more body parts and viewed the robot in more detail than the older adults. Furthermore, the older adults rated physical attractiveness and social likeability of the robot significantly higher than the younger adults.

Inline with this natural, effective communication, robots need to perceive and manage multimodal information, both as input and output, and respond accordingly. Consequently, dialogue design is a key factor in creating an engaging multimodal interaction. These dialogues need to be flexible enough to adapt to unforeseen circumstances that arise during the conversation but should also be easy to create, so the development of new applications gets simpler. In this work, we present our approach to dialogue modelling based on basic atomic interaction units called Communicative Acts. They manage basic interactions considering who has the initiative (the robot or the user), and what is his/her intention. The two possible intentions are either ask for information or give information. In addition, because we focus on one-to-one interactions, the initiative can only be taken by the robot or the user. Communicative Acts can be parametrised and combined in a hierarchical manner to fulfil the needs of the robot’s applications, and they have been equipped with built-in functionalities that are in charge of low-level communication tasks. These tasks include communication error handling, turn-taking or user disengagement. This system has been integrated in Mini, a social robot that has been created to assist older adults with cognitive impairment.

To validate the proposal, an experimental single-case study method was designed using two groups: a control group and an experimental one, with similar cognitive ages. Didactic exercises were provided to the experimental group using visual cognitive stimulation. These exercises were created on the TANGO:H Designer, a platform that was designed for gestural interaction using the KINECT sensor. As a result, TANGO:H allows for visual-motor cognitive stimulation through the movement of hands, arms, feet and head.

The purpose of this research is to identify how the (ostensible) gender and the facial characteristics of a robot influence the extent to which people trust it and the psychological reactance they experience from its persuasive attempts. This paper reports a laboratory study where SociBot™, a robot capable of displaying different faces and dynamic social cues, delivered persuasive messages to participants while playing a game. In-game choice behavior was logged, and trust and reactance toward the advisor were measured using questionnaires. Results show that a robotic advisor with upturned eyebrows and lips (features that people tend to trust more in humans) is more persuasive, evokes more trust, and less psychological reactance compared to one displaying eyebrows pointing down and lips curled downwards at the edges (facial characteristics typically not trusted in humans). Gender of the robot did not affect trust, but participants experienced higher psychological reactance when interacting with a robot of the opposite gender. Remarkably, mediation analysis showed that liking of the robot fully mediates the influence of facial characteristics on trusting beliefs and psychological reactance. Also, psychological reactance was a strong and reliable predictor of trusting beliefs but not of trusting behavior. These results suggest robots that are intended to influence human behavior should be designed to have facial characteristics we trust in humans and could be personalized to have the same gender as the user.

Drawing on evolutionary accounts of human face perception suggesting that the face width-to-height ratio (fWHR: bizygomatic width divided by upper-face height) can signal dominance and affect its overall evaluation, this research is based on the premise that product faces are perceived in much the same way as human faces. Five experiments tested this premise. Results suggest that like human faces, product faces with high (vs. low) fWHR are perceived as more dominant. However, while human faces with high fWHR are liked less, product faces with high fWHR are liked more as revealed by consumer preference and willingness-to-pay scores. The greater preference for the high fWHR product faces is motivated by the consumers’ desire to enhance and signal their own dominant status as evidenced by the moderating effects of type of goal and of usage context.

Participants judged the un/happiness or un/trustworthiness of people with dynamic expressions in which the eyes and/or the mouth unfolded from neutral to happy or vice versa. Faces with an unfolding smile looked more trustworthy and happier than faces with a neutral mouth, regardless of the eye expression. Unfolding happy eyes increased both trustworthiness and happiness only in the presence of a congruent unfolding smiling mouth. Nevertheless, the contribution of the mouth was greater for happiness than for trustworthiness; and the mouth was especially visually salient for expressions favouring happiness more than trustworthiness. We conclude that the categorisation of facial happiness is more automatically driven by the visual saliency of a single feature, that is, the smiling mouth, while perception of trustworthiness is more strategic, with the eyes being necessarily incorporated into a configural face representation.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 26, 'citationCount': 12, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144866673', 'name': 'M.

Although several studies identify the amygdala as a core brain region in social cognition, quantitative approaches evaluating its role are scarce. Objectives This review aimed to assess the role of the amygdala in the processing of facial trustworthiness, by analyzing its amplitude BOLD response polarity to untrustworthy versus trustworthy facial signals under fMRI tasks through a Meta-analysis of effect sizes (MA). Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analyses were also conducted. Data sources Articles were retrieved from MEDLINE, ScienceDirect and Web-of-Science in January 2016. Following the PRISMA statement guidelines, a systematic review of original research articles in English language using the search string “(face OR facial) AND (trustworthiness OR trustworthy OR untrustworthy OR trustee) AND fMRI” was conducted. Study selection and data extraction The MA concerned amygdala responses to facial trustworthiness for the contrast Untrustworthy vs. trustworthy faces, and included whole-brain and ROI studies. To prevent potential bias, results were considered even when at the single study level they did not survive correction for multiple comparisons or provided non-significant results. ALE considered whole-brain studies, using the same methodology to prevent bias. A summary of the methodological options (design and analysis) described in the articles was finally used to get further insight into the characteristics of the studies and to perform a subgroup analysis. Data were extracted by two authors and checked independently. Data synthesis Twenty fMRI studies were considered for systematic review. An MA of effect sizes with 11 articles (12 studies) showed high heterogeneity between studies [Q(11) = 265.68, p < .0001; I2 = 95.86%, 94.20% to 97.05%, with 95% confidence interval, CI]. Random effects analysis [RE(183) = 0.851, .422 to .969, 95% CI] supported the evidence that the (right) amygdala responds preferentially to untrustworthy faces. Moreover, two ALE analyses performed with 6 articles (7 studies) identified the amygdala, insula and medial dorsal nuclei of thalamus as structures with negative correlation with trustworthiness. Six articles/studies showed that posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus present positive correlations with increasing facial trustworthiness levels. Significant effects considering subgroup analysis based on methodological criteria were found for experiments using spatial smoothing, categorization of trustworthiness in 2 or 3 categories and paradigms which involve both explicit and implicit tasks. Limitations Significant heterogeneity between studies was found in MA, which might have arisen from inclusion of studies with smaller sample sizes and differences in methodological options. Studies using ROI analysis / small volume correction methods were more often devoted specifically to the amygdala region, with some results reporting uncorrected p-values based on mainly clinical a priori evidence of amygdala involvement in these processes. Nevertheless, we did not find significant evidence for publication bias. Conclusions and implications of key findings Our results support the role of amygdala in facial trustworthiness judgment, emphasizing its predominant role during processing of negative social signals in (untrustworthy) faces.

Such instant judgments might be innate and automatic, being performed unconsciously and independently to other cognitive processes. Lying detection might be subject to such a modular process. Unfortunately, numerous studies highlighted problems with lying detection paradigms such as high error rates and learning effects. Additionally, humans should be motivated doing both detecting others’ lies and disguising own lies. Disguising own lies might even be more challenging than detecting other people’s lies. Thus, when trying to disguise cheating behaviour, liars might display a mixture of disguising (fake) trust cues and uncontrolled lying cues making the interpretation of the expression difficult (perceivers are guessing). In two consecutive online studies, we tested whether seeing an increasing amount (range 0–4) of lying cues (LC) and non-lying cues (NLC) on a standard face results in enhanced guessing behaviour (studies 1 and 2) and that enhanced guessing is accompanied by slower responding (study 2). Results showed that pronounced guessing and slowest responding occurred for faces with an intermediate number and not with the highest number of LC and NLC. In particular, LC were more important than NLC to uncertain lying decisions. Thus, only a few LC may interfere with automatic processing of lying detection (irrespective of NLC), probably because too little lying cue information is yet available.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 46, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4395685', 'name': 'M.

The present study examined the facial features that contributed to judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness by three groups of Chinese children aged 8 years old (n = 34; 17 boys), 10 years old (n = 34; 17 boys), and 12 years old (n = 34; 17 boys) and a comparison group of 37 undergraduates (M age = 20.2 yr.; 16 men). Using FaceGen Modeler 3.1, a total of 400 East Asian adult faces (200 male, 200 female) portraying neutral emotions with direct gazes were generated. The faces were represented by 61 shape features and were presented for a maximum of 3,000 msec. in the center of the computer screen in randomized order. The participants were asked to judge whether each person was trustworthy and to rate the level of trustworthiness; 1 month later, the attractiveness of the same faces was judged using a similar procedure. The children and the adults used similar facial features to judge trustworthiness (e.g., the brow ridge, nose, and chin). Some of the facial features used by the different age groups as the basis for the trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments were similar. Facial attractiveness accounted for roughly 30 to 60% of the variance in the groups' trustworthiness judgments. Thus, facial attractiveness may serve as a heuristic property that signals trustworthiness and guides adaptive social decisions. More importantly, even children as young as 8 years old use a strategy similar to that of adults to make trustworthiness judgments, although some differences in the use of specific facial features were observed among the age groups."", 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 36, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2010071', 'name': 'Fengling Ma'}, {'authorId': '48101393', 'name': 'Fen Xu'}, {'authorId': '51145918', 'name': 'Xianming Luo'}]}, {'paperId': 'af1713cc17394b8383134fef152f25e1a0509ffa', 'title': 'Evaluation of a spatial language interpretation framework for natural human-robot interaction with older adults', 'abstract': ""We present the design and analysis of a multi-session user study conducted with older adults to evaluate the effectiveness of a human-robot interaction (HRI) framework utilizing a neuroscience-inspired spatial language interpretation approach.

Background: Trust is an important psychological factor determining the acceptance of smart systems. Because smart systems tend to be treated like humans, and similarity has been shown to increase trust in humans, we expected that similarity would increase trust in a virtual agent. Methods: In a driving simulator experiment, participants (N = 111) were presented with a virtual agent that was either similar to them or not. This agent functioned as their virtual driver in a driving simulator, and trust in this agent was measured. Furthermore, we measured how trust changed with experience. Results: Prior to experiencing the agent, the similar agent was trusted more than the dissimilar agent. This effect was mediated by perceived similarity. After experiencing the agent, the similar agent was still trusted more than the dissimilar agent. Conclusion: Just as similarity between humans increases trust in another human, similarity also increases trust in a virtual agent. When such an agent is presented as a virtual driver in a self-driving car, it could possibly enhance the trust people have in such a car.

Finally, the FWHRs of athletes showed no relationship with the amount of aggression and related traits that were judged as required for success in those sports, although FWHRs did correlate with perceived endurance demands in women. Therefore, in a large sample of athletes, the sex difference in FWHR could be attributed to body size, and little support was found for the predicted links between this facial measure and behavior.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 31, 'citationCount': 30, 'authors': [{'authorId': '9795072', 'name': 'R.

This effect has been overlooked because trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments have a high level of shared variance for most face samples. We show that for a continuum of faces that vary on a typicality-attractiveness dimension, trustworthiness judgments peak around the typical face.

Facial appearance is often used as a guide to personality traits such as trustworthiness (Todorov, 2008). Recent studies have demonstrated that, in addition to objective characteristics such as the resemblance of the structure of a face to positive and negative emotional expressions, subjective characteristics such as the similarity of another person’s face to one’s own also influence people’s judgments about a person’s character (Bailenson, Iyengar, Yee, & Collins, 2008; DeBruine, 2002, 2005). Coupled with research suggesting that people have overly positive self-views (Taylor & Brown, 1988), including viewing themselves as more trustworthy than the average person (Flynn & Lake, 2008), these findings suggest that people favor those who are physically similar to themselves. Indeed, facial similarity leads to increased attributions of trustworthiness (DeBruine, 2005) and increased cooperation in both trust games (DeBruine, 2002) and common-goods games (Krupp, Debruine, & Barclay, 2008). Although the effects of facial similarity on cooperative interactions are well documented, little is known about whether the perceived similarity between the self and others can change as a result of such interactions. The experience of another’s face being similar to one’s own can be thought of as the felt output of a computational system that utilizes direct, phenotypic cues (e.g., objective facial features) and indirect, contextual cues (e.g., coresidence early in life; DeBruine et al., 2011; Penn & Frommen, 2010) to gauge genetic kinship (cf. Kurzban, Duckworth, Kable, & Myers, in press). If evidence of cooperative intent in others serves as a contextual cue to kinship, then people may perceive another who behaves in a trustworthy way toward them as more physically similar than another who behaves in an untrustworthy way. The influence of trustworthiness on perceived facial similarity was investigated by Verosky and Todorov (2010), who found that untrustworthy-looking faces were viewed as less similar to the self than trustworthy-looking faces were. However, in their study, trustworthiness was manipulated by varying the physical characteristics of the face rather than by varying actual behavior.

The 2D model proposes that trust and dominance are spontaneously evaluated from features of faces. These evaluations have adaptive significance from an evolutionary standpoint because they indicate whether someone should be approached or avoided. Method Participants rated the emotional state, personality traits, and criminal appearance of faces shown in photographs. The photographs were of males and females taken under naturalistic conditions (i.e., police mugshots) and highly controlled conditions. In the controlled photographs, the emotion display of the actor was systematically varied (happy expression, emotionally neutral expression, or angry expression). Results Both male and female faces rated high in criminal appearance were perceived as less trustworthy and more dominant in police mugshots as well as in photographs taken under highly controlled conditions. Additionally, emotionally neutral faces were deemed as less trustworthy if they were perceived as angry, and more dominant if they were morphologically mature. Systematically varying emotion displays also affected criminality ratings, with angry faces perceived as the most criminal, followed by neutral faces and then happy faces. Conclusion The 2D model parsimoniously accounts for criminality perceptions. This study extends past research by demonstrating that morphological features that signal high dominance and low trustworthiness can also signal high criminality. Spontaneous evaluations regarding criminal propensity may have adaptive value in that they may help us to avoid someone who is physically threatening. On the other hand, such evaluations could inappropriately influence decision making in criminal identification lineups.

Research on the evolution of signaling has shown that animals frequently alter visual features, including color cues, to attract, intimidate or protect themselves from conspecifics. Humans engage in conscious manipulation of visual signals using cultural tools in real time rather than genetic changes over evolutionary time. Here, we investigate one tool, the use of color cosmetics. In two studies, we asked viewers to rate the same female faces with or without color cosmetics, and we varied the style of makeup from minimal (natural), to moderate (professional), to dramatic (glamorous). Each look provided increasing luminance contrast between the facial features and surrounding skin. Faces were shown for 250 ms or for unlimited inspection time, and subjects rated them for attractiveness, competence, likeability and trustworthiness. At 250 ms, cosmetics had significant positive effects on all outcomes. Length of inspection time did not change the effect for competence or attractiveness. However, with longer inspection time, the effect of cosmetics on likability and trust varied by specific makeup looks, indicating that cosmetics could impact automatic and deliberative judgments differently. The results suggest that cosmetics can create supernormal facial stimuli, and that one way they may do so is by exaggerating cues to sexual dimorphism. Our results provide evidence that judgments of facial trustworthiness and attractiveness are at least partially separable, that beauty has a significant positive effect on judgment of competence, a universal dimension of social cognition, but has a more nuanced effect on the other universal dimension of social warmth, and that the extended phenotype significantly influences perception of biologically important signals at first glance and at longer inspection.', 'year': 2011, 'referenceCount': 42, 'citationCount': 164, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3131885', 'name': 'N.

Each day we face decisions in which we must accurately assess another individual's trustworthiness or risk suffering very real consequences. In a global marketplace of increasing heterogeneity with respect to nationality, race, and multiple other social categories, it is of great value to understand how implicitly held attitudes about group membership may support or undermine social trust and thereby implicitly shape the decisions we make. Recent behavioral and neuroimaging work suggests that a common mechanism may underlie the expression of implicit race bias and evaluations of trustworthiness, although no direct evidence of a connection exists. In two behavioral studies, we investigated the relationship between implicit race attitude (as measured by the Implicit Association Test) and social trust. We demonstrate that race disparity in both an individual's explicit evaluations of trustworthiness and, more crucially, his or her economic decisions to trust is predicted by that person's bias in implicit race attitude. Importantly, this relationship is robust and is independent of the individual's bias in explicit race attitude.

In addition, the implications for product design of each role are listed, and managerial recommendations for optimizing the appearance of products are given. \n \nBased on a literature review, six different roles of product appearance for consumers are identified: (1) communication of aesthetic, (2) symbolic, (3) functional, and (4) ergonomic information; (5) attention drawing; and (6) categorization. A product's appearance can have aesthetic and symbolic value for consumers, can communicate functional characteristics and give a quality impression (functional value), and can communicate ease of use (ergonomic value). In addition, it can draw attention and can influence the ease of categorization of the product. In a large qualitative study (N=142) it was tested whether these roles indeed exist in consumers' process of product choice and whether they are sufficient to describe the way in which product appearance plays a role for consumers. In addition, qualitative insight into these roles was gained. After making a choice between two answering machines, subjects were interviewed about the reasons for their choice and the product information they used to form the judgments underlying their choice reasons. \n \nThe six appearance roles indeed proved relevant for consumers and were sufficient to describe the influence of product appearance on product choice. The number of ways in which appearance played a role for consumers differed between 0 and 5; most subjects mentioned two different ways in which appearance influenced their product choice. The aesthetic and symbolic roles were mentioned most often. \n \nThe preferred shape (e.g., rounded or angular), color, or size were found to differ depending on the way in which product appearance played a role for subjects. For example, bright colors may be valued from an aesthetic point of view but may diminish the impression of quality (i.e., functional value). This makes it difficult to optimize all roles and illustrates that the product value that is most important for consumers when purchasing a specific kind of product should be the starting point in the design of the product appearance. Furthermore, the influence of shape, color, or size on a certain kind of product value—aesthetic, symbolic, ergonomic, or functional—differed between subjects. One person may like a rounded shape, while another may prefer a rectangular shape. This means that the value of guidelines indicating how the perception of a specific kind of product value can be engendered by means of shape, color, and size is limited. This is especially the case for aesthetic and symbolic product value, which are very personal. Therefore it is recommended to test the performance of the appearance of a newly developed product on these six roles with the target group of consumers. \n \nInsight into the different ways in which appearance characteristics, such as form and color, may influence consumer choice will increase managers' awareness about how to use product appearance as a marketing tool. In addition, distinguishing these six appearance roles will help product development managers to optimize the product appearance better to market needs, as the roles have different and sometimes even conflicting implications for the design of the product appearance."", 'year': 2005, 'referenceCount': 60, 'citationCount': 852, 'authors': [{'authorId': '98528457', 'name': 'Mariëlle E.

The book opens with a brief overview of the design process relative to general problem solving approaches and specific ANSI design standards. A condensed but informative overview of statics and failure theories is provided, followed by separate chapters for the design of shafts, springs, screws and transmission elements such as belts, clutches, brakes, chains, bearings, and the most common types of gears. Using a phenomenological approach, each type of machine element and its associated variants are described with respect to function, form, and constraints. The provided performance and failure analysis is accessible, with most mathematical derivations given in full detail to increase the usefulness and adaptability of the provided information. Educators and practitioners currently utilizing the 7 edition will appreciate the important changes to the 8 edition. While the organization of the two books is virtually identical through Chapter 14, a structured approach has been applied to all the design examples. This structured approach includes the enumeration of the problem statement, given information, assumptions, solution method, and solution details. While quite standard, this structured approach does facilitate an understanding of the engineering approach and may assist the development of critical thinking skills.

This complaint is also an expression of anticipatory pleasure on the part of Freud the writer, in so far as the uncanny in particular has no “literature” with which to contend – but he has to admit that there is one exception, namely the essay translated below (“The ‘Uncanny’” 219). Jentsch emphasises that the uncanny arises from a certain experience of the uncertain or undecidable, and this seems intolerable to Freud. Freud decides, in other words, that the undecidable cannot be tolerated as a theoretical explanation, but it nonetheless recurs in his own essay, undecidably (see 221 and 230-31). He also pays close attention to Jentsch’s argument about the uncanniness of automata (226-27 and 233). Dr. Ernst Jentsch was born in 1867. The diversity of his cultural and psychological interests can be seen in his published works. His study of mood (1902) includes a sympathetic account of affect in the Studien uber Hysterie of Freud and Breuer (Die Laune 49-51); in his two-part Musik und Nerven (1904 and 1911), 5 he notes how uncanny effects are readily produced in music (2: 5657); and, amongst other works, he produced German translations of Havelock Ellis and Cesare Lombroso. Reference has often been made to Jentsch’s essay on the uncanny, in the vast secondary literature of psychoanalysis after Freud, as if its content were already known, familiar and thus not requiring to be read. The essay had never before been translated into English; inasmuch as it now appears both familiar and unfamiliar, its reappearance here can be called ‘uncanny.’ This translation first appeared in Angelaki 2.1 (1995), and I remain deeply grateful to Sarah Wood, the issue editor and one of the founders of the journal. For their advice, I would also like to thank Peter Krapp, Robert White, and especially Forbes Morlock – whose “Doubly Uncanny,” which immediately followed my translation on its first publication, remains a good starting point for further research.', 'year': 1997, 'referenceCount': 0, 'citationCount': 165, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2082907982', 'name': 'E.

To deepen understanding of host-tourist interaction, this study took a host perspective to examine emotional contagion from tourists to hosts. By adopting video-vignette based interaction scenarios and cutting-edge techniques (e.g., FaceReader), a real-time multi-modal investigation was undertaken to reveal mechanism underlying emotional contagion of Hong Kong residents from Mainland Chinese tourists. Results theoretically consolidated the dual-process mechanism underpinning automatic emotional contagion and empirically verified an Emotional Contagion Model (ECM) from tourists to hosts. The compelling effects of mimicry, interaction context and stereotypes explained the emotional convergence and divergence between hosts and tourists. The study extended the knowledge boundary of host-tourist interaction to micro-level interpersonal emotional connection. Moreover, the verified ECM theoretically advances emotional contagion mechanism in the social psychology literature. Practical guidelines for host-tourist relation management and sustainable destination development were provided.",2022,88,2,"{'name': 'Journal of Travel Research', 'pages': '1328 - 1346', 'volume':

The study is based on a mini literature review. We identify different mechanisms and approaches to emotional contagion described in the literature. Emotional contagion can be triggered by facial expressions, indirect human interactions, and/or by observing other people's behavior in direct and indirect interactions. Furthermore, emotional contagion can be triggered physiologically or neurologically by synchronizing with the emotional state of others during human interactions. Regarding the assessment and measurement of emotional contagion, we argue that methods based on neuroscience tools are much more accurate and effective than methods based on traditional research approaches. The study identifies guidelines for research on commercial communication through emotional contagion that can be especially interesting for academia and marketing practitioners.

Entrainment may be further cultivated by interaction rituals involving rhythmic music that sets the pace for collective singing, dancing, or marching. These rituals also provide an emotionally meaningful focus for group activities and sometimes specifically encourage the experience of intense embodied states.

A closer look at the empirical evidence, however, reveals that although these two phenomena often co-occur, the changes in emotional expressions may not necessarily be causally linked to the changes in subjective emotional experience. Here, we directly investigate this link, by testing a model in which facial activity served as a mediator between the observed emotional displays and subsequently felt emotions (i.e. emotional contagion). Participants watched videos of different senders displaying happiness, anger, or sadness, while their facial activity was recorded. After each video, participants rated their own emotions and assessed the senders’ likeability and competence. Participants both mimicked and reported feeling the emotions displayed by the senders. Moreover, their facial activity partially explained the association between the senders’ emotional displays and self-reported emotions, thereby supporting the notion that facial mimicry may be involved in emotional contagion.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 33, 'citationCount': 46, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4135033', 'name': 'M.

This research aims to compare and contrast physiological and self-report methods to assess emotional responses to tourism marketing stimuli where music was manipulated. This research assessed emotional responses from 37 participants to three tourism advertisements of Iran using four key methods; specifically, FaceReader™, skin conductance, self-report surveys and post hoc interviews. This research found that the light rhythmic music tends to evoke positive emotions and a higher level of emotional arousal in participants than does the traditional Iranian music or a video without music. Physiological and self-report measures of emotional arousal were inconsistent, but both techniques found similar results for assessing the valence of emotions.

We review literature on the moderating role of social factors in emotional contagion and emotional mimicry, a process often considered a basic mechanism of emotional contagion. We argue that top-down social processes controlling emotional mimicry may be explained by the correction hypothesis formulated to account for contrast effects in priming research.

We conclude that while the application of a range of novel theoretical perspectives and facets largely reflects the postmodern move away from binary thinking and concepts, the sociology of tourism still makes little contribution back to the discipline of sociology, and will need to address important emergent topics such as deglobalization and current nationalistic movements towards isolationism, to do so.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 151, 'citationCount': 84, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145823382', 'name': 'S.

A video camera was used to record the facial expressions of respondents while viewing the advertisement. Results provide an indication that participants had overall low arousal and positive emotions while watching the tourism video. FaceReader™ proved useful for collecting and analysing real time data concerning seven discrete emotions plus valence and arousal. Since FaceReader™ is sensitive to light and participants with thick frame glasses, it is recommended that future studies apply this software with additional physiological and self-report measures to advance understanding of the measurement of emotions in the tourism field.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 24, 'citationCount': 29, 'authors': [{'authorId': '90586366', 'name': 'A.

The sample included 573 full customer service interactions in 47 hotels in Catalonia. The model was tested with structural equation modelling. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nEmotional contagion has specific mechanisms at the hotel front-desk. No relationship was found between receptionists’ inner mood and their outwardly displayed emotions. Yet, receptionists’ displayed emotions enhance customer mood, and, largely, customer satisfaction. Ultimately, this affects customer behavioural intentions. It was also discovered that guests are able to clearly distinguish between their satisfaction with the specific service encounter at the front desk and the overall satisfaction with the hotel stay. The positive effects of employees’ displayed emotions are of particular importance in lower-star hotels and are less important at the high end. Perceived training opportunities have a positive effect on customer satisfaction and improve the employee-displayed emotion. \n \n \n \n \nResearch limitations/implications \n \n \n \n \nResearchers should examine employee outcomes that are more stable than mood, but may enhance or be related to the effective display of emotions at the front desk, such as employee satisfaction and commitment. In general, emotions and behaviours of employees and consumers should be further examined in other services across the hospitality industry, in different cultural contexts and in terms of their impact on company performance.

We present the matching scores (accuracy) for recognition of facial expressions and the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) index of agreement. In 2005, matching scores of 89% were reported for FaceReader. However, previous research used a version of FaceReader that implemented older algorithms (version 1.0) and did not contain FACS classifiers. In this study, we tested the newest version (6.0). FaceReader recognized 88% of the target emotional labels in the Warsaw Set of Emotional Facial Expression Pictures (WSEFEP) and Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES). The software reached a FACS index of agreement of 0.67 on average in both datasets. The results of this validation test are meaningful only in relation to human performance rates for both basic emotion recognition and FACS coding. The human emotions recognition for the 2 datasets was 85%, therefore FaceReader is as good at recognizing emotions as humans.

Research has shown various dissociations between the two kinds of evaluations, including different antecedents, different consequences, and discrepant evaluations of the same object. The current article provides a briefreview ofthe associative–propositional evaluation (APE)model, whichaccounts for these dissociations by conceptualizing implicit and explicit evaluations as the behavioral outcomes of two functionallydistinct, yet mutuallyinteracting, mentalprocesses. Whereasimplicit evaluations are assumed to be the outcome of associative processes, explicit evaluations are conceptualized as the outcome of propositional processes. Associative processes determine the activation of mental contents on the basis of feature similarity and spatiotemporal contiguity; propositional processes involve the validation of activated mental contents on the basis of cognitive consistency. The APE model includes specific assumptions about mutual interactions between the two processes, implying precise predictions about converging versus diverging patterns of implicit and explicit evaluation. Conflicts between the “head” and the “heart” can be rather common in everyday life. We may feel romantically attracted to a particular person despite firmly believing that this person is not a good match; and the sight of a high-caloriedessertmay elicitanimpulse toindulge althoughwe know that it is unhealthy and detrimental for our goal to lose weight. Conversely, we may experience feelings of apprehension and discomfort when encountering members of stigmatized groups even though we intellectually abhor prejudice and wish to express solidarity with minorities; and a small spider may elicit an unpleasant fright response although we know that it is entirely harmless. Over the last two decades, psychologists have gained valuable insights into the causes and consequences of such evaluative conflicts by comparing verbal judgments on traditionalself-reportmeasures(e.g.,attitude scales,likeability ratings)tospontaneousresponses on performance-based paradigms (e.g.,sequential priming tasks, implicit association test). 1 Conceptually, evaluative judgments on the former type of measures can be described as explicit evaluations in the sense that their evaluative meaning is explicit in the observed response (e.g., participants explicitly report their agreement or disagreement with an evaluative statement about an object). Conversely, spontaneous responses on the latter type of measures can be described as implicit evaluations in the sense that their evaluative meaning is implicit in the observed response (e.g.,evaluative responses are inferred from participants’ latencies in responding topositive and negativewords that are precededby brief presentations ofanobject). The main goal of the current article is to provide a brief review of the associative– propositional evaluation (APE) model, which explains dissociations between implicit and explicit evaluations in terms of two functionally distinct mental processes (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006, 2007, 2011).

Using a rule-governed theoretical process, APT reveals 10 distinct mechanisms that connect people’s affective states, which fall into three types.

The results indicated that multimodal accuracies were consistently better than unimodal accuracies and yielded an average 8.12% improvement over the best unimodal classifiers.

Here we show that networks of brain areas “tick together” in participants who are viewing similar emotional events in a movie. Participants’ brain activity was measured with functional MRI while they watched movies depicting unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant emotions. After scanning, participants watched the movies again and continuously rated their experience of pleasantness–unpleasantness (i.e., valence) and of arousal–calmness. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity measures [intersubject correlations (ISCs)] of functional MRI data. Valence and arousal time series were used to predict the moment-to-moment ISCs computed using a 17-s moving average. During movie viewing, participants' brain activity was synchronized in lower- and higher-order sensory areas and in corticolimbic emotion circuits. Negative valence was associated with increased ISC in the emotion-processing network (thalamus, ventral striatum, insula) and in the default-mode network (precuneus, temporoparietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus). High arousal was associated with increased ISC in the somatosensory cortices and visual and dorsal attention networks comprising the visual cortex, bilateral intraparietal sulci, and frontal eye fields. Seed-voxel–based correlation analysis confirmed that these sets of regions constitute dissociable, functional networks. We propose that negative valence synchronizes individuals’ brain areas supporting emotional sensations and understanding of another’s actions, whereas high arousal directs individuals’ attention to similar features of the environment.

In this paper, we evaluate past theories of why people mimic and the brain systems that implement mimicry in social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. By reviewing recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies on the control of mimicry by social signals, we conclude that the subtlety and sophistication of mimicry in social contexts reflect a social top-down response modulation (STORM) which increases one's social advantage and this mechanism is most likely implemented by medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).

Specifically, the emotional contagion hypothesis explains how the emotions of two people (e.g., salesperson and customer) during a conversation are transmitted from one to the other via facial cues, and that these emotions affect the outcome of that interaction. The emotional contagion hypothesis implies that there are definitive individual differences concerning whether someone is either sensitive to emotions from others or able to transmit his or her emotions onto others. This study explores whether these individual differences are assets or liabilities over the long term for salespersons in a sales organization. The data in this study show that a salesperson's ability to infect others with his or her emotions is an asset (because it can lead to higher performance). In addition, being sensitive to the emotions of others is an asset (it can also lead to better performance); at the same time it is a liability (because of the higher risk of burnout).

We tested the influence of 3 key factors—emotional salience of information, group structure, and information distribution—on mnemonic transmission, social contagion, and collective memory. Participants individually studied emotionally salient (negative or positive) and nonemotional (neutral) picture–word pairs that were completely shared, partially shared, or unshared within participant triads, and then completed 3 consecutive recalls in 1 of 3 conditions: individual–individual–individual (control), collaborative–collaborative (identical group; insular structure)–individual, and collaborative–collaborative (reconfigured group; diverse structure)–individual. Collaboration enhanced negative memories especially in insular group structure and especially for shared information, and promoted collective forgetting of positive memories. Diverse group structure reduced this negativity effect. Unequally distributed information led to social contagion that creates false memories; diverse structure propagated a greater variety of false memories whereas insular structure promoted confidence in false recognition and false collective memory. A simultaneous assessment of network structure, information distribution, and emotional valence breaks new ground to specify how network structure shapes the spread of negative memories and false memories, and the emergence of collective memory.",2017,85,28,"{'name': 'Journal of Experimental Psychology: General', 'pages': '1247–1265', 'volume': '146'}","{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

Collaborative inhibition studies on memory for emotional stimuli are scarce. Therefore, the present study examined both collaborative inhibition and collaborative error reduction in the recall of the details of emotional material in a laboratory setting. Female undergraduates (n = 111) viewed a film clip of a fatal accident and subsequently engaged in either collaborative (n = 57) or individual recall (n = 54) in groups of three. The results show that, across several detail categories, collaborating groups recalled fewer details than nominal groups.

This finding is known as collaborative inhibition and is generally thought to arise due to retrieval disruption. However, there is growing evidence that is inconsistent with the retrieval disruption account, suggesting that additional mechanisms also contribute to collaborative inhibition. In the current studies, we examined 2 alternate mechanisms: retrieval inhibition and retrieval blocking. To identify the contributions of retrieval disruption, retrieval inhibition, and retrieval blocking, we tested how collaborative recall of entirely unshared information influences subsequent individual recall and individual recognition memory. If collaborative inhibition is due solely to retrieval disruption, then there should be a release from the negative effects of collaboration on subsequent individual recall and recognition tests. If it is due to retrieval inhibition, then the negative effects of collaboration should persist on both individual recall and recognition memory tests. Finally, if it is due to retrieval blocking, then the impairment should persist on subsequent individual free recall, but not recognition, tests. Novel to the current study, results suggest that retrieval inhibition plays a role in the collaborative inhibition effect. The negative effects of collaboration persisted on a subsequent, always-individual, free-recall test (Experiment 1) and also on a subsequent, always-individual, recognition test (Experiment 2). However, consistent with the retrieval disruption account, this deficit was attenuated (Experiment 1). Together, these results suggest that, in addition to retrieval disruption, multiple mechanisms play a role in collaborative inhibition.

This study investigated the circumstances under which collaboration would influence the likelihood that participants come to share both a similar content and a similar organization of the past by aligning their individual representations into a shared rendering. We tested how the frequency and the timing of collaboration affect participants' retrieval organization, and how this in turn influences the formation of shared memory and its persistence over time. Across numerous foundational and novel analyses, we observed that as the size of the collaborative inhibition effect-a counterintuitive finding that collaboration reduces group recall-increased, so did the amount of shared memory and the shared organization of memories. These findings reveal the interconnected relationship between collaborative inhibition, retrieval disruption, shared memory, and shared organization.

Collaboration also influences collective memory—the overlap in post-collaborative memory among group members. We examined the role of group configuration on such transmission of memory by varying group configuration across repeated recalls. Participants (N = 162) studied words and completed three recall sessions in one of three conditions (N = 54/condition): Individual–Individual–Individual (Control), Collaborative–Collaborative (Identical group)–Individual and Collaborative–Collaborative (Reconfigured group)–Individual. Collaborative inhibition occurred in both the Identical and Reconfigured groups during the first recall but disappeared in the Reconfigured groups during the second recall. Post-collaborative individual memory was greater following Reconfigured than Identical group collaboration. This pattern reversed for collective memories; repeated collaboration increased overlap in the remembered and forgotten items in Identical groups compared to Reconfigured groups. Finally, Reconfigured groups provided a quantifiable index of the influence of distal partners (i.e., no direct collaboration involved) on post-collaborative individual memory.

Third, when emotion facilitates the processing of information, this also facilitates the retention of that same information.

This article takes a psychological approach to understanding diffusion. Using a unique data set of all the New York Times articles published over a three-month period, the authors examine how emotion shapes virality. The results indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral. These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently content was featured). Experimental results further demonstrate the causal impact of specific emotion on transmission and illustrate that it is driven by the level of activation induced.

A candidate explanation for this collaborative inhibition effect is the disruption of people's idiosyncratic retrieval strategies during collaboration, and it is hypothesized that employing methods that improve one's organization protects against retrieval disruption. Here it is investigated how one's learning method during the study phase--defined as either repeatedly studying or repeatedly retrieving information--influences retrieval organization and what effects this has on collaborative recall and post-collaborative individual recall. Results show that repeated retrieval consistently eliminated collaborative inhibition. This enabled participants to gain the most from re-exposure to materials recalled by their partners that they themselves did not recall and led to improvements in their individual memory following collaboration. This repeated retrieval advantage stemmed from the preferential manner in which this learning method strengthened retrieval organization.

In this context, the recent surge in research on the cognitive basis of collaborative memory marks an important conceptual departure. As a first aim, we review these empirical and theoretical advances on the nature and influence of collaborative memory. Effects of collaboration are counterintuitive because individuals remember less when recalling in groups. Collaboration can also lead to forgetting and increase memory errors. Conversely, collaboration can also improve memory under proper conditions. As a second aim, we propose an overarching theoretical framework that specifies the cognitive mechanisms associated with the costs and benefits of collaboration on memory.

Both groups recruited the amygdala and the orbito-frontal cortex during the successful encoding of positive and negative information. Both ages also showed valence-specific recruitment: right fusiform activity was greatest during the successful encoding of negative information, whereas left prefrontal and temporal activity was greatest during the successful encoding of positive information. These valence-specific processes are consistent with behavioral evidence that negative information is processed with perceptual detail, whereas positive information is processed at a conceptual or schematic level. The only age differences in emotional memory emerged during the successful encoding of positive items: Older adults showed more activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and along the cingulate gyrus than young adults.

We will emphasize how the process of repeated retrieval helps to shape our memories. Before we get to our main story, we need to provide some background. Many different cultures exist within the community of scholars who study memory, from humanistic approaches to a whole variety of scientific approaches to the field (see Roediger, Dudai & Fitzpatrick, 2007). In our chapter we attempt to blend some insights from several approaches to studying memory. In particular, we apply the principles that have emerged from research in experimental cognitive psychology to issues in collective memory in hopes that combining insights from various disciplines may point the way to progress in understanding larger issues in the study of memory. Our chapter has six parts. First, we discuss issues in collective memory – how we conceive the topic – by considering three conceptual oppositions (following Wertsch & Roediger, in press). We then discuss how these issues might play out in learning about history from textbooks. Then, we describe three main mechanisms that we believe play a critical role in shaping collective memory: the act of retrieving information from memory; repeated retrieval of information over long periods of time; and finally the role of feedback in modifying memories. The third, fourth, and fifth sections of the chapter spell out these mechanisms and how they might contribute to the creation of collective memories. The sixth section explores the issue of accuracy in collective memory, and how it is affected by the mechanisms of retrieval and feedback.

and Terminology', 'abstract': 'The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) presents a revised operational classification of seizure types. The purpose of such a revision is to recognize that some seizure types can have either a focal or generalized onset, to allow classification when the onset is unobserved, to include some missing seizure types, and to adopt more transparent names. Because current knowledge is insufficient to form a scientifically based classification, the 2017 Classification is operational (practical) and based on the 1981 Classification, extended in 2010. Changes include the following: (1) “partial” becomes “focal”; (2) awareness is used as a classifier of focal seizures; (3) the terms dyscognitive, simple partial, complex partial, psychic, and secondarily generalized are eliminated; (4) new focal seizure types include automatisms, behavior arrest, hyperkinetic, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional; (5) atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, and tonic seizures can be of either focal or generalized onset; (6) focal to bilateral tonic–clonic seizure replaces secondarily generalized seizure; (7) new generalized seizure types are absence with eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic absence, myoclonic–atonic, myoclonic–tonic–clonic; and (8) seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified. The new classification does not represent a fundamental change, but allows greater flexibility and transparency in naming seizure types.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 57, 'citationCount': 2067, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144184955', 'name': 'R.

Objective The aim of this scoping review was to identify and describe social robot interventions in mental health facilities and to highlight their outcomes as well as the barriers and facilitators to their implementation. Methods A scoping review of the literature published since 2015 was conducted using the Arksey and O’Malley’s framework. The MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO databases were searched, and 2239 papers were retrieved. The papers included were primary empirical studies published in peer-reviewed literature. Eligible studies were set in mental health facilities and they included participants with a known mental health disorder. The methodological quality of the included papers was also assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results A total of 30 papers met the eligibility criteria for this review. Studies involved participants with dementia, cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, depression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and an intellectual disability. The outcomes studied included engagement, social interaction, emotional state, agitation, behavior, and quality of life. Conclusions The methodological weaknesses of the studies conducted this far and the lack of diversity in the conditions studied limit the generalizability of the results. However, despite the presence of certain barriers to their implementation (eg, technical problems, unsuitable environment, staff resistance), social robot interventions generally show positive effects on patients with mental health disorders. Studies of stronger methodological quality are needed to further understand the benefits and the place of social robots in mental health care.",2022,82,9,"{'name': 'JMIR Mental Health', 'volume':

In this context, most behavioural interventions are typically short-term in nature. This paper describes a long-term study that was conducted with 11 children diagnosed with either Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or ASD in co-occurrence with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It uses a quantitative analysis based on behavioural measures, including engagement, valence, and eye gaze duration. Each child interacted with a robot on several occasions in which each therapy session was customized to a child’s reaction to robot behaviours. This paper presents a set of robot behaviours that were implemented with the goal to offer a variety of activities to be suitable for diverse forms of autism. Therefore, each child experienced an individualized robot-assisted therapy that was tailored according to the therapist’s knowledge and judgement. The statistical analyses showed that the proposed therapy managed to sustain children’s engagement. In addition, sessions containing familiar activities kept children more engaged compared to those sessions containing unfamiliar activities. The results of the interviews with parents and therapists are discussed in terms of therapy recommendations.

Previous studies show that it is possible to perform some therapy using a robot. This article is a synthesis review of the literature on research with the use of robots in the therapy of children with the diagnosis of early childhood autism. The review includes scientific journals from 2005–2021. Using descriptors: ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders), Social robots, and Robot-based interventions, an analysis of available research in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science was done. The results showed that a robot seems to be a great tool that encourages contact and involvement in joint activities. The review of the literature indicates the potential value of the use of robots in the therapy of people with autism as a facilitator in social contacts. Robot-Assisted Autism Therapy (RAAT) can encourage child to talk or do exercises. In the second aspect (prompting during a conversation), a robot encourages eye contact and suggests possible answers, e.g., during free conversation with a peer. In the third aspect (teaching, entertainment), the robot could play with autistic children in games supporting the development of joint attention. These types of games stimulate the development of motor skills and orientation in the body schema. In future work, a validation test would be desirable to check whether children with ASD are able to do the same with a real person by learning distrust and cheating the robot.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 80, 'citationCount': 10, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2106639879', 'name': 'Barbara Szymona'}, {'authorId': '51054377', 'name': 'M.

Consequences, while globally severe, are acutely pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) confronting pronounced gaps in resources and clinician accessibility. Social robots are well-recognized for their potential to support mental health, yet user compliance (i.e., trust) demands seamless affective human-robot interactions; natural ‘human-like’ conversations are required in simple, inexpensive, deployable platforms. We present the design, development, and pilot testing of a multimodal robotic framework fusing verbal (contextual speech) and nonverbal (facial expressions) social cues, aimed to improve engagement in human-robot interaction and ultimately facilitate mental health telemedicine during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the design optimization of a hybrid face robot, which combines digital facial expressions based on mathematical affect space mapping with static 3D facial features. We further introduce a contextual virtual assistant with integrated cloud-based AI coupled to the robot’s facial representation of emotions, such that the robot adapts its emotional response to users’ speech in real-time. Experiments with healthy participants demonstrate emotion recognition exceeding 90% for happy, tired, sad, angry, surprised and stern/disgusted robotic emotions. When separated, stern and disgusted are occasionally transposed (70%+ accuracy overall) but are easily distinguishable from other emotions. A qualitative user experience analysis indicates overall enthusiastic and engaging reception to human-robot multimodal interaction with the new framework. The robot has been modified to enable clinical telemedicine for cognitive engagement with older adults and people with dementia (PwD) in LMICs. The mechanically simple and low-cost social robot has been deployed in pilot tests to support older individuals and PwD at the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) in Chennai, India. A procedure for deployment addressing challenges in cultural acceptance, end-user acclimatization and resource allocation is further introduced. Results indicate strong promise to stimulate human-robot psychosocial interaction through the hybrid-face robotic system. Future work is targeting deployment for telemedicine to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults and PwD in both LMICs and higher income regions.', 'year': 2021, 'referenceCount': 77, 'citationCount': 20, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1384017213', 'name': 'Maria R.

After 5-min RAA sessions that involved patients interacting with a communication robot, patient emotions and mood states were measured, and resting-state EEG activity and salivary cortisol were assessed before and after RAA. We found that compared with those in the control group, participants in the cognitive decline group did not enjoy RAA using the communication robot. This was corroborated by EEG findings indicating decreased relaxation immediately after RAA exposure. These results suggested that participants with cognitive decline had difficulty understanding the contents of communication with the robot.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an integrative framework and research agenda on the role of companion robots in mitigating feelings of loneliness. Design/methodology/approach: A netnographic analysis of 595 online visual and textual descriptions offer empirical insights about the role of the companion robot Vector during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The contributions of this study are twofold. First, it postulates that companion robots have the potential of mitigating feelings of loneliness (i.e. indicator of well-being). Second, this study contributes to transformative service by developing an integrative framework introducing the roles (personal assistant, relational peer and intimate buddy) that companion robots can fulfill to mitigate feelings of loneliness through building different types of supportive relationships. Research limitations/implications: The proposed research agenda encourages future service scholars to investigate 1) the role of robots in addressing loneliness, 2) design features that drive adoption of robots, 3) social support for different groups, 4) the operationalization and the measurement of loneliness and 5) an impact analysis of companion robots. Practical implications: Service providers and policy makers can leverage the insights about how companion robots can help reduce a sense of loneliness.

The results are largely positive and suggest that they are valuable in enhancing wellbeing, communication and behavioural aspects. However, there has been little research in people’s own homes, possibly due to the cost and complexity of some of the robot pets currently available. As dementia affects people in different ways, this study explores the effects of a robot cat for people in their own homes, without specifically investigating the effects on a particular symptom. We utilised a case study design to investigate the proposition that various factors influence the impact of a robot cat on the person living with dementia and their carer, including acceptability of the robot pet and acceptance of dementia and its symptoms. The qualitative analysis explores the similarities and differences within the data which were gathered during interviews with people with dementia and their families. This analysis revealed four themes: Distraction, Communication, Acceptance and rejection, and Connecting with the cat and connecting with others.

Animal-like social robots are increasingly used in dementia care as they can provide companionship and engage PWD in meaningful activities.

This study aims to explore the effects of contextual interactions between PWD and a social robot embedded in the augmented responsive environment. Three experimental conditions were compared: reactive context-enhanced robot interaction; dynamic context-enhanced interaction with a static robot; a control condition with only the dynamic context presented. Effectiveness evaluations were performed with 16 participants using four observational rating scales on observed engagement, affective states, and apathy related behaviors. Findings suggested that the higher level of interactivity of a social robot and the interactive contextualized feedback helped capture and maintain users’ attention during engagement; however, it did not significantly improve their positive affective states. Additionally, the presence of either a static or a proactive robot reduced apathy-related behaviors by facilitating purposeful activities, thus, motivating behavioral engagement.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 43, 'citationCount': 18, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2150670564', 'name': 'Yuan Feng'}, {'authorId': '145741020', 'name': 'E.

Design: A mixed-methods approach consisting of a single group, before and after quasi-experimental design, and individual interview. Participants: Twenty older adults with depression from four LTC facilities in Taiwan were recruited. Intervention: Each participant participated in 8 weeks of observation and 8 weeks of intervention. In the observation stage, participants received usual care or activities without any research intervention. In the intervention stage, each participant was given a Paro (Personal Assistive RobOt) to keep for 24 hours, 7 days a week. Measurements: The Geriatric Depression Scale, the UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire for older adults were administered at four time points. Individual qualitative interviews with thematic analysis followed. Results: A repeated multivariate analysis of variance and Friedmanʼs test showed no significant changes during the observation stage between T1 and T2 for depression and quality of life (p >.5). For the intervention stage, statistically significant changes in decreasing depression and loneliness and improving quality of life over time were identified. Three themes emerged from the interviews: (i) humanizing Paro through referring to personal experiences and engagement; (ii) increased social interaction with other people; and (iii) companionship resulting in improved mental well-being.

The purpose of our study was to explore the current evidence on barriers and enablers for the implementation of humanoid robots in health and social care. Design Systematic review of studies entailing hands-on interactions with a humanoid robot. Setting From April 2018 to June 2018, databases were searched using a combination of the same search terms for articles published during the last decade. Data collection was conducted by using the Rayyan software, a standardised predefined grid, and a risk of bias and a quality assessment tool. Participants Post-experimental data were collected and analysed for a total of 420 participants. Participants comprised: older adults (n=307) aged ≥60 years, with no or some degree of age-related cognitive impairment, residing either in residential care facilities or at their home; care home staff (n=106); and informal caregivers (n=7). Primary outcomes Identification of enablers and barriers to the implementation of socially assistive humanoid robots in health and social care, and consequent insights and impact. Future developments to inform further research. Results Twelve studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. None of the selected studies had an experimental design; hence overall quality was low, with high risks of biases. Several studies had no comparator, no baseline, small samples, and self-reported measures only. Within this limited evidence base, the enablers found were enjoyment, usability, personalisation and familiarisation. Barriers were related to technical problems, to the robots’ limited capabilities and the negative preconceptions towards the use of robots in healthcare. Factors which produced mixed results were the robot’s human-like attributes, previous experience with technology and views of formal and informal carers. Conclusions The available evidence related to implementation factors of socially assistive humanoid robots for older adults is limited, mainly focusing on aspects at individual level, and exploring acceptance of this technology. Investigation of elements linked to the environment, organisation, societal and cultural milieu, policy and legal framework is necessary.

Current technology platforms delivering interventions are largely mobile apps and online websites, although efforts have been made to create more personalized and embodied technology experiences. To extend and improve on these platforms, the field of robotics has been increasingly included in conversations of how to deliver technology-assisted, interactive, and responsive mental health and psychological well-being interventions. Socially assistive robots (SARs) are robotic technology platforms with audio, visual, and movement capabilities that are being developed to interact with individuals socially while also assisting them with management of their physical and psychological well-being. However, little is known about the empirical evidence or utility of using SARs in mental health interventions. Objective The review synthesizes and describes the nascent empirical literature of SARs in mental health research and identifies strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement in future research and practice. Methods Searches in Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore yielded 12 studies included in the final review after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Abstract and full-text reviews were conducted by two authors independently. Results This systematic review of the literature found 5 distinct SARs used in research to investigate the potential for this technology to address mental health and psychological well-being outcomes.

Objective To bring together the evidence of the experiences of staff, residents and family members of interacting with robopets and the effects of robopets on the health and well‐being of older people living in care homes. Design Systematic review of qualitative and quantitative research. Data sources We searched 13 electronic databases from inception to July 2018 and undertook forward and backward citation chasing. Methods Eligible studies reported the views and experiences of robopets from residents, family members and staff (qualitative studies using recognised methods of qualitative data collection and analysis) and the effects of robopets on the health and well‐being of care home residents (randomised controlled trials, randomised crossover trials and cluster randomised trials). Study selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers. We used the Wallace criteria and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the quality of the evidence. We developed a logic model with stakeholders and used this as a framework to guide data extraction and synthesis. Where appropriate, we used meta‐analysis to combine effect estimates from quantitative studies. Results Nineteen studies (10 qualitative, 2 mixed methods and 7 randomised trials) met the inclusion criteria. Interactions with robopets were described as having a positive impact on aspects of well‐being including loneliness, depression and quality of life by residents and staff, although there was no corresponding statistically significant evidence from meta‐analysis for these outcomes. Meta‐analysis showed evidence of a reduction in agitation with the robopet “Paro” compared to control (−0.32 [95% CI −0.61 to −0.04, p = 0.03]). Not everyone had a positive experience of robopets. Conclusions Engagement with robopets appears to have beneficial effects on the health and well‐being of older adults living in care homes, but not all chose to engage. Whether the benefits can be sustained are yet to be investigated. Implications for practice Robopets have the potential to benefit people living in care homes, through increasing engagement and interaction.

The data similarity was determined by comparing these index values using Bland-Altman plots, Cohen’s kappa (κ) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Acceptability was assessed using questionnaires. Results The mean robot interview duration was 16.57\u2009min (SD=1.53\u2009min), which was not significantly longer than the nurse interviews (14.92\u2009min, SD=8.47\u2009min; p=0.19). The three Bland-Altman plots showed moderate to substantial agreement between the frailty, well-being and resilience scores (κ=0.61, 0.50 and 0.45, and ICC=0.79, 0.86 and 0.66, respectively). The robot autonomously completed 39 of 42 interviews (92.8%).

Design Scoping review. Data sources Engineering Village, IEEE Xplore, Medline, PsycINFO and Scopus databases were searched up until 10 July 2017. Only publications written in English were considered. Identified publications were initially screened by title and abstract, and the full texts of remaining publications were then subsequently screened. Eligibility criteria Publications were included if they were journal articles, conference proceedings or conference proceedings published as monographs that described the conceptualisation, development, testing or evaluation of social robots for use with children with any mental or physical health condition or disability. Publications on autism exclusively, robots for use with children without identified health conditions, physically assistive or mechanical robots, non-physical hardware robots and surgical robots were excluded. Results Seventy-three publications were included in the review, of which 50 included user studies with a range of samples. Most were feasibility studies with small sample sizes, suggesting that the robots were generally accepted. At least 26 different robots were used, with many of these still in development. The most commonly used robot was NAO. The evidence quality was low, with only one randomised controlled trial and a limited number of experimental designs.

With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.', 'year': 2018, 'referenceCount': 101, 'citationCount': 208, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46217950', 'name': 'A.

They may examine the extent (that is, size), range (variety), and nature (characteristics) of the evidence on a topic or question; determine the value of undertaking a systematic review; summarize findings from a body of knowledge that is heterogeneous in methods or discipline; or identify gaps in the literature to aid the planning and commissioning of future research (1, 2). A recent scoping review by members of our team suggested that although the number of scoping reviews in the literature is increasing steadily, methodological and reporting quality needs to improve in order to facilitate complete and transparent reporting (1). Results from a survey on scoping review terminology, definitions, and methods showed a lack of consensus on how to conduct and report scoping reviews (3). The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) published a guidance document for the conduct of scoping reviews (4) (updated in 2017 [5]) based on earlier work by Arksey and O'Malley (6) and Levac and colleagues (7). However, a reporting guideline for scoping reviews currently does not exist. Reporting guidelines outline a minimum set of items to include in research reports and have been shown to increase methodological transparency and uptake of research findings (8, 9). Although a reporting guideline exists for systematic reviewsthe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement (10)scoping reviews serve a different purpose (11). Systematic reviews are useful for answering clearly defined questions (for example, Does this intervention improve specified outcomes when compared with a given comparator in this population?), whereas scoping reviews are useful for answering much broader questions (such as What is the nature of the evidence for this intervention? or What is known about this concept?). Given the difference in objectives, and therefore in the methodological approach (such as presence vs. absence of a risk-of-bias assessment or meta-analysis), scoping reviews should have different essential reporting items from systematic reviews. Consequently, some PRISMA items may not be appropriate, whereas other important considerations may be missing (1214). It was decided that a PRISMA extension for scoping reviews was needed to provide reporting guidance for this specific type of knowledge synthesis. This extension is also intended to apply to evidence maps (15, 16), which share similarities with scoping reviews and involve a systematic search of a body of literature to identify knowledge gaps, with a visual representation of results (such as a figure or graph). Methods The PRISMA-ScR (PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews) was developed according to published guidance by the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network for the development of reporting guidelines (9). The St. Michael's Hospital Research Ethics Board granted research ethics approval for this study on 15 August 2016. Protocol, Advisory Board, and Expert Panel Our protocol was drafted by the research team and revised as necessary by the advisory board before being listed as a reporting guideline on the EQUATOR (17) and PRISMA (18) Web sites. The research team included 2 leads (A.C.T. and S.E.S.) and 2 research coordinators (E.L. and W.Z.), none of whom participated in the scoring exercises, and a 4-member advisory board (K.K.O., H.C., D.L., and D.M.) with extensive experience doing scoping reviews or developing reporting guidelines. We aimed to form an expert panel of approximately 30 members that would be representative of different geography and stakeholder types and research experiences, including persons with experience in the conduct, dissemination, or uptake of scoping reviews. Survey Development and Round 1 of Delphi The initial step in developing the Delphi survey via Qualtrics (an online survey platform) (19) involved identifying potential modifications to the original 27-item PRISMA checklist. The modifications were based on a research program carried out by members of the advisory board to better understand scoping review practices (1, 3, 20) and included a broader research question and literature search strategy, optional risk-of-bias assessment and consultation exercise (whereby relevant stakeholders contribute to the work, as described by Arksey and O'Malley [6]), and a qualitative analysis. For round 1 of scoring, we prepared a draft of the PRISMA-ScR (Supplement) and asked expert panel members to rate their agreement with each of the proposed reporting items using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = entirely disagree, 2 = mostly disagree, 3 = somewhat disagree, 4 = neutral, 5 = somewhat agree, 6 = mostly agree, and 7 = entirely agree). Each survey item included an optional text box where respondents could provide comments. The research team calibrated the survey for content and clarity before administering it and sent biweekly reminders to optimize participation. Supplement. PRISMA-ScR Round 1 Survey (With Information Sheet) Survey Analysis To be conservative, a threshold for 85% agreement was established a priori for each of the reporting items to indicate consensus among the expert panel. This rule required that at least 85% of the panel mostly or entirely agreed (values of 6 or 7 on the Likert scale) with the inclusion of the item in the PRISMA-ScR. If agreement was less than 85%, it was considered to be discrepant. This standard was used for all 3 rounds of scoring to inform the final checklist. For ease and consistency with how the survey questions were worded, we did not include a provision for agreement on exclusion (that is, 85% of answers corresponding to values of 1 or 2 on the Likert scale). All comments were summarized to help explain the scorings and identify any issues. For the analysis, the results were stratified by group (in-person meeting vs. online, hereafter e-Delphi) because discrepant items could differ between groups. In-Person Group (Round 2 of Delphi) The Chatham House rule (21) was established at the beginning of the meeting, whereby participants were free to use information that is shared but were not permitted to reveal the identity or affiliation of the speaker. Expert panel members were given their individual results; the overall group distribution, median, and interquartile range; a summary of the JBI methodological guidance (4); and preliminary feedback from the e-Delphi group. These data were used to generate and inform the discussion about each discrepant item from round 1. Two researchers (A.C.T. and S.E.S.) facilitated the discussion using a modified nominal group technique (22) to reach consensus. Panel members were subsequently asked to rescore the discrepant items using sli.do (23), a live audience-response system in a format that resembled the round 1 survey. For items that failed to meet the threshold for consensus, working groups were assembled. The meeting was audio-recorded and transcribed using TranscribeMe (24), and 3 note-takers independently documented the main discussion points. The transcript was annotated to complement a master summary of the discussion points, which was compiled using the 3 note-takers' files. E-Delphi Group (Round 2 of Delphi) Those who could not attend the in-person meeting participated via an online discussion exercise using Conceptboard (25), a visual collaboration platform that allows users to provide feedback on whiteboards in real time. The discrepant items from round 1 were presented as a single whiteboard, and questions (for example, After reviewing your survey results with respect to this item, please share why you rated this item the way you did) were assigned to participants as tasks to facilitate the discussion. E-Delphi panel members received the same materials as in-person participants and were encouraged to respond to others' comments and interact through a chat feature. The second round of scoring was done in Qualtrics using a similar format as in round 1. A summary of the Conceptboard discussion, as well as the annotated meeting transcript and master summary document, were shared so that participants could learn about the perspectives of the in-person group before rescoring. Working Groups and Round 3 of Delphi To enable panel-wide dialogue and refine the checklist items before the final round of scoring, working groups were created and collaborated by teleconference and e-mail. Their task was to discuss the discrepant items in terms of the key issues and considerations (relating to both concepts and wording) that had been raised in earlier stages across both groups. To harmonize the data from the 2 groups, a third round of scoring exercise was administered using Qualtrics (19). In this step, suggested modifications (in terms of both concepts and wording) from all previous stages were incorporated into the items that had failed to reach consensus in the first 2 rounds across both groups, and the full panel scored this updated list. Interactive Workshop (Testing) A workshop led by the lead investigator (A.C.T.) and facilitated by members of the advisory board and expert panel (S.E.S., C.M.G., C.G., T.H., M.T.M., and M.D.J.P.) was held as part of the Global Evidence Summit in Cape Town, South Africa, in September 2017. Participants (researchers, scientists, policymakers, managers, and students) tested the checklist by applying the PRISMA-ScR to a scoping review on a health-related topic (26). Role of the Funding Source This work was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The funding source had no role in designing the study; collecting, analyzing, or interpreting the data; writing the manuscript; or deciding to submit it for publication. Results Expert Panel A total of 37 persons were invited to participate, of whom 31 completed round 1 and 24 completed all 3 rounds of scoring.

International recommendations stress nonpharmacological interventions as first-line treatment. While newer psychosocial initiatives adapted to geriatric populations based on social robot therapy have emerged, to our knowledge, no studies on differential efficacy depending on BPSD profiles have been conducted yet. Objectives This pilot study examined the impact of short exposure to a social robot (Paro®) on the subjective emotional well-being of patients with major neurocognitive disorder as well as its impact on differential effects for 3 BPSD profiles. Methods Seventeen patients with major NCD with apathy (n=6), depression (n=7), and agitation (n=4) were recruited. The intervention was composed of four 15-minute individual sessions. Exposure occurred without the simultaneous presence of a health care provider. A pre–post assessment of emotional well-being was conducted with the International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short-Form, which measures positive and negative affectivity. Results Overall findings showed a significant increase of positive affectivity (p=0.02). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that agitated patients reduced negative affectivity significantly more than depressed patients (p=0.03). Results also confirmed users’ overall acceptability of the robot. Conclusion These findings support the usefulness of brief interactive sessions with the Paro robot for elderly patients with major NCD.

Adherence to medication and availability of rehabilitation are suboptimal in this patient group, which increases the risk of hospitalization. Objective This pilot study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a robot delivering telehealth care to increase adherence to medication and home rehabilitation, improve quality of life, and reduce hospital readmission compared with a standard care control group. Methods At discharge from hospital for a COPD admission, 60 patients were randomized to receive a robot at home for 4 months or to a control group. Number of hospitalization days for respiratory admissions over the 4-month study period was the primary outcome. Medication adherence, frequency of rehabilitation exercise, and quality of life were also assessed. Implementation interviews as well as benefit-cost analysis were conducted. Results Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses showed no significant differences in the number of respiratory-related hospitalizations between groups. The intervention group was more adherent to their long-acting inhalers (mean number of prescribed puffs taken per day=48.5%) than the control group (mean 29.5%, P=.03, d=0.68) assessed via electronic recording. Self-reported adherence was also higher in the intervention group after controlling for covariates (P=.04). The intervention group increased their rehabilitation exercise frequency compared with the control group (mean difference −4.53, 95% CI −7.16 to −1.92). There were no significant differences in quality of life. Of the 25 patients who had the robot, 19 had favorable attitudes. Conclusions This pilot study suggests that a homecare robot can improve adherence to medication and increase exercise. Further research is needed with a larger sample size to further investigate effects on hospitalizations after improvements are made to the robots. The robots could be especially useful for patients struggling with adherence.

This poses several impediments in the delivery of high-quality health and social care. Socially assistive robot (SAR) technology could assume new roles in health and social care to meet this higher demand. This review qualitatively examines the literature on the use of SAR in elderly care and aims to establish the roles this technology may play in the future. Design Scoping review. Data sources Search of CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Scopus databases was conducted, complemented with a free search using Google Scholar and reference harvesting. All publications went through a selection process, which involved sequentially reviewing the title, abstract and full text of the publication. No limitations regarding date of publication were imposed, and only English publications were taken into account. The main search was conducted in March 2016, and the latest search was conducted in September 2017. Eligibility criteria The inclusion criteria consist of elderly participants, any elderly healthcare facility, humanoid and pet robots and all social interaction types with the robot. Exclusions were acceptability studies, technical reports of robots and publications surrounding physically or surgically assistive robots. Results In total, 61 final publications were included in the review, describing 33 studies and including 1574 participants and 11 robots. 28 of the 33 papers report positive findings. Five roles of SAR were identified: affective therapy, cognitive training, social facilitator, companionship and physiological therapy. Conclusions Although many positive outcomes were reported, a large proportion of the studies have methodological issues, which limit the utility of the results. Nonetheless, the reported value of SAR in elderly care does warrant further investigation. Future studies should endeavour to validate the roles demonstrated in this review.

Due to the abundance of devices and ease of access they subsequently allow, the utility of mobile health (mHealth) has never been more endemic. A substantial amount of interactive and psychoeducational apps are readily available to download concerning a wide range of health issues. mHealth has the potential to reduce waiting times for appointments; eradicate the need to meet in person with a clinician, successively diminishing the workload of mental health professionals; be more cost effective to practices; and encourage self-care tactics. Previous research has given valid evidence with empirical studies proving the effectiveness of physical and mental health interventions using mobile apps. Alongside apps, there is evidence to show that receiving short message service (SMS) messages, which entail psychoeducation, medication reminders, and links to useful informative Web pages can also be advantageous to a patient’s mental and physical well-being. Available mHealth apps and SMS services and their ever improving quality necessitates a systematic review in the area in reference to reduction of symptomology, adherence to intervention, and usability. Objective The aim of this review was to study the efficacy, usability, and feasibility of mobile apps and SMS messages as mHealth interventions for self-guided care. Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in JMIR, PubMed, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and SAGE. The search spanned from January 2008 to January 2017. The primary outcome measures consisted of weight management, (pregnancy) smoking cessation, medication adherence, depression, anxiety and stress. Where possible, adherence, feasibility, and usability outcomes of the apps or SMS services were evaluated. Between-group and within-group effect sizes (Cohen d) for the mHealth intervention method group were determined. Results A total of 27 studies, inclusive of 4658 participants were reviewed. The papers included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=19), within-group studies (n=7), and 1 within-group study with qualitative aspect. Studies show improvement in physical health and significant reductions of anxiety, stress, and depression. Within-group and between-group effect sizes ranged from 0.05-3.37 (immediately posttest), 0.05-3.25 (1-month follow-up), 0.08-3.08 (2-month follow-up), 0.00-3.10 (3-month follow-up), and 0.02-0.27 (6-month follow-up). Usability and feasibility of mHealth interventions, where reported, also gave promising, significant results.

The eight‐session intervention program was based on the discrete trial teaching protocol and focused on two basic social skills: eye contact and facial emotion recognition. The robotic interactions occurred in four modules: training element query, recognition of human activity, coping‐mode selection, and follow‐up action. Children with ASD who were between 4 and 7 years old and who had verbal IQ\u2009≥\u200960 were recruited and randomly assigned to the treatment group (TG, n\u2009=\u20098, 5.75\u2009±\u20090.89 years) or control group (CG, n\u2009=\u20097; 6.32\u2009±\u20091.23 years). The therapeutic robot facilitated the treatment intervention in the TG, and the human assistant facilitated the treatment intervention in the CG. The intervention procedures were identical in both groups. The primary outcome measures included parent‐completed questionnaires, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and frequency of eye contact, which was measured with the partial interval recording method. After completing treatment, the eye contact percentages were significantly increased in both groups. For facial emotion recognition, the percentages of correct answers were increased in similar patterns in both groups compared to baseline (P\u2009>\u20090.05), with no difference between the TG and CG (P\u2009>\u20090.05). The subjects’ ability to play, general behavioral and emotional symptoms were significantly diminished after treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.05). These results showed that the robot‐facilitated and human‐facilitated behavioral interventions had similar positive effects on eye contact and facial emotion recognition, which suggested that robots are useful mediators of social skills training for children with ASD.

Recent promising robot-based innovations in mental health care suggest that robot-based animal assisted therapy (AAT) could be useful to improve social skills and mood in people with moderate to severe ID. This study explores the efficacy of the innovative therapeutic robot seal Paro on alertness and mood in adults with moderate to severe ID. Method: Five N = 1 studies were performed in adults (59–70 years) with moderate to severe ID. During a control phase of four weeks, participants could interact with a plush seal, which was replaced by the robot seal Paro during an equally long treatment phase. Results: In one participant, alertness and mood, as rated by supervisors, improved during the treatment phase as compared to the baseline phase. The other four participants did not improve on either of the outcome measures.

Although these robots are not yet reality, robots are currently being used in healthcare, education, and business. Robots provide benefits such as relieving loneliness and enabling communication. Engineers are trying to build robots that look and behave like humans and thus need comprehensive knowledge not only of technology but also of human cognition, emotion, and behavior. This need is driving engineers to study human behavior toward other humans and toward robots, leading to greater understanding of how humans think, feel, and behave in these contexts, including our tendencies for mindless social behaviors, anthropomorphism, uncanny feelings toward robots, and the formation of emotional attachments. However, in considering the increased use of robots, many people have concerns about deception, privacy, job loss, safety, and the loss of human relationships.

Pet therapy has been known to be emotionally beneficial for many years. Robotic pets have been shown to have similar positive effects without the negative aspects of traditional pets. Robotic pet therapy offers an alternative to traditional pet therapy. Objective: The study rigorously assesses the effectiveness of the PARO robotic pet, an FDA approved biofeedback device, in treating dementia-related symptoms. Methods: A randomized block design with repeated measurements guided the study. Before and after measures included reliable, valid tools such as: RAID, CSDD, GDS, pulse rate, pulse oximetry, and GSR. Participants interacted with the PARO robotic pet, and the control group received standard activity programs. Five urban secure dementia units comprised the setting. Results: 61 patients, with 77% females, average 83.4 years in age, were randomized into control and treatment groups. Compared to the control group, RAID, CSDD, GSR, and pulse oximetry were increased in the treatment group, while pulse rate, pain medication, and psychoactive medication use were decreased. The changes in GSR, pulse oximetry, and pulse rate over time were plotted for both groups. The difference between groups was consistent throughout the 12-week study for pulse oximetry and pulse rate, while GSR had several weeks when changes were similar between groups.

Objectives Assistive social robots are believed to be useful in eldercare for two reasons, a functional one and an affective one. Such robots are developed to function as an interface for the elderly with digital technology, and to help increase the quality of life of the elderly by providing companionship, respectively. There is a growing attention for these devices in the literature. However, no comprehensive review has yet been performed to investigate the effectiveness of such robots in the care of the elderly. Therefore, we systematically reviewed and analyzed existing literature on the effects of assistive social robots in health care for the elderly. We focused in particular on the companion function. Data Sources A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library databases, IEEE, ACM libraries and finally Google Scholar was performed for records through December 2007 to identify articles of all studies with actual subjects aimed to assess the effects of assistive social robots on the elderly. This search was completed with information derived from personal expertise, contacts and reports. Study Selection and Data Extraction Since no randomized controlled trials (RCT)’s have been found within this field of research, all studies reporting effects of assistive robotics in elderly populations were included. Information on study design, interventions, controls, and findings were extracted for each article. In medical journals only a few articles were found, whereas about 50 publications were found in literature on ICT and robotics. Data Synthesis The identified studies were all published after 2000 indicating the novelty of this area of research. Most of these publications contain the results of studies that report positive effects of assistive social robots on health and psychological well-being of elders. Solid evidence indicating that these effects can indeed be attributed to the actual assistive social robot, its behavior and its functionality is scarce. Conclusions There is some qualitative evidence as well as limited quantitative evidence of the positive effects of assistive social robots with respect to the elderly. The research designs, however, are not robust enough to establish this. Confounding variables often cannot be excluded. This is partly due to the chosen research designs, but also because it is unclear what research methodology is adequate to investigate such effects. Therefore, more work on methods is needed as well as robust, large-scale studies to establish the effects of these devices.', 'year': 2009, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 878, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1735303', 'name': 'J.

Novel technologies such as social robot interventions might be useful to engage people with dementia in activities and interactions as well as to improve their cognitive, emotional, and physical status. Objective: Assessing the effects and the quality of reporting of social robot interventions for people with dementia. Methods: In our systematic review, we included quasi-experimental and experimental studies published in English, French, or German, irrespective of publication year. Searching CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection was supplemented by citation tracking and free web searching. To assess the methodological quality of included studies, we used tools provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute. To assess the reporting of the interventions, we applied CReDECI 2 and TIDieR. Results: We identified sixteen studies published between 2012 and 2018, including two to 415 participants with mostly non-defined type of dementia. Eight studies had an experimental design. The predominant robot types were pet robots (i.e., PARO). Most studies addressed behavioral, emotion-related, and functional outcomes with beneficial, non-beneficial, and mixed results. Predominantly, cognitive outcomes were not improved. Overall, studies were of moderate methodological quality. Conclusion: Heterogeneous populations, intervention characteristics, and measured outcomes make it difficult to generalize the results with regard to clinical practice. The impact of social robot interventions on behavioral, emotion-related, and functional outcomes should therefore be assessed considering the severity of dementia and intervention

Still, the evidence for people with dementia in home care is unclear because a lot of studies are performed in a laboratory or institutional setting, and mainly use robots in prototype stages. Objective This study aims to explore the effects of the refined, commercially-available, humanoid SAR Pepper combined with a tablet PC–based dementia training program (Coach Pepper) versus an exclusively tablet PC–based dementia training program on psychosocial and physical outcomes of people with dementia living at home, including caregivers and dementia trainers. We hypothesize that Coach Pepper has a more positive effect on the primary outcome motivation (stable or decreased apathy) of people with dementia. Methods A mixed methods study will be performed, including a randomized controlled, parallel, 2-arm study with a complementary qualitative part. This sample includes 40 PWD living at home and 40 relatives, each complemented with five professional caregivers and dementia trainers. The intervention group will receive Coach Pepper (a SAR connected with a tablet PC–based dementia training program), and the control group will receive exclusively tablet PC–based training without the SAR. The duration of the intervention will be three weeks per household. Data will be collected at baseline and during and after the intervention by standardized questionnaires, sensor data of the robot, and tablet PC, as well as semistructured interviews, focus groups, and observation. Results To date, no results are available for this study protocol. The study intervention started in May 2019 and will end in Spring 2020. Conclusions The intervention of this study can be seen as a nonpharmacological intervention, including cognitive and physical training by a robot. This study will help to further refine SAR for the specific needs of people with dementia living at home.

The purpose of our study was to explore the current evidence on barriers and enablers for the implementation of humanoid robots in health and social care. Design Systematic review of studies entailing hands-on interactions with a humanoid robot. Setting From April 2018 to June 2018, databases were searched using a combination of the same search terms for articles published during the last decade. Data collection was conducted by using the Rayyan software, a standardised predefined grid, and a risk of bias and a quality assessment tool. Participants Post-experimental data were collected and analysed for a total of 420 participants. Participants comprised: older adults (n=307) aged ≥60 years, with no or some degree of age-related cognitive impairment, residing either in residential care facilities or at their home; care home staff (n=106); and informal caregivers (n=7). Primary outcomes Identification of enablers and barriers to the implementation of socially assistive humanoid robots in health and social care, and consequent insights and impact. Future developments to inform further research. Results Twelve studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. None of the selected studies had an experimental design; hence overall quality was low, with high risks of biases. Several studies had no comparator, no baseline, small samples, and self-reported measures only. Within this limited evidence base, the enablers found were enjoyment, usability, personalisation and familiarisation. Barriers were related to technical problems, to the robots’ limited capabilities and the negative preconceptions towards the use of robots in healthcare. Factors which produced mixed results were the robot’s human-like attributes, previous experience with technology and views of formal and informal carers. Conclusions The available evidence related to implementation factors of socially assistive humanoid robots for older adults is limited, mainly focusing on aspects at individual level, and exploring acceptance of this technology. Investigation of elements linked to the environment, organisation, societal and cultural milieu, policy and legal framework is necessary.

This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of AT in improving the safety of people with dementia living in the domestic setting, by searching for randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials and controlled before-after studies which compared safety AT with treatment as usual. Measures of safety include care home admission; risky behaviours, accidents and falls at home; and numbers of deaths. The review updates the safety aspect of Fleming and Sum's 2014 systematic review. Method: Seven bibliographic databases, the Social Care Institute for Excellence website and the Alzheimer's Society website were searched for published and unpublished literature between 2011–2016. Search terms related to AT, dementia and older people. Common outcomes were meta-analysed. Results: Three randomised controlled trials were identified, including 245 people with dementia. No significant differences were found between intervention and control groups in care home admission (risk ratio 0.85 95% CI [0.37, 1.97]; Z = 0.37; p = 0.71).

Current technology platforms delivering interventions are largely mobile apps and online websites, although efforts have been made to create more personalized and embodied technology experiences. To extend and improve on these platforms, the field of robotics has been increasingly included in conversations of how to deliver technology-assisted, interactive, and responsive mental health and psychological well-being interventions. Socially assistive robots (SARs) are robotic technology platforms with audio, visual, and movement capabilities that are being developed to interact with individuals socially while also assisting them with management of their physical and psychological well-being. However, little is known about the empirical evidence or utility of using SARs in mental health interventions. Objective The review synthesizes and describes the nascent empirical literature of SARs in mental health research and identifies strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement in future research and practice.

Systematic reviews evaluating the effects of complex health interventions can be challenging to conduct. This paper is part of a special series of papers considering these challenges particularly in the context of WHO guideline development. We outline established and innovative methods for synthesising quantitative evidence within a systematic review of a complex intervention, including considerations of the complexity of the system into which the intervention is introduced. We describe methods in three broad areas: non-quantitative approaches, including tabulation, narrative and graphical approaches; standard meta-analysis methods, including meta-regression to investigate study-level moderators of effect; and advanced synthesis methods, in which models allow exploration of intervention components, investigation of both moderators and mediators, examination of mechanisms, and exploration of complexities of the system. We offer guidance on the choice of approach that might be taken by people collating evidence in support of guideline development, and emphasise that the appropriate methods will depend on the purpose of the synthesis, the similarity of the studies included in the review, the level of detail available from the studies, the nature of the results reported in the studies, the expertise of the synthesis team and the resources available.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 105, 'citationCount': 107, 'authors': [{'authorId': '27367111', 'name': 'J.

International recommendations stress nonpharmacological interventions as first-line treatment. While newer psychosocial initiatives adapted to geriatric populations based on social robot therapy have emerged, to our knowledge, no studies on differential efficacy depending on BPSD profiles have been conducted yet. Objectives This pilot study examined the impact of short exposure to a social robot (Paro®) on the subjective emotional well-being of patients with major neurocognitive disorder as well as its impact on differential effects for 3 BPSD profiles. Methods Seventeen patients with major NCD with apathy (n=6), depression (n=7), and agitation (n=4) were recruited. The intervention was composed of four 15-minute individual sessions. Exposure occurred without the simultaneous presence of a health care provider. A pre–post assessment of emotional well-being was conducted with the International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short-Form, which measures positive and negative affectivity. Results Overall findings showed a significant increase of positive affectivity (p=0.02). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that agitated patients reduced negative affectivity significantly more than depressed patients (p=0.03). Results also confirmed users’ overall acceptability of the robot. Conclusion These findings support the usefulness of brief interactive sessions with the Paro robot for elderly patients with major NCD.

This paper presents a mixed-method integrative review of telepresence robots used to improve social connection of people with dementia by enabling real-time communication with their carers. Methods: A systematic search of Medline, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library was conducted to gather available evidence on the use of telepresence robots, specifically videoconferencing, to improve social connectedness, in people with dementia. A narrative synthesis was used to analyze the included studies. Results: A review of 1,035 records, identified four eligible peer-reviewed publications, reporting findings about three different mobile telepresence robots. The study designs included qualitative and mixed-methods approaches, focusing primarily on examining the feasibility and acceptability of the telepresence robots within the context of dementia care. These studies reported both positive outcomes of using telepresence robots to connect people with dementia to others, as well as barriers, such as a lack of experience in using a robot and technological issues. Conclusion: Although limited, the current literature suggests that telepresence robots have potential utility for improving social connectedness of people with dementia and their carers.

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction."", 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 34, 'authors': [{'authorId': '19560809', 'name': 'Natacha Rouaix'}, {'authorId': '1422471008', 'name': 'Laure Retru-Chavastel'}, {'authorId': '2012138', 'name': 'A.

Objective: The study rigorously assesses the effectiveness of the PARO robotic pet, an FDA approved biofeedback device, in treating dementia-related symptoms. Methods: A randomized block design with repeated measurements guided the study. Before and after measures included reliable, valid tools such as: RAID, CSDD, GDS, pulse rate, pulse oximetry, and GSR. Participants interacted with the PARO robotic pet, and the control group received standard activity programs. Five urban secure dementia units comprised the setting. Results: 61 patients, with 77% females, average 83.4 years in age, were randomized into control and treatment groups.

Cox proportional hazards models were developed to assess the effect of healthcare discipline and source journal on the primary outcome.\n\n\nRESULTS\nData were collected for 19,259 articles, of which 78.7%, 12.6%, and 8.7% originated from medical, nursing, and pharmacy journals, respectively. For medical, pharmacy, and nursing journals, 97.8%, 90.8%, and 50.1% of articles, respectively, were indexed within one year of PubMed entry; the corresponding median (interquartile range) times to indexing were 52 (20-68), 186 (150-246), and 252 (168-301) days. Unadjusted hazard ratios derived from Cox models indicated that indexing within one year was significantly less likely for articles published in pharmacy or nursing journals versus medical journals and for articles from all evaluated journals versus a designated reference publication (New England Journal of Medicine).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAnalysis of major medical, nursing, and pharmacy journals found that articles from nursing and pharmacy journals were indexed with MeSH terms more slowly than articles from medical journals. Journal identity was significantly associated with time to indexing.', 'year': 2016, 'referenceCount': 7, 'citationCount': 18, 'authors': [{'authorId': '31914488', 'name': 'Ryan Rodriguez'}]}, {'paperId': 'd94cad39cbb8037ddd91fcf44a497eaa98b8075b', 'title': 'Guidance on the use of logic models in health technology assessments of complex interventions', 'abstract': 'Challenges in assessments of health technologies \nIn recent years there have been major advances in the development of health technology assessment (HTA). However, HTA still has certain limitations when assessing technologies, which \nﬁ are complex, i.e. consist of several interacting components, target different groups or organisational levels, have multiple and variable outcomes, and/or permit a certain degree of flexibility or tailoring; \nﬁ are context-dependent, with HTA usually focusing on the technology rather than on the system within which it is used; \nﬁ perform differently depending on the way they are implemented; and/or \nﬁ have distinct effects on different individuals. \nLogic models are one important means of conceptualising and handling complexity in HTAs or systematic reviews (SRs) of complex technologies, as well as integrating the findings of multi-component HTAs. A logic model is described as “… a graphic description of a system … designed to identify important elements and relationships within that system”. When evaluating complex health technologies, logic models can serve an instrumental purpose at every stage of the HTA/SR process, from scoping the topic of the HTA/SR, including formulating the question and defining the intervention; conducting the HTA/SR; interpreting results and making the HTA/SR relevant for decision makers to implement in policy and practice. \nPurpose and scope of the guidance \nThis guidance is targeted at commissioners, producers and users of guidelines, HTAs and SRs with an interest in using logic models as an overarching framework for their work. It aims to make the use of logic models as straightforward as possible by facilitating the systematic identification or development as well as utilisation of different types and sub-types of logic models. In principle, logic models are a useful tool in any kind of SR or HTA, as they aid with the conceptualisation of the intervention and the review question. This is particularly useful for complex technologies, where conceptualising the intervention and its implementation within a system is critical. In addition, logic models can enhance communication within the HTA/SR team and with relevant stakeholders. \nThree types of logic model are described: With a priori logic models the logic model is specified upfront and remains unchanged during the HTA/SR process. With iterative logic models the logic model is subject to continual modification throughout the course of an HTA/SR. The staged logic model harnesses the strengths of both a priori and iterative approaches by pre-specifying revision points at which major data inputs are anticipated. In \n| 6 \naddition, two subtypes are identified, namely logic models that seek to represent structure (system-based) and those that focus on processes or activities (process-orientated). \nThis guidance offers direction on how to choose between distinct types and sub-types of logic models, describes each logic model type and its application in detail, and provides templates for getting started with the development of an HTA/SR-specific logic model. \nDevelopment of the guidance \nThis guidance was informed by a combination of (i) systematic searches for published examples of logic models supplemented by purposive sampling of iterative logic modelling approaches; (ii) searches for existing guidance on the use of logic models in primary research, SRs and HTAs; (iii) development of two draft templates for system-based and process-orientated logic models in an iterative process within the research team and in consultation with external methodological experts; and (iv) application of these draft templates in multiple SRs and one HTA of different complex health technologies covering technical, educational and policy interventions in environmental health, e-learning for health professionals and models of palliative care. \nApplication of this guidance \nFor a comprehensive integrated assessment of a complex technology we have developed a five step process, the INTEGRATE-HTA model. In Step 1 the HTA objective and the technology are defined with the support from a panel of stakeholders. A system-based logic model is developed in Step 2. It provides a structured overview of technology, the context, implementation issues, and relevant patient groups. It then frames the assessment of the effectiveness, as well as economic, ethical, legal, and socio-cultural aspects in Step 3. In Step 4 a graphical overview of the assessment results, structured by the logic model, is provided. Step 5 is a structured decision-making process informed by the HTA (and is thus not formally part of the HTA but follows it). Logic models therefore form an integral element of the INTEGRATE-HTA model but may also be useful in individual steps. \nThis guidance starts off by offering support in identifying and, as needed, adapting existing logic models from the literature or developing an HTA-/SR-specific logic model de novo. In either case, the user will need to decide upfront whether to pursue an a priori, staged or iterative approach to logic modelling, and the guidance offers criteria on how to decide between these distinct types of logic modelling. The system-based and process-orientated logic model templates provide a starting point for the de novo development of either type of logic model. The guidance also discusses the advantages and drawbacks of adopting the system-based or process-orientated sub-type, and offers some general considerations in applying logic models, such as the variety of data sources used, transparency in reporting and necessary trade-offs between comprehensiveness and complexity of the logic model in communicating with stakeholders. \nFor a priori logic modelling, a six-step process comprises: (1) defining the PICO elements of the HTA/SR as well as relevant aspect of context and implementation; (2) deciding on a system- vs. process-orientated logic model subtype with the former focusing on a conceptualization of the question and the latter more concerned with an explanation of the pathways from the intervention to the outcomes; (3) populating the logic model template with information obtained through literature searches, discussions within the author team and consultations with content experts; (4) asking stakeholders for input and refining the logic model accordingly; (5) repeating steps 3 and 4 until all members of the author team agree that the logic model accurately represents the framework for the specific HTA/SR; and (6) publishing the final logic model with the protocol of the HTA or SR. This logic model remains unchanged during the HTA/SR process. \nFor iterative logic modelling, a five-step process includes: (1) creating an initial logic model as a starting point for subsequent exploration, where a logic model template is used to create an initial logic model de novo; (2) identifying data on the whole system or entire process, or on individual components of the model, where data may come from stakeholders, the review team, ongoing primary research or the published literature; (3) making \n7 | \nchanges to the initial logic model repeatedly and at any point of the review and documenting these changes carefully; (4) creating a new numbered version of the logic model, where changes are considered substantive or stepwise; and (5) recording a definitive version of the logic model for the purpose of publication within the final HTA/SR report. It is recognised that this version of the logic model is only definitive with regard to the specific project timeframe and may well be subject to subsequent modification by the HTA/SR team, or indeed by other teams. \nFor staged logic modelling, a four-step process consists of: (1) developing an initial logic model, using one of the templates and various mechanisms to populate them, in particular input from stakeholders and literature searches; (2) pre-specifying points within the HTA/SR process at which significant inputs, defined in terms of quantity or importance, are likely to have an impact on the structure and content of the HTA/SR and thus the logic model; (3) revisiting the logic model at the pre-specified review and revision points, and creating new and clearly labelled versions, documenting how and based on which data sources changes were made; and (4) presenting selected versions of the logic model, as a minimum the initial and the final logic models, in the HTA/ SR report. \nConclusions \nLogic models are an important tool when conducting HTAs or SRs of complex health technologies, as they enhance transparency on underlying assumptions and help understand complexity by depicting the entire system, its parts and the interactions between intervention and outcomes; they also play a key role in integrating across different parts of a multi-component HTA. Nonetheless, logic models are not a panacea in addressing or resolving complexity and each type shows its specific strengths and limitations. This guidance provides a stateof-the-art overview of current practices in the use of logic models within HTAs and SRs. By providing templates for generating a logic model de novo, it aims to make the process of logic model development and application as straightforward as possible. Certain types and sub-types of logic models are more or less suitable depending on the technology concerned and the HTA/SR question addressed and approach pursued.

If authors do not provide sufficient details about the conduct and findings of their study, readers are unable to judge the reliability of the results and interpret them. There are also ethical and moral reasons for reporting research adequately. Widespread deficiencies in research publications have been extensively documented. In recent years, they have led to the development of reporting guidelines, which outline the key elements of research that should be addressed in a research report and how [2]. The primary role of reporting guidelines is to help researchers write up their research to maximize the value to others. Adherence to reporting guidelines will increase the completeness and transparency of health research publications, thereby providing readers with sufficient details to enable them to critically appraise the study [3]. Improved reporting also has important benefits for systematic reviewers and those developing clinical practice guidelines and improves the efficiency of electronic literature searches. Over time, the use of reporting guidelines may have a beneficial influence on the quality of research by raising general awareness of key methodological issues.

However, many trials of psychosocial interventions in dementia lack impact. It is not clear whether this reflects a genuine ineffectiveness, since the methodology used in dementia care research is at present weak in addressing the important distinction between genuine ineffectiveness and an implementation error. Therefore, potentially effective dementia care interventions that may have a positive impact on patient experience can fail to show effectiveness, thereby reducing treatment options and wasting research money. Methodological discussions about the success and failure of interventions in dementia care within the European INTERDEM group of multi-professional researchers on psychosocial dementia care (www.interdem.org/) led to a critical analysis of the suitability of the current methodology. This has often relied on the Medical Research Council’s (MRC) Framework for complex interventions and its iterations (Campbell et al., 2000; Craig et al., 2008; Craig & Petticrew, 2013). Foster and Little (2012) pinpoint an important obstacle to improving clinical practice as the legacy of ‘simple’ drug therapy evaluations which are engrained in the design and conduct of the pragmatic trial, a view that can also be extended more generally to the interpretation and conduct of the MRC framework for complex interventions and its methodologies. The advantage of pragmatic trials is their proximity to daily practice in routine health care settings. This has particular implications for the design and conduct of psychosocial intervention research in dementia, where the important distinction between poor attention to implementation and genuine ineffectiveness is often overlooked. Furthermore, better attention to the implications of this proximity in the design and conduct of psychosocial intervention research trials may reduce the need for a separate large-scale implementation study phase in the way that this is currently conceived within the MRC approach to complex interventions (Craig et al., 2008; Craig & Petticrew, 2013). This is an urgent issue for psychosocial intervention research in dementia care as today 35.6 million people and families worldwide live with dementia (Prince et al., 2013), whilst major pharmaceutical advances in prevention and cure remain elusive (Miller, 2012). The predicted future growth of dementia cases over the next decade will undoubtedly raise the already high costs of care, estimated at US$ 604 billion in 2010 (Wimo et al., 2013), in an illness that is most feared people over the age of 55 years (Le Couteur, Doust, Creasey, & Brayne, 2013), since it can undermine core human capacities resulting in decline in quality of life (Selkoe, 2012). Although cure for dementia is not available for dementia patients, we are not empty handed. Psychosocial intervention research has emerged as today’s forerunner, given its aim to improve daily practice among professionals who provide support to people and families living with dementia. Psychosocial interventions in dementia involve interactions between people to improve psychological and social functioning (Moniz-Cook, Vernooij-Dassen, Woods, & Orrell, 2011; Rabins et al., 2007), such as cognitive stimulation therapy (Woods, Aguirre, Spector, & Orrell, 2012), occupational therapy (Graff et al., 2006) and support programmes for family carers (Vernooij-Dassen, Draskovic, McCleery, & Downs, 2011).

To improve the completeness of reporting, and ultimately the replicability, of interventions, an international group of experts and stakeholders developed the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. The process involved a literature review for relevant checklists and research, a Delphi survey of an international panel of experts to guide item selection, and a face to face panel meeting.

Human-interactive robots, used to improve the quality of life, are becoming increasingly common. Their purposes and functions vary depending on their use, such as assistance, therapy, guide, entertainment, and education. Robot therapy, which uses robots as a substitution for animals in “animal therapy,” is a new robot application in the fields of welfare and patient care. The seal robot PARO began development for robot therapy in 1993. PARO was commercialized in Japan in 2005, and in Europe and the United States in 2009, and it has been used in hospitals and care facilities in approximately 30 countries. Recent research has revealed that robot therapy has a similar effect on patients as animal therapy. In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certified PARO as a “biofeedback medical device.” While PARO can be used in various kinds of therapy similar to that where real animals are used, this study focuses on its use with elderly dementia patients because explicit differences can be easily observed before and after interacting with PARO. First, this paper explains the purposes and functions of PARO. Second, because there are several observational studies on the therapeutic effects of the elderly with dementia interacting with PARO, some typical cases and interesting special cases are introduced. These cases include recovery from depression, reduction of agitation, and recovery from speech disorders. Finally, this paper discusses why PARO has the potential to change moods and behaviors of the elderly with dementia as a nonpharmacological approach.', 'year': 2012, 'referenceCount': 59, 'citationCount': 180, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40528071', 'name': 'T.

Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement—a reporting guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realising these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review.

This area of research falls under the relatively unexplored domain of social robot services. This paper proposes and tests the proactive services rendered by a soliloquising social robot that has three core functions: responding to a customer's request, soliloquising about the hotel service, and proactively expressing goodwill (e.g. greetings and farewells), according to the context. We expect that, through its proactive interaction (in this case, soliloquising and expressing goodwill), a soliloquising social robot can become an essential room companion for customers. Rather than being a mere tool, the soliloquising robot can relieve a customer's feeling of loneliness and provide him or her some interpersonal warmth. However, the proactive social robot may appear to be intrusive. Thus, a field experiment was conducted at a hotel on the expectations and risks associated with using such a robot. The results reveal that although social robots can make potential room companions in hotels, it is necessary to resolve a few issues to enable them gain wider acceptance."", 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 39, 'citationCount': 6, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2730863', 'name': 'Junya Nakanishi'}, {'authorId': '40615551', 'name': 'Itaru Kuramoto'}, {'authorId': '1604007503', 'name': 'Jun Baba'}, {'authorId': '1604010380', 'name': 'Kohei Ogawa'}, {'authorId': '2836701', 'name': 'Y.

The results demonstrate a humanoid robot's potential of engaging in a heartwarming interaction service that enhances customer satisfaction of the whole service.

The present study investigates customers' perceptions toward the smiling behaviors, especially with various degrees of head tilts, of humanlike robots and humans in a service setting by comparing the perceptions of males (n=92) and females (n=121) of varying generations. A total of 10 stimuli were used with head tilt at − 20°, −10°, 0°, 10°, and 20°, in which, head tilt is considered a unique trait in smiling behavior. Findings showed that male and female customers in differing age groups had different perceptions toward the overall service quality, specifically the reliability and assurance, and overall visiting intentions, given by either the robot or human staff.

We discovered that human labor is divided into small tasks, and that robot actions affect human emotional control. However, the hotel not only divides human work but also reconstructs it from tasks.

We proposed a method based on the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect nakedness in a daily living scenario. In this method, two CNNs are used: one detects whether a person is present or not in the current scene, and the other detects privacy-sensitive situations. We implemented the method on the ASCC home service robot developed in our lab. The CNNs were trained with a database composed of more than 2900 pictures collected from the Internet and from our ASCC Smart Home. In our experiments, we considered three human poses: sitting, standing, and lying. If the robot detects a privacy-sensitive situation, it will turn around and verbally announce its intention, which ensures the person that he or she is not being watched.

For example, the Dutch Child and Family Center explores the possibilities of social robot assistance in their regular care pathways. This robot should address the affective processes in the communication appropriately. Whereas there is an enormous amount of emotion research in human-robot interaction, there is not yet a proven set of models and methods that can be put into this practice directly. Our research aims at a model for robot's emotional recognition and expression that is effective in the Dutch youth care. Consequently, it has to take account of personal differences (e.g., child's developmental phase and mental problems) and the context (e.g., family circumstances and therapy approach). Our study distinguishes different phases that may partially run in parallel. First, possible solutions for affective computing by social robots are identified to set the general design space and understand the constraints. Second, in an exploration phase, focus group sessions are conducted to identify core features of emotional expressions that the robot should or could process, including the context-dependencies. Third, in the testing phase, via scenario-based design and child-robot interaction experiments a practical model of affect processing by a social robot in youth care is derived.

Identified publications were initially screened by title and abstract, and the full texts of remaining publications were then subsequently screened. Eligibility criteria Publications were included if they were journal articles, conference proceedings or conference proceedings published as monographs that described the conceptualisation, development, testing or evaluation of social robots for use with children with any mental or physical health condition or disability. Publications on autism exclusively, robots for use with children without identified health conditions, physically assistive or mechanical robots, non-physical hardware robots and surgical robots were excluded. Results Seventy-three publications were included in the review, of which 50 included user studies with a range of samples. Most were feasibility studies with small sample sizes, suggesting that the robots were generally accepted. At least 26 different robots were used, with many of these still in development. The most commonly used robot was NAO. The evidence quality was low, with only one randomised controlled trial and a limited number of experimental designs. Conclusions Social robots hold significant promise and potential to help children in healthcare contexts, but higher quality research is required with experimental designs and larger sample sizes.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 91, 'citationCount': 88, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153124410', 'name': 'Julia P.

Atypical emotional expressions are seen in various psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, depression, and autism spectrum conditions. Understanding the basics of emotional expressions and recognition can be crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Emotions can be expressed in the face, gesture, posture, voice, and behavior and affect physiological parameters, such as the heart rate or body temperature.

We studied the development of early treatment process with semi-structured individual in-depth interviews with 12 patients with PD, conducted post session 3. Grounded theory was used to analyze the transcripts. The development of early treatment process was captured by four thematic categories: approaching the problem, easing in and opening up, building trust and bonding, and making sense of panic. The developmental scheme culminated to the core category: Jointly Engaging in PD Therapy versus Awaiting Relief, capturing early engagement or disengagement from PD therapy respectively. The emergent core category was cross-validated against distal treatment outcome. Emergent processes can be replicated and incorporated in early treatment procedures of EBCBT for PD.

In this paper, we evaluate a number of automatic speech recognition (ASR) engines under a variety of conditions, inspired by real-world social HRI conditions. Using the data collected we demonstrate that there is still much work to be done in ASR for child speech, with interactions relying solely on this modality still out of reach.

Although historically the human body has been perceived primarily as a tool for actions, there is now increased understanding that the body is also an important medium for emotional expression. Indeed, research on emotional body language is rapidly emerging as a new field in cognitive and affective neuroscience. This article reviews how whole-body signals are processed and understood, at the behavioral and neural levels, with specific reference to their role in emotional communication. The first part of this review outlines brain regions and spectrotemporal dynamics underlying perception of isolated neutral and affective bodies, the second part details the contextual effects on body emotion recognition, and final part discusses body processing on a subconscious level. More specifically, research has shown that body expressions as compared with neutral bodies draw upon a larger network of regions responsible for action observation and preparation, emotion processing, body processing, and integrative processes. Results from neurotypical populations and masking paradigms suggest that subconscious processing of affective bodies relies on a specific subset of these regions. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that emotional information from the face, voice, and body all interact, with body motion and posture often highlighting and intensifying the emotion expressed in the face and voice.', 'year': 2015, 'referenceCount': 94, 'citationCount': 148, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4628064', 'name': 'B. de Gelder'}, {'authorId': '2937188', 'name': 'A.

Results indicate that robot expressions have mixed effects depending on the gender of the participant. Male participants showed a positive affective response, and indicated greater liking towards the robot, when it made positive and negative affective facial expressions during an interactive game, when compared to the same robot with a neutral expression. Female participants showed no marked difference across two conditions. This is the first study to demonstrate an effect of life-like emotional expression on children’s behavior in the field.

Using a mood estimation algorithm based on visual cues of the user’s behaviors through their facial expressions and body posture, a multidimensional model predicts a qualitative measure of the subject’s affective state. Using a novel Interactive Reinforcement Learning algorithm, the robot is able to learn over several sessions the social profile of the user, adjusting its behavior to match their preferences. Although the robot is completely autonomous, a third party can optionally provide feedback to the robot through an additional UI to accelerate its learning of the user’s preferences. To validate the proposed methodology, we evaluated the impact of the robot on elementary school aged children in a long-term, multi-session interaction setting. Our findings show that using this methodology, the robot is able to learn the social profile of the users over a number of sessions, either with or without external feedback as well as maintain the user in a positive mood, as shown by the consistently positive rewards received by the robot using our proposed learning algorithm.",2019,29,7,"{'name': '2019 28th IEEE International Conference on

In this work, we present a realtime approach to detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image. The proposed method uses a nonparametric representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image. This bottom-up system achieves high accuracy and realtime performance, regardless of the number of people in the image. In previous work, PAFs and body part location estimation were refined simultaneously across training stages. We demonstrate that a PAF-only refinement rather than both PAF and body part location refinement results in a substantial increase in both runtime performance and accuracy. We also present the first combined body and foot keypoint detector, based on an internal annotated foot dataset that we have publicly released. We show that the combined detector not only reduces the inference time compared to running them sequentially, but also maintains the accuracy of each component individually.

Then, these emotions are classified as affective states in a multi-dimensional model. Leveraging the expertise of a human trainer, the action-planning module interactively learns those actions that are the most appropriate to perform when the child subject is in a specific affective state. To validate the usefulness of the proposed methodology, we evaluated the impact of the robot on elementary school aged children.

The high level feature is extracted from a video consisting of a sequence of frames through a proposed by convolutional neural networks (CNN). In order to let our CNN framework be able to extract similar features from adjacent frames, special loss function is introduced. Moreover, the neutral and peak expression frames are identified through comparison of distances among frames. Then, facial expressions can be classified by the so-called contrastive representation between neutral and peak expressions.

We find that the children can be divided into two groups depending on their reaction to the robot; for some children, the robot was an engaging object that elicited social behavior by providing novel and appealing sensory experiences (primarily bubbleblowing), while for other children, the robot was an agent and elicited social behavior through agentlike actions such as autonomous movement.

In this exploratory study, we asked whether similar benefits are observed when a robot engages in dialogic reading with preschoolers. Given the established effectiveness of active reading, we also asked whether this effectiveness was critically dependent on the expressive characteristics of the robot. For approximately half the children, the robot’s active reading was expressive; the robot’s voice included a wide range of intonation and emotion (Expressive). For the remaining children, the robot read and conversed with a flat voice, which sounded similar to a classic text-to-speech engine and had little dynamic range (Flat). The robot’s movements were kept constant across conditions. We performed a verification study using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to confirm that the Expressive robot was viewed as significantly more expressive, more emotional, and less passive than the Flat robot. We invited 45 preschoolers with an average age of 5 years who were either English Language Learners (ELL), bilingual, or native English speakers to engage in the reading task with the robot. The robot narrated a story from a picture book, using active reading techniques and including a set of target vocabulary words in the narration. Children were post-tested on the vocabulary words and were also asked to retell the story to a puppet. A subset of 34 children performed a second story retelling 4–6 weeks later. Children reported liking and learning from the robot a similar amount in the Expressive and Flat conditions. However, as compared to children in the Flat condition, children in the Expressive condition were more concentrated and engaged as indexed by their facial expressions; they emulated the robot’s story more in their story retells; and they told longer stories during their delayed retelling. Furthermore, children who responded to the robot’s active reading questions were more likely to correctly identify the target vocabulary words in the Expressive condition than in the Flat condition. Taken together, these results suggest that children may benefit more from the expressive robot than from the flat robot.', 'year': 2017, 'referenceCount': 81, 'citationCount': 89, 'authors': [{'authorId': '19226999', 'name': 'Jacqueline M.

This potential is particularly relevant for children, who have proven receptive to interactions with social robots. To reach learning and therapeutic goals, a number of issues need to be investigated, notably the design of an effective child-robot interaction (cHRI) to ensure the child remains engaged in the relationship and that educational goals are met. Typically, current cHRI research experiments focus on a single type of interaction activity (e.g. a game). However, these can suffer from a lack of adaptation to the child, or from an increasingly repetitive nature of the activity and interaction. In this paper, we motivate and propose a practicable solution to this issue: an adaptive robot able to switch between multiple activities within single interactions. We describe a system that embodies this idea, and present a case study in which diabetic children collaboratively learn with the robot about various aspects of managing their condition.

Recent research suggests that other people have a strong influence on children’s exploratory behavior. Would a curious robot elicit children’s exploration and the desire to find out new things? In order to answer this question we designed a novel experimental paradigm in which a child plays an education tablet app with an autonomous social robot, which is portrayed as a younger peer. We manipulated the robot’s behavior to be either curiosity-driven or not and measured the child’s curiosity after the interaction. We show that some of the child’s curiosity measures are significantly higher after interacting with a curious robot, compared to a non-curious one, while others do not. These results suggest that interacting with an autonomous social curious robot can selectively guide and promote children’s curiosity.

Eighty children (group 1) received conventional verbal information from an ENT nurse, and another 80 children (group 2) received specific information, including role‐play, from a nurse anaesthetist at a preadmission visit. Children’s and parents’ experience of premedication, operation theatre (OR), i.v.‐needle insertion and induction of anaesthesia were evaluated from a self‐rating questionnaire. The questionnaire included ratings for anxiety and satisfaction with information and care. The results indicate a clear improvement of the preoperative acquisition of knowledge in all age groups. When it comes to alleviation of fear, a positive effect of the preparation programme was noticed, especially among the younger children (< 5\u2003years), while preoperative anxiety overall was a significantly smaller problem among the older children. The effects of the programme were also related to previous experience of anaesthesia and most beneficial among young children with such experience. Overall, the most negative procedure reported by the children was the i.m. injection for premedication (a routine which was abandoned as a result of the study), followed by the insertion of the i.v.‐needle. The parents experienced watching their child fall asleep during induction of anaesthesia as most negative, followed by the insertion of the i.v.‐needle. Parents also reported more satisfaction and less anxiety after having received specific information and preparation preoperatively.

Insights from pilot sessions showed that people were able to bond with the Huggable robot emotionally and socially well and other activities that would help patients build higher self-efficacy for enduring medical procedures are proposed.

Here, we aimed to investigate effects of sleep deprivation on emotional contagion and mimicry in young and older humans.Participants underwent 3h partial sleep deprivation, crossed-over with a full sleep condition, followed by a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electromyography (EMG) experiment with viewing of emotional and neutral faces and ratings of emotional responses. The final sample for main analyses was n = 69 (n = 36 aged 20-30 years, n = 33 aged 65-75 years).Sleep deprivation caused decreased activation in fusiform gyri for angry faces and decreased ratings of happiness for all stimuli. Older participants reported more angriness compared to younger, but no age differences were seen in brain responses to emotional faces or sensitivity to sleep deprivation. No effect of sleep deprivation was seen on EMG.In conclusion, emotional contagion, but not emotional mimicry, was affected by sleep deprivation. Our results do not support increased amygdala reactivity after sleep deprivation as a mechanism behind decreased social emotional functioning, but are consistent with an increased negativity bias

How a pandemic affect our daily lives? Which type of emotion will dominate and why in the emotional contagion caused by a pandemic situation?To answer these research questions, our methodology is based on a mapping of epistemological knowledge from social science and history about how societies faced collapse due to epidemic outbreaks. Also, we present an autoethnography to revise moment by moment how professional and private lives are being affected by this pandemic right now.",2020,0,1,,"{'model': 'specter_v1', 'vector':

For example, anger can be expressed through a scowl, narrowed eyes, a long stare, or many other expressions. This complexity is problematic when attempting to recognize a human's expression in a human-robot interaction: categorical emotion models used in HRI typically use only a few prototypical classes, and do not cover the wide array of expressions in the wild. We propose a data-driven method towards increasing the number of known emotion classes present in human-robot interactions, to 28 classes or more. The method includes the use of automatic segmentation of video streams into short (<10s) videos, and annotation using the large set of widely-understood emojis as categories. In this work, we showcase our initial results using a large in-the-wild HRI dataset (UE-HRI), with 61 clips randomly sampled from the dataset, labeled with 28 different emojis. In particular, our results showed that the ""skeptical"" emoji was a common expression in our dataset, which is not often considered in typical emotion taxonomies. This is the first step in developing a rich taxonomy of emotional expressions that can be used in the future as labels for training machine learning models, towards more accurate perception of humans

Most of the recent deep learning solutions for facial expression recognition under-perform when deployed in Human-Robot-Interaction scenarios, although they are capable of breaking records on the most varied benchmarks on facial expression recognition. The main reason for that we believe is that they are using techniques that are developed for recognition of static pictures, while in real-life scenarios, we infer emotions from intervals of expression. Utilising on the feature of CNN to form regions of interests that are similar to human gaze patterns, we use recordings from human-gaze patterns to train such a network to infer facial emotions from 3 seconds video footage of humans expressing 6 basic emotions.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 44, 'citationCount': 2, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1562122009', 'name': 'Anne C.

This research proposes that the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW), a self-report instrument for measuring emotional reactions, has strong potential for use as a tool for evaluating the expression of affective content by robots. Factors that make the GEW advantageous over existing evaluation methods include: ease of administration, reduction in the importance of word labels, and coverage of ‘no emotion’ states. Statistical analyses of the GEW are proposed, isolating quantitative metrics of emotion distinctness. An experiment requiring participants to rate the perceived emotion of a social robot was conducted, employing the proposed methods. Analysis using the GEW revealed significant differences in the reliability of different expressions to clearly convey emotional states. The GEW provided a repeatable, systematic framework for estimating perceived affect of robot expression. Thus, the results suggest the GEW offers a powerful tool for design purposes as well as analysis. To support future research using the GEW, the software used for the analysis has been packaged and made available as an open-source resource to the community.

However, objects are sentiment neutral which hinders the expected gain of transfer learning for such tasks. In this work, we propose to overcome this problem by learning a novel sentiment-aligned image embedding that is better suited for subsequent visual sentiment analysis. Our embedding leverages the intricate relation between emojis and images in large-scale and readily available data from social media. Emojis are language-agnostic, consistent, and carry a clear sentiment signal which make them an excellent proxy to learn a sentiment aligned embedding. Hence, we construct a novel dataset of 4 million images collected from Twitter with their associated emojis. We train a deep neural model for image embedding using emoji prediction task as a proxy. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed embedding outperforms the popular object-based counterpart consistently across several sentiment analysis benchmarks. Furthermore, without bell and whistles, our compact, effective and simple embedding outperforms the more elaborate and customized state-of-the-art deep models on these public benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a novel emoji representation based on their visual emotional response which support a deeper understanding of the emoji modality and their usage on social media.', 'year': 2019, 'referenceCount': 47, 'citationCount': 17, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1390024605', 'name': 'Ziad Al-Halah'}, {'authorId': '49931957', 'name': 'Andrew P.

This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life.

Facial expression recognition (FER) is a vital task for emotion recognition. However, significant gap between human and machine exists in FER task. In this paper, we present a conditional generative adversarial network-based approach to alleviate the intra-class variations by individually controlling the facial expressions and learning the generative and discriminative representations simultaneously. The proposed framework consists of a generator G and three discriminators (<italic>Di</italic>, <italic>Da</italic>, and <italic>Dexp</italic>). The generator G transforms any query face image into another prototypic facial expression image with other factors preserved. Armed with action units condition, the generator G pays more attention to information relevant to facial expression. Three loss functions (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$L_{I}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <italic>La</italic>, and <italic>Lexp</italic>) corresponding to the three discriminators (<italic>Di</italic>, <italic>Da</italic>, and <italic>Dexp</italic>) were designed to learn generative and discriminative representations. Moreover, after rendering the generated expression back to its original facial expression, cycle consistency loss is also applied to guarantee the identity and produce more constrained visual representations. Optimized by combining both synthesis and classification loss functions, the learnt representation is explicitly disentangled from other variations such as identity, head pose, and illumination.

Indeed, child-robot interactions are increasingly being explored in domains which require longer-term interactions, such as healthcare and education. For a robot to behave in an appropriate manner over longer time scales, its behaviours have to be contingent and meaningful to the unfolding relationship. Recognising, interpreting and generating sustained and engaging social behaviours is as such an important—and essentially, open—research question. We believe that the recent progress of machine learning opens new opportunities in terms of both analysis and synthesis of complex social dynamics. To support these approaches, we introduce in this article a novel, open dataset of child social interactions, designed with data-driven research methodologies in mind. Our data acquisition methodology relies on an engaging, methodologically sound, but purposefully underspecified free-play interaction. By doing so, we capture a rich set of behavioural patterns occurring in natural social interactions between children. The resulting dataset, called the PInSoRo dataset, comprises 45+ hours of hand-coded recordings of social interactions between 45 child-child pairs and 30 child-robot pairs.

This research has helped establish a fundamental understanding about people as they interact with robots, how specific design choices affect interactions with robots, and how novel mechanisms or computational tools can be used to improve HRI. The predominant focus of this growing body of work, however, stands in stark contrast to the complex social contexts in which robots are increasingly placed. Developments in machine learning and tele-robotics, as well as compliant and social robotics, have occasioned more robots in closer proximity and even direct contact with people. Robots, especially mobile autonomous robots, are now deployed across work contexts and “sociable robots” such as Jibo, Cozmo, Kuri, and M.A.X. are increasingly becoming staples of household technology. These robots interact with people in everyday contexts across a wide range of tasks and situations, yet our research reflects a time when studies of HRI were possible almost exclusively only in laboratory settings. As a result, we have a limited understanding of how people will respond to robots in complex social settings and how robots will affect social dynamics in situ. In particular, our theories reflect an oversimplified view of HRI. The time is ripe for studies that tackle HRI in these complex settings and build generalizable theories about what to expect of HRI in the wild.

Using statistical methods to analyze reports of emotional states elicited by 2,185 emotionally evocative short videos with richly varying situational content, we uncovered 27 varieties of reported emotional experience. Reported experience is better captured by categories such as “amusement” than by ratings of widely measured affective dimensions such as valence and arousal. Although categories are found to organize dimensional appraisals in a coherent and powerful fashion, many categories are linked by smooth gradients, contrary to discrete theories. Our results comprise an approximation of a geometric structure of reported emotional experience. Emotions are centered in subjective experiences that people represent, in part, with hundreds, if not thousands, of semantic terms. Claims about the distribution of reported emotional states and the boundaries between emotion categories—that is, the geometric organization of the semantic space of emotion—have sparked intense debate. Here we introduce a conceptual framework to analyze reported emotional states elicited by 2,185 short videos, examining the richest array of reported emotional experiences studied to date and the extent to which reported experiences of emotion are structured by discrete and dimensional geometries. Across self-report methods, we find that the videos reliably elicit 27 distinct varieties of reported emotional experience. Further analyses revealed that categorical labels such as amusement better capture reports of subjective experience than commonly measured affective dimensions (e.g., valence and arousal). Although reported emotional experiences are represented within a semantic space best captured by categorical labels, the boundaries between categories of emotion are fuzzy rather than discrete. By analyzing the distribution of reported emotional states we uncover gradients of emotion—from anxiety to fear to horror to disgust, calmness to aesthetic appreciation to awe, and others—that correspond to smooth variation in affective dimensions such as valence and dominance. Reported emotional states occupy a complex, high-dimensional categorical space.

The results reported herein propound otherwise, suggesting that a larger number of categories is used by humans. Understanding the different categories of facial expressions of emotion regularly used by us is essential to gain insights into human cognition and affect as well as for the design of computational models and perceptual interfaces. Past research on facial expressions of emotion has focused on the study of six basic categories—happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. However, many more facial expressions of emotion exist and are used regularly by humans. This paper describes an important group of expressions, which we call compound emotion categories. Compound emotions are those that can be constructed by combining basic component categories to create new ones. For instance, happily surprised and angrily surprised are two distinct compound emotion categories. The present work defines 21 distinct emotion categories. Sample images of their facial expressions were collected from 230 human subjects. A Facial Action Coding System analysis shows the production of these 21 categories is different but consistent with the subordinate categories they represent (e.g., a happily surprised expression combines muscle movements observed in happiness and surprised). We show that these differences are sufficient to distinguish between the 21 defined categories. We then use a computational model of face perception to demonstrate that most of these categories are also visually discriminable from one another.', 'year': 2014, 'referenceCount': 49, 'citationCount': 603, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2323717', 'name': 'Shichuan Du'}, {'authorId': '2105710649', 'name': 'Yong Tao'}, {'authorId': '1384255355', 'name': 'Aleix M.

The emotion recognition system, based on a deep neural network, learns six basic emotions: happiness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and surprise. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract visual features by learning on a large number of static images. Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is used to determine the relationship between the transformation of facial expressions in image sequences and the six basic emotions. Third, CNN and LSTM are combined to exploit their advantages in the proposed model. Finally, the performance of the emotion recognition system is improved by using transfer learning, that is, by transferring knowledge of related but different problems.

Different interaction styles may be simulated through the use of verbal and non-verbal features that may not be easily recognized by the user as intended by the designer. For this reason, this study aimed to evaluate how three different robot interaction styles (i.e., Friendly, Neutral, and Authoritarian) were perceived by humans in the context of a robot carrying out cognitive tests. The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) was proposed to measure the perceived Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. We expected that a Neutral behavior is characterized by low Arousal, a Friendly by high Valence, and an Authoritarian by high Dominance. Moreover, the perception of a Socially Assistive Robot’s behavior is closely linked to trust, which is a key component to the success of any care-provider/user relationship. Hence, a Trust Perception Scale was used to explore the effect of the interaction style on trust. The results confirmed our hypothesis and showed a significant difference between each value with the others. Furthermore, we expected to obtain a higher value of trust with the Authoritarian since the performance of the users who interacted with the Authoritarian was better than the others. However, this hypothesis was not confirmed by the results.",2021,31,1,"{'name': '2021 30th IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)', 'pages':

We defined trust of entirety as a measure that accounts for trust across a human's entire interactive experience with automation, and first identified alternatives to quantify it using real-time measurements of trust. Second, we provided a novel model that attempts to explain how trust of entirety evolves as a user interacts repeatedly with automation. Lastly, we investigated the effects of automation transparency on momentary changes of trust. Our results indicated that trust of entirety is better quantified by the average measure of “area under the trust curve” than the traditional post-experiment trust measure. In addition, we found that trust of entirety evolves and eventually stabilizes as an operator repeatedly interacts with a technology.

The similarity attraction theory implies that people prefer a robot with a similar personality to their own (e.g., an extroverted person prefers an extroverted robot). According to the complementary attraction theory, people prefer a robot's personality opposite to their own (e.g., extroverted people prefer an introverted robot). In contrast to both theories, we argue that what is considered an appropriate personality for a robot depends on the task context. In a 2×2 between-groups experiment (N=45), we found trends that indicated similarity attraction for extrovert participants when the robot was a tour guide and complementary attraction for introverted participants when the robot was a cleaner. These trends show that preferences for robot personalities may indeed depend on the context of the robot's role and the stereotype perceptions people hold for certain jobs.

Meanwhile, emotional contagion, the spread of vigilance or panic, serves as a negative feedback to the epidemic, but few existing models take it into consideration. In this study, we proposed an innovative multi-layer hybrid modelling and simulation approach to simulate disease transmission and emotional contagion together. In each layer, we used a hybrid simulation method combining agent-based modelling (ABM) with system dynamics modelling (SDM), keeping spatial heterogeneity while reducing computation costs. We designed a new emotion dynamics model IWAN (indifferent, worried, afraid and numb) to simulate emotional contagion inside a community during an epidemic. Our model was well fit to the data of China, the UK and the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. If there weren’t emotional contagion, our experiments showed that the confirmed cases would increase rapidly, for instance, the total confirmed cases during simulation in Guangzhou, China would grow from 334 to 2096, which increased by 528%. We compared the calibrated emotional contagion parameters of different countries and found that the suppression effect of emotional contagion in China is relatively more visible than that in the US and the UK. Due to the experiment results, the proposed multi-layer network model with hybrid simulation is valid and can be applied to the quantitative analysis of the epidemic trends and the suppression effect of emotional contagion in different countries. Our model can be modified for further research to study other social factors and intervention policies in the COVID-19 pandemic or future epidemics.",2021,42,6,"{'name': 'PLoS ONE', 'volume':

That is why we have the urge to develop an efficient mathematical model (quarantine) based on social consciousness to control the epidemic. *Corresponding author: E-mail: kamrujjaman@du.ac.bd; Mahmud et al.; JALSI, 23(3): 20-27, 2020; Article no.JALSI.56918 Methods: This is a quarantine mathematical model. The outcome of the system is dependent on social consciousness. We have calculated the awareness level by considering various socio-economic factor of each country. In our model, the parameters are Education Index, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, population density, high literacy and stable economy. To maximize the efficiency of the model, it has to be implemented in initial stage. However, strict application of the method in vigorous stage of epidemic will also bring a satisfactory outcome. Results: In Spain, quarantine was effected on March 14, 2020. Spain experienced an increase in reported cases for 13 days of quarantine enforcement and from the 14th day, daily reported cases started to decrease with small fluctuation. Government ensured the social isolation through quarantine. After imposition of a quarantine on March 9, 2020 in Italy, within 13 days of lock-down, the maximum number of infection started to decrease. Similar results observed in France. Higher social consciousness would decrease the number of infected population dramatically while minimal or lower awareness will do a outburst. Conclusion: Outbreak will be in control of health care system which yields to reduce the death rate and will ensure social and economic stability.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 13, 'citationCount': 11, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1657417676', 'name': 'MD.

Community mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing are thought to be effective but there is little evidence to inform or support community members on COVID-19 risk reduction within families. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 335 people in 124 families and with at least one laboratory confirmed COVID-19 case was conducted from 28 February to 27 March 2020, in Beijing, China. The outcome of interest was secondary transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the family. Characteristics and practices of primary cases, of well family contacts and household hygiene practices were analysed as predictors of secondary transmission. Results The secondary attack rate in families was 23.0% (77/335). Face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79% effective in reducing transmission (OR=0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79). Daily use of chlorine or ethanol based disinfectant in households was 77% effective (OR=0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.84). Wearing a mask after illness onset of the primary case was not significantly protective. The risk of household transmission was 18 times higher with frequent daily close contact with the primary case (OR=18.26, 95% CI 3.93 to 84.79), and four times higher if the primary case had diarrhoea (OR=4.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.60). Household crowding was not significant. Conclusion The study confirms the highest risk of transmission prior to symptom onset, and provides the first evidence of the effectiveness of mask use, disinfection and social distancing in preventing COVID-19. We also found evidence of faecal transmission. This can inform guidelines for community prevention in settings of intense COVID-19 epidemics.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 23, 'citationCount': 401, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2153605585', 'name': 'Yu Wang'}, {'authorId': '2401412', 'name': 'H.

To understand how travel and quarantine influence the dynamics of the spread of this novel human virus, Chinazzi et al. applied a global metapopulation disease transmission model to epidemiological data from China. They concluded that the travel quarantine introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 only delayed epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days within China, but international travel restrictions did help to slow spread elsewhere in the world until mid-February. Their results suggest that early detection, hand washing, self-isolation, and household quarantine will likely be more effective than travel restrictions at mitigating this pandemic. Science, this issue p. 395 A SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological model reveals the effects of travel restrictions and transmission reduction efforts on the spread of this novel virus. Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.', 'year': 2020, 'referenceCount': 16, 'citationCount': 2929, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1851304', 'name': 'Matteo Chinazzi'}, {'authorId': '1557302037', 'name': 'Jessica T.

However, which measures were most effective is uncertain. Tian et al. performed a quantitative analysis of the impact of control measures between 31 December 2019 and 19 February 2020, which encompasses the Lunar New Year period when millions of people traveled across China for family visits. Travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan were too late to prevent the spread of the virus to 262 cities within 28 days. However, the epidemic peaked in Hubei province on 4 February 2020, indicating that measures such as closing citywide public transport and entertainment venues and banning public gatherings combined to avert hundreds of thousands of cases of infection. It is unlikely that this decline happened because the supply of susceptible people was exhausted, so relaxing control measures could lead to a resurgence. Science, this issue p. 638 Travel restrictions and the national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Responding to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus [agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in December 2019, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January 2020 and implemented a national emergency response. We investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a data set that included case reports, human movement, and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Cities that implemented control measures preemptively reported fewer cases on average (13.0) in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later (20.6). Suspending intracity public transport, closing entertainment venues, and banning public gatherings were associated with reductions in case incidence.

To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. Methods We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. Results We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. Methods We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. Results Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). Conclusions On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

While behavioural responses to the spread of a disease have often been reported anecdotally, there has been relatively little systematic investigation into how behavioural changes can affect disease dynamics. Mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases are an important tool for investigating and quantifying such effects, not least because the spread of a disease among humans is not amenable to direct experimental study. Here, we review recent efforts to incorporate human behaviour into disease models, and propose that such models can be broadly classified according to the type and source of information which individuals are assumed to base their behaviour on, and according to the assumed effects of such behaviour. We highlight recent advances as well as gaps in our understanding of the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and human behaviour, and suggest what kind of data taking efforts would be helpful in filling these gaps.', 'year': 2010, 'referenceCount': 92, 'citationCount': 1010, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2262177', 'name': 'S.
