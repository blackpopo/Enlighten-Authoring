0,0002c3da54a89186c0422af83181c5b018c57cd7,Historical approach,"It was within this hospital some 53 years ago that I found in cases of accidental fracture of major long bones, and in certain non-bony injuries and operations, what seemed to me a most unusual disturbance of protein metabolism shortly after injury. To explore this further I was successful in obtaining a small nursing unit which provided two small side rooms accommodating five to six patients. There was also a small kitchen where we compounded the diets from relatively constant sources of supply and which we analysed from time to time. Latterly there was a sister in charge. This was one of the earliest metabolic units in the country. Although before and during the First World War there were occasional references to rises in urinary nitrogen following haemorrhage and operation, noone had really explored the condition. So there was here a relatively wide open but unknown field to chart. Having found that disuse atrophy might only be a small and contributory cause, I reported in a series of papers from 1930 onwards the characteristics of an increase in general catabolism over anabolism describing the parallel increments in urinary N, P, S, K, also the extent of the creatinuria without marked change in preformed creatinine. I also found that there was a tendency for a parallel increment in the resting consumption of oxygen taken under almost basal conditions. This hypermetabolism with slight febrile rise generally occurred, but not always if the patient was already undernourished at the time. In general, the more well built the subject prior to the incident the greater the effect and the more severe the accidental injury the greater this hypercatabolism which generally reached a peak between the 4th to 8th d after injury. The total loss of N in one case during the first 10 d was 137 g N, a reduction on the body’s content of 7.7%. Accidental injuries gave greater effects than elective operations (Cuthbertson, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932). We also showed that there was often an appreciable rise in fibrinogen in the plasma and a slight fall in albumin and marked rise in ‘globulin’ (Cuthbertson & Tompsett, 1935).",1980.0,20.0,14.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '101 - 105'}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Dp1980HistoricalA,\n author = {Cuthbertson Dp},\n pages = {101 - 105},\n title = {Historical approach},\n volume = {39},\n year = {1980}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '66072191', 'name': 'Cuthbertson Dp'}]"

However, it has become increasingly apparent that social and interactive skills are necessary requirements in many application areas and contexts where robots need to interact and collaborate with other robots or humans. Research on human–robot interaction (HRI) poses many challenges regarding the nature of interactivity and ‘social behaviour’ in robot and humans. The first part of this paper addresses dimensions of HRI, discussing requirements on social skills for robots and introducing the conceptual space of HRI studies. In order to illustrate these concepts, two examples of HRI research are presented. First, research is surveyed which investigates the development of a cognitive robot companion. The aim of this work is to develop social rules for robot behaviour (a ‘robotiquette’) that is comfortable and acceptable to humans. Second, robots are discussed as possible educational or therapeutic toys for children with autism. The concept of interactive emergence in human–child interactions is highlighted. Different types of play among children are discussed in the light of their potential investigation in human–robot experiments. The paper concludes by examining different paradigms regarding ‘social relationships’ of robots and people interacting with them.",2007.0,127.0,968.0,"{'volume': '362', 'pages': '679 - 704', 'name': 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dautenhahn2007SociallyIR,\n author = {K.

Intrinsically this language is multimodal (heterogeneous), sequential and asynchronous; it consists of the language (words), visual (expressions) and acoustic (paralinguistic) modalities all in the form of asynchronous coordinated sequences. From a resource perspective, there is a genuine need for large scale datasets that allow for in-depth studies of this form of language. In this paper we introduce CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI), the largest dataset of sentiment analysis and emotion recognition to date. Using data from CMU-MOSEI and a novel multimodal fusion technique called the Dynamic Fusion Graph (DFG), we conduct experimentation to exploit how modalities interact with each other in human multimodal language.

Physical measures of human vocal cues and participant ratings of dominance were obtained from videotapes of actors delivering short influence messages. After controlling for linguistic and visual content of messages, results indicated that mean amplitude and amplitude standard deviation were positively associated wit dominance judgments, whereas speech rate was negatively associated with dominance judgments. An unexpected interaction revealed that mean fundamental frequency (F 0 ) was positively associated with dominance judgments for male speakers but not significantly associated with dominance judgments for female speakers. F 0 standard deviation was not significantly associated with dominance judgments. Results support the conclusion that dominance judgments are inferred from multiple sources of information and that some vocal markers of dominance are more influential than others",2000.0,55.0,132.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '148-171', 'name': 'Human Communication Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tusing2000TheSO,\n author = {Kyle James Tusing and J.

Such superintelligence would not be just another technological development; it would be the most important invention ever made, and would lead to explosive progress in all scientific and technological fields, as the superintelligence would conduct research with superhuman efficiency. To the extent that ethics is a cognitive pursuit, a superintelligence could also easily surpass humans in the quality of its moral thinking. However, it would be up to the designers of the superintelligence to specify its original motivations. Since the superintelligence may become unstoppably powerful because of its intellectual superiority and the technologies it could develop, it is crucial that it be provided with human-friendly motivations.

Guided by new conceptual and quantitative approaches (Cowen, Elfenbein, Laukka, & Keltner, 2018; Cowen & Keltner, 2017, 2018), we explore the taxonomy of emotion recognized in facial-bodily expression. Participants (N = 1,794; 940 female, ages 18-76 years) judged the emotions captured in 1,500 photographs of facial-bodily expression in terms of emotion categories, appraisals, free response, and ecological validity. We find that facial-bodily expressions can reliably signal at least 28 distinct categories of emotion that occur in everyday life. Emotion categories, more so than appraisals such as valence and arousal, organize emotion recognition. However, categories of emotion recognized in naturalistic facial and bodily behavior are not discrete but bridged by smooth gradients that correspond to continuous variations in meaning. Our results support a novel view that emotions occupy a high-dimensional space of categories bridged by smooth gradients of meaning. They offer an approximation of a taxonomy of facial-bodily expressions, visualized within an online interactive map.

The current socio-economic situation is characterized by complexity, inconsistency, instability, which negatively affects the psycho-emotional state of citizens, reduces their level of satisfaction with life. To solve the problem of maintaining the internal balance of the individual, more and more psychological scientists are paying close attention to the study of well-being and identifying factors for its optimization. Scientists have found numerous proofs of the relationship between well-being and psychological qualities of the individual, while the question of the relationship with intellectual characteristics belongs to the category of little-studied. This topic is particularly relevant for the student audience, which is the professional potential of modern society. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship between emotional and personal well-being and intelligence of students. Methods. The methodology of self-assessment of emotional and personal well-being (SEPWB) and the cultural-free intelligence test of R. Kettell (CFIT) were used as research tools. Results of the study. The study allowed us to identify 4 typological groups with a pronounced positive, weak positive, weak negative and pronounced negative self-assessment of emotional and personal well-being. The results of the distribution of the sample of students into the selected groups showed that 62.5% of students positively assess their emotional and personal well-being. At the same time, students with intermediate types (weak positive and weak negative) have the highest values on the intelligence test. Correlation analysis of the parameters of the SEPWB method and the CFIT method showed the specificity of correlation structures in groups with different types of emotional and personal well-being, which is proof of the ambiguity, non-linearity of the relationship between emotional and personal well-being and intelligence. Conclusion. The novelty of the study is to establish the relationship between the expression of intelligence and the level of emotional and personal well-being.

In this article we have tried to design an automated framework for emotion detection using facial expression. For human-computer interaction facial expression makes a platform for non-verbal communication. The emotions are effectively changeable happenings that are evoked as a result of impelling force. So in real life application, detection of emotion is very challenging task. Facial expression recognition system requires to overcome the human face having multiple variability such as color, orientation, expression, posture and texture so on. In our framework we have taken frame from live streaming and processed it using Grabor feature extraction and neural network. To detect the emotion facial attributes extraction by principal component analysis is used and a clusterization of different facial expression with respective emotions.

17,019c9967c0af574d2e4baa11ff4ad6734e41ce83,How Does Rumination Impact Cognition? A First Mechanistic Model.,"Rumination is a process of uncontrolled, narrowly focused negative thinking that is often self-referential, and that is a hallmark of depression. Despite its importance, little is known about its cognitive mechanisms. Rumination can be thought of as a specific, constrained form of mind-wandering. Here, we introduce a cognitive model of rumination that we developed on the basis of our existing model of mind-wandering. The rumination model implements the hypothesis that rumination is caused by maladaptive habits of thought. These habits of thought are modeled by adjusting the number of memory chunks and their associative structure, which changes the sequence of memories that are retrieved during mind-wandering, such that during rumination the same set of negative memories is retrieved repeatedly. The implementation of habits of thought was guided by empirical data from an experience sampling study in healthy and depressed participants. On the basis of this empirically derived memory structure, our model naturally predicts the declines in cognitive task performance that are typically observed in depressed patients. This study demonstrates how we can use cognitive models to better understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying rumination and depression.",2018.0,52.0,31.0,"{'volume': '10 1', 'pages': '\n          175-191\n        ', 'name': 'Topics in cognitive science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vugt2018HowDR,\n author = {Marieke K. van Vugt and Maarten van der Velde},\n journal = {Topics in cognitive science},\n pages = {\n          175-191\n        },\n title = {How Does Rumination Impact Cognition?

Measures of three components of emotional intelligence (empathy, self-regulation of mood, and self-presentation) as well as affective traits (positive and negative affectivity) and general and practical intelligence were related to a major facet of work success, job interview performance. A sample of 116 undergraduates participated in a simulated job selection experience, consisting of paper and pencil tests and a videotaped structured interview. Results partially supported the proposed model. Some but not all of the affect and ability measures were related to interview outcomes, both directly and mediated by the interviewer's affective response (perceived similarity and liking).

Many researchers have applied linear or partial nonlinear processing in feature reduction and classification, but these applications did not work well. Therefore, this paper proposed a comprehensive nonlinear method to solve this problem. On the one hand, as traditional feature reduction may cause the loss of significant amounts of feature information, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) based on radial basis function (RBF) was introduced to map the data into a high-dimensional space, extract the nonlinear information of the features, and then reduce the dimension. This method can provide many features carrying information about the structure in the physiological dataset. On the other hand, considering its advantages of predictive power and feature selection from a large number of features, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) was used as a nonlinear ensemble classifier to improve the recognition accuracy. The comprehensive nonlinear processing method had a great performance on our physiological dataset. Classification accuracy of four emotions in 29 participants achieved 93.42%.",2018.0,52.0,16.0,"{'volume': '18', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2018EmotionRB,\n author = {Xingxing Zhang and Chao Xu and Wanli Xue and Jing Hu and Yongchuan He and Mengxin Gao},\n journal = {Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)},\n title = {Emotion Recognition Based on Multichannel Physiological Signals with Comprehensive Nonlinear Processing},\n volume = {18},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2153650340', 'name': 'Xingxing Zhang'}, {'authorId': '145194975', 'name': 'Chao Xu'}, {'authorId': '2052308315', 'name': 'Wanli Xue'}, {'authorId': '50778797', 'name': 'Jing Hu'}, {'authorId': '2118926186', 'name': 'Yongchuan He'}, {'authorId': '46573132', 'name': 'Mengxin Gao'}]"

But despite the importance of the voice in communicating emotion in general and positive emotion in particular, there is to date no systematic review of what characterizes vocal expressions of different positive emotions. Furthermore, integration and synthesis of current findings are lacking. In this review, we comprehensively review studies ( N = 108) investigating acoustic features relating to specific positive emotions in speech prosody and nonverbal vocalizations. We find that happy voices are generally loud with considerable variability in loudness, have high and variable pitch, and are high in the first two formant frequencies. When specific positive emotions are directly compared with each other, pitch mean, loudness mean, and speech rate differ across positive emotions, with patterns mapping onto clusters of emotions, so-called emotion families. For instance, pitch is higher for epistemological emotions (amusement, interest, relief), moderate for savouring emotions (contentment and pleasure), and lower for a prosocial emotion (admiration). Some, but not all, of the differences in acoustic patterns also map on to differences in arousal levels. We end by pointing to limitations in extant work and making concrete proposals for future research on positive emotions in the voice.",,0.0,42.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n title = {UvA-DARE (Digital Academic Repository) Good Vibrations: A Review of Vocal Expressions of Positive Emotions}\n}\n'}",[]

We conducted four studies examining the effect of affect labeling on self-reported emotional experience. In study one, self-reported distress was lower during affect labeling, compared to passive watching, of negative emotional pictures. Studies two and three added reappraisal and distraction conditions, respectively. Affect labeling showed similar effects on self-reported distress as both of these intentional emotion regulation strategies. In each of the first three studies, however, participant predictions about the effects of affect labeling suggest that unlike reappraisal and distraction, people do not believe affect labeling to be an effective emotion regulation strategy. Even after having the experience of affect labels leading to lower distress, participants still predicted that affect labeling would increase distress in the future. Thus, affect labeling is best described as an incidental emotion regulation process. Finally, study four employed positive emotional pictures and here, affect labeling was associated with diminished self-reported pleasure, relative to passive watching.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare, but little is known about consumer receptivity to AI in medicine. Consumers are reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider performance (studies 3A–3C), and derive negative utility if a provider is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect, a concern that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for consumers’ unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5). Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human healthcare provider (study 9). These findings make contributions to the psychology of automation and medical decision making, and suggest interventions to increase consumer acceptance of AI in medicine.",2019.0,101.0,492.0,{'name': 'DecisionSciRN: Consumer Decision-Making (Sub-Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Longoni2019ResistanceTM,\n author = {Chiara Longoni and Andrea Bonezzi and Carey K.

In this paper we study an important but often overlooked feature of ads in mobile apps (mostly absent in traditional web ads), that of ad refreshes : A user is shown a stream of banner ads during the app session, in which each ad is displayed in the ad slot for a certain amount of time (the refresh rate) before the ad-slot is refreshed to the next ad. Data analysis on our large-scale experiments that vary refresh rates reveals a surprising result, that cannot be explained by existing user click models: Varying ads» refresh almost preserves total number of clicks. We propose a new, natural, ""two-phase"" click model for this setting that explains this independence, as well as our measurements of the click-through rate as a function of the impression»s time-on-screen and of ad-repeat counts.

The response styles theory suggests that rumination in response to depressed mood exacerbates and prolongs depression, while distraction ameliorates and shortens it. Gender differences in response styles are said to contribute to the observed gender differences in the prevalence of unipolar depression. While empirical support for the theory has been found from a variety of non-clinical studies, its generalizability to clinically depressed patient populations remains unclear. Methods. A cohort of 52 unipolar depressed in-patients was assessed with the Response Styles Questionnaire during in-patient stay (T1) and 4 weeks after discharge (T2). The patients were followed up 4 months after discharge (T3). Clinical assessment included the SCAN-PSE-10. Results. Moderate and statistically significant retest-stabilities for rumination and distraction were found, comparable for patients with stable and changing depression status from T1 to T2. A cross-sectional diagnosis of a major depressive episode was associated with rumination, while gender was not. Post-discharge baseline rumination (T2), adjusted for concurrent depression, predicted follow-up levels of depression (T3), and, in patients who were non-remitted at post-discharge baseline, it predicted presence of a major depressive episode at follow-up (T3). Results on distraction were more ambiguous. Conclusions. Our results suggest that rumination is likely to have a deteriorating impact on the course of clinical episodes of depression in unipolar depressed patients.

For 50 years, scientists have sought to map emotion-related experience, expression, physiology, and recognition in terms of the “basic six”—anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Claims about the relationships between these six emotions and prototypical facial configurations have provided the basis for a long-standing debate over the diagnostic value of expression (for review and latest installment in this debate, see Barrett et al., p. 1). Building on recent empirical findings and methodologies, we offer an alternative conceptual and methodological approach that reveals a richer taxonomy of emotion. Dozens of distinct varieties of emotion are reliably distinguished by language, evoked in distinct circumstances, and perceived in distinct expressions of the face, body, and voice. Traditional models—both the basic six and affective-circumplex model (valence and arousal)—capture a fraction of the systematic variability in emotional response. In contrast, emotion-related responses (e.g., the smile of embarrassment, triumphant postures, sympathetic vocalizations, blends of distinct expressions) can be explained by richer models of emotion. Given these developments, we discuss why tests of a basic-six model of emotion are not tests of the diagnostic value of facial expression more generally. Determining the full extent of what facial expressions can tell us, marginally and in conjunction with other behavioral and contextual cues, will require mapping the high-dimensional, continuous space of facial, bodily, and vocal signals onto richly multifaceted experiences using large-scale statistical modeling and machine-learning methods.",2019.0,168.0,90.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '69 - 90', 'name': 'Psychological Science in the Public Interest'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cowen2019MappingTP,\n author = {Alan S.

Our solution is based on automatically finding sources in news and social media, and feeding these into a distantly supervised classifier for assessing the credibility of a claim (i.e., true or fake). For inference, our method leverages the joint interaction between the language of articles about the claim and the reliability of the underlying web sources. Experiments with claims from the popular website snopes.com and from reported cases of Wikipedia hoaxes demonstrate the viability of our methods and their superior accuracy over various baselines.",2016.0,19.0,163.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Popat2016CredibilityAO,\n author = {Kashyap Popat and Subhabrata Mukherjee and Jannik Strotgen and G.

Initially, we developed a self-report measure of thought suppression through successive factor-analytic procedures and found that it exhibited acceptable internal consistency and temporal stability. This measure, the White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI), was found to correlate with measures of obsessional thinking and depressive and anxious affect, to predict signs of clinical obsession among individuals prone toward obsessional thinking, to predict depression among individuals motivated to dislike negative thoughts, and to predict failure of electrodermal responses to habituate among people having emotional thoughts. The WBSI was inversely correlated with repression as assessed by the Repression-Sensitization Scale, and so taps a trait that is quite unlike repression as traditionally conceived.",1994.0,18.0,1315.0,"{'volume': '62 4', 'pages': '\n          616-40\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wegner1994ChronicTS,\n author = {D.

The reason for this is simple: Regulation is usually reactive, responding to facts. However, we currently live in a world of data, not facts. Regulation must therefore be proactive and dynamically responsive to data and trends. This paper discusses the following questions: (1) Why should regulators be proactive?, (2) When should regulators respond?, (3) What should regulators respond to? and (4) How should regulators respond? Using a dataset comprising over 77,000 venture capital deals with over 35,000 companies in the United States from 2005 to 2015, the paper shows how investment data can provide important feedback on innovation trends and associated risks for regulators, optimize the timing of regulation, and support anticipatory rulemaking.",2016.0,14.0,30.0,{'name': 'IRPN: Innovation Systems (Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Kaal2016HowTR,\n author = {Wulf A.

Taking a financial investor's perspective, we assess the determinants of post-ICO performance via buy-and-hold abnormal returns (BHAR) in a sample of 565 ICO ventures. Conceptually, we argue that institutional investors' superior screening (selection effect) and coaching abilities (treatment effect) enable them to partly overcome the information asymmetry of the ICO context and extract informational rents from their ICO investments. We find that institutional investor backing is indeed associated with higher post-ICO performance. Disentangling selection and treatment effects econometrically, we find that both of these effects explain the positive impact institutional investors have on post-ICO performance. Overall, our results highlight the importance of institutional investors in the ICO context.",2020.0,139.0,82.0,{'name': 'Econometric Modeling: Corporate Finance & Governance eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Fisch2020InstitutionalIA,\n author = {Christian Fisch and Paul P.

Measuring such subjective data as reactions to color, heat, light, and sound would seem to be an almost impossible task; indeed, until now there has been no theory around which the research in this field could be organized. This volume represents a preliminary effort to identify the relevant variables involved and fit them into a systematic framework. Furthermore, it presents extensive sets of measures for investigating the theory and implementing it in a variety of everyday environments.Basically, the framework outlined here proposes that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal, pleasure, and dominance. By considering the impact of the environment on these basic emotional responses, the effects of diverse stimulus components within or across sense modalities can be readily compared. An additional concept, information rate, is used to compare the effects of different environments, each with stimulation in many sense modalities. In the final chapters the authors present a series of hypotheses which relate the emotional response variables to a diversity of behaviors such as physical approach, performance, affiliation, and verbally or nonverbally expressed preference.",1974.0,0.0,5829.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mehrabian1974AnAT,\n author = {A.

While Hidden Markov Models tend to ignore this information, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can in principle learn to make use of it. We focus on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) because it has been shown to outperform other RNNs on tasks involving long time lags. We find that LSTM augmented by ""peephole connections"" from its internal cells to its multiplicative gates can learn the fine distinction between sequences of spikes spaced either 50 or 49 time steps apart without the help of any short training exemplars. Without external resets or teacher forcing, our LSTM variant also learns to generate stable streams of precisely timed spikes and other highly nonlinear periodic patterns.

The validity of this approach was first tested by analyzing the questionnaire responses, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and peripheral signals of the players playing a Tetris game at three difficulty levels. This analysis confirms that the different difficulty levels correspond to distinguishable emotions, and that, playing several times at the same difficulty level gives rise to boredom. The next step was to train several classifiers to automatically detect the three emotional classes from EEG and peripheral signals in a player-independent framework. By using either type of signals, the emotional classes were successfully recovered, with EEG having a better accuracy than peripheral signals on short periods of time. After the fusion of the two signal categories, the accuracy raised up to 63%.",2011.0,45.0,357.0,"{'volume': '41', 'pages': '1052-1063', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chanel2011EmotionAF,\n author = {G.

Design Parallel randomised controlled, open, trial. Participants were allocated using an online randomisation tool, handled by an independent person who was separate from the staff conducting the study. Setting General community, with recruitment nationally through mass media and advertisements. Participants 40 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder received a BA treatment, and 41 participants received a mindfulness treatment. 9 participants were lost at the post-treatment. Intervention BA: An 8-week long behaviour programme administered via a smartphone application. Mindfulness: An 8-week long mindfulness programme, administered via a smartphone application. Main outcome measures The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9). Results 81 participants were randomised (mean age 36.0 years (SD=10.8)) and analysed. Results showed no significant interaction effects of group and time on any of the outcome measures either from pretreatment to post-treatment or from pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed that the BA treatment was more effective than the mindfulness treatment among participants with higher initial severity of depression from pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up (PHQ-9: F (1, 362.1)=5.2, p<0.05). In contrast, the mindfulness treatment worked better than the BA treatment among participants with lower initial severity from pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up (PHQ-9: F (1, 69.3)=7.7, p<0.01); BDI-II: (F(1, 53.60)=6.25, p<0.05). Conclusions The two interventions did not differ significantly from one another. For participants with higher severity of depression, the treatment based on BA was superior to the treatment based on mindfulness. For participants with lower initial severity, the treatment based on mindfulness worked significantly better than the treatment based on BA.

In the near past, general community norms helped guide a clear sense of ethical boundaries with respect to privacy. One does not peek into the window of a house even if it is left open. One does not hire a private detective to investigate a casual date or the social life of a prospective employee. Yet with technological innovation rapidly driving new models for business and inviting new types of personal socialization, we often have nothing more than a fleeting intuition as to what is right or wrong. Our intuition may suggest that it is responsible to investigate the driving record of the nanny who drives our child to school, since such tools are now readily available. But is it also acceptable to seek out the records of other parents in our child’s car pool or of a date who picks us up by car? Alas, intuitions and perceptions of “creepiness” are highly subjective and difficult to generalize as social norms are being strained by new technologies and capabilities. And businesses that seek to create revenue opportunities by leveraging newly available data sources face huge challenges trying to operationalize such subjective notions into coherent business and policy strategies. This article presents a set of social and legal considerations to help individuals, engineers, businesses and policymakers navigate a world of new technologies and evolving social norms. These considerations revolve around concepts that we have explored in prior work, including enhanced transparency; accessibility to information in usable format; and the elusive principle of context.",2013.0,1.0,133.0,"{'volume': '16', 'pages': '2', 'name': 'Yale Journal of Law and Technology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tene2013ATO,\n author = {Omer Tene and Jules Polonetsky},\n journal = {Yale Journal of Law and Technology},\n pages = {2},\n title = {A Theory of Creepy: Technology, Privacy and Shifting Social Norms},\n volume = {16},\n year = {2013}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2301316', 'name': 'Omer Tene'}, {'authorId': '2476781', 'name': 'Jules Polonetsky'}]"

In classrooms and other school settings, children and adolescents need to have skills such as managing negative emotions, being calm and focused, following directions, and navigating relationships with peers and adults. To build and support these skills, schools have widely adopted social and emotional learning (SEL) programs. When well-designed and well-implemented, SEL programs are associated with positive outcomes; however, effect sizes are generally modest even for the most promising interventions. This issue of Social Policy Report proposes that schools should take a new approach: integrating the teaching and reinforcement of SEL skills into their daily interactions and practices with students. It explains that research warrants a new perspective and highlights a range of new approaches and support strategies that are designed to be time-efficient, low-cost, and integrated with (rather than distracting from) academic curricula. These strategies are grounded in an organizing framework for SEL and a review of current programmatic approaches to SEL. They are introduced with a set of principles for creating better integration of SEL into educational practice and accompanied by recommendations about the role of policy.",2012.0,125.0,295.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '1-33', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Jones2012SocialAE,\n author = {Stephanie M.

Theoretically, rumination is a multifaceted construct that aggregates multiple neurocognitive aspects of depression, including poor executive control, negative and overgeneral memory bias, and persistence or stickiness of negative mind states. Current measures of rumination, most-often self-reports, do not capture these different aspects of ruminative tendencies, and therefore are limited in providing detailed information about the mechanisms of mindfulness. Methods: we developed new insight into the potential mechanisms of rumination, based on three model-based metrics of free recall dynamics. These three measures reflect the patterns of memory retrieval of valenced information: the probability of first recall (Pstart) which represents initial affective bias, the probability of staying with the same valence category rather than switching, which indicates strength of positive or negative association networks (Pstay), and probability of stopping (Pstop) or ending recall within a given valence, which indicates persistence or stickiness of a mind state. We investigated the effects of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; N = 29) vs. wait-list control (N = 23) on these recall dynamics in a randomized controlled trial in individuals with recurrent depression. Participants completed a standard laboratory stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test, to induce negative mood and activate ruminative tendencies. Following that, participants completed a free recall task consisting of three word lists. This assessment was conducted both before and after treatment or wait-list. Results: while MBCT participant’s Pstart remained relatively stable, controls showed multiple indications of depression-related deterioration toward more negative and less positive bias. Following the intervention, MBCT participants decreased in their tendency to sustain trains of negative words and increased their tendency to sustain trains of positive words. Conversely, controls showed the opposite tendency: controls stayed in trains of negative words for longer, and stayed in trains of positive words for less time relative to pre-intervention scores. MBCT participants tended to stop recall less often with negative words, which indicates less persistence or stickiness of negatively valenced mental context. Conclusion: MBCT participants showed a decrease in patterns that may perpetuate rumination on all three types of recall dynamics (Pstart, Pstay, and Pstop), compared to controls. MBCT may weaken the strength of self-perpetuating negative associations networks that are responsible for the persistent and “sticky” negative mind states observed in depression, and increase the positive associations that are lacking in depression. This study also offers a novel, objective method of measuring several indices of ruminative tendencies indicative of the underlying mechanisms of rumination.",2012.0,227.0,87.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vugt2012TheEO,\n author = {Marieke K. van Vugt and Peter F Hitchcock and Ben Shahar and Willoughby B.

These two functions of advertising closely parallel the informational and transformational schools of advertising effects and theories on the central and peripheral routes to consumer persuasion.

In this paper, we focus on this challenging but interesting topic and make contributions from three aspects. First, we present a new large-scale 'in-the-wild' dynamic facial expression database, DFEW (Dynamic Facial Expression in the Wild), consisting of over 16,000 video clips from thousands of movies. These video clips contain various challenging interferences in practical scenarios such as extreme illumination, occlusions, and capricious pose changes. Second, we propose a novel method called Expression-Clustered Spatiotemporal Feature Learning (EC-STFL) framework to deal with dynamic FER in the wild. Third, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on DFEW using a lot of spatiotemporal deep feature learning methods as well as our proposed EC-STFL. Experimental results show that DFEW is a well-designed and challenging database, and the proposed EC-STFL can promisingly improve the performance of existing spatiotemporal deep neural networks in coping with the problem of dynamic FER in the wild.

84,06dfb42673971303655adcf9fac75fbfe19a9545,Lessons from the Flash Crash for the Regulation of High-Frequency Traders,"ABSTRACTAre equity markets vulnerable to a sudden collapse if the traders who account for about half of the volume have no regulatory obligations to stabilize prices? After the ""Flash Crash"" of May 6, 2010, policymakers have resoundingly answered this question in the affirmative. During the worst of the crash, some of the so-called high-frequency trading firms that dominate equity markets stopped trading and prices collapsed, momentarily wiping out almost $1 trillion in market value. In response, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is considering whether high-frequency trading firms should be required to act as the traders of last resort. This Note argues that the regulation under consideration would likely result in higher transaction costs without ensuring market liquidity or stability. This Note proposes instead that the largest high-frequency traders be subject to heightened regulatory oversight to ensure fair dealing.INTRODUCTIONIn twenty minutes on May 6, 2010, stock market investors lost about $862 billion.1 Fifteen minutes later, the market had surged back to recover almost all of it losses.2 It was the worst intrady pint drop on record for the 114-year-old Dow Jones Industrial Average.3 Individual investors who sold their stock during the worst of the panic may have lost more than $200 million relative to the closing price for the day.4 The so-called ""Flash Crash"" rattled investor confidence, sparking eight consecutive months of withdrawals from U.S. stock mutual funds for a total of almost $90 billion.5 Regulators and investors alike concluded that equity markets had simply failed.6Exchanges are supposed to reduce the cost of searching for the best price by establishing a venue where buyers and sellers meet and compete for trades.7 A single meeting place for traders helps develop prices that reflect the relevant information about the underlying economic value of a security.8 Yet when needed most on May 6, exchanges failed to provide liquidity at a fair price.9 More than 20,000 trades for some 300 securities were cancelled on May 6 because they were executed at ""clearly erroneous"" prices.10 Since May 6, there have also been periodic reports of similarly sudden breakdowns in the markets for certain securities."" Such extreme volatility hinders capital formation by raising the cost of equity capital for companies.12 As noted by one executive of a company whose shares plummeted on May 6, events like the Flash Crash deter investments in otherwise strong businesses merely because their shares are vulnerable to a market malfunction.13This Note analyzes some of the proposals aimed at preventing another Flash Crash in equity markets. In particular, it examines whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC,"" or the ""Commission"") should require high-frequency trading firms (""HFTs"") to act as the buyers or sellers of last resort.14 This could entail two kinds of requirements: an affirmative obligation to stand continuously ready to buy and sell a stock, and a negative obligation to refrain from trading in certain circumstances. Currently, only market makers have such obligations.15The Commission first suggested these obligations in January 2010, when it issued the Concept Release on Equity Market Structure with three dozen proposals to address issues arising from the growth of electronic trading.16 The SEC noted that although HFTs dominate equity trading, they can withdraw from the market at any moment since they are not subject to the same obligations as market makers.17 The SEC also stated that some HFT strategies fuel volatility and may even border on illegal manipulation.18 Public comments in response to the Concept Release focused on the SEC's far-reaching proposals to regulate HFTs.19 The Flash Crash greatly intensified the political pressure on the SEC to rein in HFTs.20Proponents of imposing market maker obligations on HFTs claim that they would stabilize the market in times of stress. …",2012.0,1.0,10.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '1195', 'name': 'Fordham Journal of Corporate & Financial Law'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Barrales2012LessonsFT,\n author = {Edgar Ortega Barrales},\n journal = {Fordham Journal of Corporate & Financial Law},\n pages = {1195},\n title = {Lessons from the Flash Crash for the Regulation of High-Frequency Traders},\n volume = {17},\n year = {2012}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2239446786', 'name': 'Edgar Ortega Barrales'}]"

To evaluate the reliability and validity of the PANAS (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988b) and provide normative data.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional and correlational.


METHOD
The PANAS was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult UK population (N = 1,003). Competing models of the latent structure of the PANAS were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression and correlational analysis were used to determine the influence of demographic variables on PANAS scores as well as the relationship between the PANAS with measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the DASS).


RESULTS
The best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon & Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory.


CONCLUSION
The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data.",2004.0,49.0,2565.0,"{'volume': '43 Pt 3', 'pages': '\n          245-65\n        ', 'name': 'The British journal of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Crawford2004ThePA,\n author = {J.

Entrepreneurs' ability to signal quality is crucial to succeeding in the competition for growth capital. However, the absence of institutions that verify endogenous signals may induce a moral hazard in signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, artificial linguistic intelligence indicates that token issuers systematically exaggerate information disclosed in whitepapers. Exaggerating entrepreneurs raise more funds in less time, suggesting that investors do not see through this practice initially. Eventually, the crowd learns about the exaggeration bias through trading with other investors. The resulting investor disappointment causes the cryptocurrency to depreciate and the probability of platform failure to increase.",2020.0,103.0,117.0,{'name': 'Corporate Finance: Governance'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Momtaz2020EntrepreneurialFA,\n author = {Paul P.

95,07733319f6c40020a266bc6963c1a2eb2bb42bef,The Path of Robotics Law,"This essay, written as a response to Ryan Calo's valuable discussion in ""Robotics and the Lessons of Cyberlaw,"" describes key problems that robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) agents present for law.The first problem is how to distribute rights and responsibilities among human beings when non-human agents create benefits like artistic works or cause harms like physical injuries. The difficulty is caused by the fact that the behavior of robotic and AI systems is ""emergent;"" their actions may not be predictable in advance or constrained by human expectations about proper behavior. Moreover, the programming and algorithms used by robots and AI entities may be the work of many hands, and may employ generative technologies that allow innovation at multiple layers. These features of robotics and AI enhance unpredictability and diffusion of causal responsibility for what robots and AI agents do. Lawrence Lessig's famous dictum that ""Code is Law"" argued that combinations of computer hardware and software, like other modalities of regulation, could constrain and direct human behavior. Robotics and AI present the converse problem. Instead of code as a law that regulates humans, robotics and AI feature emergent behavior that escapes human planning and expectations. Code is lawless.The second problem raised by robotics and AI is the ""substitution effect."" People will substitute robots and AI agents for living things — and especially for humans. But they will do so only in certain ways and only for certain purposes. In other words, people tend to treat robots and AI agents as special-purpose animals or special-purpose human beings. This substitution is likely to be incomplete, contextual, unstable, and often opportunistic. People may treat the robot as a person (or animal) for some purposes and as an object for others. The problem of substitution touches many different areas of law, and it promises to confound us for a very long time.Finally, the essay responds to Calo's argument about the lessons of cyberlaw for robotics. Calo argues that lawyers should identify the ""essential characteristics"" of robotics and then ask how the law should respond to the problems posed by those essential characteristics. I see the lessons of cyberlaw quite differently. We should not think of essential characteristics of technology independent of how people use technology in their lives and in their social relations with others. Because the use of technology in social life evolves, and because people continually find new ways to employ technology for good or for ill, it may be unhelpful to freeze certain features of use at a particular moment and label them ""essential characteristics."" Innovation in technology is not just innovation of tools and techniques; it may also involve innovation of economic, social and legal relations. As we innovate socially and economically, what appears most salient and important about our technologies may also change.",2015.0,4.0,56.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '45', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Balkin2015ThePO,\n author = {J.

Emotions play an important role in human-to-human communication and interaction, allowing people to express themselves beyond the verbal domain. The ability to understand human emotions is desirable for the computer in several applications. This paper explores new ways of human-computer interaction that enable the computer to be more aware of the user's emotional and attentional expressions. We present the basic research in the field and the recent advances into the emotion recognition from facial, voice, and physiological signals, where the different modalities are treated independently.

Our focus is on modelling an actor's decision making when they encounter notable events. We model GR as an iterative refinement process, where constraints introduced for each abstraction layer shape the solutions for successive layers. Our model provides a conceptual framework for robotics researchers and practitioners. We present a goal lifecycle and define a formal model for GR that(1) relates distinct disciplines concerning actors that operate on goals, and (2) provides a way to evaluate actors. We introduce GR using an example on waypoint navigation and outline its application, in three projects, for controlling simulated and real-world vehicles. We emphasize the relation of GR to planning, and encourage PlanRob researchers to collaborate in exploring this exciting frontier.",2014.0,53.0,29.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Roberts2014IterativeGR,\n author = {M.

Specifically, we examine the utility of EI in predicting health and well-being and point to future research issues that the field might profitably explore. EI is predictive of various indicators of well-being, as well as both physical and psychological health, but existing research has methodological limitations including over-reliance on self-report measures, and neglect of overlap between EI and personality measures. Interventions focusing on emotional perception, understanding and expression, and emotion regulation, seem potentially important for improving health and well-being, but research on EI has not yet made a major contribution to therapeutic practice. Future research, using a finer-grained approach to measurement of both predictors and criteria might most usefully focus on intra- and inter-personal processes that may mediate effects of EI on health.

Recognizing emotions is a challenging task due to the non-linear property of the EEG signal. This paper presents an advanced signal processing method using the deep neural network (DNN) for emotion recognition based on EEG signals. The spectral and temporal components of the raw EEG signal are first retained in the 2D Spectrogram before the extraction of features. The pre-trained AlexNet model is used to extract the raw features from the 2D Spectrogram for each channel. To reduce the feature dimensionality, spatial, and temporal based, bag of deep features (BoDF) model is proposed. A series of vocabularies consisting of 10 cluster centers of each class is calculated using the k-means cluster algorithm. Lastly, the emotion of each subject is represented using the histogram of the vocabulary set collected from the raw-feature of a single channel. Features extracted from the proposed BoDF model have considerably smaller dimensions. The proposed model achieves better classification accuracy compared to the recently reported work when validated on SJTU SEED and DEAP data sets. For optimal classification performance, we use a support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) to classify the extracted features for the different emotional states of the two data sets. The BoDF model achieves 93.8% accuracy in the SEED data set and 77.4% accuracy in the DEAP data set, which is more accurate compared to other state-of-the-art methods of human emotion recognition.",2019.0,55.0,66.0,"{'volume': '19', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Asghar2019EEGBasedME,\n author = {Muhammad Adeel Asghar and Muhammad Jamil Khan and Fawad and Y.

Using hierarchical regression analysis to examine this issue, this study investigates teachers’ perceptions of the relationships among the emotional job demands, emotional intelligence, emotional labour strategies and teaching satisfaction, with a particular focus on the moderating role of emotional intelligence. The results of a survey of 1281 Chinese teachers reveal that teachers’ perceptions of emotional job demands and emotional intelligence significantly predict the three emotional labour strategies. Emotional intelligence significantly moderates the impact of emotional job demands on surface acting and expression of naturally felt emotion but not deep acting. Even after controlling for emotional job demands and emotional intelligence, deep acting and expression of naturally felt emotion still have a positive influence on teachers’ teaching satisfaction. Deep acting and expression of naturally felt emotion are more effective emotional labour strategies for teachers.

Wine consumers’ opinions, thoughts, feelings and attitudes seem to appear in traditional channels, such as newspapers and magazines, as well as in digital channels, such as blogs, tweets, text messages, social media comments, and consumer ratings. These come in all sorts of formats, but most commonly through text (e.g. posts, tweets) and images (e.g. pictures and videos). Content analysis can be an effective way to understand these widely shared means of expressing sentiment towards a wine and the wine industry. This article examines 300 wine cartoons using a content analysis method that classifies their content into four analytical dimensions: narrative, domestication, binary struggle, and normative transference. This cartoon content analysis reveals details of how different types of wine customers consume and evaluate wine across contexts (e.g. wine in restaurants or at home). This analysis also explores public perception trends regarding wine: social status associations, emotional consumer responses, and consumption-specific concerns.

This study provides preliminary reference data for speech and articulatory rates of school-age children in conversational and narrative speaking contexts.


METHOD
Participants included 36 typically developing children in 3 groups of 12 participants at ages 7, 9, and 11 years. Conversational and narrative speech rates were measured in words per minute, syllables per minute, and syllables per second.


RESULTS
Speaking rates increased with age between ages 7 and 9, but rates were similar between ages 9 and 11. Between contexts, only the words per minute measure was significantly higher (faster) in narrative than in conversation.


IMPLICATIONS
These results are important to the assessment, treatment, and management of children with communication disorders in clinical or school settings.",2007.0,36.0,58.0,"{'volume': '38 1', 'pages': '\n          47-59\n        ', 'name': 'Language, speech, and hearing services in schools'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sturm2007SpeechAA,\n author = {J.

A key factor in human social interaction is our beliefs about others, a theory of mind. Whether we believe a message depends not only on its content but also on our model of the communicator. How we act depends not only on the immediate effect but also on how we believe others will react. In this paper, we discuss PsychSim, an implemented multiagent-based simulation tool for modeling interactions and influence. While typical approaches to such modeling have used first-order logic, Psych-Sim agents have their own decision-theoretic model of the world, including beliefs about its environment and recursive models of other agents. Using these quantitative models of uncertainty and preferences, we have translated existing psychological theories into a decision-theoretic semantics that allow the agents to reason about degrees of believability in a novel way.

130,0a8543686eeb03f28d8cb76933f9685e66a086bf,Appraisal Theory,"The appraisal framework, developed by Martin and White and their colleagues in the 1990s and 2000s (see, for example, Iedema, Feez, & White, 1993; Martin & White, 2005), provides for analyses of those meanings by which texts convey positive or negative assessments, by which the intensity or directness of such attitudinal utterances is strengthened or weakened and by which speakers/writers engage dialogistically with prior speakers or with potential respondents to the current proposition. These meaningmaking resources are grouped together as the “language of evaluation” on the grounds that they are all means by which the speaker’s/writer’s personal, evaluative involvement in the text is revealed as they adopt stances either toward phenomena (the entities, happenings, or states of affairs being construed by the text) or toward metaphenomena (propositions about these entities, happenings, and states of affairs). Early work on the appraisal framework largely focused on evaluative meanings in English, with this literature noting that no assumptions should be made as to whether the evaluative categories proposed for English necessarily operate in other languages. Subsequently, researchers have employed the descriptive principles that underlie the framework in work on other languages and in work that compares and contrasts evaluative meanings across languages (see, for example, Thomson & White, 2008). The view of language adopted by the architects of the appraisal framework is that of the systemic functional linguistic theory of Halliday and his associates (Halliday, 1994). Accordingly they hold that meaning-making can usefully be divided into three broad modes, or what Halliday terms “metafunctions”: (1) “ideational” meaning by which language construes the world of experience, (2) “interpersonal” meaning by which speakers/writers enact social roles, personas, and relationships, and (3) “textual” meaning by which these ideational and interpersonal meanings are organized into coherent texts appropriate for a given communicative setting. The evaluative meanings described by the appraisal framework provide some of the mechanisms by which the “interpersonal” metafunction operates, in that they present speakers/writers as revealing their feelings, tastes, and opinions with greater or lesser degrees of intensity and directness, as construing propositions as more or as less contentious or warrantable, and as thereby aligning or disaligning with value positions in play in the current communicative context. Within the model of the interpersonal metafunction proposed by Martin (1997) these resources of “appraisal” operate alongside two other interpersonal systems: those communicative resources by which speakers/writers perform speech functions such as asserting, questioning, responding, commanding, advising, and offering,",2020.0,7.0,275.0,{'name': 'Encyclopedia of Personality and Individual Differences'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{White2020AppraisalT,\n author = {P.

Correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the MAAS measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. An experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states.

Undergraduate students (N = 135) completed self-report questionnaires over the course of two assessment sessions (T1 and T2). Results of a linear regression in which the five dimensions of distress tolerance and covariates (i.e. T1 perceived stress, duration between T1 and T2) served as predictor variables and T2 perceived stress served as the outcome variable showed that intolerance of uncertainty was the only dimension of distress tolerance to predict T2 perceived stress. To better understand this prospective association, we conducted a post hoc analysis simultaneously regressing two subdimensions of intolerance of uncertainty on T2 perceived stress. The subdimension representing beliefs that “uncertainty has negative behavioral and self-referent implications” significantly predicted T2 perceived stress, while the subdimension indicating that “uncertainty is unfair and spoils everything” did not. Results support a growing body of research suggesting intolerance of uncertainty as a risk factor for a wide variety of maladaptive psychological outcomes.

139,0b5eecaa7abedf6b1cacf52ce712d6a00b0ec38f,The PHQ-9: validity of a brief depression severity measure.,"OBJECTIVE
While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.


MEASUREMENTS
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ""0"" (not at all) to ""3"" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.


RESULTS
As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.


CONCLUSION
In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.",2001.0,26.0,15124.0,"{'volume': '16 9', 'pages': '\n          606-13\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of general internal medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kroenke2001ThePV,\n author = {K.

Interestingly, more socially advantaged citizens (wealthier, better-educated, and urban residents) show the strongest approval of SCSs, along with older people.

This growth in our understanding of moral mechanisms overshadowed a crucial and complementary question, however: How are they learned? As this special issue of the journal Cognition attests, a new crop of research into moral learning has now firmly taken root. This new literature draws on recent advances in formal methods developed in other domains, such as Bayesian inference, reinforcement learning and other machine learning techniques. Meanwhile, it also demonstrates how learning and deciding in a social domain—and especially in the moral domain—sometimes involves specialized cognitive systems. We review the contributions to this special issue and situate them within the broader contemporary literature. Our review focuses on how we learn moral values and moral rules, how we learn about personal moral character and relationships, and the philosophical implications of these emerging models. 2017 Elsevier B.V.

150,0c30868380c00f3ca42b82dd4d5e7e0bda9f5c90,Identifying major depression using whole-brain functional connectivity: a multivariate pattern analysis.,"Recent resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown significant group differences in several regions and networks between patients with major depressive disorder and healthy controls. The objective of the present study was to investigate the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of depressed patients, which can be used to test the feasibility of identifying major depressive individuals from healthy controls. Multivariate pattern analysis was employed to classify 24 depressed patients from 29 demographically matched healthy volunteers. Permutation tests were used to assess classifier performance. The experimental results demonstrate that 94.3% (P < 0.0001) of subjects were correctly classified by leave-one-out cross-validation, including 100% identification of all patients. The majority of the most discriminating functional connections were located within or across the default mode network, affective network, visual cortical areas and cerebellum, thereby indicating that the disease-related resting-state network alterations may give rise to a portion of the complex of emotional and cognitive disturbances in major depression. Moreover, the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, which exhibit high discriminative power in classification, may play important roles in the pathophysiology of this disorder. The current study may shed new light on the pathological mechanism of major depression and suggests that whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging may provide potential effective biomarkers for its clinical diagnosis.",2012.0,92.0,648.0,"{'volume': '135 Pt 5', 'pages': '\n          1498-507\n        ', 'name': 'Brain : a journal of neurology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zeng2012IdentifyingMD,\n author = {L.

Such prototypic expressions, however, occur rather infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are more often communicated by changes in one or a few discrete facial features. In this paper, we develop an Automatic Face Analysis (AFA) system to analyze facial expressions based on both permanent facial features (brows, eyes, mouth) and transient facial features (deepening of facial furrows) in a nearly frontal-view face image sequence. The AFA system recognizes fine-grained changes in facial expression into action units (AUs) of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), instead of a few prototypic expressions. Multistate face and facial component models are proposed for tracking and modeling the various facial features, including lips, eyes, brows, cheeks, and furrows. During tracking, detailed parametric descriptions of the facial features are extracted. With these parameters as the inputs, a group of action units (neutral expression, six upper face AUs and 10 lower face AUs) are recognized whether they occur alone or in combinations. The system has achieved average recognition rates of 96.4 percent (95.4 percent if neutral expressions are excluded) for upper face AUs and 96.7 percent (95.6 percent with neutral expressions excluded) for lower face AUs. The generalizability of the system has been tested by using independent image databases collected and FACS-coded for ground-truth by different research teams.",2001.0,54.0,1816.0,"{'volume': '23 2', 'pages': '\n          97-115\n        ', 'name': 'IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tian2001RecognizingAU,\n author = {Ying-li Tian and T.

156,0d5e0110fadb6a4503c517f5669440bba43755f8,Emotion Recognition from Text Based on Automatically Generated Rules,"With the growth of the Internet community, textual data has proven to be the main tool of communication in human-machine and human-human interaction. This communication is constantly evolving towards the goal of making it as human and real as possible. One way of humanizing such interaction is to provide a framework that can recognize the emotions present in the communication or the emotions of the involved users in order to enrich user experience. For example, by providing insights to users for personal preferences and automated recommendations based on their emotional state. In this work, we propose a framework for emotion classification in English sentences where emotions are treated as generalized concepts extracted from the sentences. We start by generating an intermediate emotional data representation of a given input sentence based on its syntactic and semantic structure. We then generalize this representation using various ontologies such as Word Net and Concept Net, which results in an emotion seed that we call an emotion recognition rule (ERR). Finally, we use a suite of classifiers to compare the generated ERR with a set of reference ERRs extracted from a training set in a similar fashion. The used classifiers are k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with handcrafted similarity measure, Point Mutual Information (PMI), and PMI with Information Retrieval (PMI-IR). When applied on different datasets, the proposed approach significantly outperformed the existing state-of-the art machine learning and rule-based classifiers with an average F-Score of 84%.",2014.0,31.0,90.0,"{'pages': '383-392', 'name': '2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shaheen2014EmotionRF,\n author = {Shadi Shaheen and W.

To assess the nature of these relationships and to predict the factors implied on life satisfaction, positive and negative affect, work satisfaction and alexithymia measures were used. 52 university teachers (30 men and 22 women) completed the Spanish version of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale for emotional intelligence (TMMS, Fernández-Berrocal, Extremera & Ramos, 2004). Alexithymia was measured by the Spanish version of the TAS-20 (Martínez-Sánchez, 1996), and life satisfaction was measured by SWLS (Díaz Morales, 2001). Also, Work Satisfaction Scale was used (JWS, Grajales & Araya, 2001). Our results yield a strong correlation between life satisfaction and TMMS subscales (emotional Clarity and emotional Repair), TAS-20 subscales (difficulty to describe emotions and external oriented thinking), and Work Satisfaction Scale. Further analyses show that the life satisfaction most significant predictors were positive and negative affect and emotional Clarity. These results support the incremental validity of self-report measures, as the TMMS, and the capacity of constructs related to emotional intelligence to explain the differences on life satisfaction independently from personality traits and mood states constructs.",2006.0,45.0,111.0,"{'volume': '18 Suppl', 'pages': '\n          152-7\n        ', 'name': 'Psicothema'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Landa2006PerceivedEI,\n author = {J.

162,0dfcae7e1c1eb6d07b59c1d84ec07ee6f47089bc,Systematic Review: Emotion Recognition Based on Electrophysiological Patterns for Emotion Regulation Detection,"The electrophysiological basis of emotion regulation (ER) has gained increased attention since efficient emotion recognition and ER allow humans to develop high emotional intelligence. However, no methodological standardization has been established yet. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a critical systematic review to identify experimental methodologies that evoke emotions and record, analyze and link electrophysiological signals with emotional experience by statistics and artificial intelligence, and lastly, define a clear application of assessing emotion processing. A total of 42 articles were selected after a search based on six scientific browsers: Web of Science, EBSCO, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest and ScienceDirect during the first semester of 2020. Studies were included if (1) electrophysiological signals recorded on human subjects were correlated with emotional recognition and/or regulation; (2) statistical models, machine or deep learning methods based on electrophysiological signals were used to analyze data. Studies were excluded if they met one or more of the following criteria: (1) emotions were not described in terms of continuous dimensions (valence and arousal) or by discrete variables, (2) a control group or neutral state was not implemented, and (3) results were not obtained from a previous experimental paradigm that aimed to elicit emotions. There was no distinction in the selection whether the participants presented a pathological or non-pathological condition, but the condition of subjects must have been efficiently detailed for the study to be included. The risk of bias was limited by extracting and organizing information on spreadsheets and participating in discussions between the authors. However, the data size selection, such as the sample size, was not considered, leading to bias in the validity of the analysis. This systematic review is presented as a consulting source to accelerate the development of neuroengineering-based systems to regulate the trajectory of emotional experiences early on.",2023.0,97.0,1.0,{'name': 'Applied Sciences'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Duville2023SystematicRE,\n author = {M.

The concrete realization of these ideas implies that the design process must start with an analysis of the requirements that the features of the environment, the characteristics of the action-selection task, and the agent architecture impose on the emotional system. This is particularly important if we see emotions as mechanisms that aim at modifying or maintaining the relation of the agent with its (external and internal) environment (rather than modifying the environment itself) in order to preserve the agent's goals. Emotions can then be selected and designed according to the roles they play with respect to this relation.",2000.0,34.0,46.0,"{'volume': '29', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cañamero2000DesigningEF,\n author = {Dolores Cañamero},\n title = {Designing Emotions for Activity Selection},\n volume = {29},\n year = {2000}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1719487', 'name': 'Dolores Cañamero'}]"

Posting online reviews has become an increasingly popular way for people to share their opinions about specific product or service with other users. It has become a common practice for web technologies to provide the venues and facilities for people to publish their reviews. Sentiment classification and feature based summarization are essential steps for the classification and summarization of movie reviews. System proposed Random forest method for sentiment classification of movie reviews. Identification of movie features and opinion words are both important for feature based summarization. System identified movie features using a novel approach called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and frequency based approach. Then system identified opinion words using part-of-speech (POS) tagging method. The result of LSA is extended to LSA based filtering mechanism to reduce the size of review summary.

A new explanation for the great rise in America's attention to corporate leaders,"type=""main"" xml:id=""smj2258-abs-0001""> We introduce a new explanation for one of the most pronounced phenomena on the American business landscape in recent decades: a dramatic increase in attributions of CEO significance. Specifically, we test the possibility that America's CEOs became seen as increasingly significant because they were, in fact, increasingly significant. Employing variance partitioning methodologies on data spanning 60 years and more than 18,000 firm-years, we find that the proportion of variance in performance explained by individual CEOs, or “the CEO effect,” increased substantially over the decades of study. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this finding.

A drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of two nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFI) and nonnormed (FI) fit indexes. CFI avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for Bentler and Bonett's (1980) normed fit index (NFI). FI is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's non-normed fit index (NNFI) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFI. Asymptotically, CFI, FI, NFI, and a new index developed by Bollen are equivalent measures of comparative fit, whereas NNFI measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes.",1990.0,26.0,22137.0,"{'volume': '107 2', 'pages': '\n          238-46\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bentler1990ComparativeFI,\n author = {P.

Particular attention is paid to the capacities of different digital media, both individually and combined, to help facilitate, but certainly not guarantee, different emotions. The research is informed by a feminist geographical reading of theories of digital media and emotion. Findings illustrate that increasingly mothers are making use of digital media, both singularly and collectively, to increase the chances of a particular desired emotional outcome with their child or children.

180,0fef4cbe4c1b7b6312383d2cdccf93f195fcc5bc,The flow experience and its significance for human psychology.,"In the ordinary course of events, psychologists observe human action either in clinical settings, where the “patient” is seeking therapeutic redress for some impairment, or in experimental settings, where the confines of the laboratory and the parameters of the experimental design allow only a tiny fraction of potential responses to be manifested. The theoretical models of human action that psychologists have constructed in the past half century reflect this poverty of observational data: They tend to be mechanistic, reductive, and biased in favor of pathology. To provide a more complete view of what human behavior and experience entail, it is necessary to begin observing what people do and what happens to them when they are not confined to the couch or the laboratory, but are involved in their normal lives in real ecological settings. In particular, it is important to observe them in those moments when their lives reach peaks of involvement that produce intense feelings of enjoyment and creativity. Without accounting for these aspects of experience, models of human behavior will remain one-sided and incomplete. The studies of the flow experience included in this volume attempt to provide evidence on which a more realistic model of human behavior can be built. The major psychological trends of this century – including drive theories, psychoanalysis, behaviorism, cognitive psychology, and the contemporary atheoretical neuropharmacological approaches – all share a common epistemology.",1988.0,0.0,846.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '15-35', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Csíkszentmihályi1988TheFE,\n author = {M.

184,1019ce446b3f6cd493ae46c00680b837f5c63fb2,What Does the Public Think? Examining Plastic Surgery Perceptions through the Twitterverse,"Background: Twitter is a recognized social media platform for communication of health information. Rime reported that emotion is the main motive for social sharing. This study is a content analysis of Twitter that was performed to identify the public’s perceptions and attitudes toward plastic surgery and the emotional triggers that drive social sharing of plastic surgery information. Methods: Tweets containing “#PlasticSurgery” or “Plastic Surgery” were archived randomly from August 1, 2014, to December 30, 2016 (n = 4548). Tweets were categorized according to tweet author, specialty, topic, content, multimedia included, emotion, tone, accuracy of information, source, and retweet rate. Statistical analysis was performed to detect significant patterns. Results: Tweets on cosmetic surgery (74 percent) were shared mostly on Twitter, predominantly posted by the public [n = 1611 (48 percent)]. More than 13 percent of posts contained “celebrity news” and 42.8 percent contained professional information and resources. The most frequent emotions shared and retweeted were “relaxed/content” (51.5 percent) and “excited/interested” (18.4 percent). Most tweets posted by the public contained inaccurate information [n = 1486 (80 percent)]. Only 154 (11.2 percent) of board-certified plastic surgeons’ tweets were rated as “most accurate.” Conclusions: The majority of tweets posted on Twitter contained inaccurate information that can lead to misperception among the public. Understanding emotional triggers for social sharing provides insight into what is most appealing. To enhance public uptake and sharing of tweets, plastic surgeons can use these findings to promote the specialty using relaxed/content emotions or excitement in their social media posts.",2018.0,26.0,31.0,"{'volume': '142', 'pages': '265–274', 'name': 'Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kalandar2018WhatDT,\n author = {Abeer Kalandar and S.

Pet therapy has been known to be emotionally beneficial for many years. Robotic pets have been shown to have similar positive effects without the negative aspects of traditional pets. Robotic pet therapy offers an alternative to traditional pet therapy. Objective: The study rigorously assesses the effectiveness of the PARO robotic pet, an FDA approved biofeedback device, in treating dementia-related symptoms. Methods: A randomized block design with repeated measurements guided the study. Before and after measures included reliable, valid tools such as: RAID, CSDD, GDS, pulse rate, pulse oximetry, and GSR. Participants interacted with the PARO robotic pet, and the control group received standard activity programs. Five urban secure dementia units comprised the setting. Results: 61 patients, with 77% females, average 83.4 years in age, were randomized into control and treatment groups. Compared to the control group, RAID, CSDD, GSR, and pulse oximetry were increased in the treatment group, while pulse rate, pain medication, and psychoactive medication use were decreased. The changes in GSR, pulse oximetry, and pulse rate over time were plotted for both groups. The difference between groups was consistent throughout the 12-week study for pulse oximetry and pulse rate, while GSR had several weeks when changes were similar between groups. Conclusions: Treatment with the PARO robot decreased stress and anxiety in the treatment group and resulted in reductions in the use of psychoactive medications and pain medications in elderly clients with dementia.",2016.0,17.0,177.0,"{'volume': '55', 'pages': '569 - 574', 'name': ""Journal of Alzheimer's Disease""}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Petersen2016TheUO,\n author = {Sandra Petersen and Susan Houston and Huanying Qin and C.

The phenomenon of EU law operating beyond its borders, which may be termed its ‘global reach’, includes the extraterritorial application of EU law, territorial extension, and the so-called ‘Brussels Effect’ resulting from unilateral legislative and regulatory action. It also includes the impact of the EU’s bilateral relationships, and its engagement with multilateral fora and the negotiation of international legal instruments. The book maps this phenomenon across a range of policy fields, including the environment, the internet and data protection, banking and financial markets, competition policy and migration. It argues that in looking beyond the undoubtedly important instrumental function of law we can start to identify the ways in which law shapes the EU’s external identity and its relations with other legal regimes, both enabling and constraining the EU’s external action.",2019.0,0.0,7.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{None,\n title = {EU Law Beyond EU Borders},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}",[]

Yet devices such as fitness trackers, personal home assistants (e.g., Amazon Echo, Google Home), and digital appliances are changing the nature of privacy as they operate silently in the background while transmitting data about a broad range of human activities and behaviors. As “smart” becomes the new default setting for devices, consumers are further losing the ability to monitor and control the data collected about them, and they often have little awareness of what is done with their data downstream. The risks of sharing data through smart devices are not always clear, particularly as companies combine data from different sources to infer an individual’s habits, movements, and even emotions.<br><br>This report is the culmination of eighteen months of empirical research into the privacy risks of the internet of things, involving over forty experts, scholars, business-people, advocates, regulators, lawyers, engineers, and other experts. It provides an overview of some of the key privacy issues resulting from the expansion of the IoT, as well as emerging frameworks that could help policymakers and corporate leaders reduce potential harms through regulation and product design. Among the findings outlined in this paper:<br><br>• The IoT has the potential to diminish the sanctity of spaces that have long been considered private, and could have a “chilling effect” as people grow aware of the risk of surveillance. Yet the same methods of privacy preservation that work in the online world are not always practical or appropriate for the personal types of data collection that the IoT enables.<br><br>• Several frameworks have emerged for addressing the privacy issues that the IoT presents. Some focus on giving users more meaningful, granular control over the data that is collected, when it's collected, and how it is shared, while others focus on the accessibility and correct timing of privacy notices.<br><br>• Policymakers should take steps to regulate the privacy effects of IoT before mass sensor data collection becomes ubiquitous, rather than after. Omnibus privacy legislation can help regulate how data is handled in the grey areas between sectors and contexts. Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), coming into force in 2018, will have an impact initially on IoT devices created and sold in the EU, and will affect those from the US as well over time.<br><br>• Having broad non-specialist conversations about the use, collection, and effects of IoT data is essential to help the populace understand technological changes in this space and how they affect privacy expectations.<br><br>• Makers of IoT products and services should employ a variety of standard measures to provide greater user management and control, as well as more effective notification about how personal data is captured, stored, analyzed, and shared.",2018.0,117.0,14.0,{'name': 'Materials Science Educator: Courses'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Rosner2018ClearlyOP,\n author = {Gilad L.

We identify a weakness of LSTM networks processing continual input streams that are not a priori segmented into subsequences with explicitly marked ends at which the network's internal state could be reset. Without resets, the state may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is a novel, adaptive forget gate that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review illustrative benchmark problems on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve continual versions of these problems.

Students need opportunities to practice and demonstrate their creativity and gain an awareness of the importance of such skills to enhance their graduate capabilities. One way is to embed creativity into course assessment and link it to an employability context. This article describes how we used a staff-student co-creation framework to develop a group project assessment task encouraging 400+ first-year online students to express their creativity and demonstrate graduate attributes. We were also interested in students’ perspectives of empowerment, collegiality and authenticity. Our findings indicate the task enabled student groups to generate a diverse array of creative educational products for varied audiences. Most students valued the opportunity to express their creativity and were able to see the connection with creativity and other soft skills along with future opportunities and achievements. The group work aspects of the task helped many students feel connected to their peers and in control of their assessment. Students perceived that this assessment task reflected multiple aspects of authenticity. We demonstrate co-created creative assessment can be undertaken in large first year science classes to facilitate student learning and capability development.",2021.0,36.0,3.0,"{'volume': '47', 'pages': '1149 - 1166', 'name': 'Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Colson2021SwitchingOT,\n author = {N.

In this paper we derive distributions of transaction prices in limit order markets populated by low frequency traders (humans) before and after the entrance of a high frequency trader (machine). We find that the presence of a machine is likely to change the average transaction price, even in the absence of new information. We also find that in a market with a high frequency trader, the distribution of transaction prices has more mass around the center and thinner far tails. With a machine, mean intertrade duration decreases in proportion to the increase in the ratio of the human order arrival rates with and without the presence of the machine; trading volume goes up by the same rate. We show that the machine makes positive expected profits by ""sniping"" out human orders somewhat away from the front of the book. This explains the shape of the transaction price density.

However, artificial general intelligence (AGI) agents can find undesirable ways of maximising any prior reward function. Therefore, value learning is crucial for safe AGI. We assume that generalised states of the world are valuable – not rewards themselves, and propose an extension of AIXI, in which rewards are used only to bootstrap hierarchical value learning. The modified AIXI agent is considered in the multi-agent environment, where other agents can be either humans or other ‘mature’ agents, the values of which should be revealed and adopted by the ‘infant’ AGI agent. A general framework for designing such empathic agent with ethical bias is proposed as an extension of the universal intelligence model as well.

In order to decrease alert frequency while retaining clinical relevance, we developed a method to assess dynamic, patient-tailored RIs based on mixed-effects linear regression models. Potassium test results from primary care were used as proof-of-concept test bed. Clinical relevance was assessed via a survey administered to general practitioners (GPs). Overall, the dynamic, patient-tailored method and the combination of both methods flagged 20% and 36% fewer values as abnormal than the population-based method. Nineteen out of 43 invited GPs (44%) completed the survey. The population-based method yielded a better sensitivity than the patient-tailored and the combined methods (0.51 vs 0.41 and 0.38, respectively) but a lower PPV (0.66 vs 0.67 and 0.76, respectively).

214,12e3ef5354246f8e99a09d39f20303290acbcfba,Designing A Self-Aware Neuromorphic Hybrid,"A top-level integration of symbolic and connectionist components of a cognitive architecture can be achieved through the blending of innovative concepts used in both components. i) On the connectionist side the key innovative elements are neuromorphic cognitive maps that provide for associative indexing and organization of symbolic memories and path-finding in modeled cognitive spaces. On the symbolic side the key innovative elements are: ii) a unique, central notion of “self”, and iii) a formal representation system based on the general notion of a “schema”. In this work we describe a theoretical framework allowing us to design an implementable cognitive architecture of this sort. The Challenge of Integration The grand vision of integrated, versatile, intelligent systems capable of unlimited, autonomous cognitive growth starting from a minimal embryo [22] is a difficult, but probably the most interesting and critical challenge of our time. Achieving this meta-goal of artificial intelligence requires certain key features of human cognition to be enabled in an agent: (a) the cognitive growth ability consisting of basic human kinds of learning: abilities to learn problem spaces autonomously (by exploration of environments and previously acquired episodic memories) and from an instructor (by consultation or by mimicking instructor’s behavior); (b) basic human kinds of memory, including episodic memory understood as memory of personal experience of the subject; (c) social metacognition (simulationist ‘theory-of-mind’ capabilities: can simulate other minds), including social imagery (‘what if’ capabilities: can imagine self and others in plausible situations); (d) real-world communication capabilities, including anaphoric reference resolution and other techniques studied by discourse representation theory [41] that use mental simulations; (e) higher emotional capabilities, including appreciation of subjective feelings resulting from emotional evaluation of mental states and the ability to understand and to simulate emotions observed in other agents. Copyright © 2002, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. It is well known that in humans the development of (a) – (e) critically depends on (1) the neuronal networks of the brain and (2) “the child’s conception of self during the age-4 transition” [4]: this transition, according to Barresi [4] and to other works in developmental psychology, consists in rapid, simultaneous development of the entire complex of those cognitive abilities (a) – (e) that require the Self as a precondition. Therefore, mimicking a human self in a neuromorphic artifact could be a major step toward enabling the emergence of (a) – (e) upon implementation. A straightforward approach to mimicking the human self in a neuromorphic cognitive system could be to study the brain, to describe and to replicate its functionality step by step. The progress made in this direction in brain sciences during last decades is tremendous: brain areas related to highest cognition in humans are identified (such as the hippocampal formation, medial temporal and frontal lobes), their functions are characterized, connectionist models of the underlying mechanisms are studied numerically and related to brain imaging. At the same time, there is an enormous gap between brain sciences and artificial intelligence. We believe in a possibility to bridge this gap based on a mapping between the brain architecture and cognitive architectures, expecting the complex of structure-function relations be capable of self-completion in a new substratum. It is therefore wise to use results from cognitive and computational neuroscience in our selfaware cognitive architecture design that logically takes off from studies of the human mind and the self.

Peripheral physiological signals were measured through wearable biofeedback sensors and an anxiety-based difficulty altering methodology for a Pong game was designed and implemented. The results from affect-elicitation tasks for human participants showed that it is possible to detect affective states of anxiety, engagement, boredom and frustration through physiological sensing in real-time.

The increasing demand for technological verification of identity is a result of intricate connections between our notions of the self, order, efficiency and security. Behind the growing acceptance of these new technologies, such as biometric passports, biometric ID cards, drug testing, and DNA databases, are fears connected to those who may have a ‘stolen identity’, are unidentified, or ‘identity-less’, such as potentially fraudulent welfare recipients, ‘identity thieves’, terrorists, immigrants and asylum seekers. However, unlike Foucault's disciplinary power, the latest technologies no longer see the body as something that needs to be trained and disciplined, but rather as a source of unprecedented accuracy and precision. Bodies become ‘coded’ and function as ‘passwords’. This form of identification is particularly relevant since its mode of operation enables identification and denial of access at-a-distance, thus fitting perfectly into the contemporary modes of disembedded global governance.",2006.0,57.0,169.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '143 - 158', 'name': 'Crime, Media, Culture: An International Journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Aas2006TheBD,\n author = {K.

Jitter and shimmer are proposed as minimal, reliable and effective features for speech emotion recognition since it is difficult to bring about such minute variations in intensity and pitch artificially, without actually experiencing the emotions. The identification of such a minimal feature set could result in savings of time and effort. It is significant in the present SER scenario where the performance of emotion recognition systems relies on hundreds of features, the collection of which is time consuming. These investigations were conducted on a database of induced emotional speech of females developed exclusively for this purpose. 2765 wave files in English and 2240 wave files in Hindi were statistically analyzed. Multiple classifiers were used for validating the classification results. Maximum overall accuracy of 64.8% for English SER and 83.3% for Hindi SER have been obtained with an ANN classifier when classifying seven different emotions.",2016.0,8.0,20.0,"{'pages': '0886-0890', 'name': '2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jacob2016SpeechER,\n author = {Agnes Jacob},\n journal = {2016 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP)},\n pages = {0886-0890},\n title = {Speech emotion recognition based on minimal voice quality features},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1923515367', 'name': 'Agnes Jacob'}]"

Although there has been a considerable amount of research on automatic emotion recognition in adults, emotion recognition in children has been understudied. This problem is more challenging as children tend to fidget and move around more than adults, leading to more self-occlusions and non-frontal head poses. Also, the lack of publicly available datasets for children with annotated emotion labels leads most researchers to focus on adults. In this paper, we introduce a newly collected multimodal emotion dataset of children between the ages of four and fourteen years old. The dataset contains 1102 audio-visual clips annotated for 17 different emotional states: six basic emotions, neutral, valence and nine complex emotions including curiosity, uncertainty and frustration. Our experiments compare unimodal and multimodal emotion recognition baseline models to enable future research on this topic.

The widespread inclination to associate empathy with the morally and socially “good”—with compassion, understanding, cultural bonding, and non-violent sociality—ignores what we propose to call the “dark side of empathy”: that is, the multiple ways in which empathy is routinely deployed to manipulate, seduce, deceive, and dehumanize others by means of vicariousness. Two diverse ethnographic cases, of hunting in Siberia and political violence in Indonesia, provide the empirical background for a discussion of the complex relationship of empathy to mimesis, deception, violence, and sociality.",2015.0,117.0,72.0,"{'volume': '57', 'pages': '5 - 34', 'name': 'Comparative Studies in Society and History'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bubandt2015TheDS,\n author = {N.

Emotion recognition has been widely explored in the broader fields of human–machine interaction and affective computing. Here, we report recent advances in emotion recognition, with particular regard to the human–robot interaction context. Our aim is to review the state of the art of currently adopted emotional models, interaction modalities, and classification strategies and offer our point of view on future developments and critical issues.

Moreover, we examine to what extent players’ privacy concerns moderate these effects. Drawing on self-determination theory and uncertainty reduction theory, we developed and tested a game with varying levels of customization features and brand trust. Results show that customization possibilities and brand trust may have a positive influence on advergame persuasion outcomes, but this influence is strongly conditioned by consumers’ privacy concerns. When privacy concerns are low, a game containing customization features leads to a more positive brand attitude. However, when privacy concerns are high, the effect becomes negative. Additionally, we find that different levels of privacy concerns do not affect players’ responses toward high trust brands, but toward low trust brands. For low trust brands, players with high privacy concerns show more negative game responses than players with low concerns. These findings set the boundaries for several theoretical and practical implications regarding advergame effectiveness.",2017.0,92.0,29.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '60 - 81', 'name': 'International Journal of Advertising'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wottrich2017TheRO,\n author = {V.

The aim of the embedding is to approximate this distribution as well as possible when the same operation is performed on the low-dimensional ""images"" of the objects. A natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, one per object, which leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of the low-dimensional images. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each object by a mixture of widely separated low-dimensional images.

Individuals are members of the Kauai Longitudinal Study, which followed all children born in 1955 on a Hawaiian island from the perinatal period to ages 1, 2, 10, 18, and 32 years. Several clusters of protective factors and processes were identified that enabled most of these high-risk individuals to become competent and caring adults.

However, biofeedback games are expensive and difficult to create and are not sufficiently appealing to hold a child's interest over the long term needed for effective biofeedback training. We present a system that turns off-the-shelf computer games into biofeedback games. Our approach uses texture-based graphical overlays that vary in their obfuscation of underlying screen elements based on the sensed physiological state of the child. The textures can be visually customized so that they appear to be integrated with the underlying game. Through a 12-week deployment, with 16 children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, we show that our solution can hold a child's interest over a long term, and balances the competing needs of maintaining the fun of playing, while providing effective biofeedback training.",2013.0,24.0,57.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Mandryk2013GamesAN,\n author = {R.

Lawyers and scientists repeatedly express a need for practical and objective substantive guidance on the lawful development of autonomy in weapon systems. This Article proposes five foundational principles to enable development of responsible AWS policy. The findings emerged from a research project conducted by a team of military and civilian professors at the Stockton Center for the Study of International Law at the U.S. Naval War College. The study is informed by experts in computer sciences, government and military, non-governmental organizations, think tanks, and academia. 
Advances in AI will likely produce AWS that are different in kind from existing weapon systems and thus require a fresh approach to evaluating IHL compliance. First, this Article describes the technological details pertinent to understanding the distinction between current and future systems. It argues that the technological evaluation of the spectrum of autonomy should focus on the combination of authorities granted to the computer that controls an AWS, while also taking into account the physical capabilities of the system. Second, it argues that a key issue bearing on IHL compliance is whether an AWS has been granted some combination of authorities and capabilities that functionally delegate the decision to kill from human to machine. Third, it posits that predictability must be at the core of an evaluation into whether a particular AWS breaches this delegation threshold and examines how AI handles uncertainty, a critical component of the predictability analysis. Finally, the Article proposes five foundational principles to guide the development of AWS policy.",2017.0,0.0,23.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Schuller2017AtTC,\n author = {Alan L.

 In this paper, we show that personalized levels can be auto- matically generated for platform games. We build on previ- ous work, where models were derived that predicted player experience based on features of level design and on playing styles. These models are constructed using preference learn- ing, based on questionnaires administered to players after playing different levels. The contributions of the current pa- per are (1) more accurate models based on a much larger data set; (2) a mechanism for adapting level design parameters to given players and playing style; (3) evaluation of this adap- tation mechanism using both algorithmic and human players. The results indicate that the adaptation mechanism effectively optimizes level design parameters for particular players.

Mindfulness meditation delivered via a mobile app may be an appealing, efficacious way to reduce stress in college students. Objective We aimed to test the initial efficacy and sustained effects of an 8-week mindfulness meditation mobile app—Calm—compared to a wait-list control on stress, mindfulness, and self-compassion in college students with elevated stress. We also explored the intervention’s effect on health behaviors (ie, sleep disturbance, alcohol consumption [binge drinking], physical activity, and healthy eating [fruit and vegetable consumption]) and the feasibility and acceptability of the app. Methods This study was a randomized, wait-list, control trial with assessments at baseline, postintervention (8 weeks), and at follow-up (12 weeks). Participants were eligible if they were current full-time undergraduate students and (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) scored ≥14 points on the Perceived Stress Scale, (3) owned a smartphone, (4) were willing to download the Calm app, (5) were willing to be randomized, and (7) were able to read and understand English. Participants were asked to meditate using Calm at least 10 minutes per day. A P value ≤.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 88 participants were included in the analysis. The mean age (SD) was 20.41 (2.31) years for the intervention group and 21.85 (6.3) years for the control group. There were significant differences in all outcomes (stress, mindfulness, and self-compassion) between the intervention and control groups after adjustment for covariates postintervention (all P<.04). These effects persisted at follow-up (all P<.03), except for the nonreacting subscale of mindfulness (P=.08). There was a significant interaction between group and time factors in perceived stress (P=.002), mindfulness (P<.001), and self-compassion (P<.001). Bonferroni posthoc tests showed significant within-group mean differences for perceived stress in the intervention group (P<.001), while there were no significant within-group mean differences in the control group (all P>.19). Similar results were found for mindfulness and self-compassion. Effect sizes ranged from moderate (0.59) to large (1.24) across all outcomes. A significant group×time interaction in models of sleep disturbance was found, but no significant effects were found for other health behaviors. The majority of students in the intervention group reported that Calm was helpful to reduce stress and stated they would use Calm in the future. The majority were satisfied using Calm and likely to recommend it to other college students. The intervention group participated in meditation for an average of 38 minutes/week during the intervention and 20 minutes/week during follow-up. Conclusions Calm is an effective modality to deliver mindfulness meditation in order to reduce stress and improve mindfulness and self-compassion in stressed college students. Our findings provide important information that can be applied to the design of future studies or mental health resources in university programs.

Building on the idea that systemic effects of CHD risk factors are a conglomeration of genetic and environmental factors, we use machine learning techniques and integrate genetic, epigenetic and phenotype data from the Framingham Heart Study to build and test a Random Forest classification model for symptomatic CHD. Our classifier was trained on n = 1,545 individuals and consisted of four DNA methylation sites, two SNPs, age and gender. The methylation sites and SNPs were selected during the training phase. The final trained model was then tested on n = 142 individuals. The test data comprised of individuals removed based on relatedness to those in the training dataset. This integrated classifier was capable of classifying symptomatic CHD status of those in the test set with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 78%, 0.75 and 0.80, respectively. In contrast, a model using only conventional CHD risk factors as predictors had an accuracy and sensitivity of only 65% and 0.42, respectively, but with a specificity of 0.89 in the test set. Regression analyses of the methylation signatures illustrate our ability to map these signatures to known risk factors in CHD pathogenesis. These results demonstrate the capability of an integrated approach to effectively model symptomatic CHD status. These results also suggest that future studies of biomaterial collected from longitudinally informative cohorts that are specifically characterized for cardiac disease at follow-up could lead to the introduction of sensitive, readily employable integrated genetic-epigenetic algorithms for predicting onset of future symptomatic CHD.",2018.0,51.0,63.0,"{'volume': '13', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dogan2018IntegratedGA,\n author = {Meeshanthini V Dogan and I.

The data compiled and portraits created are incredibly detailed, to the point of being invasive. But who connects the dots about what firms are doing with this information? The Black Box Society argues that we all need to be able to do soand to set limits on how big data affects our lives. Hidden algorithms can make (or ruin) reputations, decide the destiny of entrepreneurs, or even devastate an entire economy. Shrouded in secrecy and complexity, decisions at major Silicon Valley and Wall Street firms were long assumed to be neutral and technical. But leaks, whistleblowers, and legal disputes have shed new light on automated judgment. Self-serving and reckless behavior is surprisingly common, and easy to hide in code protected by legal and real secrecy. Even after billions of dollars of fines have been levied, underfunded regulators may have only scratched the surface of this troubling behavior. Frank Pasquale exposes how powerful interests abuse secrecy for profit and explains ways to rein them in. Demanding transparency is only the first step. An intelligible society would assure that key decisions of its most important firms are fair, nondiscriminatory, and open to criticism.

At 94 cm tall, the iCub is the same size as a three year-old child and is designed to be able to crawl on all fours and sit up. Its hands will allow dexterous manipulation, its head and eyes are fully articulated, and it has visual, vestibular, auditory, and haptic sensory capabilities. We begin by reviewing briefly the enactive approach to cognition, highlighting the requirements for phylogenetic configuration, the necessity for ontogenetic development, and the importance of humanoid embodiment. After a short look at the the iCub's mechanical and electronic specifications, we detail the iCub cognitive architecture, addressing the iCub phylogeny, i.e. the robot's intended innate abilities, the modulation of these skills by circuits inspired by the functionality of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and amygdala. The architecture also include a prospective ability whereby sensorimotor behaviours can be simulated and then used to influence the action selection in the basal ganglia.

Ten focus groups were organized, two from each age group. One group for each age included the students with the lowest scores in subjective well‐being (SWB) and the other included those with the highest, according to their responses to previously administered psychometric scales. The views of the participating adolescents were explored by means of a content analysis. In general, the children mentioned both positive and negative elements of participating in defining what constitutes well‐being. According to these children, well‐being is related to both affects and attitudes, relations with family and friends being key factors in it. Differences in the information provided reveal some variations according to age and SWB score. Children scoring lower in SWB tend to refer more to relationships with friends and basic needs covered, whereas those scoring higher tend to refer more to family relationships and not having problems. The results of this research can contribute to both social policy design and appraisal as they provide an in‐depth understanding of how SWB works at these ages.",2017.0,20.0,72.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '175–184', 'name': 'Child & Family Social Work'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Navarro2017SubjectiveWW,\n author = {Dolors Navarro and Carme Montserrat and S.

Without a control framework, trustworthiness of AI is impacted. This negatively affects adoption of AI and reduces its potential for social benefit. For international trade and technology cooperation, effective regulatory frameworks need to be created. This study presents a thematic analysis of national AI strategies for European countries in order to assess the appetite for an AI regulatory framework. A Declaration of Cooperation on AI was signed by EU members and non-members in 2018. Many of the signatories have adopted national strategies on AI. In general there is a high level of homogeneity in the national strategies. An expectation of regulation, in some form, is expressed in the strategies, though a reference to AI specific legislation is not universal. With the exception of some outliers, international cooperation is supported. The shape of effective AI regulation has not been agreed upon by stakeholders but governments are expecting and seeking regulatory frameworks. This indicates an appetite for regulation. The international focus has been on regulating AI solutions and not on the regulation of individuals. The introduction of a professional regulation system may be a complementary or alternative regulatory strategy. Whether the appetite and priorities seen in Europe are mirrored worldwide will require a broader study of the national AI strategy landscape.",2020.0,29.0,4.0,{'pages': '133-144'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{NíFhaoláin2020AssessingTA,\n author = {Labhaoise NíFhaoláin and Andrew Hines and Vivek Nallur},\n booktitle = {Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science},\n pages = {133-144},\n title = {Assessing the Appetite for Trustworthiness and the Regulation of Artificial Intelligence in Europe},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2040092418', 'name': 'Labhaoise NíFhaoláin'}, {'authorId': '37996633', 'name': 'Andrew Hines'}, {'authorId': '1889245', 'name': 'Vivek Nallur'}]"

Indeed, I believe we are at a key point in advertising history in this regard as ‘over the top,’ connected media blur the lines and have opened the door to addressable advertising becoming a major force in the future (Taylor 2019a). Essentially, more data are available on consumers than ever before, and the analytics exist to send consumers much more focused, targeted messages than in the past. When reading the popular press, current use of the term artificial intelligence in advertising usually seems to refer to the use of advanced technology by developing platforms that can deliver a programmed, relevant message to consumers based on data that have been collected on their demographics, interests, prior consumption behaviour, etc. (Cardona 2018). It seems certain that other forms of artificial intelligence will begin to enter on to the scene, as is the case with Mike’s Hard Lemonade’s recent ‘Brighter Times’ campaign in which participants are encouraged to read only good news and attend a pop-up experience that uses facial recognition technology to demonstrate the positive impact of good news – while simultaneously promoting the brand (see Taylor 2019b). Yet, for now most of the focus on artificial intelligence is focused on the idea of automated, programmatic relevance being built into search engine, video, and potentially television advertising (Lamm 2018; Taylor 2019b; for a fuller discussion, see Kietzmann, Paschen and Treen 2018). The current focus on programmatic ads delivered via artificial intelligence is understandable and badly in need of additional study. All of us have at times received social media ads that seem to make little sense, such as getting an ad for memorabilia for ports team that just defeated your favourite team in a big game, or ads for flights to a city you just visited that it is unlikely you will go back to any time soon. Clearly, there are challenges associated with the analytics and with measuring return on investment. As such, this is an area badly in need of academic research. While some strong articles have appeared focusing on the impacts of greater customization (e.g. van Riejmersdal et al. 2017; Wottrick, Verlegh and Smit 2017), we need to know more about nuances around the topic. Another twist on the use of AI to program advertising is for marketers to figure out the line where it bumps up against privacy. With the European Union having passed and implemented General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), some clear guidelines exist in Europe. Two of the key provisions are requiring consent and anonymization of data in an effort to protect privacy while simultaneously allowing those who wish to receive more",2019.0,9.0,14.0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Advertising', 'pages': '649 - 650', 'volume': '38'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Taylor2019EditorialAI,\n author = {C.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.",2001.0,13.0,52.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mellers2001EmotionRI,\n author = {A.

The aim of the present study was to establish the convergent and discriminant validity of these 4 subscales. Hypothesized relationships among the IRI subscales between the subscales and measures of other psychological constructs (social functioning self-esteem emotionality and sensitivity to others) and between the subscales and extant empathy measures were examined. Study subjects included 677 male and 667 female students enrolled in undergraduate psychology classes at the University of Texas. The IRI scales not only exhibited the predicted relationships among themselves but also were related in the expected manner to other measures. Higher PT scores were consistently associated with better social functioning and higher self-esteem; in contrast Fantasy scores were unrelated to these 2 characteristics. High EC scores were positively associated with shyness and anxiety but negatively linked to egotism. The most substantial relationships in the study involved the PD scale. PD scores were strongly linked with low self-esteem and poor interpersonal functioning as well as a constellation of vulnerability uncertainty and fearfulness. These findings support a multidimensional approach to empathy by providing evidence that the 4 qualities tapped by the IRI are indeed separate constructs each related in specific ways to other psychological measures.,1983.0,26.0,8368.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '113-126', 'name': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Davis1983MeasuringID,\n author = {Mark H.

Gendron, Lindquist, Barsalou, & Barrett, 2012) (see also Barrett, 2006b; Barrett, Lindquist, & Gendron, 2007; Barrett, Mesquita, & Gendron, 2011), language plays a constitutive role in emotion perception because words ground the otherwise highly variable instances of an emotion category.

Research has demonstrated their efficacy in a wide range of psychological conditions characterized by emotion dysregulation. Neuroimaging studies have evidenced functional and structural changes in a myriad of brain regions mainly involved in attention systems, emotion regulation, and self-referential processing. In this article we review studies on psychological and neurobiological correlates across different empirically derived models of research, including dispositional mindfulness, mindfulness induction, MBIs, and expert meditators in relation to emotion regulation. From the perspective of recent findings in the neuroscience of emotion regulation, we discuss the interplay of top-down and bottom-up emotion regulation mechanisms associated with different mindfulness models. From a phenomenological and cognitive perspective, authors have argued that mindfulness elicits a “mindful emotion regulation” strategy; however, from a clinical perspective, this construct has not been properly differentiated from other strategies and interventions within MBIs. In this context we propose the distinction between top-down and bottom-up mindfulness based emotion regulation strategies. Furthermore, we propose an embodied emotion regulation framework as a multilevel approach for understanding psychobiological changes due to mindfulness meditation regarding its effect on emotion regulation. Finally, based on clinical neuroscientific evidence on mindfulness, we open perspectives and dialogues regarding commonalities and differences between MBIs and other psychotherapeutic strategies for emotion regulation.",2017.0,170.0,297.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Guendelman2017MindfulnessAE,\n author = {Simón Guendelman and Sebastián Medeiros and H.

In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classiﬁcation system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We ﬁnd that these datasets are overwhelm-ingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79 . 6% for IJB-A and 86 . 2% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classiﬁcation systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassiﬁed group (with error rates of up to 34 . 7%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0 . 8%.

A systematic search of the literature identified 306 experimental comparisons of different emotion regulation (ER) strategies. ER instructions were coded according to a new taxonomy, and meta-analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy across studies. The findings revealed differences in effectiveness between ER processes: Attentional deployment had no effect on emotional outcomes (d(+) = 0.00), response modulation had a small effect (d(+) = 0.16), and cognitive change had a small-to-medium effect (d(+) = 0.36). There were also important within-process differences. We identified 7 types of attentional deployment, 4 types of cognitive change, and 4 types of response modulation, and these distinctions had a substantial influence on effectiveness. Whereas distraction was an effective way to regulate emotions (d(+) = 0.27), concentration was not (d(+) = -0.26). Similarly, suppressing the expression of emotion proved effective (d(+) = 0.32), but suppressing the experience of emotion or suppressing thoughts of the emotion-eliciting event did not (d(+) = -0.04 and -0.12, respectively). Finally, reappraising the emotional response proved less effective (d(+) = 0.23) than reappraising the emotional stimulus (d(+) = 0.36) or using perspective taking (d(+) = 0.45). The review also identified several moderators of strategy effectiveness including factors related to the (a) to-be-regulated emotion, (b) frequency of use and intended purpose of the ER strategy, (c) study design, and (d) study characteristics.",2012.0,349.0,1411.0,"{'volume': '138 4', 'pages': '\n          775-808\n        ', 'name': 'Psychological bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Webb2012DealingWF,\n author = {Thomas Llewelyn Webb and E.

It is therefore essential to identify credible information content that provides an objective narrative of an event. News communities such as digg, reddit, or newstrust offer recommendations, reviews, quality ratings, and further insights on journalistic works. However, there is a complex interaction between different factors in such online communities: fairness and style of reporting, language clarity and objectivity, topical perspectives (like political viewpoint), expertise and bias of community members, and more. This paper presents a model to systematically analyze the different interactions in a news community between users, news, and sources. We develop a probabilistic graphical model that leverages this joint interaction to identify 1) highly credible news articles, 2) trustworthy news sources, and 3) expert users who perform the role of ""citizen journalists"" in the community. Our method extends CRF models to incorporate real-valued ratings, as some communities have very fine-grained scales that cannot be easily discretized without losing information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first full-fledged analysis of credibility, trust, and expertise in news communities.",2015.0,37.0,88.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Mukherjee2015LeveragingJI,\n author = {Subhabrata Mukherjee and G.

318,1a4aa3ab7d4ffcc90fa4afcb41dff1c70423dde1,Development of Enhanced Stimulus Content to Improve the Treatment Efficacy of EEG–Based Frontal Alpha Asymmetry Neurofeedback for Stress Mitigation,"The neurofeedback stimulus content has direct implications for the efficacy of the psychophysiological applications for neurofeedback modality. In particular, enhancements of neurofeedback stimulus content can facilitate improvements in the efficacy of neurofeedback applications in clinical practice. To further elaborate on this aspect, this study introduced systematic enhancements in neurofeedback stimulus content by developing enhanced neurofeedback stimulus content for stress mitigation. The enhancements included the automatic selection of colour of neurofeedback stimulus content environment and instruction messages, as well as, the adaptive selection of threshold of quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) features, such as frontal alpha power and frontal alpha asymmetry. The enhancements were based on the outcomes from previous research on the selection of neurofeedback stimulus content for stress mitigation. The improvement in the efficacy of neurofeedback stimulus content was measured statistically by comparing the QEEG and topographic maps. In this study, electroencephalogram data from 20 participants were acquired during multiple sessions of neurofeedback. Analysis of variance and a post hoc test were used to verify the improvement on the efficacy of the neurofeedback application for stress mitigation after the enhancements of the neurofeedback stimulus content; a t–test was used to verify the statistical significance of the stress mitigation by the neurofeedback. The results indicate that the enhancement of the developed neurofeedback stimulus content facilitated stress mitigation during the early sessions of neurofeedback. In conclusion, the efficacy of neurofeedback can be improved using the developed stimulus content with enhancements.",2021.0,41.0,7.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '130638-130648', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hafeez2021DevelopmentOE,\n author = {Y.

For this reason, different perception systems have been proposed for different robotic platforms in order to detect high-level features such as facial expressions and body gestures. However, due to the variety of robotics software architectures and hardware platforms, these highly customized solutions are hardly interchangeable and adaptable to different HRI contexts. In addition, most of the developed systems have one issue in common: they detect features without awareness of the real-world contexts (e.g., detection of environmental sound assuming that it belongs to a person who is speaking, or treating a face printed on a sheet of paper as belonging to a real subject). This paper presents a novel social perception system (SPS) that has been designed to address the previous issues. SPS is an out-of-the-box system that can be integrated into different robotic platforms irrespective of hardware and software specifications. SPS detects, tracks, and delivers in real-time to robots, a wide range of human- and environment- relevant features with the awareness of their real-world contexts. We tested SPS in a typical scenario of HRI for the following purposes: to demonstrate the system capability in detecting several high-level perceptual features as well as to test the system capability to be integrated into different robotics platforms. Results show the promising capability of the system in perceiving real world in different social robotics platforms, as tested in two humanoid robots, i.e., FACE and ZENO.",2017.0,46.0,26.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '341-355', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zaraki2017DesignAE,\n author = {A.

The system presented in this paper includes thermal image acquisition as well as a video processing pipeline to perform object detection, classification and tracking of wildlife in forest or open areas. The system is tested on thermal video data from ground based and test flight footage, and is found to be able to detect all the target wildlife located in the surveyed area.

Location-aware technologies allow people to access, annotate, address and attach information to locations, which transforms the space for other people who use the same services. Such locations acquire relevance and reshape social and spatial interactions through increased use on social media as people 'check-in' to places, photograph or 'like' them. Collectively the authors are marking-up the city around them. The popularization of location-aware technologies thus contributes to the changing meaning of locations in cities. In contrast to the technological focus in the emerging discourses on smart cities and big data, this paper offers an alternative view of the three lenses of Social, Local and Mobile technologies that describe and explain crowd-sourced socio-technical layers on the city landscape. The proposed integrated theoretical model describes the relevant information linkages between people and places in the online and offline worlds and introduces a new evaluation method for the evaluation of city places: affinity spectrum of social endorsements.

The optimal choice of technology depends on the country's endowment of skilled and unskilled labor, so that the model is one of appropriate technology.

Overall, the system delivers an engaging training experience. Preliminary results of a pilot study involving stroke patients demonstrate the potential of the system to improve patients' reaching performance. 1 I. INTRODUCTION n neuromotor rehabilitation, biofeedback systems have most often been associated with non-purposeful, single-joint movements. While isolated muscle activity may improve, functional improvements are rarely noted [1]. Therefore, it has been suggested that biofeedback therapy aimed at enhancing motor function should be task-oriented [2]. Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging and promising approach for task-oriented biofeedback therapy [2, 3]. The approach is ecologically valid [4]. Furthermore, it has been shown that task learning in a VR can be transferred to real-world task performance [5]. Traditionally, biofeedback devices have utilized unimodal sensory signals (e.g. visual or auditory). Multimodal sensory signaling, whereby a patient's attention is drawn to the task through various sensory inputs, may be more advantageous for neuromotor rehabilitation [6]. One concern of such a system is that multiple sources of biofeedback may create problems with sensory overload especially in a patient population who may have high attentional demands just for the initiation of a motor task. In order to promote motor learning, a biofeedback system should be interactive in that the user should be provided with information that could be used to improve subsequent movements. The primary goal of this project was to design a system through which task practice and biofeedback are integrated",,13.0,65.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n author = {H. Huang and T. Ingalls and L.

 The problem of fake news has gained a lot of attention as it is claimed to have had a significant impact on 2016 US Presidential Elections. Fake news is not a new problem and its spread in social networks is well-studied. Often an underlying assumption in fake news discussion is that it is written to look like real news, fooling the reader who does not check for reliability of the sources or the arguments in its content. Through a unique study of three data sets and features that capture the style and the language of articles, we show that this assumption is not true. Fake news in most cases is more similar to satire than to real news, leading us to conclude that persuasion in fake news is achieved through heuristics rather than the strength of arguments. We show overall title structure and the use of proper nouns in titles are very significant in differentiating fake from real. This leads us to conclude that fake news is targeted for audiences who are not likely to read beyond titles and is aimed at creating mental associations between entities and claims.

Starting from a three-way classification of construals of the world––events, the attribution of responsibility for events, and objects––the authors propose a systematic account of emotion differentiation. Rejecting the oft-favored features of bodily feelings, emotion-related behaviors, and facial expressions as too intensity-dependent and insufficiently diagnostic, they provide a detailed analysis of emotion differentiation in terms of the cognitive underpinnings of emotion types. Using numerous examples, they explain how different variables influence emotion intensity, and show how emotions can be formalized for computational purposes. Now with a contributed chapter describing the OCC model's influence, this book will interest a wide audience in cognitive, clinical, and social psychology, as well as in artificial intelligence and affective computing, and other cognitive science disciplines.",1988.0,3.0,6602.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ortony1988TheCS,\n author = {A.

Robotic systems that aim to learn effectively from human teachers must similarly be able to engage in perspective taking. We present an integrated architecture wherein the robot's cognitive functionality is organized around the ability to understand the environment from the perspective of a social partner as well as its own. The performance of this architecture on a set of learning tasks is evaluated against human data derived from a novel study examining the importance of perspective taking in human learning. Perspective taking, both in humans and in our architecture, focuses the agent's attention on the subset of the problem space that is important to the teacher. This constrained attention allows the agent to overcome ambiguity and incompleteness that can often be present in human demonstrations and thus learn what the teacher intends to teach.",2006.0,19.0,84.0,{'pages': '1444-1450'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Berlin2006PerspectiveTA,\n author = {Matt Berlin and Jesse Gray and A.

345,1ba9c94d4dcad5a9b2c3bc240835fc6b98e9d808,The Chinese Economy: Transitions and Growth,"This comprehensive overview of the modern Chinese economy by a noted expert on China's economic development offers a quality and breadth of coverage not found in any other English-language text. In The Chinese Economy, Barry Naughton provides both an engaging, broadly focused introduction to China's economy since 1949 and original insights based on his own extensive research. The book will be an essential resource for students, teachers, scholars, business people, and policymakers. It is suitable for classroom use for undergraduate or graduate courses. After presenting background material on the pre-1949 economy and the industrialization, reform, and market transition that have taken place since, the book examines different aspects of the modern Chinese economy. It analyzes patterns of growth and development, including population growth and the one-child family policy; the rural economy, including agriculture and rural industrialization; industrial and technological development in urban areas; international trade and foreign investment; macroeconomic trends and cycles and the financial system; and the largely unaddressed problems of environmental quality and the sustainability of growth. The text is notable also for placing China's economy in interesting comparative contexts, discussing it in relation to other transitional or developing economies and to such advanced industrial countries as the United States and Japan. It provides both a broad historical and macro perspective as well as a focused examination of the actual workings of China's complex and dynamic economic development. Interest in the Chinese economy will only grow as China becomes an increasingly important player on the world's stage. This book will be the standard reference for understanding and teaching about the next economic superpower.",2007.0,1.0,1322.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Naughton2007TheCE,\n author = {Barry J.

Characterizing how false information proliferates on social platforms and why it succeeds in deceiving readers are critical to develop efficient detection algorithms and tools for early detection. A recent surge of research in this area has aimed to address the key issues using methods based on feature engineering, graph mining, and information modeling. Majority of the research has primarily focused on two broad categories of false information: opinion-based (e.g., fake reviews), and fact-based (e.g., false news and hoaxes). Therefore, in this work, we present a comprehensive survey spanning diverse aspects of false information, namely (i) the actors involved in spreading false information, (ii) rationale behind successfully deceiving readers, (iii) quantifying the impact of false information, (iv) measuring its characteristics across different dimensions, and finally, (iv) algorithms developed to detect false information.

Two samples were included: 487 adolescents attending a secondary school and 630 adults from a general practitioners practice. Data were obtained on symptoms of depression and anxiety and the use of nine cognitive coping strategies: acceptance, catastrophizing, other-blame, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective, refocus on planning, positive refocusing, rumination and self-blame. The results showed that all cognitive coping strategies were reported by adolescents to a significantly lesser extent than by adults. Further, it was shown that both in adolescents and adults a considerable percentage of the variance in symptomatology was explained by the use of cognitive coping strategies. Although adolescents and adults differed in relative strength of the relationships, generally speaking, conclusions were the same: in both groups, the cognitive coping strategies self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing and positive reappraisal were shown to play the most important role in the reporting of symptoms of psychopathology, showing the importance of introducing prevention and intervention programmes at an early stage.",2002.0,15.0,480.0,"{'volume': '25 6', 'pages': '\n          603-11\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of adolescence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Garnefski2002CognitiveCS,\n author = {N.

Big data is likely to reduce the impact of negative prejudice in the credit market but it could reduce the effectiveness of existing policies aimed at protecting minorities.

Best results were obtained by selecting a subset of Gabor filters using AdaBoost followed by classification with support vector machines. The system operates in real-time, and obtained 93% correct generalization to novel subjects for a 7-way forced choice on the Cohn-Kanade expression dataset. The outputs of the classifiers change smoothly as a function of time and thus can be used to measure facial expression dynamics. We applied the system to to fully automated recognition of facial actions (FACS).

The concept of emotional intelligence (EQ) is considered as encapsulating many of the key competences involved in creating and maintaining a positive climate for services. The conceptual basis of EQ is examined in some detail, in addition to its practical measurement. Research is reviewed which suggests that EQ can be developed, and which provides support for the argument that higher levels of EQ within organizations will facilitate the appropriate conditions for a positive climate for services to emerge. It is argued that measurement of EQ should form part of the selection process, for management and customer‐facing staff, and that development of emotional intelligence should be incorporated into staff training programs.",2003.0,35.0,122.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '97-104', 'name': 'Managing Service Quality'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bardzil2003EmotionalIF,\n author = {Philip Bardzil and M.

At present, the effect of emotion analysis of ideological and political students is poor. This article builds on the artificial intelligence technology and combines machine learning data mining ideas to construct a student emotion analysis model in the ideological and political classroom. Starting from the individual, based on the individual’s own emotions and external stimuli, this article carries out emotion transfer probability statistics on the dialogues with emotions marked, and obtains the individual’s emotion transfer matrix. After the corresponding model is constructed, it can be applied to practice, and the research is conducted from the aspects of systematic emotion analysis effect and teaching promotion effect. In addition, this study designs a controlled experiment to analyze the effects of the model.

366,1d174f0e3c391368d0f3384a144a6c7487f2a143,Big Data's Disparate Impact,"Advocates of algorithmic techniques like data mining argue that these techniques eliminate human biases from the decision-making process. But an algorithm is only as good as the data it works with. Data is frequently imperfect in ways that allow these algorithms to inherit the prejudices of prior decision makers. In other cases, data may simply reflect the widespread biases that persist in society at large. In still others, data mining can discover surprisingly useful regularities that are really just preexisting patterns of exclusion and inequality. Unthinking reliance on data mining can deny historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups full participation in society. Worse still, because the resulting discrimination is almost always an unintentional emergent property of the algorithm’s use rather than a conscious choice by its programmers, it can be unusually hard to identify the source of the problem or to explain it to a court.This Essay examines these concerns through the lens of American antidiscrimination law — more particularly, through Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination in employment. In the absence of a demonstrable intent to discriminate, the best doctrinal hope for data mining’s victims would seem to lie in disparate impact doctrine. Case law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, though, hold that a practice can be justified as a business necessity when its outcomes are predictive of future employment outcomes, and data mining is specifically designed to find such statistical correlations. Unless there is a reasonably practical way to demonstrate that these discoveries are spurious, Title VII would appear to bless its use, even though the correlations it discovers will often reflect historic patterns of prejudice, others’ discrimination against members of protected groups, or flaws in the underlying dataAddressing the sources of this unintentional discrimination and remedying the corresponding deficiencies in the law will be difficult technically, difficult legally, and difficult politically. There are a number of practical limits to what can be accomplished computationally. For example, when discrimination occurs because the data being mined is itself a result of past intentional discrimination, there is frequently no obvious method to adjust historical data to rid it of this taint. Corrective measures that alter the results of the data mining after it is complete would tread on legally and politically disputed terrain. These challenges for reform throw into stark relief the tension between the two major theories underlying antidiscrimination law: anticlassification and antisubordination. Finding a solution to big data’s disparate impact will require more than best efforts to stamp out prejudice and bias; it will require a wholesale reexamination of the meanings of “discrimination” and “fairness.”",2016.0,34.0,2019.0,"{'volume': '104', 'pages': '671', 'name': 'California Law Review'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Barocas2016BigDD,\n author = {Solon Barocas and Andrew D.

Smartphone applications (apps) may assist individuals with mental health concerns in alleviating symptoms or increasing understanding. This study seeks to characterize apps readily available to smartphone users seeking mental health information and/or support. Ten key terms were searched in the Apple iTunes and Google Play stores: mental health, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, trauma, trauma in schools, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), child trauma, and bullying. A content analysis of the first 20 application descriptions retrieved per category was conducted. Out of 300 nonduplicate applications, 208 (70%) were relevant to search topic, mental health or stress. The most common purported purpose for the apps was symptom relief (41%; n = 85) and general mental health education (18%; n = 37). The most frequently mentioned approaches to improving mental health were those that may benefit only milder symptoms such as relaxation (21%; n = 43). Most app descriptions did not include information to substantiate stated effectiveness of the application (59%; n = 123) and had no mention of privacy or security (89%; n = 185). Due to uncertainty of the helpfulness of readily available mental health applications, clinicians working with mental health patients should inquire about and provide guidance on application use, and patients should have access to ways to assess the potential utility of these applications.

371,1d844cf24e9451333fae7763ca52ccb2d7dfb703,Mental Health Smartphone Apps: Review and Evidence-Based Recommendations for Future Developments,"Background The number of mental health apps (MHapps) developed and now available to smartphone users has increased in recent years. MHapps and other technology-based solutions have the potential to play an important part in the future of mental health care; however, there is no single guide for the development of evidence-based MHapps. Many currently available MHapps lack features that would greatly improve their functionality, or include features that are not optimized. Furthermore, MHapp developers rarely conduct or publish trial-based experimental validation of their apps. Indeed, a previous systematic review revealed a complete lack of trial-based evidence for many of the hundreds of MHapps available. Objective To guide future MHapp development, a set of clear, practical, evidence-based recommendations is presented for MHapp developers to create better, more rigorous apps. Methods A literature review was conducted, scrutinizing research across diverse fields, including mental health interventions, preventative health, mobile health, and mobile app design. Results Sixteen recommendations were formulated. Evidence for each recommendation is discussed, and guidance on how these recommendations might be integrated into the overall design of an MHapp is offered. Each recommendation is rated on the basis of the strength of associated evidence. It is important to design an MHapp using a behavioral plan and interactive framework that encourages the user to engage with the app; thus, it may not be possible to incorporate all 16 recommendations into a single MHapp. Conclusions Randomized controlled trials are required to validate future MHapps and the principles upon which they are designed, and to further investigate the recommendations presented in this review. Effective MHapps are required to help prevent mental health problems and to ease the burden on health systems.",2016.0,308.0,629.0,"{'volume': '3', 'name': 'JMIR Mental Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bakker2016MentalHS,\n author = {D.

Many algorithms have been developed for classification of cervical images based on extracting mathematical features and classifying these images. Deciding the suitability of a feature and learning the algorithm is a complex task. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) self-learn most suitable hierarchical features from the raw input image. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a shallow layer CNN for classification of image patches of cervical images as cancerous or not cancerous. We used cervix images acquired after the application of 3%-5% acetic acid using an Android device in 102 women. Of these, 42 cervix images belonged in the VIA-positive category (pathologic) and 60 in the VIA-negative category (healthy controls). A total of 275 image patches of 15 × 15 pixels were manually extracted from VIA-positive areas, and we considered these patches as positive examples. Similarly, 409 image patches were extracted from VIA-negative areas and were labeled as VIA negative.

Participants (N = 89) described how they regulated their emotions in terms of cognitive reappraisal and suppression. They also indicated their subjective well-being and level of perceived stress each day over 3 weeks. At the within-person level, cognitive reappraisal intended to increase positive emotions was positively associated with higher subjective well-being and negatively associated with perceived stress. Suppression of the expression of positive emotions was negatively associated with subjective well-being and positively associated with perceived stress. However, cognitive reappraisal intended to down-regulate negative emotions and suppression as a strategy to inhibit the expression of negative emotions were not associated with daily well-being or perceived stress. Off-days were rated as days with higher subjective well-being and lower perceived stress in contrast to working days. At the between-person level, individuals who reported more daily negative affect reported increased suppression of positive emotions, corroborating the within-person findings. Moreover, findings indicated that nurses with more years of experience in the job reported higher subjective well-being and less perceived stress.

384,1e838fd269232085b73d59e1eae57f6bb8ec345e,Evolution of responses to (un)fairness,"Background The human sense of fairness presents an evolutionary puzzle because it appears to run counter to the short-term interests of at least some parties. We not only react negatively to getting less than a partner but sometimes also to getting more, which seems illogical. Following an ideal of impartiality, we seek appropriate outcomes for everyone within the community, not just a few individuals, and, in particular, not just ourselves. Why do we react this way? Are we the only species to do so? Here, we consider the evidence with regard to nonhuman primates and other animals to illuminate the evolution of the sense of fairness. Because social ideals escape measurement, we focus on behavioral responses to equal versus unequal reward division. Moreover, a true sense of fairness includes taking account of receiving both less than a partner and more than a partner. Therefore, we consider the evidence for both of these in other species and how this informs our understanding of the evolution of fairness in humans. A diagram of the relationship between first-order IA and second-order IA. Individual A received high-level rewards, and individual B received low-level rewards. Individuals who recognize when they receive less than another may react against this situation—for instance, by finding a new cooperative partner. As reliance on cooperation increases, individuals also benefit from recognizing when they receive more, as this allows them to forestall first-order IA reactions in their partners and thereby maintain a successful cooperative relationship. This is the foundation of the full-blown human sense of fairness. A diagram of the relationship between first-order IA and second-order IA. Individual A received high-level rewards, and individual B received low-level rewards. Individuals who recognize when they receive less than another may react against this situation—for instance, by finding a new cooperative partner. As reliance on cooperation increases, individuals also benefit from recognizing when they receive more, as this allows them to forestall first-order IA reactions in their partners and thereby maintain a successful cooperative relationship. This is the foundation of the full-blown human sense of fairness. Advances There is widespread evidence for sensitivity to receiving less than a partner, or “first-order inequity aversion” (IA), in species that cooperate outside mating bonds and kinship. In these studies, animals are paired with a social partner who receives a preferred reward for completing a task. Subjects may respond by refusing to participate or refusing to accept the food reward, and such reactions are compared with those following control tests in which both subjects receive the same reward for the same effort. Increased responses when the partner receives a preferred reward are indicative of a sensitivity to inequity. Thus far, passive and active protest against unfavorable outcomes has been documented in monkeys, apes, dogs, and birds. It is thought that these species compare their outcomes with those of others so as to judge the merit of their partnerships. They may turn away from partners that appropriate more than their fair share of the yields of cooperation. A complete sense of fairness also includes second-order IA, however, which seeks to equalize outcomes even at a short-term cost to the self. This requires individuals to give up an immediate benefit to stabilize a long-term valuable cooperative relationship. Second-order IA reactions have thus far been found only in humans and apes. We hypothesize that second-order IA requires anticipation of first-order IA in the partner and its negative impact on the relationship. To forestall these consequences, and ensure continued cooperation, outcomes are equalized between partners. Outlook Thus, humans and other species seem to share basic reactions to inequity, which serves to sustain cooperation. We postulate that the basic emotional reactions and calculations underlying our sense of fairness are rooted in our primate background and offer a model that places these reactions in the context of cooperative relationships. Future research should more explicitly investigate the key variables underlying IA, such as the degree of dependence on cooperation, anticipation of the way resource division affects relationships, and the freedom to choose among and change partners. A cross-species investigation with a standardized paradigm, including both first- and second-order IA, may further illuminate the factors involved and help verify or falsify the model proposed. The evolutionary benefits of behaving fairly Humans have a deep and innate sense of fairness. Humans, however, are not the only species to react to apparent inequities. Brosnan and de Waal propose that inequity aversion can be broken down into two levels. At the most basic level, individuals react to immediate unequal distribution of a reward for equal effort expended, whereas at the second, they show the ability to accept a current unequal distribution with the expectation that over time distribution will equalize. This second level facilitates cooperation over time and requires the cognitive abilities both to assess current distribution and envision future opportunities for equalization. As cognitive abilities advanced across the primate lineage, this more complex accounting of equal distribution and cooperation may have developed into the complete sense of fairness we see in humans today. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1251776 The human sense of fairness is an evolutionary puzzle. To study this, we can look to other species, in which this can be translated empirically into responses to reward distribution. Passive and active protest against receiving less than a partner for the same task is widespread in species that cooperate outside kinship and mating bonds. There is less evidence that nonhuman species seek to equalize outcomes to their own detriment, yet the latter has been documented in our closest relatives, the apes. This reaction probably reflects an attempt to forestall partner dissatisfaction with obtained outcomes and its negative impact on future cooperation. We hypothesize that it is the evolution of this response that allowed the development of a complete sense of fairness in humans, which aims not at equality for its own sake but for the sake of continued cooperation.",2014.0,111.0,276.0,"{'volume': '346', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brosnan2014EvolutionOR,\n author = {S.

Results of two studies using university employees (N = 82) and students (N = 162) suggest that psychological attachment may be predicated on compliance, identification, and internalization (e.g., Kelman, 19S8). Identification and internalization are positively related to prosocial behaviors and negatively related to turnover. Internalization is predictive of financial donations to a fund-raising campaign. Overall, the results suggest the importance of clearly specifying the underlying dimensions of commitment using notions of psychological attachment and the various forms such attachment can take. In the past decade, the construct of organizational commitment has occupied a prominent place in organizational behavior research (Mowday, Porter, & Steers, 1982; Salancik, 1977; Staw & Ross, 1978). Unfortunately, as Morrow (1983, p. 486) has pointed out, ""the growth in commitment related concepts has not been accompanied by a careful segmentation of commitment's theoretical domain in terms of intended meaning of each concept or the concepts' relationships among each other."" By her count, there are over 25 commitment-related concepts and measures.

Despite the clinical relevance and associated negative consequences of this behavior, however, there are few empirically supported treatments for DSH among individuals with BPD, and those that exist are difficult to implement in many clinical settings (due to their duration and intensity). To address this limitation, Gratz and Gunderson (2006) examined the efficacy of a 14-week, adjunctive emotion regulation group therapy (ERGT) for DSH among women with BPD. Although the results of this initial trial were promising (indicating positive effects of this treatment on DSH, emotion dysregulation, experiential avoidance, and psychiatric symptoms), they require replication and extension. Thus, the purpose of this study was to further develop this ERGT by examining its utility across other settings, a more diverse group of patients, a wider range of outcomes, and group leaders other than the principal investigator. Twenty-three women received this ERGT in addition to their ongoing treatment in the community. Self-report and interview-based measures of DSH and other self-destructive behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, adaptive functioning (including social and vocational impairment and quality of life), and the proposed mechanisms of change (emotion dysregulation and experiential avoidance) were administered pre- and posttreatment. Results indicate significant changes over time (accompanied by large effect sizes) on all outcome measures except quality of life and self-destructive behaviors (although the latter was a large-sized effect).

Legal education and training models are beginning to recognize the need to incorporate skill building in data and technology platforms, but they have lost sight of a core competency for lawyers: problem-solving and decision-making skills to counsel clients on how best to meet their desired goals and needs. In 2014, Amani Smathers introduced the legal field to the concept of the T-shaped lawyer. The T-shaped lawyer stems from the concept of T-shaped professionals who have a depth of knowledge in their chosen discipline and a breadth of knowledge in other tangentially related disciplines in order to enhance collaboration with other professionals. The concept of a T-shaped lawyer recognizes that lawyers not only need in-depth legal knowledge and skills but an understanding of data, technology, project management, and process improvement to be competent legal professionals. The T-shaped lawyer brought attention to the need for lawyers and law students to expand their training and begin learning about artificial intelligence, design thinking, data analytics, and more. However, the T-shaped lawyer obscures the core competency of decision-making and problem-solving. This paper introduces the Delta Model for legal professional competency that not only recognizes the need for lawyers to have deep legal knowledge and skills, as well as an understanding of data and technology, but also recognizes the need for emotional intelligence in decision-making and problem-solving. The Delta Model could reshape how we approach legal education and lawyer training, providing a structure that more accurately reflects the breadth of skills that a twenty-first-century lawyer needs.",2019.0,0.0,10.0,"{'name': 'Georgia State University law review', 'pages': '15110', 'volume': '35'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Carrel2019LegalIT,\n author = {A.

This article investigates dynamic resource allocation of multiple UAVs enabled communication networks with the goal of maximizing long-term rewards. More particularly, each UAV communicates with a ground user by automatically selecting its communicating user, power level and subchannel without any information exchange among UAVs. To model the dynamics and uncertainty in environments, we formulate the long-term resource allocation problem as a stochastic game for maximizing the expected rewards, where each UAV becomes a learning agent and each resource allocation solution corresponds to an action taken by the UAVs. Afterwards, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that each agent discovers its best strategy according to its local observations using learning. More specifically, we propose an agent-independent method, for which all agents conduct a decision algorithm independently but share a common structure based on Q-learning. Finally, simulation results reveal that: 1) appropriate parameters for exploitation and exploration are capable of enhancing the performance of the proposed MARL based resource allocation algorithm; 2) the proposed MARL algorithm provides acceptable performance compared to the case with complete information exchanges among UAVs. By doing so, it strikes a good tradeoff between performance gains and information exchange overheads.",2018.0,52.0,265.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '729-743', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cui2018MultiAgentRL,\n author = {Jingjing Cui and Yuanwei Liu and A.

Part II: Fine analysis.,"The purpose of this research was to investigate the potential effectiveness of digital speech processing and pattern recognition techniques for the automatic recognition of gender from speech. In part I Coarse Analysis [K. Wu and D. G. Childers, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 90, 1828-1840 (1991)] various feature vectors and distance measures were examined to determine their appropriateness for recognizing a speaker's gender from vowels, unvoiced fricatives, and voiced fricatives. One recognition scheme based on feature vectors extracted from vowels achieved 100% correct recognition of the speaker's gender using a database of 52 speakers (27 male and 25 female). In this paper a detailed, fine analysis of the characteristics of vowels is performed, including formant frequencies, bandwidths, and amplitudes, as well as speaker fundamental frequency of voicing. The fine analysis used a pitch synchronous closed-phase analysis technique. Detailed formant features, including frequencies, bandwidths, and amplitudes, were extracted by a closed-phase weighted recursive least-squares method that employed a variable forgetting factor, i.e., WRLS-VFF. The electroglottograph signal was used to locate the closed-phase portion of the speech signal. A two-way statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test the differences between gender features. The relative importance of grouped vowel features was evaluated by a pattern recognition approach. Numerous interesting results were obtained, including the fact that the second formant frequency was a slightly better recognizer of gender than fundamental frequency, giving 98.1% versus 96.2% correct recognition, respectively. The statistical tests indicated that the spectra for female speakers had a steeper slope (or tilt) than that for males. The results suggest that redundant gender information was imbedded in the fundamental frequency and vocal tract resonance characteristics. The feature vectors for female voices were observed to have higher within-group variations than those for male voices. The data in this study were also used to replicate portions of the Peterson and Barney [J. Acoust. Soc.

Medical interventions are quite efficacious in reducing pain levels. However, changes in physical and mental health status after medical interventions are not proportional.

This study explores whether pain reduction efforts are more beneficial for individuals scoring high in rational thinking (moderation). Methods The study design was longitudinal. Patients were assessed twice, 2 weeks prior to the start of medical treatment at the pain clinic and 6 months after. A total of 163 patients with heterogeneous pain (mostly low back and neck pain) participated in the study. Their mean age was 58.74 years (SD = 14.28) and 61.3% were female. Results Overall, there was a reduction in pain intensity (t = 4.25, p < 0.001, d = 0.32). An improvement in physical functioning (t = 4.02, p < 0.001, d = 0.19), but not mental health (t = -0.66, p = 0.511, d = 0.11) was also observed. In the regression analyses, a decrease in pain intensity was moderately associated with improved physical health (β = 0.87, t = 4.96, p < 0.001, R2 change = 0.177). This association was found to be moderated by frustration tolerance (β = -0.49, t = -2.80, p = 0.006, R2 change = 0.039). Specifically, post hoc analyses indicated that changes in pain intensity only correlated with changes in physical health when patients reported high frustration tolerance levels (r = 0.47, p = 0.006, M = 7, n = 32), but not when patients were intolerant to frustration (r = 0.28, p = 0.078, M = 17, n = 41). Conclusion The results suggest that frustration tolerance may render adaptive by facilitating the positive effect that a reduction in pain intensity has on physical health status. The study findings are discussed in the context of personalized therapy with an emphasis on how to maximize the effectiveness of current interventions for pain.",2019.0,95.0,15.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Suso‐Ribera2019ARI,\n author = {C.

398,1fdc146b116dd29da8bf98015fd2198ca1264bce,Emotion regulation as a transdiagnostic factor in the development of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology: Current and future directions,"Abstract In response to rapidly growing rates of comorbidity among psychiatric disorders, clinical scientists have become interested in identifying transdiagnostic processes that can help explain dysfunction across diagnostic categories (e.g., Kring & Sloan, 2009). One factor that has received a great deal of attention is that of emotion regulation, namely, the ability to modulate the intensity and/or duration of emotional states (e.g., Cicchetti, Ackerman, & Izard, 1995; Gross, 1998). Recent theoretical and empirical work has begun to emphasize the role that emotion regulation plays in the temporal comorbidity between internalizing and externalizing conditions (e.g., Aldao & De Los Reyes, 2015; De Los Reyes & Aldao, 2015; Drabick & Kendall, 2010; Jarrett & Ollendick, 2008; Patrick & Hajcak, 2016). However, close inspection of this work reveals two very pertinent areas of growth: (a) this literature is characterized by mixed findings that are likely explained, in part, by methodological heterogeneity; and (b) emotion regulation tends to be studied in relatively narrow terms. To address these issues, we provide a series of recommendations for facilitating cross-study comparisons and leveraging multifaceted approaches to studying emotion regulation processes within a developmental psychopathology framework. We hope that our perspective can enhance the organization and growth of this very important area of inquiry, and ultimately result in more effective prevention and treatment programs.",2016.0,248.0,276.0,"{'volume': '28', 'pages': '927 - 946', 'name': 'Development and Psychopathology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Aldao2016EmotionRA,\n author = {A.

CT scans and X-rays play an important role in that direction. However, processing chest CT images and using them to accurately diagnose COVID-19 is a computationally expensive task. Machine Learning techniques have the potential to overcome this challenge. This article proposes two optimization algorithms for feature selection and classification of COVID-19. The proposed framework has three cascaded phases. Firstly, the features are extracted from the CT scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named AlexNet. Secondly, a proposed features selection algorithm, Guided Whale Optimization Algorithm (Guided WOA) based on Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS), is then applied followed by balancing the selected features. Finally, a proposed voting classifier, Guided WOA based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), aggregates different classifiers’ predictions to choose the most voted class. This increases the chance that individual classifiers, e.g. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Trees (DT), to show significant discrepancies. Two datasets are used to test the proposed model: CT images containing clinical findings of positive COVID-19 and CT images negative COVID-19. The proposed feature selection algorithm (SFS-Guided WOA) is compared with other optimization algorithms widely used in recent literature to validate its efficiency. The proposed voting classifier (PSO-Guided-WOA) achieved AUC (area under the curve) of 0.995 that is superior to other voting classifiers in terms of performance metrics. Wilcoxon rank-sum, ANOVA, and T-test statistical tests are applied to statistically assess the quality of the proposed algorithms as well.",2020.0,62.0,111.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '179317 - 179335', 'name': 'Ieee Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{El-Kenawy2020NovelFS,\n author = {E.

It is argued that appraisal is a necessary as well as sufficient cause of emotion and that knowledge is necessary but not sufficient. This position is examined in light of what is known about emotions in infants and young children, the effects of drugs on acute emotions and moods, and recent patterns of thought about the brain in emotions. The discussion of how meaning is generated is the core of the article. Automatic processing without awareness is contrasted with deliberate and conscious processing, and the concept of resonance between an animal's needs and what is encountered in the environment is examined. The idea that there is more than one way meaning is achieved strengthens and enriches the case for the role of appraisal in emotion and allows the consideration of what is meant by unconscious and preconscious appraisal and the examination of how they might work.",1991.0,103.0,1533.0,"{'volume': '46 4', 'pages': '\n          352-67\n        ', 'name': 'The American psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lazarus1991CognitionAM,\n author = {R.

In the first section, we review experimental findings showing that reappraisal has a healthier profile of short-term affective, cognitive, and social consequences than suppression. In the second section, we review individual-difference findings, which show that using reappraisal to regulate emotions is associated with healthier patterns of affect, social functioning, and well-being than is using suppression. In the third section, we consider issues in the development of reappraisal and suppression and provide new evidence for a normative shift toward an increasingly healthy emotion regulation profile during adulthood (i.e., increases in the use of reappraisal and decreases in the use of suppression).",2004.0,60.0,2081.0,"{'volume': '72 6', 'pages': '\n          1301-33\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{John2004HealthyAU,\n author = {O.

407,20d63f7154a7101df3af33ca0ba97ef55230584d,Therapeutic Psychological and Biological Responses to Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy.,"Stress and anxiety pose a threat to college students' academic performance as well as their long-term mental and physical health, but the time constraints of a rigorous academic schedule make it difficult to offer even brief mental health interventions. A convenience sample of full-time students at a public university were recruited for a five-week study conducted mostly using an online platform. Participants were randomly assigned to a Mindfulness-Based Art Therapy (MBAT) intervention or a Neutral Clay Task (NCT). Anxiety, perceived stress, and salivary cortisol outcomes were measured. A total of n = 77 participants completed the study. The MBAT group experienced significant reductions in anxiety and perceived stress compared to the NCT group. Significant reductions in salivary cortisol were observed, but only time could be identified as a confounding variable. Art-making alone is not enough to induce significant positive responses, but this study suggests MBAT can, and that an online intervention could offer feasible and accessible mental health services on college campuses. Further refinement of biological data collection and analysis is needed to determine what the mediating effects MBAT could have, if any, at the molecular level.

In this study, we implemented sensors/actuators into a stuffed toy mammoth, which allows the toy to have an affective and cognitive basis to its communication. The goal is for therapists to use this as a tool during their therapy sessions that work with patients with mood disorders. The toy detects emotion and provides a dialogue that would guide a session aimed at working with emotional regulation and perception. These technical capabilities are possible by employing IBM Watson’s services, implemented into a Raspberry Pi Zero. In this paper, we delve into its evaluation with neurotypical adolescents, a panel of experts, and other professionals. The evaluation aims were to perform a technical and application validation for use in therapy sessions.

In order to make sense of the vast volume of information derived from, and increasingly dependent upon, reductionist approaches, a greater emphasis must be placed on the traditional integrated and more holistic approaches developed by the scientists who gave birth to physiology as an intellectual discipline. Our understanding of physiological regulation has evolved over time from the Greek idea of body humors, through Claude Bernard’s “milieu intérieur,” to Walter Cannon’s formulation of the concept of “homeostasis” and the application of control theory (feedback and feedforward regulation) to explain how a constant internal environment is achieved. Homeostasis has become the central unifying concept of physiology and is defined as a self-regulating process by which an organism can maintain internal stability while adjusting to changing external conditions. Homeostasis is not static and unvarying; it is a dynamic process that can change internal conditions as required to survive external challenges. It is also important to note that homeostatic regulation is not merely the product of a single negative feedback cycle but reflects the complex interaction of multiple feedback systems that can be modified by higher control centers. This hierarchical control and feedback redundancy results in a finer level of control and a greater flexibility that enables the organism to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The health and vitality of the organism can be said to be the end result of homeostatic regulation. An understanding of normal physiology is not possible without an appreciation of this concept. Conversely, it follows that disruption of homeostatic mechanisms is what leads to disease, and effective therapy must be directed toward re-establishing these homeostatic conditions. Therefore, it is the purpose of this essay to describe the evolution of our understanding of homeostasis and the role of physiological regulation and dysregulation in health and disease.",2020.0,32.0,133.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Physiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Billman2020HomeostasisTU,\n author = {G.

428,22162cca694ac512b8dce19c23d1690cf422260f,The Use of Emotional Artificial Intelligence in Plastic Surgery.,"BACKGROUND
The use of social media to discuss topics related to and within plastic surgery has become widespread in recent years; however, it remains unclear how to use this abundance of largely untapped data to propagate educational research in the field of plastic surgery. In this prospective, observational study, the authors aimed to delineate which plastic surgery-related topics evoked a significant emotional response within the study population and to assess the utility of motivational artificial intelligence within the field of plastic surgery.


METHODS
Over a 4-month period (January to April of 2018), Cognovi Lab's artificial intelligence technology was used to search and analyze emotional reactions to several commonly hashtagged words. This innovative software uses several key metrics to describe its findings, including awareness, engagement, and motivation.


RESULTS
Of the search terms examined, ""nose job"" had the most awareness during the study period, and the topic that most engaged consumers emotionally was ""liposuction."" Interestingly, ""liposuction"" ranked only fifth in terms of awareness. Consumers showed the strongest positive motivation toward the subjects of ""plastic surgery"" and ""cosmetic surgery,"" and the lowest motivation toward the topic of ""tummy tucks.""


CONCLUSIONS
This analysis by Cognovi Labs is the first quantitative effort to use the plethora of data on social media to interpret patient motivations and subsequent behavior. Moving forward, artificial intelligence technology will make it possible to predict which plastic surgery products, procedures, and practices will be successful.

432,224800427042921eae02b63ab597ede1254b9d02,Investigating the emotional appeal of fake news using artificial intelligence and human contributions,"
Purpose
The creation and dissemination of fake news can have severe consequences for a company’s brand. Researchers, policymakers and practitioners are eagerly searching for solutions to get us out of the “fake news crisis”. Here, one approach is to use automated tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, to support managers in identifying fake news. The study in this paper demonstrates how AI with its ability to analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, can help us tell apart fake and real news content. Using an AI application, this study examines if and how the emotional appeal, i.e., sentiment valence and strength of specific emotions, in fake news content differs from that in real news content. This is important to understand, as messages with a strong emotional appeal can influence how content is consumed, processed and shared by consumers.


Design/methodology/approach
The study analyzes a data set of 150 real and fake news articles using an AI application, to test for differences in the emotional appeal in the titles and the text body between fake news and real news content.


Findings
The results suggest that titles are a strong differentiator on emotions between fake and real news and that fake news titles are substantially more negative than real news titles. In addition, the results reveal that the text body of fake news is substantially higher in displaying specific negative emotions, such as disgust and anger, and lower in displaying positive emotions, such as joy.


Originality/value
This is the first empirical study that examines the emotional appeal of fake and real news content with respect to the prevalence and strength of specific emotion dimensions, thus adding to the literature on fake news identification and marketing communications. In addition, this paper provides marketing communications professionals with a practical approach to identify fake news using AI.

Autonomic activity (heart rate and skin conductance) was concurrently measured to determine whether pupillary changes are mediated by parasympathetic or sympathetic activation. Following an initial light reflex, pupillary changes were larger when viewing emotionally arousing pictures, regardless of whether these were pleasant or unpleasant. Pupillary changes during picture viewing covaried with skin conductance change, supporting the interpretation that sympathetic nervous system activity modulates these changes in the context of affective picture viewing. Taken together, the data provide strong support for the hypothesis that the pupil's response during affective picture viewing reflects emotional arousal associated with increased sympathetic activity.",2008.0,13.0,1480.0,"{'volume': '45 4', 'pages': '\n          602-7\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bradley2008ThePA,\n author = {M.

437,2287bfa13bd9d378a09897cececbb76576630668,Discussion: What Does the Public Think? Examining Plastic Surgery Perceptions through the Twitterverse.,"www.PRSJournal.com 278 A the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery – Global Open social media consulting editor, I welcome this article for a number of reasons.1 It reaffirms that plastic surgeons are increasingly embracing innovation as a tool for effective communication and education, as represented by our growing interaction with social media; the authors’ intentions demonstrate that as a profession we are concerned with disseminating the evidencebased truth about plastic surgery treatments in the best interests of our patients and the public; and it shows that we are inextricably engaged in the public debate about our specialty. We should use our voices wisely. Previous studies have focused on social media engagement by plastic surgeons.2 The main focus of the present article was an analysis of Twitter that was performed to identify the public’s perception and attitude toward plastic surgery and the emotional triggers that drive social sharing of plastic surgery information. The study (analyzing tweets from 2014 to 2016) found that the majority of posts were about cosmetic surgery (74 percent), and that almost half of the tweets were by the public (48 percent), the largest category. This is comparable to the findings of our study of Twitter posts in 2015 where 61 percent of posts were about cosmetic surgery, and 71 percent of posts were by the public.2 The differences are most likely attributable to the more recent increase in plastic surgeons getting involved in social media and posting about evidence-based plastic surgery. In the present study, 30 percent of posts were by plastic surgeons, whereas we found this figure to be only 6 percent.2 The authors graciously acknowledge the efforts of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons in promoting engagement by board-certified plastic surgeons using the hashtag #PlasticSurgery, as outlined in our article.2 These efforts have resulted in our specialty hashtag being the number one health care specialty hashtag in the world, with over 5 billion views per year.2 In the present article, the most frequent emotions shared and retweeted were positive ones: “relaxed/content” (52 percent) and “excited/ interested” (18 percent). Those individuals posting tweets are akin to media broadcasters, albeit on a smaller scale. Social media are a very human endeavor, despite their routine bad press. Those people that lift us are more likely to get increased exposure in the form of retweets and likes, sometimes resulting in exponential digital impact. The authors also analyzed the accuracy of the information posted, with 80 percent of the tweets posted by the public containing inaccurate information. Sadly, only 11 percent of board-certified plastic surgeons’ tweets were rated as “most accurate.” This is an alarming statistic and a real wakeup call. Social media use is growing inexorably, and there is a public appetite for evidence-based information. Humphries et al. published the first plastic surgery article containing a hashtag, “#SocialMedia for the Academic Plastic Surgeon: Elevating the Brand,” outlining the advantages to academic plastic surgeons of being engaged.3 Worldwide, there is a lack of regulation of plastic surgery, and of cosmetic surgery in particular. Social media are a new avenue that will enable engaged plastic surgeons to support the public in “doing their homework.” Informed patients do not go to cowboys. Twitter and Facebook are two of the most used social media platforms, and many boardcertified plastic surgeons are actively engaged in these. Instagram is rapidly rising in the ranks, with its visual format being well suited to plastic surgery.",2018.0,3.0,3.0,{'name': 'Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Branford2018DiscussionWD,\n author = {O.

To better understand the pandemic-related challenges that Activity Professionals are facing, we asked COVID-19 specific questions as part of a larger survey. The overall survey focused on identifying challenges and potential technology solutions (e.g., socially assistive robots) to assist Activity Professionals in their job duties. Activity Professionals (N=19) completed the online questionnaire. Respondents (aged M=48.00, SD=12.87; 95% female, 100% native English speakers, 68% White/Caucasian, 21% Black/African American) were highly educated/experienced: 68% had a Bachelor’s degree or above, and 53% had 10-35 years of experience. Respondents worked in Independent Living (68%), Assisted Living (37%), Memory Care (26%), Skilled Nursing (21%), or Personal Care (11%). All Activity Professionals reported impact by COVID-19, as follows: 1) Cancelled activities: Group activities/gatherings; hosting outside entertainment; fewer volunteers, vendors, paid sources. 2) New restrictions: Number of people in elevators, rooms; no contact with residents. 3) Unexpected new tasks: More 1:1 meetings; video conferencing; additional phone calls with residents, staff, and families; ordering groceries online. Daily duties changed significantly with less help and limited availability of technology. 4) Effect: Fewer activities and new delivery models (online, TV). Concerns about potential negative effects on residents while trying to meet the creativity challenge: “This has caused lots of “out of the box” thinking for ways to engage residents and keep things upbeat despite the challenges.” Results illustrate the breadth of challenges that staff are facing, some of which can be addressed by technology.",2020.0,0.0,3.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '957 - 957', 'name': 'Innovation in Aging'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Adams2020SocialAI,\n author = {A.

The aim of this research is to provide support for an empirical pathway that proposes that the effects of EI on suicide risk may follow an indirect pathway, involving maladaptive and adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies, using both cross-sectional and prospective design in two independent studies with Spanish adolescents. The sample of Study 1 consisted of 1824 students (52.4% female; mean age 14.55 years). In Study 2, 796 adolescents (54.4% female; mean age 13.76 years) filled out the measures twice, four months later. The results confirmed a positive association between EI and adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and a negative link with suicidal ideation. As expected, the results showed that both cross-sectionally (Study 1) and prospectively (Study 2) EI predicted lower suicidal ideation. Bootstrap mediation analysis indicated that only adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies partially mediated the link between EI and suicidal ideation both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Together, those adolescents who showed higher EI were more likely to report more adaptive cognitive emotion regulation, which in turn predicted lower levels of suicidal ideation. Our findings suggest possible avenues for prevention and intervention efforts aimed at boosting emotional abilities and developing adaptive coping strategies among adolescents who are at elevated suicide risk.",2020.0,46.0,11.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Quintana-Orts2020UntanglingTE,\n author = {Cirenia Quintana-Orts and S.

444,22cf9c78977cf62b5169ec3f57d91e88f076148d,Development of Students' Emotional Intelligence: Participative Classroom Environments in Higher Education,"INTRODUCTION The purpose of the present study is to explore the role participative classroom environments play in the development of college student's emotional intelligence (EI), and whether EI is related to academic achievement. Emotional intelligence has become an increasingly popular topic in recent years in the management and behavioral science literature. Researchers now broadly acknowledge that emotions play a critical role in organizational life and performance (Ashforth and Humphrey, 1995; Ashkanasy, 2004; Ashkanasy and Daus, 2005; Hartel, Zerbe, and Ashkanasy, 2004). Emotional intelligence can be regarded as a central part of current zeitgeist (Mayer, Salovey and Caruso, 2000) or ""affective revolution"" (Barsade, Brief, and Spataro, 2003) which emerges as a result of discontent with previously adopted predominantly cognitive and rational paradigms. EI has also become a concern for companies that face a serious gap between required and actual level of their employees' emotional abilities. Although employers of new college graduates emphasize the importance of ""soft skills,"" they are substantially less satisfied with graduates' interpersonal and emotional competencies than with their conceptual and analytical skills (Rynes, Trank, Lawson, and Ilies, 2003; Shivpuri and Kim, 2004; Whetten and Cameron, 2005). Acknowledgement of this discrepancy makes it essential for educators to address the issue of enhancing students' emotional intelligence in academic institutions. Some empirical findings suggest that emotional intelligence, unlike IQ, can be improved through learning and development opportunities.(Ashkanasy and Daus, 2005; Dulewicz and Higgs, 2004). Studies devoted to the development of emotional intelligence during the formal educational process suggest tackling the problem in a direct fashion, by including the topic in particular courses and activities. Tucker, Sojka, Barone, and McCarthy (2000) recommend incorporating the process for the development of emotional intelligence outlined by Cherniss and Goleman (1998) into the business school curriculum. According to these authors an overall program should entail self-assessment of emotional intelligence for freshmen as part of their orientation; integrating experiential exercises into specific courses, so that students can practice using emotional skills; and assessing EI of graduating seniors (Tucker et al., 2000). Liptak (2005) advocates teaching emotional intelligence during personal and career counseling of students. Brown (2003) describes interesting emotional skills-building exercises which can be incorporated into organizational behavior courses. Whetten and Cameron (2005) and Clark Callister, and Wallace (2003) make a similar suggestion regarding a management skills course. Ornstein and Nelson (2006) make a convincing argument for teaching emotional competencies to students preparing for a business class overseas, because experiencing a foreign culture imposes high emotional demands on both students and trip leaders. We fully accept the value of incorporating the topic of emotional intelligence in specific courses and activities. At the same time, this direct approach is limited to the portion of students who participate in these courses. It would be worthwhile to investigate if described practices can be complemented by other more indirect approaches which make development of emotional skills possible for a larger student population. Therefore the central research question of this study is whether participative class environments, in general, result in improvement of emotional intelligence. This has not been investigated in previous studies. At the same time, we want to examine whether increased emotional intelligence leads to better academic achievement. This would bolster the argument that it is important to develop emotional intelligence of college students. WHAT IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE? One of the problems in reviewing past research on emotional intelligence is the different incompatible definitions of what encompasses emotional intelligence. …",2011.0,0.0,39.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '89', 'name': 'The Academy of Educational Leadership Journal'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Landau2011DevelopmentOS,\n author = {Jacqueline C.

Chinese provincial leaders, despite facing strong career concerns, make different policy decisions depending on their career backgrounds. Provincial party secretaries who have risen from low to high positions within the province they govern (“locals”) spend a higher share of budgetary resources on education and health care and invest less in construction infrastructure than party secretaries who have made their most significant career advancements in other provinces (“outsiders”). Identification comes from variation in central leadership and term limits. As the promotion mechanism rewards infrastructure investments, locals are less likely to be promoted at the end of the term. We explore various mechanisms and provide evidence that the difference between locals and outsiders is not driven by knowledge or experience. Several pieces of evidence suggest that locals cater to low-level provincial elites, who helped them rise to power. Thus, local career trajectories limit the power of career concerns by fostering competing allegiances.",2014.0,38.0,128.0,{'name': 'Public Choice: Public Goods eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Persson2014TheLO,\n author = {Petra Persson and E.

ICOs are smart contracts based on blockchain technology that are designed for entrepreneurs to raise external finance by issuing tokens without an intermediary. Unlike existing mechanisms for early-stage finance, tokens potentially provide investors with rapid opportunities thanks to liquid trading platforms. The marketability of tokens offers novel insights into entrepreneurial finance, which I explore in this paper. First, I document that investors earn on average 8.2% on the first day of trading. However, about 40% of all ICOs destroy investor value on the first day of trading. Second, I explore the determinants of market outcomes and find that management quality and the ICO profile are positively correlated with the funding amount and returns, whereas highly visionary projects have a negative effect. Among the 21% of all tokens that get delisted from a major exchange platform, highly visionary projects are more likely to fail, which investors anticipate. Third, I explore the sensitivity of the ICO market to adverse industry events such as China’s ban of ICOs, the hack of leading ledgers, and the marketing ban on FaceBook. I find that the ICO market is highly susceptible to such environmental shocks, resulting in substantial welfare losses for investors.",2018.0,68.0,76.0,"{'volume': '15', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Momtaz2018InitialCO,\n author = {Paul P.

Method: We conducted a literature search for studies that used a qualitative or a mixed-method approach having a significant qualitative element. Pubmed, Cinahl, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were queried. Candidate articles published in journals and conference proceedings were considered for review. Two independent reviewers assessed the included studies for methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program, after which data on subjects’ self-reported opinions and perceptions were extracted and synthesized using thematic analyses. Results: Seventeen studies producing 23 publications were included. Based on the opinions of older adults, four themes emerged in relation to the use of SARS: (1) roles of a SAR; (2) interaction between the older adult and the SAR, which could be further subdivided into (a) the technical aspect of the interaction and (b) the human aspect of the interaction; (3) appearance of the SAR; and (4) normative/ethical issues regarding the use of SARs in aged care. Conclusions: Older adults have clear positive and negative opinions about different aspects of SARs in aged care. Nonetheless, some opinions can be ambiguous and need more attention if SARs are to be considered for use in aged care. Understanding older adults’ lived experiences with SARs creates the possibility of using an approach that embeds technological innovation into the care practice itself.",2018.0,54.0,115.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '149 - 167', 'name': 'Aging & Mental Health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vandemeulebroucke2018HowDO,\n author = {Tijs Vandemeulebroucke and Bernadette Dierckx de Casterlé and C.

458,23d42a4b43a37b957e8a00f31336fd356ff9c6a1,Multidimensional scaling of emotional facial expressions: Similarity from preschoolers to adults.,"Structural models of emotion represent the fact that we perceive emotions as systematically interrelated. These interrelations may reveal a basic property of the human conception of emotions, or they may represent an artifact that is due to semantic relations learned along with the emotion lexicon. The first alternative was supported by results from a series of scalings of 20 emotional facial expressions, results that could not easily be attributed to word similarity. Similarity data on the facial expressions were obtained from 30 adults and 42 preschoolers. For preschoolers, prior evidence indicates that emotion labels are not readily available; for both groups, we measured similarity without the use of emotion labels by asking subjects to group together people who appear to feel alike. The structure of emotions obtained from both children and adults was as predicted: a roughly circular order in a two-dimensional space, the axes of which could be interpreted as pleasure-disp leasure and arousal-sleepiness. The form and meaning of this structure was supported through two additional scalings of the facial expressions with adults: a multidimension al scaling based on direct ratings of similarity-di ssimilarity, and unidimensional scalings on the pleasuredispleasure and arousal-sleepiness dimensions.",1985.0,31.0,374.0,"{'volume': '48', 'pages': '1290-1298', 'name': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Russell1985MultidimensionalSO,\n author = {J.

While this area has seen plenty of discussion, there is little rigorous experimentation addressing how biofeedback can enhance human-computer interaction. In our two-part study, (N=36) subjects first played eight different game stages with two implicit biofeedback conditions, with two simulation-based comparison and repetition rounds, then repeated the two biofeedback stages when given explicit information on the biofeedback. The biofeedback conditions were respiration and skin-conductance (EDA) adaptations. Adaptation targets were four balanced player avatar attributes. We collected data with psycho¬physiological measures (electromyography, respiration, and EDA), a game experience questionnaire, and game-play measures. According to our experiment, implicit biofeedback does not produce significant effects in player experience in an FPS game. In the explicit biofeedback conditions, players were more immersed and positively affected, and they were able to manipulate the game play with the biosignal interface. We recommend exploring the possibilities of using explicit biofeedback interaction in commercial games.",2010.0,19.0,112.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Kuikkaniemi2010TheIO,\n author = {Kai Kuikkaniemi and T.

In recent years social neuroscience made considerable progress in revealing the mechanisms that enable a person to feel what another is feeling. The present review provides an in‐depth and critical discussion of these findings. Consistent evidence shows that sharing the emotions of others is associated with activation in neural structures that are also active during the first‐hand experience of that emotion. Part of the neural activation shared between self‐ and other‐related experiences seems to be rather automatically activated. However, recent studies also show that empathy is a highly flexible phenomenon, and that vicarious responses are malleable with respect to a number of factors—such as contextual appraisal, the interpersonal relationship between empathizer and other, or the perspective adopted during observation of the other. Future investigations are needed to provide more detailed insights into these factors and their neural underpinnings. Questions such as whether individual differences in empathy can be explained by stable personality traits, whether we can train ourselves to be more empathic, and how empathy relates to prosocial behavior are of utmost relevance for both science and society.",2009.0,112.0,1928.0,"{'volume': '1156', 'name': 'Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Singer2009TheSN,\n author = {T.

One commonly used technique is reactive training - applying standard RL methods while treating other agents as a part of the learner's environment. It is known that in general-sum games reactive training can lead groups of agents to converge to inefficient outcomes. We focus on one such class of environments: Stag Hunt games. Here agents either choose a risky cooperative policy (which leads to high payoffs if both choose it but low payoffs to an agent who attempts it alone) or a safe one (which leads to a safe payoff no matter what). We ask how we can change the learning rule of a single agent to improve its outcomes in Stag Hunts that include other reactive learners. We extend existing work on reward-shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning and show that that making a single agent prosocial, that is, making them care about the rewards of their partners can increase the probability that groups converge to good outcomes. Thus, even if we control a single agent in a group making that agent prosocial can increase our agent's long-run payoff. We show experimentally that this result carries over to a variety of more complex environments with Stag Hunt-like dynamics including ones where agents must learn from raw input pixels.",2017.0,72.0,89.0,{'pages': '2043-2044'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Peysakhovich2017ProsocialLA,\n author = {A.

473,24c5de3c93aa8cdd779641c3172399ef5c092d1c,What Are Emotion Theories About,"This is a set of notes relating to an invited talk at the cross-disciplinary workshop on Architectures for Modeling Emotion at the AAAI Spring Symposium at Stanford University in March 2004. The organisers of the workshop note that work on emotions “is often carried out in anad hocmanner”, and hope to remedy this by focusing on two themes (a) validation of emotion models and architectures, and (b) relevance of recent findings from affective neuroscience research. I shall focus mainly on (a), but in a manner which, I hope is relevant to (b), by addressing the need for conceptual clarification to remove, or at least reduce, the adhocery, both in modelling and in empirical research. In particular I try to show how a design-based approach can provide an improved conceptual framework and sharpen empirical questions relating to the study of mind and brain. From this standpoint it turns out that what are normally called emotions are a somewhat fuzzy subset of a larger class of states and processes that can arise out of interactions between different mechanisms in an architecture. What exactly the architecture is will determine both the larger class and the subset, since different architectures support different classes of states and processes. In order to develop the design-based approach we need a good ontology for characterising varieties of architectures and the states and processes that can occur in them. At present this too is often a matter of much ad-hocery. We propose steps toward a remedy. Validation vstesting It is good to ask how theories can be validated, though I would rather ask how they can be t sted, and how they can becompared, in various dimensions, such as depth, clarity, generality, precision, explanatory power, etc., since most theories are incomplete, provisional, premature, vague, or just false. So validation is rarely to be expected, even when a theory is the best one available and provides a good basis for further research, a point that is familiar from the writings of Karl Popper (Popper 1934; Magee 1985), and work of Lakatos cited by Dean Petters in this symposium. Copyright c © 2004, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. There is, however, a kind of validation of theories of a type Popper did not (as far as I know) admit as science, and many scientists do not acknowledge, partly because of Popper’s influence, namely theories about what is possible (what can occur). Simple logic shows that even a single example validates such a theory. The importance of theories of what is possible and how they are presupposed by the search for laws and regularities which constrain what is possible, was discussed in Sloman (1978, Ch 2). See also (Boden 1990). In particular, contrary to wide-spread views on scientific method, the truth of a statement that something can occur is established by a singleexample – which could be world-shaking (e.g. the discovery that light of low intensity and small wavelength can trigger an electric current when high intensity large wavelength light fails (the photoelectric effect), the discovery in 1919 that light from a star can be deflected by passing near the sun, or Newton’s earlier discovery that white light passing through a prism can be split into beams different colours). However, checking that the description of the example is correct may be non-trivial, especially if it requires the use of concepts that are not yet generally understood or theories that are not yet accepted. For present purposes the study of architectures and the phenomena they support is part of the study of what can exist or occur (deep science) and why, rather than an attempt to discover any new laws about what happens when or what correlates with what (shallow science). But we need to know what we are talking about. What are we talking about? It is sometimes forgotten that the question whether a theory is true or false presupposes an answer to whether it makes sense at all. All theories use concepts , for these are the building blocks of propositions, but insofar as the concepts are obscure, confused, or vague, the theories, and even the questions to which the theories are answers, will be flawed. For instance, if our concept of ‘emotion’ is ambiguous then so also will many questions about emotions be ambiguous, e.g. how emotions evolved, what their functions are, which animals have them, which brain mechanisms produce them, what types there are, whether they are needed for intelligence, whether a foetus has them, etc. Alas, our everyday concept of ‘emotion’ mixes up motivations, attitudes, moods, and other affective states and processes, and is therefore is too deeply flawed to be a useful component of scientific questions and theories for reasons recounted elsewhere. 1 But that does not prevent scientists assuming that these concepts can be used to formulate clear, unambiguous scientific questions or theories. For instance, sometimes people who argue that emotions are needed for intelligence are merely defending the truism that motivation is needed for action, and preferences are needed for selecting between options. However, not everyone would call a motive or preference, however important, an emotion. Wishful thinking isn’t science Sometimes over-generalising the notion of ‘emotion’ is related to a desire to argue that emotions are important in ways not previously acknowledged, e.g. that they are a prerequisite for intelligence. This can be wishful thinking or a trivial truism. If ‘emotion’ is construed so broadly that it covers all goals and preferences the claim that emotions are needed for intelligence is vacuous. On the other hand if it refers more narrowly to the sorts of processes in which one subsystem interferes with or disrupts the normal functioning of another, as happens in many of the states in which people are described as being ‘emotional’ then it is false that emotions arerequiredfor intelligence: on the contrary, emotions of that sort can get in the way of sensible decisions and actions. Monica Croucher and I once argued in 1981 that mechanisms required for intelligence in resource-limited robots in fast-changing environments would inevitably produce thepossibility of emotional states, involving interruption or modulation of one process by another (where the latter is often a fast and therefore relatively stupid process) that detects an urgent need for some change, e.g. using reactive mechanisms labelled ‘alarms’ in Fig. 1. But saying that states of type X can occur as a side-effect of the operation of some mechanism M that is required for intelligence does not imply that states of type X are themselves required for intelligence. Many wishful thinkers misinterpreted that paper as claiming that emotions are requiredfor intelligence, just as they fail to see the obvious flaw in Damasio’s widely quoted reasoning (1994) from the premiss:Damage to frontal lobes impairs both intelligence and emotional capabilitiesto the conclusionEmotions are required for intelligence . A moment’s thought should show that two capabilities could presuppose some common mechanisms without either capability being required for the other. A research community with too much wishful thinking does not advance science. Of course, if I have misread such people and they are merely proposing the truism (noted by Hume, which needs no empirical evidence) that motivation and preferences are required for intelligent thought and actions then that is another manifestation of the ambiguity of the word ‘emotion’. E.g. in (Sloman 2002b; 2002a; 2001; Sloman, Chrisley, & Scheutz To Appear). Figure 1: The CogAff schema defines a crude first-draft division of mechanisms into 9 categories. A particular type of fast, patterndriven, reactive central mechanism, with inputs from and outputs to many other components of the architecture could function as an alarm mechanism able to produce global reorganisation very quickly. Different sorts of alarm systems can produce different sorts of emotions, depending on where the inputs come from where the outputs go, what kinds of decisions are taken and what kinds of output signals are sent. Slower, longer lasting, more easily suppressedispositionalmechanisms can produce long term emotions, such as grief or jealousy. We need finer-grained ontologies We should not put both (i) a general preference for saving effort, and (ii) fear produced by a stampeding herd, in the same conceptual basket when they have so very many differences, including the (relative) permanence of the first and the transience of the second. Or rather, we can put them in a more general basket labelled ‘affect’ which includes sub-categories which might be aptly labelled ‘emotion’, ‘desire’, ‘preference’, ‘attitude’, ‘value’, ‘mood’, etc. I am not claiming that all emotions are short-term (though many emotion theories have that consequence, often not noticed by their proponents). In Wright et al. (1996) we tried to show, at least in outline, how long-term emotions such as grief, could exist in the form of dispositions which only rarely manifest themselves, either because of external triggers (reminders) or because other competing attention-grabbers subside. Many states generally regarded as important human emotions that form the stuff of plays, novels and garden-gate gossip are long term largely dispositional states, including jealousy, vengefulness, family love, obsessive ambition, infatuation, fascination with a mathematical problem, etc. There are other long term affective states such as preferences, and attitudes that are not normally called emotions. Of course, someone who defines an emotion as an episodic state in which there are particular sorts of bodily changes or sensed changes in a body state map will not include some of these long term states as emotions. But that’s just another example of the terminological disarray.

Specific aspects are the insufficient perception of their own emotional states and the use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies. Both aspects are interdependent. Thus, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) comprises the development and training of adequate emotion regulation strategies. Traditionally, reappraisal is the most common strategy, but strategies of acceptance are becoming more important in the course of advancing CBT. Indeed, there is evidence that emotion regulation strategies differ in self-reported effectiveness, psychophysiological reactions, and underlying neural correlates. However, comprehensive comparisons of different emotion regulation strategies are sparse. The present study, therefore, compared the effect of three common emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal, acceptance, and suppression) on self-reported effectiveness, recollection, and psychophysiological as well as electroencephalographic dimensions. Twenty-nine healthy participants were instructed to either reappraise, accept, suppress, or passively observe their upcoming emotional reactions while anxiety- and sadness-inducing pictures were presented. Results showed a compelling effect of reappraisal on emotional experience, skin conductance response, and P300 amplitude. Acceptance was almost as effective as reappraisal, but led to increased emotional experience. Combining all results, suppression was shown to be the least effective but significantly decreased emotional experience when thoughts and feelings had to be suppressed. Moreover, results show that greater propensity for rumination differentially impairs strategies of emotion regulation.",2019.0,73.0,15.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Brain Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Boehme2019EffectsOD,\n author = {S.

Chinese policy makers face mounting challenges overseeing the rapidly growing residential care sector, given the tension arising from policy inducements to further institutional growth, a weak regulatory framework, and the lack of enforcement capacity. We recommend addressing the following pressing policy issues: building a balanced system of services and avoiding an ""institutional bias"" that promotes rapid growth of elder care institutions over home or community-based care; strengthening regulatory oversight and quality assurance with information systems; and prioritizing education and training initiatives to grow a professionalized long-term care workforce.",2012.0,23.0,287.0,"{'volume': '31 12', 'pages': '\n          2764-73\n        ', 'name': 'Health affairs'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Feng2012ChinasRA,\n author = {Zhanlian Feng and Chang Liu and Xinping Guan and V.

Multiple physiological signals such as respiration (RSP) and heart rate variability (HRV) were acquired in an experiment from 53 participants when six basic emotion states were induced. Two RSP parameters were acquired from a chest-band respiration sensor, and five HRV parameters were acquired from a finger-clip blood volume pulse (BVP) sensor. A newly designed deep-learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was adopted for detecting the identification accuracy of individual emotions. Additionally, the signal combination of the acquired parameters was proposed to obtain high classification accuracy. Furthermore, a dominant factor influencing the accuracy was found by comparing the relativeness of the parameters, providing a basis for supporting the results of emotion classification.

Recent studies demonstrate that board-certified plastic surgeons are underrepresented amongst individuals posting public-directed marketing plastic surgery-related content on Instagram. However, peer-to-peer and education-based social media influence has not been studied. Twitter is a social media platform has been suggested to be useful for educating the masses and connecting with colleagues.


Objectives
The purpose of this study is to identify the top influencers in plastic surgery on Twitter, characterize who they are, and relate their social media influence to academic influence.


Methods
Twitter influence scores for the topic search ""plastic surgery"" were collected in July 2017 using Right Relevance software. The accounts associated with the highest influencer scores were linked to individual names, status as a plastic surgeon, board certification, location, and academic h-index.


Results
The top 100 Twitter influencers in plastic surgery are presented. Seventy-seven percent of the top influencers are trained as plastic surgeons or facial plastic surgeons. Sixty-one percent of influencers are board-certified plastic surgeons or board-eligible/future eligible trainees. International plastic surgeons made up 16% of influencers. Other medical doctors made up another 10%. The other 13% of influencers were nonphysicians. Three-quarters of social media influencers were physically located in the United States. Academic h-index of social media influencers ranged from 0 to 62 (mean, 8.6).


Conclusions
This study shows that the top plastic surgery social media influencers on Twitter are predominantly board-certified or eligible plastic surgeons and physically based in the United States. This study also provides the influencer network for other plastic surgeons to engage with to improve their own influence within the plastic surgery social media sphere.",2018.0,10.0,52.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '913–917', 'name': 'Aesthetic Surgery Journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chandawarkar2018TheT1,\n author = {A.

Difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) have been linked to lower high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a measure of autonomous nervous system functioning. However, previous research on vagally-mediated heart rate in BPD revealed heterogeneous findings and the effects of comorbid PTSD and dissociation on HF-HRV are not yet completely understood. This study aim to investigate HF-HRV during resting-state and an ER task in female BPD patients with comorbid PTSD (BPD + PTSD), patients without this comorbidity (BPD), and healthy controls (HC). Methods 57 BPD patients (BPD: n = 37, BPD + PTSD: n = 20) and 27 HC performed an ER task with neutral, positive, and negative images. Participants were instructed to either attend these pictures or to down-regulate their upcoming emotions using cognitive reappraisal. Subjective arousal and wellbeing, self-reported dissociation, and electrocardiogram data were assessed. Results Independent of ER instruction and picture valence, both patient groups (BPD and BPD + PTSD) reported higher subjective arousal and lower wellbeing; patients with BPD + PTSD further exhibited significantly lower HF-HRV compared with the other groups. Higher self-reported state dissociation predicted higher HF-HRV during down-regulating v. attending negative pictures in BPD + PTSD. Conclusions Findings suggest increased emotional reactivity to negative, positive, and neutral pictures, but do not provide evidence for deficits in instructed ER in BPD. Reduced HF-HRV appears to be particularly linked to comorbid PTSD, while dissociation may underlie attempts to increase ER and HF-HRV in BPD patients with this comorbidity.",2018.0,101.0,21.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '1810 - 1821', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Krause-Utz2018HeartRV,\n author = {A.

It is proposed that when choosing between options that differ in relative risk, a somatic marker (for example, a “gut feeling”) feeds back to the brain and influences cognitive appraisal. This study tested the hypothesis that the noradrenergic system may play a part in this afferent feedback process. Methods: Thirty healthy young adults were randomly allocated to receive placebo, 4 mg, or 8 mg reboxetine (a new selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor that acts to increase central noradrenergic activity). It is hypothesised that enhancement of central noradrenergic activity may amplify the effect of afferent feedback, and lead to altered decision making. All subjects completed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a computerised card playing game where the player is instructed to try and win as much money as possible over 100 selections from one of four decks. Results: There were no significant differences between the three groups in gambling task performance. Conclusion: This result suggests that central noradrenergic activity may not be critically involved in the afferent feedback mechanism that is central to the somatic marker hypothesis.",2003.0,22.0,46.0,"{'volume': '74', 'pages': '376 - 378', 'name': 'Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{O'Carroll2003DecisionMI,\n author = {R.

Specifically, we believe that affect can be used to tradeoff computational complexity with quality of the solution, thereby producing approximations that compare favorably with other approximation techniques. Our research is predicated on the thesis that cognitive appraisal of the environment induces internal emotions that in turn affect the agent’s decision-making process. In order to validate our thesis, we require a computational model for capturing the dynamics of emotions and generating behaviors characteristic of several emotional states. We are especially interested in modeling affective agent planning in stochastic domains where the agent is unaware of its current state (e.g. its physical location), but receives a series of percepts that may guide it. In this context we propose utilizing a decision-theoretic framework called Partially ObservableMarkov DecisionProcess (POMDP). Solution of a problem modeled as a POMDP, produces a policy that controls agent planning. Exact solutions of POMDPs are intractable spurring interest into approximation techniques that compute near-optimal solutions using less running time. Towards this end, we propose employing affect as a justification for reducing the size of the input POMDP model, and therefore the computational complexity of its solution. In doing so, we not only demonstrate the feasibility of employing affect as a potential approximation technique, but also present a computational model that can generate behaviors characteristic of several emotions. The primary contributions of this paper are twofold: We explore the feasibility of employing affect to produce nearoptimal approximations to optimal plans in less time. Secondly, we propose a hybrid agent architecture that employs a reactive finite state machine based metareasoner and a deliberative POMDP based planner, to model different affective behaviors. We validate our claims through experimentation on an example toy problem domain. The remainder of this paper is structured in the following manner. In the next section we discuss some related work and put our model in the proper context.

In this paper we outline the concept of reproducible research in relation to micro-level administrative social science data. Our central claim is that a planned and organised workflow is essential for high quality research using micro-level administrative social science data. We argue that it is essential for researchers to share research code, because code sharing enables the elements of reproducible research. First, it enables results to be duplicated and therefore allows the accuracy and validity of analyses to be evaluated. Second, it facilitates further tests of the robustness of the original piece of research. Drawing on insights from computer science and other disciplines that have been engaged in e-Research we discuss and advocate the use of Git repositories to provide a useable and effective solution to research code sharing and rendering social science research using micro-level administrative data reproducible.",2016.0,91.0,37.0,"{'volume': '3', 'name': 'Big Data & Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Playford2016AdministrativeSS,\n author = {Christopher J.

When it is tested for periodic signals and for signals with additive noise or jitter, it proves to be several orders of magnitude more accurate than the methods commonly used for speech analysis. This makes our method capable of measuring harmonics-to-noise ratios in the lag domain with an accuracy and reliability much greater than that of any of the usual frequency-domain methods. By definition, the best candidate for the acoustic pitch period of a sound can be found from the position of the maximum of the autocorrelation function of the sound, while the degree of periodicity (the harmonics-to-noise ratio) of the sound can be found from the relative height of this maximum. However, sampling and windowing cause problems in accurately determining the position and height of the maximum. These problems have led to inaccurate timedomain and cepstral methods for pitch detection, and to the exclusive use of frequency-domain methods for the determination of the harmonics-to-noise ratio. In this paper, I will tackle these problems. Table 1 shows the specifications of the resulting algorithm for two spectrally maximally different kinds of periodic sounds: a sine wave and a periodic pulse train; other periodic sounds give results between these. Table 1. The accuracy of the algorithm for a sampled sine wave and for a correctly sampled periodic pulse train, as a function of the number of periods that fit in the duration of a Hanning window. These results are valid for pitch frequencies up to 80% of the Nyquist frequency. These results were measured for a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and window lengths of 40 ms (for pitch) and 80 ms (for HNR), but generalize to other sampling frequencies and window lengths (see section 5).",1993.0,9.0,1275.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Boersma1993ACCURATESA,\n author = {P.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)-based surveillance technologies such as facial recognition, emotion recognition and other biometric technologies have been rapidly introduced by both public and private entities all around the world, raising major concerns about their impact on fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy. This article questions the efﬁciency of the European Commission’s Proposal for Regulation of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, known as the AI Act, in addressing the threats and risks to fundamental rights posed by AI biometric surveillance systems. It argues that in order to meaningfully address risks to fundamental rights the proposed classiﬁcation of these systems should be reconsidered. Although the draft AI Act acknowledges that some AI practices should be prohibited, the multiple exceptions and loopholes should be closed, and in addition new prohibitions, in particular to emotional recognition and biometric categorisation systems, should be added to counter AI surveillance practices violating fundamental rights. The AI Act should also introduce stronger legal requirements, such as third-party conformity assessment, fundamental rights impact assessment, transparency obligations as well as enhance existing EU data protection law and the rights and remedies available to individuals, thus not missing the unique opportunity to adopt the ﬁrst legal framework that truly promotes trustworthy AI. enhance existing data protection rules and promote the rights and remedies of the individuals and groups in the draft AI Act.",2022.0,44.0,0.0,"{'name': 'Inf.

506,27a5bfae7527ad031c38f5b8393eab4d126e9980,A Regulatory Sandbox for Robo Advice,"Robo advice, the automated provision of financial advice without human intervention, holds the promise of cheap, convenient and fast investment services for consumers – freed from human error or bias. However, retail investors have limited capacity to assess the soundness of the advice, and are prone to make hasty, unverified investment decisions. Moreover, financial advice based on rough and broad classifications may fail to take into account the individual preferences and needs of the investor. On a more general scale, robo advice may be a source of new systemic risk. At this stage, the existing EU regulatory framework is of little help. Instead, this paper proposes a regulatory ""sandbox"" – an experimentation space – as a step towards a regulatory environment where such new business models can thrive. A sandbox would allow market participants to test robo advice services in the real market, with real consumers, but under close scrutiny of the supervisor. The benefit of such an approach is that it fuels the development of new business practices and reduces the ""time to market"" cycle of financial innovation while simultaneously safeguarding consumer protection. At the same time, a sandbox allows for mutual learning in a field concerning a little-known phenomenon, both for firms and for the regulator. This would help reducing the prevalent regulatory uncertainty for all market participants. In the particular EU legal framework with various layers of legal instruments, the implementation of such a sandbox is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a ""guided sandbox"", operated by the EU Member States, but with endorsement, support, and monitoring by EU institutions. This innovative approach would be somewhat unchartered territory for the EU, and thereby also contribute to the future development of EU financial market governance.",2018.0,63.0,23.0,{'name': 'ERN: Regulation (European) (Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Ringe2018ARS,\n author = {W.

Critiques of self-report indices of emotion regulation suggest that its measurement is in need of more critical investigation. The current study examined the factor structure of emotion regulation as informed by Gross' (1998a) Process Model: Situation Selection, Attentional Deployment, Cognitive Change, and Response Modulation.


METHOD
A sample of 553 participants was recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (M(age) = 37.12, SD = 13.66; n = 352 female). Confirmatory factor analysis with maximum likelihood estimation was performed in Mplus.


RESULTS
A four-factor model of emotion regulation demonstrated poor fit. An alternative five-factor model fit the data well: CFI = .94, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .07.


CONCLUSION
Emotion regulation may be better conceptualized as a combination of specific strategy use and a broader construct, called ""emotional distancing"" (a trait-like disposition towards emotions). Further research is required to determine if the observed five-factor model can be replicated in more diverse samples.",2015.0,59.0,22.0,"{'volume': '71 10', 'pages': '\n          1004-22\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Seligowski2015ExaminingTS,\n author = {A.

There remains little evidence that specific instruments to safeguard children’s rights in relation to dataveillance have been developed or implemented, and further attention needs to be paid to these issues.",2017.0,73.0,264.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '780 - 794', 'name': 'New Media & Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lupton2017TheDC,\n author = {Deborah Lupton and Ben Williamson},\n journal = {New Media & Society},\n pages = {780 - 794},\n title = {The datafied child: The dataveillance of children and implications for their rights},\n volume = {19},\n year = {2017}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '4570236', 'name': 'Deborah Lupton'}, {'authorId': '143892998', 'name': 'Ben Williamson'}]"

The market-maker is characterized as passively accepting orders to buy and to sell a security at the market's prevailing price (plus or minus half the bid-ask spread). The bid-ask spread adjusts to cover market-makers' average costs. The bid-ask spread then varies positively with: the security's price volatility, the volatility of order flow, and the absolute value of the market-maker's net inventory position. Each of these variables increases average cost and hence is priced in the bid-ask spread. Thus market liquidity (varying inversely with the bid-ask spread) declines with increasing price and volume volatility and with increasing size of market-maker net inventory positions. The model hence provides a particularly simple explanation for declining market liquidity during periods of large price movements and trading imbalances that increase the size of market-makers' net inventory.",2000.0,9.0,46.0,{'name': 'Capital Markets: Market Microstructure'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Shen2000MarketMS,\n author = {Pu Shen and R.

Now that the first achievement in this field has been reached, it is time to consider the legal situation theoretically, historically, critically, and to look at the more important and more difficult task that remains to be done. The struggle for the ""rights of m a n "" was first waged within the states. The democratic Greek city-state, which was at the same time the Church, knew no rights even of the full citizens as against the state. Even less were there rights for all men. Even Aristotle speaks of men who are by nature slaves. True, the Stoics opposed slavery, and Roman jurists later took over the Stoic natural law; but they never doubted that the positive law of slavery prevailed. In the ""age of reason"" the struggle for the rights of man was based on a natural law of revolutionary character. To say that the ""rights of man"" are inherent, inalienable, preexisting to the state which the state has to protect, but cannot bestow, was a formidable weapon in the political battle against tyranny. There is no doubt that many formulations of the ""Bill of Rights"" are drawn in the ideological language of the eighteenth century. But however great the influence of the ""age of reason"" was in this respect, it would be a mistake to believe that the idea of ""rights of man"" was unknown to the Middle Ages. Two more sources must not be forgotten. First, Christianity which brought this idea. The Catholic natural law as expressed by St. Thomas of Aquinas and by the Spaniards, Francisco de Vitoria 2 and Suarez, teaches the equality of all men. I t is the Catholic natural law which emphasizes the dignity of man as a rational creature, participating in the lex aeterna, made to the image of God and having an eternal destiny.

However, it has been limited to the reconstruction with low-level image bases (Miyawaki et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2016) or to the matching to exemplars (Naselaris et al., 2009; Nishimoto et al., 2011). Recent work showed that visual cortical activity can be decoded (translated) into hierarchical features of a deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features (Horikawa & Kamitani, 2017). Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that the generated images resembled the stimulus images (both natural images and artificial shapes) and the subjective visual content during imagery. While our model was solely trained with natural images, our method successfully generalized the reconstruction to artificial shapes, indicating that our model indeed ‘reconstructs’ or ‘generates’ images from brain activity, not simply matches to exemplars. A natural image prior introduced by another deep neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to reconstructions by constraining reconstructed images to be similar to natural images. Furthermore, human judgment of reconstructions suggests the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance visual quality of generated images. The results suggest that hierarchical visual information in the brain can be effectively combined to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images.",2017.0,37.0,185.0,"{'volume': '15', 'name': 'PLoS Computational Biology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shen2017DeepIR,\n author = {Guohua Shen and T.

This study examined the utilization of mental health treatments over a three-year period among patients with schizotypal, borderline, avoidant, or obsessive-compulsive personality disorders compared with patients with major depressive disorder and no personality disorder.


METHODS
A prospective, longitudinal study design was used to measure treatment use for 633 individuals aged 18 to 45 years during a three-year period.


RESULTS
Patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly more likely than those with major depressive disorder to use most types of treatment. Furthermore, all patients continued using high-intensity, low-duration treatments throughout the study period, whereas individual psychotherapy attendance declined significantly after one year.

Although it seems apparent that voice gender perception would rely on low-level pitch analysis, many lines of research suggest that this is not the case. Indeed, voice gender perception has been shown to rely on timbre perception and to be categorical, i.e., to depend on accessing a gender model or representation. Here, we used a unique combination of acoustic stimulus manipulation and mathematical modeling of human categorization performances to determine the relative contribution of pitch and timbre to this process. Contrary to the idea that voice gender perception relies on timber only, we demonstrate that voice gender categorization can be performed using pitch only but more importantly that pitch is used only when timber information is ambiguous (i.e., for more androgynous voices).",2012.0,28.0,83.0,"{'volume': '3', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pernet2012TheRO,\n author = {C.

The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect.

To this end, the electroencephalography (EEG) signal, electrocardiography (ECG) signal and skin temperature of 24 subjects have been studied. Each methodology has been evaluated individually, finding characteristic patterns of positive and negative emotions in each of them. After feature selection of each methodology, the results of the classification showed that, although the classification of emotions is possible at both central and peripheral levels, the multimodal approach did not improve the results obtained through the EEG alone.

But is it really helpful to distinguish between emotion generation and emotion regulation? In this article, we begin by offering working definitions of emotion generation and emotion regulation. We argue that in some circumstances, the distinction between emotion generation and emotion regulation is indeed useful. We point both to citation patterns, which indicate that researchers from across a number of sub-areas within psychology are making this distinction, and to empirical studies, which indicate the utility of this distinction in many different research contexts. We then consider five ways in which the distinction between emotion generation and emotion regulation can be problematic.

These problems need to get special handling to prevent unexpected impacts on students. The results of several studies suggest that the main characteristics of bullying victims are students who have low assertiveness levels, and to build these skills need to provide an assertiveness intervention.

To develop this idea, we first define the terms emotion, emotion regulation, and mental health. We then chart the development of emotion regulation and describe its role in various facets of normal functioning. Next, we consider what happens when emotion becomes dysregulated in a major depressive episode. We suggest that an emotion regulatory perspective integrates diverse theoretical views of depression and has implications for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of depression. We conclude by speculating about the role of emotion regulation in the broader context of public mental health.",1995.0,45.0,1485.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '151-164', 'name': 'Clinical Psychology-science and Practice'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gross1995EmotionRA,\n author = {J.

To remedy this, the study introduces a vital extension of PLS: consistent PLS (PLSc). PLSc provides a correction for estimates when PLS is applied to reflective constructs: The path coefficients, inter-construct correlations, and indicator loadings become consistent. The outcome of a Monte Carlo simulation reveals that the bias of PLSc parameter estimates is comparable to that of covariance-based structural equation modeling. Moreover, the outcome shows that PLSc has advantages when using non-normally distributed data. We discuss the implications for IS research and provide guidelines for choosing among structural equation modeling techniques.",2015.0,96.0,1336.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '297-316', 'name': 'MIS Q.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dijkstra2015ConsistentPL,\n author = {T.

This ground-breaking new work is the first textbook to systematically examine how the law and legal process of the UK interacts with the modern 'information society' and the fast-moving process of digitization. It examines the challenges that this fast pace of change brings to the established legal order, which was developed to meet the needs of a traditional physical society. To address these issues, this book begins by defining the information society and discussing how it may be regulated. From there it moves to questions of internet governance and rights and responsibilities in the digital environment. Particular attention is paid to key regulatory 'pressure points', including:DT copyright for digital productsDT identity fraudDT electronic commerceDT privacy and surveillancePossible future challenges and opportunities are outlined and discussed, including e-government, virtual environments and property, and the development of web 3.0. Information Technology Law: The law and society covers all aspects of a course of study on IT law, and is therefore an ideal text for students.

Models based on behavioral economics are only able to explain this phenomenon for unrealistic stateless matrix games. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been applied to generalize social dilemma problems to temporally and spatially extended Markov games. However, this has not yet generated an agent that learns to cooperate in social dilemmas as humans do. A key insight is that many, but not all, human individuals have inequity averse social preferences. This promotes a particular resolution of the matrix game social dilemma wherein inequity-averse individuals are personally pro-social and punish defectors. Here we extend this idea to Markov games and show that it promotes cooperation in several types of sequential social dilemma, via a profitable interaction with policy learnability. In particular, we find that inequity aversion improves temporal credit assignment for the important class of intertemporal social dilemmas. These results help explain how large-scale cooperation may emerge and persist.",2018.0,64.0,156.0,{'pages': '3330-3340'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Hughes2018InequityAI,\n author = {Edward Hughes and Joel Z.

Player pairwise preference data is collected using forced choice questionnaires, and the models are trained using this data and neuroevolutionary preference learning of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs).

Methods We conducted a cross sectional retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with COPD who had at least one hospitalization in 2010. We examined the process measures of receipt of spirometry evaluation, influenza and pneumococcal vaccine, use of COPD medications, and referral to a pulmonary specialist visit. Outcome measures were emergency department (ER) visit, number of hospitalizations and 30-day readmission in 2010. Results A total of 7,257 Medicare beneficiaries with COPD were included. Of these, 1,999 and 5,258 received primary care from APPs and primary care physicians, respectively. Patients in the APP group were more likely to be white, younger, male, residing in non-metropolitan areas and have fewer comorbidities. In terms of process of care measures, APPs were more likely to prescribe short acting bronchodilators (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.18, 95%Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05–1.32), oxygen therapy (aOR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.12–1.40) and consult a pulmonary specialist (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.23–1.56), but less likely to give influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Patients receiving care from APPs had lower rates of ER visits for COPD (aOR = 0.84, 95%CI 0.71–0.98) and had a higher follow-up rate with pulmonary specialist within 30 days of hospitalization for COPD (aOR = 1.25, 95%CI 1.07–1.48) than those cared for by physicians. Conclusions Compared to patients cared for by physicians, patients cared for by APPs were more likely to receive short acting bronchodilator, oxygen therapy and been referred to pulmonologist, however they had lower rates of vaccination probably due to lower age group. Patients cared for by APPs were less like to visit an ER for COPD compared to patients care for by physicians, conversely there was no differences in hospitalization or readmission for COPD between MDs and APPs.",2016.0,44.0,17.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Agarwal2016ProcessAO,\n author = {Amitesh Agarwal and W.

Each day for an average of 3 weeks, participants described how they had regulated their emotions in terms of the reappraisal and suppression (inhibiting the expression) of positive and negative emotions, and they described their emotional experience, self-esteem, and psychological adjustment in terms of Beck's triadic model of depression. Reappraisal was used more often than suppression, and suppressing positive emotions was used less than the other three strategies. In general, regulation through reappraisal was found to be beneficial, whereas regulation by suppression was not. Reappraisal of positive emotions was associated with increases in positive affect, self-esteem, and psychological adjustment, whereas suppressing positive emotions was associated with decreased positive emotion, self-esteem, and psychological adjustment, and increased negative emotions. Moreover, relationships between reappraisal and psychological adjustment and self-esteem were mediated by experienced positive affect, whereas relationships between suppression of positive emotions and self-esteem adjustment were mediated by negative affect.",2008.0,33.0,365.0,"{'volume': '76 3', 'pages': '\n          561-80\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nezlek2008RegulatingPA,\n author = {J.

This is an interesting field to explore especially for the survival horror genre that is excellent at producing player's intense emotions. In this research, we analyzed different player affective states prior to (i.e., Neutral, Anxiety, Suspense) and after (i.e., Low-Fear, Mid-Fear, High-Fear) a scary event using an affect annotation tool to collect player self-reports of their affective states during the game. Brainwave signals, heart rate and keyboard-mouse activity were also collected for analyzing the potential of automatically detecting horror-related affect. Results indicated that players were more likely to experience fear from a scary event when they were in a suspense state compared to when they were in a neutral state. In this state, players only experienced fear after experiencing surprise. Heart rate data gave the best result in classifying player affect, which achieved up to 90% overall accuracy.

Recent studies in children proposed initiating a prophylactic treatment in patients with severe (grade III) EV and/or EV associated with red color signs. Our study was aimed at assessing the risk of bleeding from EV in a series of patients with BA, identifying risk factors for bleeding to develop a predictive model of bleeding. Methods: This was a retrospective study including 83 eligible patients with BA. Clinical, ultrasonographic, endoscopic, and laboratory parameters were studied from the beginning of medical management up to the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients not presenting any bleeding, data were analyzed until liver transplantation, endoscopic treatment of EV was performed, or last follow-up. Risk factors were investigated using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results: Seventeen of 83 patients (20%) presented gastrointestinal bleeding, with a median age of 9.5 months (6–50 months). In univariate and multivariate analyses, high-grade EV, red color signs on endoscopic examination, and low fibrinogen levels, at first endoscopy, were identified as risk factors for bleeding. When tested in >10,000 different models, these 3 variables appeared to play the most significant role in predicting bleeding. Conclusions: Our study confirmed that grade III EV and red color signs are risk factors for bleeding in patients followed up for BA. We identified low fibrinogen levels as an additional risk factor. The relevance of these 3 factors to predict bleeding from EV requires validation in a prospective study.",2013.0,26.0,38.0,"{'volume': '56', 'pages': '537–543', 'name': 'Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wanty2013AssessmentOR,\n author = {C.

Method: The sample comprised of 316 middle school students (46.8% males, M = 13.74 years old, SD = 0.87) in Southwest China. The results showed that depressive symptoms mediated the association between academic stress and problematic smartphone usage. Results: This indirect relationship was conditioned by the degree of problem-focused coping. Specifically, those with lower or moderate levels of problem-focused coping tended to report more depressive symptoms, which in turn led to a higher score on problematic smartphone usage. However, this indirect relationship was weakened for those with higher levels of problem-focused coping. Conclusions: Thus, problem-focused coping should be cultivated when designing mental health interventions to reduce problematic smartphone usage among adolescents.",2018.0,76.0,37.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '162 - 169', 'name': 'Addiction Research & Theory'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Xu2018TheRB,\n author = {Ting Xu and Hai-Zhen Wang and Winny Fonseca and M.

These relationships, mediated by affective variables, have mainly been found in adults. However, little is known about these associations with moderating effects of feelings in adolescents and certain indicators of well‐being. This study examined the moderating role of feelings in the relation between trait emotional intelligence and several indicators of well‐being (life satisfaction, self‐perceived stress and somatic complaints) in adolescents. Methods: The sample was composed of 1,273 pupils from 10 high schools, aged between 12 and 16 (M=13.63 years; SD=1.22) 666 (52.7%) were girls.

Simulations guide and improve outcomes of medical interventions involving complex physiology. We developed HumMod, a Windows-based model of integrative human physiology. HumMod consists of 5000 variables describing cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, neural, endocrine, skeletal muscle, and metabolic physiology. The model is constructed from empirical data obtained from peer-reviewed physiological literature. All model details, including variables, parameters, and quantitative relationships, are described in Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. The executable (HumMod.exe) parses the XML and displays the results of the physiological simulations. The XML description of physiology in HumMod's modeling environment allows investigators to add detailed descriptions of human physiology to test new concepts. Additional or revised XML content is parsed and incorporated into the model. The model accurately predicts both qualitative and quantitative changes in clinical and experimental responses. The model is useful in understanding proposed physiological mechanisms and physiological interactions that are not evident, allowing one to observe higher level emergent properties of the complex physiological systems. HumMod has many uses, for instance, analysis of renal control of blood pressure, central role of the liver in creating and maintaining insulin resistance, and mechanisms causing orthostatic hypotension in astronauts. Users simulate different physiological and pathophysiological situations by interactively altering numerical parameters and viewing time-dependent responses. HumMod provides a modeling environment to understand the complex interactions of integrative physiology.

At the same time, chatbot technologies have become increasingly popular for use by the public and have been identified as having benefits for health care delivery. However, little is known about how chatbot technologies may benefit people with dementia and their caregivers. Objective This study aims to identify the types of current commercially available chatbots that are designed for use by people with dementia and their caregivers and to assess their quality in terms of features and content. Methods Chatbots were identified through a systematic search on Google Play Store, Apple App Store, Alexa Skills, and the internet. An evidence-based assessment tool was used to evaluate the features and content of the identified apps. The assessment was conducted through interrater agreement among 4 separate reviewers. Results Of the 505 initial chatbots identified, 6 were included in the review. The chatbots assessed varied significantly in terms of content and scope. Although the chatbots were generally found to be easy to use, some limitations were noted regarding their performance and programmed content for dialog. Conclusions Although chatbot technologies are well established and commonly used by the public, their development for people with dementia and their caregivers is in its infancy. Given the successful use of chatbots in other health care settings and for other applications, there are opportunities to integrate this technology into dementia care. However, more evidence-based chatbots that have undergone end user evaluation are needed to evaluate their potential to adequately educate and support these populations.",2021.0,29.0,16.0,"{'volume': '23', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ruggiano2021ChatbotsTS,\n author = {Nicole Ruggiano and E.

Accordingly, it is important that athletes are able to draw on a range of strategies to enhance emotional control. The present paper outlines a number of strategies based on Lazarus’ cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion. Strategies are outlined that aim to change cognitions, resulting in either a more appropriate emotional response or a suppression of the expression of emotion and any maladaptive behavioral consequences. These techniques comprise self-statement modification, imagery, socratic dialogue, corrective experiences, self-analysis, didactic approach, storytelling metaphors and poetry, reframing, cognitive paradox, and use of problem-solving skills. Furthermore, given the changes in physiological arousal accompanying certain emotions, it is also suggested that general arousal control strategies could play an important role in emotional control.",2003.0,72.0,230.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '471-486', 'name': 'Sport Psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jones2003ControllingEI,\n author = {Marc V Jones},\n journal = {Sport Psychologist},\n pages = {471-486},\n title = {Controlling Emotions in Sport},\n volume = {17},\n year = {2003}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2218415242', 'name': 'Marc V Jones'}]"

Fourteen children between three and six years of age from a kindergarten and a pre-school play group in Zurich, Switzerland, were visited once a week for eleven weeks with the live dog and subsequently for eleven weeks with AIBO. We investigated the children's spatial proximity toward AIBO and the live dog, and the rate of stroking and touching, the overall rate of interactions, and the rate of laughing in the presence of AIBO and the live dog. The children refused to participate in 18.2% of the sessions with the live dog and in 30.5% of the sessions with AIBO. Children who participated initiated approaches to AIBO significantly more often than to the live dog over the observation period. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the live dog and AIBO initiating the very first contact, even though the live dog approached the children 24 times in 126 sessions, while AIBO approached the children only ten times in 107 sessions. The children tended to interact more with AIBO than with the dog. For example, AIBO was touched more often than the dog and there was also less laughter with the dog than with AIBO, but these differences were not significant. In contrast, the dog was stroked significantly more often than AIBO. AIBO started to play ball 44 times whereas the dog only started to play once. That the dog did not often play with a ball, whereas AIBO did, may have played an important role because the children liked this characteristic. That children touched and interacted more with AIBO could be because dogs are widespread in their society and therefore sometimes taken for granted. Nevertheless, 10 out of 14 children said they preferred the dog, three said both, and only one preferred AIBO. Because of the small sample size, strong conclusions can not be drawn from this study, but it may open the door for further research on human–pet and human–robot social interactions.",2008.0,28.0,23.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '245 - 256', 'name': 'Anthrozoös'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Ribi2008ComparisonOC,\n author = {Filomena Nina Ribi and Akimitsu Yokoyama and D.

By middecade, the concept had attracted considerable popular attention, and powerful claims were made concerning its importance for predicting success. Emotional intelligence is the set of abilities that accounts for how people's emotional reports vary in their accuracy and how the more accurate understanding of emotion leads to better problem solving in an individual's emotional life. More formally, we define emotional intelligence as the ability to perceive and express emotion, assimilate emotion in thought, understand and reason with emotion, and regulate emotion in the self and others (Mayer & Salovey, 1997). As of now, the academic concept has been developed over several theoretical articles (e.g., Mayer & Salovey, 1997; Salovey & Mayer, 1990) and is based on a growing body of relevant research (e.g., Averill & Nunley, 1992; Buck, 1984; Lane, Sechrest, Reidel et al., 1996; Mayer, DiPaolo, & Salovey, 1990; Mayer & Geher, 1996; Mayer & Stevens, 1994; Rosenthal, Hall, DiMatteo, Rogers, & Archer, 1979; Salovey, Mayer, Goldman, Turvey, & Palfai, 1995; see also, Salovey & Sluyter, 1997). Shortly after the academic work began, a popular book on the subject appeared (Goleman, 1995a). The book covered much of the literature reviewed in the aforementioned articles as well as considerable additional research on emotions and the brain, emotions and social behavior, and school-based programs designed to help children develop emotional and social skills.",2000.0,0.0,1821.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '396-422', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mayer2000ModelsOE,\n author = {J.

A phase I-II study on localized RPS treated with high-dose ifosfamide and radiotherapy followed by surgery (ISG-STS 0303 protocol) demonstrated that chemo/radiotherapy was safe and increased the 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) with respect to historical controls. Of 70 patients, twenty-six developed local, 10 distant, and 5 combined relapse. Median disease-free interval (DFI) was 29.47 months. According to a discriminant function analysis, DFI, histology, relapse pattern, and the first treatment approach at relapse had a statistically significant prognostic impact. Based on scientific literature and clinical expertise, clinicopathological data were analyzed using both a supervised and an unsupervised classification method to predict the prognosis, with similar sample sizes (66 and 65, resp., in casewise approach and 70 in mean-substitution one). This is the first attempt to predict patients' prognosis by means of multivariate statistics, and in this light, it looks noticable that (i) some clinical data have a well-defined prognostic value, (ii) the unsupervised model produced comparable results with respect to the supervised one, and (iii) the appropriate combination of both models appears fruitful and easily extensible to different clinical contexts.",2018.0,24.0,15.0,"{'volume': '2018', 'name': 'BioMed Research International'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sanctis2018UnsupervisedVS,\n author = {R. de Sanctis and A.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.",1997.0,47.0,69685.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '1735-1780', 'name': 'Neural Computation'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hochreiter1997LongSM,\n author = {S.

Testing social support within models of mediation and moderation served this purpose. Surveys were submitted to three social work programs and solicited empirical data on academic stress; social support and two subsystems, family and friend support; and perceived resilience. The sample reported moderate levels of academic stress, social support, and resilience. Academic stress significantly (p < 0.05), negatively influenced social support and resilience. Social support systems exerted significant, positive influence with each other and with resilience. No social supports mediated the negative stress effect on resilience. Friend support moderated the academic stress–resilience relationship.

Emotion models and architectures are built to elucidate the mechanisms of emotions and enhance believability and effectiveness of synthetic agents and robots. Despite the many emotion models developed to date, a lack of consistency and clarity regarding what exactly it means to 'model emotions' persists. There are no systematic guidelines for development of computational models of emotions. This paper deconstructs the often vague term 'emotion modeling' by suggesting the view of emotion models in terms of two fundamental categories of processes: emotion generation and emotion effects. Computational tasks necessary to implement these processes are also identified. The paper addresses how computational building blocks provide a basis for the development of more systematic guidelines for affective model development. The paper concludes with a description of an affective requirements analysis and design process for developing affective computational models in agent architectures.",2011.0,92.0,131.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '26-79', 'name': 'Int.

In the work reported here, we believe that the emergence of empathy and counter-empathy is closely related to creatures' inertial impression on intragroup coexistence and competition. Based on this assumption, we establish a unified model of empathy and counter-empathy in light of Hebb's rule. We also present Adaptive Empathetic Learner (AEL), a training method for agents to enable affective utility evaluation and learning procedure in multi-agent system. In AEL, the empathy model is integrated into the adversarial bandit setting in order to achieve a high degree of versatility. Our algorithm is first verified in the survival game, which is designed to simulate the primitive hunting environment. In this game, empathy and cooperation emerge among agents with different power. In another test about Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma, cooperation was reached even between an AEL agent and a rational one. Moreover, when confronted with hostile, the AEL agent showed sufficient goodwill and vigilantly protected its safe payoffs. In the Ultimatum Game, it's worth mentioning that absolute fairness could be achieved on account of the self-adaptation of empathy and counter-empathy.",2019.0,34.0,6.0,{'pages': '746-753'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Chen2019ReachingCU,\n author = {Jize Chen and Changhong Wang},\n pages = {746-753},\n title = {Reaching Cooperation using Emerging Empathy and Counter-empathy},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '30812691', 'name': 'Jize Chen'}, {'authorId': '1924361746', 'name': 'Changhong Wang'}]"
589,2f6d1c235f08e3c6fcdf2962f3f18c0144dd47a1,An Examination of the Role of Emotional Intelligence in Work and Family Conflict,"Employers need to recognize the constant challenge many employees face in balancing work and family. Recruiting and retaining top workers is essential to the success of the organization; thus, it behooves employers to understand the variables associated with the effective management of the work-family conflict. One cannot pick up a newspaper or periodical or even turn on the news without being confronted with the issue of balancing work and family. For most, it is a constant struggle to attempt to balance the commitments of work and family life. Some researchers have suggested that work-family balance is an illusive goal and one that is unattainable (Caproni, 1997). The concern is that the more one is committed to work, the more one enjoys the associated benefits, both financial and non-financial, which encourage them to devote even more time and energy to work. Since neither one's time nor energy is limitless, by definition, then, such workers will find themselves far from the balance they originally sought with one of the roles invariably ending up on the losing end. As a result of an increasingly larger share of the workforce occupying many non-work roles in addition to that of paid worker, organizations need to understand the impact of multiple roles on workers' productivity. Attitudes, behaviors and emotions associated with one role may spill over to the other (Edwards and Rothbard, 2000). In fact, many employers fear that engagement in the family role is accomplished only to the detriment to the work role. The work-family literature frames this balance in seemingly diametrically opposed views, namely the depletion and enrichment arguments (Marks, 1977). The former is more deeply rooted in the literature and views these roles as conflicting (Friedman and Greenhaus, 2000). One's energy and time are limited, and, as such, the demand in each role depletes resources at the expense of the other. Yet those scholars that view the work-family research through the lens of the enrichment hypothesis suggest that it is the occupancy of multiple roles and the quality of those roles that yield beneficial effects on one's well-being (Barnett and Hyde, 2001). The benefits to individuals provide a net gain over the costs, leading to a positive emotional response and better well-being, In an effort to explain the competing views in the literature--the depletion or enrichment hypotheses--we propose that the question needs to be examined at the individual level. Specifically, we posit that Emotional Intelligence, a dispositional variable, interacts with work-family conflict to predict one's well-being. Consistent with research conducted by Noor (2003) that resulted in support for the effect of locus of control on the relationship between work-family conflict and well-being, this study expands the link to examine the effect of a broader dispositional measure. Noor (2003) sampled 310 married women with children who were employed full-time in Malaysia. She found that ""women with high control beliefs generally were more vulnerable to work-family conflict"" and that work-family conflict was positively related to symptoms of psychological distress--women's sense of general well-being"" (2003: 658). This study builds on past models of work and family stress that use individual differences as moderators of the effects of work and family experiences on well-being (e.g., Frone et al., 1997a; Greenhaus and Parasuraman, 1986; Higgins et al., 1992; Parasuraman et al., 1996). In addition, the present study answers the call of Greenhaus and Beutell for more research ""to determine the impact of specific personal characteristics on role attitude/behaviors that affect the arousal of work-family conflict"" (1985: 83), as well as Carlson's (1999) call for additional study of personality variables such as the ""Big Five"" to provide further insight into the underpinnings of work-family conflict. We posit that it is not necessarily a general all-encompassing trait that distinguishes the ""handlers"" from the ""non-handlers,"" but rather it is an individual trait which can cross gender, race, ethnicity, and age. …",2007.0,46.0,88.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '76', 'name': 'Journal of Managerial Issues'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lenaghan2007AnEO,\n author = {Janet A.

Results showed that the EAT stimulated participants to engage in a mutual modeling of emotions.

Using a naturalistic video-assisted approach, 30 interviews were conducted with 11 national table tennis players. Ten emotions were identified in the participants’ transcriptions: anger, anxiety, discouragement, disappointment, disgust, joy, serenity, relief, hope, and pride. Qualitative analyses of participants’ transcriptions revealed the emergence of 4 categories pertaining to emotion regulation: (a) regulation efforts comprising: (i) antecedent-focused regulation (e.g., attention deployment, cognitive change); (ii) response-focused regulation (e.g., behavioral regulation, physiological regulation); and (iii) social support; (b) automatic regulation; (c) no regulation; and (d) regulation effectiveness. Quantitative analyses of participants’ transcriptions revealed that: (a) attention deployment strategies emerged as the emotional regulation strategies the most used by participants; (b) some strategies were preferentially used to manage particular emotions during competition (e.g., physiological regulation strategies were essentially used to manage anxiety); (c) automaticity of emotion regulation was strongly associated with a high perceived effectiveness; (d) automatic strategies were associated with specific emotions such as joy, relief, or anger; (e) positive emotions were almost always managed well; (f) a large variability in the emotional regulation effectiveness of negative emotions appeared; disgust, discouragement, and anxiety being the emotions the least efficaciously regulated; and (g) athletes who rated selected emotional regulation strategies as effective really performed well and those who rated selected emotional regulation strategies as ineffective really failed to perform up to their potential.",2015.0,34.0,63.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '188', 'name': 'Sport, Exercise, and Performance Psychology'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Martinent2015AthletesRO,\n author = {G.

The aim of this study is to explore the particular features of cognitive-emotional coping and their impact on depression levels and suicidal ideation.
Methods: The study included a total number of 131 participants, 65 with a clinical diagnosis of depression and 66 controls. Instruments used were: Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21R), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), in order to assess the differences between depressive and non-depressive individuals in relation to coping strategies.
Results and conclusion: The findings, based on the statistical analysis of the scores obtained on the various psychometric scales, showed significant differences between depressive and non-depressive patients. Also, cognitive-emotional strategies could represent a good predictor to be used in the prevention of suicide risk in depressed patients.",2022.0,32.0,1.0,{'name': 'BRAIN.

While success in various jobs has been predicted by intelligence and in other studies by competencies, especially in management, long term impact of having intelligence and using competencies has not been examined. Even in collegiate outcome studies, few have examined the longer term impact on graduates' careers or lives. This study assesses the impact of demonstrated emotional, social, and cognitive intelligence competencies assessed at graduation and g measured through GMAT at entry from an MBA program on career and life satisfaction, and career success assessed 5 to 19 years after graduation. Using behavioral measures of competencies (i.e., as assessed by others), we found that emotional intelligence competencies predict career satisfaction and success. Adaptability had a positive impact, but influence had the opposite effect on these career measures and life satisfaction. Life satisfaction was negatively affected by achievement orientation and positively affected by teamwork. Current salary, length of marriage, and being younger at time of graduation positively affect all three measures of life and career satisfaction and career success. GMAT (as a measure of g) predicted life satisfaction and career success to a slight but significant degree in the final model analyzed.

In China, many constructors of RHINs have spontaneously and independently created governance measures, which may be valuable as a point of reference for other countries. This paper aimed to propose a big data governance framework for healthcare data based on the governance activities associated with the processing of RHINs in China. Typical methodology for RHIN case studies in China, including rich personal experience in nationwide consulting, literature review, expert consultation, and interpretative structural modeling methods, was adopted. Based on the analysis of ten typical RHIN case studies, healthcare big data governance practices in China were summarized. A framework with 3 domains and 12 elements was proposed, which include a drive domain (big data strategy planning, laws and regulations, open transaction, and industry support), capability domain (healthcare big data organization, collection, storage, process and analysis, and usage), and support domain (healthcare big data resource planning, standards system, and privacy and security protection). We obtained 12 guidelines for healthcare big data governance. A big data governance framework with 3 domains and 12 elements was presented based on Chinese practice, which might serve as valuable references for the cross-dimensional development of RHINs, provide overall guidance for the sustainable development of regional health informatization, and contribute to realizing the business value of healthcare big data.",2019.0,23.0,17.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '50330-50338', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2019AFF,\n author = {Quan Li and L.

An alternative possibility was investigated: that overt reasoning is preceded by a nonconscious biasing step that uses neural systems other than those that support declarative knowledge. Normal participants and patients with prefrontal damage and decision-making defects performed a gambling task in which behavioral, psychophysiological, and self-account measures were obtained in parallel. Normals began to choose advantageously before they realized which strategy worked best, whereas prefrontal patients continued to choose disadvantageously even after they knew the correct strategy. Moreover, normals began to generate anticipatory skin conductance responses (SCRs) whenever they pondered a choice that turned out to be risky, before they knew explicitly that it was a risky choice, whereas patients never developed anticipatory SCRs, although some eventually realized which choices were risky. The results suggest that, in normal individuals, nonconscious biases guide behavior before conscious knowledge does. Without the help of such biases, overt knowledge may be insufficient to ensure advantageous behavior.",1997.0,13.0,3321.0,"{'volume': '275', 'pages': '1293 - 1295', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bechara1997DecidingAB,\n author = {A.

This design may exacerbate agency conflicts inherent in corporate finance. As a consequence, signals of entrepreneurial quality such as CEO loyalty, which is an established concept in social psychology and can easily be linked to potential agency conflicts in corporate settings, might be a first-order determinant of economic outcomes in the ICO market. Consistent with this, I find that loyal CEOs have to offer lower financial incentives to attract investors and are still able to raise more proceeds, conduct ICOs more thoroughly, and are less likely to fail.

Moreover, the WPP can also sign bilateral contracts with customers to supply their required energy. In the subproblem, the system operator tends to minimize the sum of the total generation costs minus the sum of the total demand benefits. The effect of bilateral contracts on the strategic offering of WPP in the DA market and its impact on the transmission margin are also investigated. Results on real cases show that when the WPP enters into a bilateral contract, it should consider the effect of such contracts on the offering strategy to the DA market. The effects of bilateral contracts on the regulating market are also examined.",2022.0,31.0,7.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '4331-4341', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rashidizadeh-Kermani2022EvaluatingTI,\n author = {Homa Rashidizadeh-Kermani and Mostafa Vahedipour-Dahraie and M.

China has been remarkably successful in designing industrial policies, joint venture requirements, and technology transfer pressures to use FDI to create indigenous national champions in a handful of prominent sectors: high speed rail transport, information technology, auto assembly, and an emerging civil aviation sector. But what is striking in the aggregate data is how relatively thin the layer of horizontal and vertical spillovers from foreign manufacturing multinationals to indigenous Chinese firms has proven to be. Despite the large size of manufacturing FDI inflows, the impact of multinational corporate investment in China has been largely confined to building plants that incorporate capital, technology, and managerial expertise controlled by the foreigner. As the skill-intensity of exports increases, the percentage of the value of the final product that derives from imported components rises sharply. China has remained a low value-added assembler of more sophisticated inputs imported from abroad--a “workbench” economy. Where do the gains from FDI in China end up? While manufacturing MNCs may build plants in China, the largest impact from deployment of worldwide earnings is to bolster production, employment, R&D, and local purchases in their home markets. For the United States the most recent data show that US-headquartered MNCs have 70 percent of their operations, make 89 percent of their purchases, spend 87 percent of their R&D dollars, and locate more than half of their workforce within the US economy--this is where most of the earnings from FDI in China are delivered.",2011.0,42.0,19.0,{'name': 'Emerging Markets Economics: Industrial Policy & Regulation eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Moran2011ForeignMM,\n author = {T.

622,32082cf5c8f8d18450d154167acea8b18d951523,An experimental investigation of thought suppression and anxiety in children.,"OBJECTIVES
This study aimed to explore the effects of thought suppression in children--in particular, whether trying to suppress a thought leads to an immediate and/or delayed increase in its occurrence. The influence of anxiety on children's performance in the experimental paradigm was also examined.


DESIGN
Participants were allocated to conditions in a between-groups experimental design devised on the basis of thought suppression methodologies reported in the adult literature.


METHODS
One-hundred and twelve participants were recruited from local primary schools and randomly allocated to four experimental conditions. Children in all conditions monitored the occurrence of a target thought (either neutral or anxiety-provoking) by tapping their hand on a table each time the thought came to mind during two consecutive experimental periods. During the first period, half the children were asked not to think about the target thought, while the remaining half were asked to think about anything. During the second period, all children were instructed to think about anything.


RESULTS
No evidence was found for either an immediate or a delayed increase in frequency of target thoughts as a consequence of suppression attempts. State and trait anxiety were, however, found to influence children's performance during these experimental tasks and were associated with increased intrusions under certain conditions.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study suggest that the experimental thought suppression paradigm is workable with 7-11-year-old children. The methodological, theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",2001.0,0.0,27.0,"{'volume': '40 Pt 1', 'pages': '\n          45-56\n        ', 'name': 'The British journal of clinical psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gaskell2001AnEI,\n author = {Sarah L.

In five experiments, we explore how these metaphors influence the way that we reason about complex issues and forage for further information about them. We find that even the subtlest instantiation of a metaphor (via a single word) can have a powerful influence over how people attempt to solve social problems like crime and how they gather information to make “well-informed” decisions. Interestingly, we find that the influence of the metaphorical framing effect is covert: people do not recognize metaphors as influential in their decisions; instead they point to more “substantive” (often numerical) information as the motivation for their problem-solving decision. Metaphors in language appear to instantiate frame-consistent knowledge structures and invite structurally consistent inferences. Far from being mere rhetorical flourishes, metaphors have profound influences on how we conceptualize and act with respect to important societal issues. We find that exposure to even a single metaphor can induce substantial differences in opinion about how to solve social problems: differences that are larger, for example, than pre-existing differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans.",2011.0,49.0,767.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Thibodeau2011MetaphorsWT,\n author = {P.

Without calibration, user performance can degrade (e.g., if an input device is not adjusted for the user's abilities), errors can increase (e.g., if color spaces are not matched), and some interactions may not be possible (e.g., use of an eye tracker). The value of calibration is often lost, however, because many calibration processes are tedious and unenjoyable, and many users avoid them altogether. To address this problem, we propose calibration games that gather calibration data in an engaging and entertaining manner. To facilitate the creation of calibration games, we present design guidelines that map common types of calibration to core tasks, and then to well-known game mechanics. To evaluate the approach, we developed three calibration games and compared them to standard procedures. Users found the game versions significantly more enjoyable than regular calibration procedures, without compromising the quality of the data. Calibration games are a novel way to motivate users to carry out calibrations, thereby improving the performance and accuracy of many human-computer systems.",2011.0,24.0,258.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 24th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Flatla2011CalibrationGM,\n author = {David R.

627,3231eb72791766c5c9e86a180c00f918984e5f90,Speed of speech and persuasion.,"The relationship between speaking rate and attitude change was investigated in two field experiments. Manipulations of speech rate were crossed with (a) credibility of the speaker and (b) complexity of the spoken message. The results suggest that speech rate functions as a general cue that augments credibility; rapid speech enhances persuasion. No support was obtained for information-processing interpretations of the effects of a fast speaking rate. The increased persuasion produced by fast speech could not be attributed to disruption of effective counterarguing. These findings emphasize the importance of perceptual and evaluative factors in the persuasion process at the expense of a more rationalistic information-processing view of how man responds when confronted with an influence attempt. Although many of the persuasive communications received during daily life are orally presented, the characteristics of speech that affect persuasion are rarely studied. Moreover, studies that do examine delivery style typically treat it as a global variable. For instance, Dietrich (1946) studied the dynamism of a speaker's style, Bettinghaus (1961) assessed the effects of overall speaking effectiveness by comparing trained and uncoached students, and Bowers (1965) examined the effects of extroverted and introverted deliv^ ery using dramatic arts students to simulate style. The persuasive effects of more discrete characteristics of oral delivery, such as intensity, pitch, speed of presentation, or specific emotional qualities apparently more rarely elicit attention. Several considerations suggest that speech rate might be an important variable.

However, the facial thermal response to emotions still needs to be investigated within the framework of the dimensional approach to emotions. The main aim of this study was to assess how the facial thermal variations index the emotional arousal and valence dimensions of visual stimuli. Twenty-four participants were presented with three groups of standardized emotional pictures (unpleasant, neutral and pleasant) from the International Affective Picture System. Facial temperature was recorded at the nose tip, an important region of interest for facial thermal variations, and compared to electrodermal responses, a robust index of emotional arousal. Both types of responses were also compared to subjective ratings of pictures. An emotional arousal effect was found on the amplitude and latency of thermal responses and on the amplitude and frequency of electrodermal responses. The participants showed greater thermal and dermal responses to emotional than to neutral pictures with no difference between pleasant and unpleasant ones. Thermal responses correlated and the dermal ones tended to correlate with subjective ratings. Finally, in the emotional conditions compared to the neutral one, the frequency of simultaneous thermal and dermal responses increased while both thermal or dermal isolated responses decreased. Overall, this study brings convergent arguments to consider fITI as a promising method reflecting the arousal dimension of emotional stimulation and, consequently, as a credible alternative to the classical recording of electrodermal activity.

Depression—also called “clinical depression” or a “depressive disorder”—is a mood disorder that adversely impacts how an individual feels, thinks, and handles daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. To be diagnosed with depression, symptoms must be present most of the time, nearly every day for at least minimum of 2 to 3 weeks. Feeling sad or having low emotional energy may be common among people. For most, however, these feelings are transitory and can be managed by changing daily life routines. But for some, prolonged mood disorders can lead to depression and foster suicidal tendencies. Suicide is a major public health concern. Over 47,000 people died by suicide in the United States in 2017. It is the 10th leading cause of death overall according to NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health). Suicide is complicated and tragic, but it is often preventable. Identifying the warning signs for suicide and how to get help can be a major mitigating factor.

The Trait Meta Mood Scale (TMMS), based on the EI ability model, has been shown to have predictive capacity for subjective well‐being through its three factors (attention, clarity, and emotional repair), but little is known about the mediating role played by these dimensions, both among themselves and in relation to other variables. The aim of the present study was to analyse the direct and indirect relationships between the TMMS factors and subjective well‐being dimensions, using structural equation modelling, also including self‐efficacy in the model as a mediator of these relationships. Attention was found to have a negative effect on subjective well‐being, which was inhibited when clarity and repair were included as mediators. Self‐efficacy played a major role since it increased the positive effect of clarity and repair on subjective well‐being. This study provides evidence of the advantage of using the TMMS factors separately and of studying their mediational role in order to better understand the processes underlying the manner in which TEI influences subjective well‐being.",2015.0,46.0,40.0,"{'volume': '67', 'pages': '47 - 54', 'name': 'Australian Journal of Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vergara2015BeWD,\n author = {A.

Previous research suggests that empathically aroused individuals help those in need, even when physical escape from the need situation is easy, and this evidence has been used to support the claim that empathy evokes an altruistic motive. However, existing research has not addressed the possibility that empathically aroused participants help because ease of physical escape fails to provide adequate psychological escape from awareness of the victim's suffering and the aversive empathic arousal such awareness produces. The two experiments reported here examined this issue by directly manipulating empathic arousal and the perceived ease of psychological escape among potential helpers. In both experiments, higher rates of helping were observed among empathically aroused participants, even under conditions of easy psychological escape. The findings of both experiments suggest that empathy evokes an altruistic motive to reduce the victim's suffering rather than an egoistic aversive-arousal reduction motive. In addition, the results of Experiment 1 suggest that concern for psychological escape from the suffering of others may constitute an important independent prosocial motive in need of future study.

However, reciprocity is just one way of getting a return on an investment in altruism and is difficult to apply to many examples. Reciprocity theory addresses how animals respond dynamically to others so as to cooperate without being exploited. I discuss how introducing differences in individual generosity together with partner choice into models of reciprocity can lead to an escalation in altruistic behaviour. Individuals may compete for the most altruistic partners and non–altruists may become ostracized. I refer to this phenomenon as competitive altruism and propose that it can represent a move away from the dynamic responsiveness of reciprocity. Altruism may be rewarded in kind, but rewards may be indirectly accrued or may not involve the return of altruism at all, for example if altruists tend to be chosen as mates. This variety makes the idea of competitive altruism relevant to behaviours which cannot be explained by reciprocity. I consider whether altruism might act as a signal of quality, as proposed by the handicap principle. I suggest that altruistic acts could make particularly effective signals because of the inherent benefits to receivers. I consider how reciprocity and competitive altruism are related and how they may be distinguished.",1998.0,28.0,494.0,"{'volume': '265', 'pages': '427 - 431', 'name': 'Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

We review the aspects of the response styles theory that have been well-supported, including evidence that rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of experimental studies show positive distractions relieve depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression, including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm. We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation strategies. Finally, we highlight recent research on the distinction between rumination and more adaptive forms of self-reflection, on basic cognitive deficits or biases in rumination, on its neural and genetic correlates, and on possible interventions to combat rumination.",2008.0,235.0,3395.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '400 - 424', 'name': 'Perspectives on Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nolen-Hoeksema2008RethinkingR,\n author = {S.

Although treatments already exist, they each have their own issues. Neurofeedback is a neuromodulation technique that specifically targets abnormal brain activity and is gaining attention as a possible insomnia treatment. AIM To review the latest studies pertaining to the use of neurofeedback in the treatment of insomnia. METHODS In this non-systematic review, only experimental studies assessing the effects of neurofeedback on patients with insomnia were targeted across four bibliographic databases. RESULTS A total of 12 studies were retained. All neurofeedback studies included in this study showed a clear improvement of subjective sleep. However, data concerning objective improvement are contradictory. Most studies regarding surface and z-score neurofeedback show that neurofeedback targeting the sensorimotor rhythm in the sensorimotor cortex may help improve subjective sleep. A placebo effect seems also to be present in some studies. Several limitations were present in each study. CONCLUSION While studies concerning neurofeedback as a treatment for insomnia are encouraging, many methodological barriers remain to be resolved to prove its efficacy unequivocally. More studies using robust design parameters, as well as the replication of existing studies, are necessary to support neurofeedback as an effective treatment for insomnia.",2021.0,72.0,3.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '897 - 914', 'name': 'World Journal of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lambert-Beaudet2021NeurofeedbackFI,\n author = {Florence Lambert-Beaudet and William-Girard Journault and Alexandre Rudziavic Provençal and C.

668,36d51e1cdbd0d65e165a2b1cd49ff3f26d35438f,Identifying highly influential nodes in the complicated grief network.,"The network approach to psychopathology conceptualizes mental disorders as networks of mutually reinforcing nodes (i.e., symptoms). Researchers adopting this approach have suggested that network topology can be used to identify influential nodes, with nodes central to the network having the greatest influence on the development and maintenance of the disorder. However, because commonly used centrality indices do not distinguish between positive and negative edges, they may not adequately assess the nature and strength of a node's influence within the network. To address this limitation, we developed 2 indices of a node's expected influence (EI) that account for the presence of negative edges. To evaluate centrality and EI indices, we simulated single-node interventions on randomly generated networks. In networks with exclusively positive edges, centrality and EI were both strongly associated with observed node influence. In networks with negative edges, EI was more strongly associated with observed influence than was centrality. We then used data from a longitudinal study of bereavement to examine the association between (a) a node's centrality and EI in the complicated grief (CG) network and (b) the strength of association between change in that node and change in the remainder of the CG network from 6- to 18-months postloss. Centrality and EI were both correlated with the strength of the association between node change and network change. Together, these findings suggest high-EI nodes, such as emotional pain and feelings of emptiness, may be especially important to the etiology and treatment of CG.

The work is motivated by the aim to provide technology with competences in perceiving and producing the emotional and nonverbal behaviors required to sustain a conversational dialogue. We present the Sensitive Artificial Listener (SAL) scenario as a setting which seems particularly suited for the study of emotional and nonverbal behavior since it requires only very limited verbal understanding on the part of the machine. This scenario allows us to concentrate on nonverbal capabilities without having to address at the same time the challenges of spoken language understanding, task modeling, etc. We first report on three prototype versions of the SAL scenario in which the behavior of the Sensitive Artificial Listener characters was determined by a human operator. These prototypes served the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of the SAL scenario and allowed us to collect data required for building system components for analyzing and synthesizing the respective behaviors. We then describe the fully autonomous integrated real-time system we created, which combines incremental analysis of user behavior, dialogue management, and synthesis of speaker and listener behavior of a SAL character displayed as a virtual agent. We discuss principles that should underlie the evaluation of SAL-type systems. Since the system is designed for modularity and reuse and since it is publicly available, the SAL system has potential as a joint research tool in the affective computing research community.",2012.0,143.0,203.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '165-183', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schröder2012BuildingAS,\n author = {M.

We used a daily diary methodology with multilevel modelling data analyses (n = 187) to examine the influence of three emotion regulation strategies (mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression) on the experience of daily negative and positive affect. Our results suggested that daily mindfulness was associated with lower negative and higher positive affect whereas the converse pattern was found for daily emotion suppression; cognitive reappraisal was related to daily positive, but not negative affect. When daily mindfulness, suppression and reappraisal were included in the same models, these strategies predicted unique variance in emotional well-being. Random slope analyses revealed substantial variability in the utility of these strategies. Indeed the presumably “adaptive” cognitive reappraisal strategy seemed to confer no benefit to the regulation of negative affect in approximately half the sample. Additional analyses revealed that age moderates the effect of cognitive reappraisal on daily negative affect: Higher use of reappraisal was associated with more negative affect for adolescents (aged 17 to 19) but became associated with less negative affect with increasing age. We interpret these results in line with a contextual view of emotion regulation where no strategy is inherently “good” or “bad”.",2017.0,41.0,231.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '113 - 91', 'name': 'Cognitive Behaviour Therapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brockman2017EmotionRS,\n author = {R.

A Meta-Analytic Investigation Based on Upper Echelons Theory,"What roles do CEOs play in firm performance? To address this question, the management field has accumulated a substantial amount of research over the past three decades built on upper echelons theory (UET), which posits that CEO characteristics manifest in firm strategic actions and, in this way, future firm performance. Hence, there is a need to systematically amass and take stock of prior empirical findings for UET testing and development. We use meta-analytic techniques to synthesize prior UET research on the relationships among commonly studied CEO characteristics, firm strategic actions, and future firm performance. Based on 308 studies, metaanalytic results generally support UET’s predictions with a few exceptions: CEO characteristics (i.e., tenure, formal education, prior career experience, and positive self-concept) are significantly associated with firm strategic actions, which in turn are significantly related to future firm performance. Moreover, CEO characteristics (i.e., age, tenure, formal education, and prior career experience) are positively related to future firm performance. In addition, finegrained analyses have revealed interesting and important relationships between specific measures of CEO characteristics (e.g., CEO prior task experience) and firm outcomes (e.g., firm strategic actions that match with CEO prior task experience).

The different picture preparing steps required for disease location from biopsy pictures incorporate procurement, upgrade, and division; include extraction, picture portrayal, characterization, and basic leadership. In this paper, MLBPNN is analyzed with the help of infra-red sensor imaging technology. Then, the computational multifaceted nature of neural distinguishing proof incredibly diminished when the entire framework is deteriorated into a few subsystems. The features are extracted using fractal dimension algorithm and then the most significant features are selected using multi fractal detection technique to reduce the complexity. This imaging sensor is integrated via wireless infrared imaging sensor which is produced to transmit the tumor warm data to a specialist clinician to screen the wellbeing condition and for helpful control of ultrasound measurements level, especially if there should arise an occurrence of elderly patients living in remote zones.",2019.0,29.0,167.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '5577-5588', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shakeel2019NeuralNB,\n author = {P.

This article extends almost three and a half decades of emotional labor research into the study of entrepreneurship by proposing an Affective Entrepreneurial Events Model. Building on organizational behavior research and recent, relevant entrepreneurship models, this conceptual model establishes four areas of understanding. First, we propose a method by which affect influences the entrepreneurial processes. Second, we demonstrate how what we already know from emotional labor research can affect the outcomes for entrepreneurs and their stakeholders. Third, we discuss how the entrepreneur’s performance of emotional labor shapes the entrepreneurial environment. And last, we use the extreme emotional conditions provided by the entrepreneur’s environment to further understand the concepts associated with emotional labor.",2013.0,72.0,32.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '331 - 366'}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Burch2013EmotionalLF,\n author = {Gerald F.

These two approaches have been developed in parallel and have not been reconciled or integrated. This paper develops an integrated research model that distinguishes beliefs and attitudes about the system (i.e., object-based beliefs and attitudes) from beliefs and attitudes about using the system (i.e., behavioral beliefs and attitudes) to build the theoretical logic that links the user satisfaction and technology acceptance literature. The model is then tested using a sample of 465 users from seven different organizations who completed a survey regarding their use of data warehousing software. The proposed model was supported, providing preliminary evidence that the two perspectives can and should be integrated. The integrated model helps build the bridge from design and implementation decisions to system characteristics (a core strength of the user satisfaction literature) to the prediction of usage (a core strength of the technology acceptance literature).",2005.0,84.0,2731.0,"{'volume': '16', 'pages': '85-102', 'name': 'Inf.

Levels of robot autonomy (LORA), ranging from teleoperation to fully autonomous systems, influence the way in which humans and robots interact with one another. Thus, there is a need to understand HRI by identifying variables that influence---and are influenced by---robot autonomy. Our overarching goal is to develop a framework for LORA in HRI. To reach this goal, our framework draws links between HRI and human-automation interaction, a field with a long history of studying and understanding human-related variables. The construct of autonomy is reviewed and redefined within the context of HRI. Additionally, this framework proposes a process for determining a robot's autonomy level by categorizing autonomy along a 10-point taxonomy. The framework is intended to be treated as a guideline for determining autonomy, categorizing the LORA along a qualitative taxonomy and considering HRI variables (e.g., acceptance, situation awareness, reliability) that may be influenced by the LORA.",2014.0,93.0,373.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '74 - 99', 'name': 'Journal of Human-Robot Interaction'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Beer2014TowardAF,\n author = {Jenay M.

Experimental work aims to verify the effectiveness of pedagogical conditions, which assure the process of developing healthcare competency in future teachers. The research is based on a hypothesis that healthcare competency of future teachers can be successfully developed under the following pedagogical conditions: enhancing future teachers’ motivation; creating learning space; designing the content of training based on interdisciplinarity; accomplishing pedagogical tasks with healthcare content; organizing students’ extracurricular activities based on their diversification; implementing healthcare self-development during professional training. The first experimental group (EG 1) comprised 95 respondents, the second experimental group (ЕG 2) – 99 respondents, the third experimental group (ЕG 3) – 97 respondents; the first control group (CG 1) – 101 respondents, the second control group (CG 2) – 105 respondents. Results. The high level of healthcare competency formation in EG 1 (33,68%) exceeds similar figures in CG 1 (20,79%) by 12,89%. In EG 2, this difference in comparison with CG 2 amounts to 20,17%. In CG 1 and CG 2, there were many respondents at critical and low levels –46.53% and 53.33% respectively.

698,38a9f63f23f33084ddeb08006fb118fe751480fe,ALMA: a layered model of affect,"In this paper we introduce ALMA - A Layered Model of Affect. It integrates three major affective characteristics: emotions, moods and personality that cover short, medium, and long term affect. The use of this model consists of two phases: In the preparation phase appraisal rules and personality profiles for characters must be specified with the help of AffectML - our XML based affect modeling language. In the runtime phase, the specified appraisal rules are used to compute real-time emotions and moods as results of a subjective appraisal of relevant input. The computed affective characteristics are represented in AffectML and can be processed by sub-sequent modules that control the cognitive processes and physical behavior of embodied conversational characters. ALMA is part of the VirtualHuman project which develops interactive virtual characters that serve as dialog partners with human-like conversational skills. ALMA provides our virtual humans with a personality profile and with real-time emotions and moods. These are used by the multimodal behavior generation module to enrich the lifelike and believable qualities.",2005.0,31.0,454.0,{'pages': '29-36'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Gebhard2005ALMAAL,\n author = {Patrick Gebhard},\n pages = {29-36},\n title = {ALMA: a layered model of affect},\n year = {2005}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '48785659', 'name': 'Patrick Gebhard'}]"

Further, organizational scholars and practitioners frequently appear to assume that emotionality is the antithesis of rationality and, thus, frequently hold a pejorative view of emotion. This has led to four institutionalized mechanisms for regulating the experience and expression of emotion in the workplace: (1) neutralizing, (2) buffering, (3) prescribing, and (4) normalizing emotion. In contrast to this perspective, we argue that emotionality and rationality are interpenetrated, emotions are an integral and inseparable part of organizational life, and emotions are often functional for the organization. This argument is illustrated by applications to motivation, leadership, and group dynamics.",1995.0,109.0,1380.0,"{'volume': '48', 'pages': '125 - 97', 'name': 'Human Relations'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ashforth1995EmotionIT,\n author = {Blake E.

Detection can be achieved by measuring multimodal signals, namely, speech, facial expressions and/or psychobiology. Over the past years, one major approach was to identify the best features for each signal using different classification methods. Although this is of high priority, other subject-specific variables should not be neglected. In our study, we analyzed the effect of gender, age, personality and gender roles on the extracted psychobiological features (derived from skin conductance level, facial electromyography and heart rate variability) as well as the influence on the classification results. In an experimental human-computer interaction, five different affective states with picture material from the International Affective Picture System and ULM pictures were induced. A total of 127 subjects participated in the study. Among all potentially influencing variables (gender has been reported to be influential), age was the only variable that correlated significantly with psychobiological responses. In summary, the conducted classification processes resulted in 20% classification accuracy differences according to age and gender, especially when comparing the neutral condition with four other affective states. We suggest taking age and gender specifically into account for future studies in affective computing, as these may lead to an improvement of emotion recognition accuracy.",2016.0,69.0,44.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rukavina2016AffectiveCA,\n author = {Stefanie Rukavina and Sascha Gruss and H.

704,3920fbfbfe415445e23d594cebf9d75e484a9770,"The Stakes of Law , or Hale and Foucault !","I started law school in 1967 with a sense that the “system” had a lot of injustice in it, meaning that the distribution of wealth and income and power and access to knowledge seemed unfairly skewed along class and race lines. I thought law was important in the skewing process and in efforts to make distribution fairer, but I had no clear idea how or why. This essay describes what I think I have found out in the intervening years about this elemental question. In the 1920s and 1930s, the legal realist institutional economists, and most particularly Robert Hale, worked out an analysis of the role of law in the distribution of income between social classes that retains its power today. The basic idea is that the rules of property, contract, and tort law (along with the criminal law rules that reinforce them in some cases) are “rules of the game of economic struggle.” As such, they differentially and asymmetrically empower groups bargaining over the fruits of cooperation in production. In the 1970s, Michel Foucault and his collaborators developed an analysis of “power/knowledge” that has much in common with that of the realists. Foucault gives law an important place in his general social theory, but his version of law is, unfortunately, prerealist. At the same time Foucault offers an indispensable antidote to the premodern understanding of the “individual” or the “subject” that infuses realist thinking about the concept. This essay is more a rude appropriation of text-fragments of Hale and Foucault than a study of their thought. The motive of the appropriation is to get help in developing a method for analyzing the role of law in the reproduction of social injustice in late capitalist societies. The method would be a pastiche of positive insights from the pragmatist/legal realist/institutional economics school and from postmodernism and poststructuralism. The pastiche would make up in practical usefulness, for example, in the study of class, race, and gender aspects of low-income housing markets, what it lacks in purity of origin. But in this essay I do no more than begin to explore compatibilities and incompatibilities of the two schools. The focus here doesn’t mean that I think the only important thing about law is its distributive effect. Legal rules function to distribute, but they also “resolve disputes” in ways that people find more or less fair or just",2004.0,15.0,53.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kennedy2004TheSO,\n author = {D.

A main feature of the proposed model of rational component concerns its interaction between rationality, personality and emotions, mainly in the goal selection and action selection processes and in the rational state evolution. Such evolution takes place in two ways: implicitly, the behavior of the rational component changes according to the current emotional state; explicitly, the emotional knowledge is encoded as facts in the working memory of a production system. The paper describes each component of the rational module, its mechanisms, its inputs and its outputs and how the interactions with emotions and personality are realized. Our research aims are directed toward applications of emotional agents to multimodal environments, with particular interest in intelligent interaction and communication by means of music, dance, movements of robots, visual media and in general applications where non-verbal communication mechanisms are the main communication channels between human and machines.

How do we come to feel a sense of enthusiasm? What fills us with lust, anger, fear, or tenderness? Traditional behavioral and cognitive neuroscience have yet to provide satisfactory answers. The Archaeology of Mind presents an affective neuroscience approach-which takes into consideration basic mental processes, brain functions, and emotional behaviors that all mammals share-to locate the neural mechanisms of emotional expression. It reveals-for the first time-the deep neural sources of our values and basic emotional feelings. This book elaborates on the seven emotional systems that explain how we live and behave. These systems originate in deep areas of the brain that are remarkably similar across all mammalian species. When they are disrupted, we find the origins of emotional disorders: - SEEKING: how the brain generates a euphoric and expectant response - FEAR: how the brain responds to the threat of physical danger and death - RAGE: sources of irritation and fury in the brain - LUST: how sexual desire and attachments are elaborated in the brain - CARE: sources of maternal nurturance - GRIEF: sources of non-sexual attachments - PLAY: how the brain generates joyous, rough-and-tumble interactions - SELF: a hypothesis explaining how affects might be elaborated in the brain The book offers an evidence-based evolutionary taxonomy of emotions and affects and, as such, a brand-new clinical paradigm for treating psychiatric disorders in clinical practice.",2012.0,0.0,672.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Panksepp2012TheAO,\n author = {J.

The empirical findings reveal that: (a) overall tourism destination is reflected by both cognitive image and affective image, and (b) overall tourism destination image has an indirect impact on behavioral intentions through satisfaction.

Goals are encoded as reward functions, expressing the desirability of each world state; the planner must find a policy (mapping from states to actions) that maximizes future rewards. Standard goals of achievement, as well as goals of maintenance and prioritized combinations of goals, can be specified in this way. An optimal policy can be found using existing methods, but these methods are at best polynomial in the number of states in the domain, where the number of states is exponential in the number of propositions (or state variables). By using information about the starting state, the reward function, and the transition probabilities of the domain, we can restrict the planner's attention to a set of world states that are likely to be encountered in satisfying the goal. Furthermore, the planner can generate more or less complete plans depending on the time it has available. We describe experiments involving a mobile robotics application and consider the problem of schedulilng different phases of the planning algorithm given time constraints.",1993.0,13.0,244.0,{'pages': '574-579'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Dean1993PlanningWD,\n author = {T.

This raises several contentious issues regarding children’s rights and freedoms. This article evaluates the impact of EAI on children’s rights, focusing on freedom of thought (FoT), non-discrimination, privacy, and data protection. These rights are evaluated in turn before focusing on the fairness principle in Article 5(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an ‘underutilized’ principle that lies at the heart of the United Kingdom (UK) Age-Appropriate Design Code’s standard: best interests of the child. We argue that the use of EAI in education contexts contradicts the fairness principle and that EAI represents a potentially serious threat to children’s rights to FoT, non-discrimination, privacy, and data protection and is an issue which requires urgent attention from policymakers and regulators in the UK.

The analysis with Python technology, including optimized artificial intelligence technology, is designed on the basis of symmetry principles. Destination image perception as a branch of destination image research is of great significance to tourists’ decision-making and destination image building. Ice-snow tourism is a hot topic nowadays, and research on perceptions of images of ice-snow tourism has become a focus. In this paper, python programming was used to crawl online travel journals and reviews about Jilin province’s ice-snow tourism on the Internet to analyze the frequency of frequently used words, their classification, word cloud and co-occurrence network, and other aspects of image perception, and proceed to the emotional perception of and emotional attitude to the emotional images and an overall image analysis. The study found that: (1) Perceptions of images of ice-snow tourism can be divided into five categories: tourism attractions, tourism activities, tourism facilities, tourism features and the tourism service environment. The frequency of tourism attractions is the highest, followed by tourism facilities and the tourism service environment. “Changbai Mountain” and “rime” are the core words, that is, tourists are most impressed by the scenic spot and landscape of “Changbai Mountain and rime.” (2) Positive emotional expressions accounted for 67.23% of perceptions of images of ice-snow tourism. Tourists gave a positive evaluation for Changbai Mountain, the snow landscape of Tianchi and skiing facilities. Meanwhile, passive emotional expressions accounted for 21.07% and tourists gave passive evaluations for travel, transportation, accommodation and catering. (3) Tourists spoke highly of overall images of ice-snow tourism in Jilin Province but few were willing to revisit. In the conclusion, strategies are put forward to improve image perceptions of ice-snow tourism and promote the sustainable development of ice and snow tourism.",2020.0,76.0,9.0,"{'name': 'Symmetry', 'pages': '606', 'volume': '12'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sun2020SymmetryAI,\n author = {Guoxia Sun},\n booktitle = {Symmetry},\n journal = {Symmetry},\n pages = {606},\n title = {Symmetry Analysis in Analyzing Cognitive and Emotional Attitudes for Tourism Consumers by Applying Artificial Intelligence Python Technology},\n volume = {12},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '32180547', 'name': 'Guoxia Sun'}]"

Building on prior measurement work demonstrating the psychometric properties of an adaptability construct, the present study investigates dispositional predictors (personality, implicit theories) of adaptability, and the role of adaptability in predicting academic (motivation, engagement, disengagement) and non-academic (self-esteem, life satisfaction, sense of meaning and purpose, emotional instability) outcomes. This longitudinal study (2 time points, 1 year apart), involving 969 adolescents from 9 high schools, found that personality (conscientiousness and agreeableness—positively; neuroticism—negatively) and implicit theories (effort-related beliefs about intelligence—positively) significantly predicted adaptability (beyond the effects of socio-demographics and prior achievement). Further, adaptability significantly predicted academic (class participation, school enjoyment, and positive academic intentions—positively; self-handicapping and disengagement—negatively) and non-academic (self-esteem, life satisfaction, and sense of meaning and purpose—positively) outcomes beyond the effects of socio-demographic factors, prior achievement, personality, implicit theories, and 2 cognate correlates (buoyancy and self-regulation).

Future studies will benefit from databases with emotion-inducing stimuli in which characteristics of the stimuli potentially influencing results can be controlled. This study presents Portuguese normative data for the identification of seven facial expressions of emotions (plus a neutral face), on the Radboud Faces Database (RaFD). The effect of participants’ gender and models’ sex on emotion recognition was also examined. Participants (N = 1249) were exposed to 312 pictures of white adults displaying emotional and neutral faces with a frontal gaze. Recognition agreement between the displayed and participants’ chosen expressions ranged from 69% (for anger) to 97% (for happiness). Recognition levels were significantly higher among women than among men only for anger and contempt. The emotion recognition was higher either in female models or in male models depending on the emotion. Overall, the results show high recognition levels of the facial expressions presented, indicating that the RaFD provides adequate stimuli for studies examining the recognition of facial expressions of emotion among college students.

As part of testing a MAC (Memory superset of Affect superset of Cognition) model of the intermediate effects of advertising, four hypotheses were developed: ads with higher affective content would have higher recognition and recall, and subjects treated with beta-blockers (Propranolol), which interact with those brain regions known to mediate affect, would have lower recognition and recall than those treated with placebos. The hypotheses are tested and broadly supported. This exploratory research, taken in conjunction with previous work, indicates some ways in which affect enhances advertising effectiveness.

Using Satirical Cues to Detect Potentially Misleading News,"Satire is an attractive subject in deception detection research: it is a type of deception that intentionally incorporates cues revealing its own deceptiveness. Whereas other types of fabrications aim to instill a false sense of truth in the reader, a successful satirical hoax must eventually be exposed as a jest. This paper provides a conceptual overview of satire and humor, elaborating and illustrating the unique features of satirical news, which mimics the format and style of journalistic reporting. Satirical news stories were carefully matched and examined in contrast with their legitimate news counterparts in 12 contemporary news topics in 4 domains (civics, science, business, and “soft” news). Building on previous work in satire detection, we proposed an SVMbased algorithm, enriched with 5 predictive features (Absurdity, Humor, Grammar, Negative Affect, and Punctuation) and tested their combinations on 360 news articles. Our best predicting feature combination (Absurdity, Grammar and Punctuation) detects satirical news with a 90% precision and 84% recall (F-score=87%).

764,3e421fd1775413bf89abd8e39a35e5e29d1a4dab,Addressing bias in machine learning algorithms: A pilot study on emotion recognition for intelligent systems,"Recently, there has been an explosion of cloud-based services that enable developers to include a spectrum of recognition services, such as emotion recognition, in their applications. The recognition of emotions is a challenging problem, and research has been done on building classifiers to recognize emotion in the open world. Often, learned emotion models are trained on data sets that may not sufficiently represent a target population of interest. For example, many of these on-line services have focused on training and testing using a majority representation of adults and thus are tuned to the dynamics of mature faces. For applications designed to serve an older or younger age demographic, using the outputs from these pre-defined models may result in lower performance rates than when using a specialized classifier. Similar challenges with biases in performance arise in other situations where datasets in these large-scale on-line services have a non-representative ratio of the desired class of interest. We consider the challenge of providing application developers with the power to utilize pre-constructed cloud-based services in their applications while still ensuring satisfactory performance for their unique workload of cases. We focus on biases in emotion recognition as a representative scenario to evaluate an approach to improving recognition rates when an on-line pre-trained classifier is used for recognition of a class that may have a minority representation in the training set. We discuss a hierarchical classification approach to address this challenge and show that the average recognition rate associated with the most difficult emotion for the minority class increases by 41.5% and the overall recognition rate for all classes increases by 17.3% when using this approach.",2017.0,32.0,72.0,"{'pages': '1-7', 'name': '2017 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts (ARSO)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Howard2017AddressingBI,\n author = {A.

Democratic or authoritative socialization practices contribute to prosocial development. Parental support, warmth and sensitivity, parental induction and inductive reasoning, parental demandingness and control have been associated with empathy, sympathy and behavior in children and adolescents. Parental warmth/responsiveness can develop a secure attachment between the parent and the child. Securely attached children tend to be responsive to parental controls and more eager learners and prosocial during the socialization process. Parents may foster behavior in children by modeling and concerning for the needs of others. Parents may induce perspective-taking, empathy and sympathy in their children and adolescents by pointing out the beneficial or harmful consequences of their actions through inductive reasoning and explanations. Parental inductive reasoning and explanations can lead to empathy-based guilt in them by highlighting consequences of the devi- ating behavior in the children and adolescents for the victim. Children and adolescents can attend to and care about parental messages, internalize prosocial values of their parents, socialize to acquire prosocial behavior when parents behave warmly, responsively and supportively and use inductive reasoning and explanations for their children and adolescents in socialization practices.",2018.0,119.0,2.0,{'name': 'Socialization - A Multidimensional Perspective'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Şengönül2018SocializationPT,\n author = {Turhan Şengönül},\n journal = {Socialization - A Multidimensional Perspective},\n title = {Socialization Processes toward Children and Adolescents for Developing Empathy, Sympathy and Prosocial Behaviors},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2098501841', 'name': 'Turhan Şengönül'}]"

Additionally, the target's responses stimulate the sharing person's emotional expression. The reciprocal stimulation of interactants favors empathy and emotional communion. Consequences are two-fold: (1) the sharing process reactivates emotional arousal in both agent and target, and (2) it strengthens social bonds. Sharing targets also share what they heard with others, who then experience a similar need. Social sharing also develops when an emotional event strikes collectively. In this case, however the propagation consequences are geared up in a spectacular manner both because there are as many sharing sources as there are members in the community and because every sharing reactivates felt emotions among interactants, thus reloading the propagation flow. It is argued that such chain reactions contribute to construct an emotional climate in I concerned community. It is predicted that emotion sharing would impact (1) on the emotional climate in general; (2) on group cohesion and solidarity, with positive consequences for emotional climate; and (3) on collective memory, with potential consequences for emotional climate in the long run. Each of these predictions is detailed and illustrated with available empirical evidence.",2007.0,28.0,187.0,"{'volume': '63', 'pages': '307-322', 'name': 'Journal of Social Issues'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rimé2007TheSS,\n author = {B.

There are critical ways in which the current debate is miscast, misleading and confused. Privacy is portrayed as an individual right, in opposition to a collective need for security. Data gathering and surveillance are portrayed as having an impact only on this individual right to privacy, rather than on a broad spectrum of rights, including freedom of expression, of assembly and association, the prohibition of discrimination and more. The gathering and surveillance of ‘content’ is intrinsically more intrusive than that of ‘communications’ data or ‘metadata’. The impact of data gathering and surveillance is often portrayed as happening only at when data are examined by humans rather than when gathered, or when examined algorithmically. Commercial and governmental data gathering and surveillance are treated as separate and different, rather than intrinsically and inextricably linked. This miscasting has critical implications. When the debate is recast taking into account these misunderstandings, the bar for the justification of surveillance is raised and a new balance needs to be found, in political debate, in law, and in decision-making on the ground.",2016.0,21.0,51.0,"{'volume': '1', 'pages': '243-264', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Bernal2016DataGS,\n author = {P.

Differences are demonstrated between heuristic search of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence and human intelligence actirity. ""Machinocentrism"" as a trend of comaring human and machine functions is strongly criticised. Three programs of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence development are analysed. It is demonstrated that the goal of approximation to human intelligence is being set under conditions of either disregarding or restricted use of psychological data about human intelligence. A real recreation of human intelligence in the work of computer is being associated with simulation of needs, emotional regulation of search, goal-formation , selective reflection of the situation. It is stated that representation of man and his intelligence as ""just a machine"" makes up the basis of the specific form of natural-scientific materialism which is being developed in bounds of artificial intelligence as a scientific trend. Psychological problems arizing in connection with origin ans use of a r t i f i-cial intelligence are also formulated. Analysis of theoretical principalee of artificial intelligence as a scientific trend obtains critical importance. Comparison of human intellect and machine functioning, exposure of their similarities and differences is one of the most significant approaches to this trend analysis. Yet this analysis would be impossible without addressing philosophy and psychology-the sciences that have been traditionally studying human intellect. Machine realisation of such games as chess and checkers is often mentioned as a cogent indicator of machine Intellect existence, Psychology obtains data, that one and the same problem may be solved by man and computer using different principles and that similarity of formal results estranged (written or typed) from the solving system can not serve as a basis for ""diagnosing 19 that computer has human intelligence (1) • Between the heuristic search analysed in the theory of artificial i n t e l l i-gence on the one hand and human intellect activity on the other there are Important differences which should not be ignored.

Recordings of a Swedish speaker uttering a phrase while expressing different emotions were interpreted by listeners with different first languages, Swedish, English, Finnish and Spanish, who were to judge the emotional contents of the expressions. The results show that some emotions, e.g. anger, fear, sadness and surprise, were interpreted in accordance with intended emotion to a greater degree than others, which were interpreted as expected to a lesser degree. Emotions were interpreted with different degrees of success depending on the first languages of listeners; native listeners were the most successful.

Most computational models dealing with this issue include emotion categories in their architecture. However, determining categories to use and their influence on behavior is a difficult task. In order to address this challenge, our COR-E model uses an architecture without emotion categories. In this paper, we present an evaluation of this model in the context of a waiting line scenario.

However, definitional ambiguity hampers the possibility of conversation about this urgent topic of public concern. Legal and regulatory interventions require agreed-upon definitions, but consensus around a definition of AI has been elusive, especially in policy conversations. With an eye towards practical working definitions and a broader understanding of positions on these issues, we survey experts and review published policy documents to examine researcher and policy-maker conceptions of AI. We find that while AI researchers favor definitions of AI that emphasize technical functionality, policy-makers instead use definitions that compare systems to human thinking and behavior. We point out that definitions adhering closely to the functionality of AI systems are more inclusive of technologies in use today, whereas definitions that emphasize human-like capabilities are most applicable to hypothetical future technologies. As a result of this gap, ethical and regulatory efforts may overemphasize concern about future technologies at the expense of pressing issues with existing deployed technologies.",2019.0,38.0,60.0,"{'name': 'Proceedings of the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Krafft2019DefiningAI,\n author = {P.

The article discusses the biases that algorithms may produce through the input data, the testing of the algorithm and the decision model. Any transparency requirement for algorithms should result in explanations of these biases that are both understandable for the prospective recipients, and technically feasible for producers.

Pvclust is an add-on package for a statistical software R to assess the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis. Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.",2006.0,12.0,2135.0,"{'volume': '22 12', 'pages': '\n          1540-2\n        ', 'name': 'Bioinformatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Suzuki2006PvclustAR,\n author = {Ryota Suzuki and Hidetoshi Shimodaira},\n journal = {Bioinformatics},\n pages = {\n          1540-2\n        },\n title = {Pvclust: an R package for assessing the uncertainty in hierarchical clustering},\n volume = {22 12},\n year = {2006}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '38784218', 'name': 'Ryota Suzuki'}, {'authorId': '3261971', 'name': 'Hidetoshi Shimodaira'}]"

Voice user interface (VUI) is now a common feature on smartphones, computers, smart home devices, and car systems. The fragmented and context focused literature on VUI motivates this examination of the relationship between perceived quality and customer satisfaction in VUI portable devices. This study is the first to introduce extrinsic motivational factors as an extension to Wixom and Todd’s model. These additional antecedent factors add an enriched explanation of VUI user behavior. This study is also the first to consider the role of gender in a VUI behavior model. Our findings suggest that the proposed driving factors, including trust, perceived risks, perceived enjoyment, and mobile self-efficacy, significantly affect VUI user attitudes, which influence their continuance intention. Our results also address the role of gender on the association of attitude toward VUI use and its antecedents. The findings show that perceived risk (privacy concerns) and perceived ease of use are more influential on VUI use behavior of males than females.

We investigate the short-and long-run impact of a direct mailing on the revenues of the firm sending the mailing and on the revenues of its competitors. The model accounts for unobserved heterogeneity across households. We estimate the model in the charitable giving setting, as sending direct mailings represents a large part of charitable fundraising activity. Households often receive direct mailings of different charities within a short period of time and competition is highly relevant. We construct a unique database by merging the databases of three large charity organizations in the Netherlands. This results in household level data on the direct mailings received and the donations made by each household to each charity. Our results show that charitable direct mailings are short-run complements, that is, the direct mailings tend to increase the total pie that is divided among the charities. At the same time, the charitable direct mailings are long-run substitutes. In the long run they fight for a piece of the pie that households have available for charitable giving.

In the current study we sought to complement this characterization by investigating the frequency of emotions in human everyday communication, which may be crucial information for designing new diagnostic or intervention tools to test and improve emotion recognition. Methods: One hundred healthy German individuals were asked to indicate the valence and arousal of 62 emotion words in a questionnaire. Importantly, participants were additionally asked to indicate the frequency with which they experience each emotion themselves and observe it in others. Results: Positive emotions were judged to occur more often than negative emotions in everyday life. The more negatively valenced emotions were rated to be observed more often in others than experienced in one-self. On the other hand more positively valenced emotions were experienced more often in one-self than they were observed in others. Finally, increasing age was associated with a decrease in the frequency of observing an emotion in other people. Limitations: Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to ascertain if the findings also apply to other cultural and language contexts. Conclusion: These results imply a greater frequency of positive emotions than negative emotions in everyday communication. The finding of such a bias toward positive emotions can guide the selection of emotion words for implementation in socio-emotional intervention tools. Such a selection may represent an effective means for improving social-cognitive functioning in people with respective impairments.",2011.0,54.0,34.0,"{'volume': '2', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hepach2011ConceptualizingEA,\n author = {Robert Hepach and Dorit Kliemann and Sebastian Grüneisen and H.

The system is inspired by advances in biosensing wearables, tattoo displays, brain sensors, robotic agents, artificial intelligence (AI), gestural interaction and 3D holographic displays. By 2030, technological advances will enable us to prototype and investigate questions related to experiential and embodied emotional learning; emotion-based human-computer interaction, affective biosensing, empathetic AI agents, and 3D interactive holographic environments. We envision EmotoTent as a modular, emotion-sensing Holodeck. In the EmotoTent program children learn and practice emotion regulation and empathy with peers, pets and a robotic dog agent in ways that are experiential, embodied and playful. We propose EmotoTent as a core element of a K-6 socio-emotional learning curriculum designed to improve school culture through the enhancement of children's ability to regulate emotions and interact with human and non-human species with empathy and compassion. Enhancing these qualities has been shown to lead to reductions in violence and bullying, racism, gender inequality and other forms of marginalization.

Drawing on the conservation of resources and expectancy of motivation theories, the current study reinterprets this relationship and proposes that employee job performance is a precursor of burnout. The employee commitment concept is incorporated into the job performance – burnout relationship.

Customer-contact employees from several hotel resorts were approached to participate in the study, with permission from hotel management and assistance from respective human resource managers. Results support the study hypotheses and confirm that job performance is related to burnout, and employee commitment significantly mediates the performance burnout relationship.

This article questions the efficiency of the European Commission’s Proposal for Regulation of Artificial Intelligence, known as the AI Act, in addressing the threats and risks to fundamental rights posed by AI biometric surveillance systems. It argues that in order to meaningfully address risks to fundamental rights the proposed classification of these systems should be reconsidered. Although the draft AI Act acknowledges that some AI practices should be prohibited, the multiple exceptions and loopholes should be closed, and in addition new prohibitions, in particular to emotional recognition and biometric categorisation systems, should be added to counter AI surveillance practices violating fundamental rights. The AI Act should also introduce stronger legal requirements, such as third-party conformity assessment, fundamental rights impact assessment, transparency obligations as well as enhance existing EU data protection law and the rights and remedies available to individuals, thus not missing the unique opportunity to adopt the first legal framework that truly promotes trustworthy AI.",2022.0,44.0,1.0,{'name': 'Information Polity'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Nesterova2022QuestioningTE,\n author = {I.

The literature reveals that the study of athletes' affective responses to competition has been narrowly focused on pre-competitive anxiety. Equivocal findings on temporal patterning of competitive anxiety suggest that a fundamental change in the empirical approach is needed because the current conceptualization of anxiety and other complex emotions is imprecise. The analysis of secondary emotions as patterns of discrete basic emotions, as suggested by differential emotions theorists, is proposed for consideration in future research. In this view, competitive anxiety is considered as a set of patterns of emotions rather than a unitary affect. The adoption of this approach could result in better operationalization of competitive anxiety as well as other secondary performance-related emotions. We propose that research on competitive affects should follow two parallel lines. The first should focus on the description of complex emotional states that reflect the idiosyncratic emotional experience and vocabulary of the athlete. The second should examine the sets of basic emotions experienced throughout competition, and focus on individual differences and factors determining those differences. The integration of the two approaches could lead to a better understanding of whether, how and why individuals differ in the interpretation of specific secondary emotions and their effect on performance. Moreover, it would permit the analysis of intra-individual variations in labelling secondary emotions with respect to different competitive contexts and temporal aspects.",2000.0,97.0,236.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '605 - 626', 'name': 'Journal of Sports Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cerin2000TemporalPO,\n author = {E.

Poker is the quintessential game of imperfect information, and it has been a longstanding challenge problem in artificial intelligence. In this paper we introduce DeepStack, a new algorithm for imperfect information settings such as poker. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition about arbitrary poker situations that is automatically learned from selfplay games using deep learning. In a study involving dozens of participants and 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack becomes the first computer program to beat professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em.

The present study examined age differences in seven emotion regulation strategies from early adolescence (age 11) to middle adulthood (age 50) for the three emotions of sadness, fear, and anger. The results showed specific developmental changes in the use of emotion regulation strategies for each of the three emotions. In addition, results suggest age-specific increases and decreases in many emotion regulation strategies, with a general trend to increasing adaptive emotion regulation. Specifically, middle adolescence shows the smallest emotion regulation strategy repertoire. Gender differences appeared for most emotion regulation strategies.

Research on suicide prevention and interventions requires a standard method for assessing both suicidal ideation and behavior to identify those at risk and to track treatment response. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was designed to quantify the severity of suicidal ideation and behavior. The authors examined the psychometric properties of the scale.


METHOD
The C-SSRS's validity relative to other measures of suicidal ideation and behavior and the internal consistency of its intensity of ideation subscale were analyzed in three multisite studies: a treatment study of adolescent suicide attempters (N=124); a medication efficacy trial with depressed adolescents (N=312); and a study of adults presenting to an emergency department for psychiatric reasons (N=237).


RESULTS
The C-SSRS demonstrated good convergent and divergent validity with other multi-informant suicidal ideation and behavior scales and had high sensitivity and specificity for suicidal behavior classifications compared with another behavior scale and an independent suicide evaluation board. Both the ideation and behavior subscales were sensitive to change over time. The intensity of ideation subscale demonstrated moderate to strong internal consistency. In the adolescent suicide attempters study, worst-point lifetime suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS predicted suicide attempts during the study, whereas the Scale for Suicide Ideation did not. Participants with the two highest levels of ideation severity (intent or intent with plan) at baseline had higher odds for attempting suicide during the study.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that the C-SSRS is suitable for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical and research settings.",2011.0,46.0,2955.0,"{'volume': '168 12', 'pages': '\n          1266-77\n        ', 'name': 'The American journal of psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Posner2011TheCS,\n author = {K.

A comparison was also made of recordings from a real‐life situation, in which the emotions of a speaker were clearly defined, with recordings from an actor who simulated the same situation. Anger, fear, and sorrow situations tended to produce characteristic differences in contour of fundamental frequency, average speech spectrum, temporal characteristics, precision of articulation, and waveform regularity of successive glottal pulses.

Cynthia Breazeal here presents her vision of the sociable robot of the future, a synthetic creature and not merely a sophisticated tool. A sociable robot will be able to understand us, to communicate and interact with us, to learn from us and grow with us. It will be socially intelligent in a humanlike way. Eventually sociable robots will assist us in our daily lives, as collaborators and companions. Because the most successful sociable robots will share our social characteristics, the effort to make sociable robots is also a means for exploring human social intelligence and even what it means to be human. 
Breazeal defines the key components of social intelligence for these machines and offers a framework and set of design issues for their realization. Much of the book focuses on a nascent sociable robot she designed named Kismet. Breazeal offers a concrete implementation for Kismet, incorporating insights from the scientific study of animals and people, as well as from artistic disciplines such as classical animation. This blending of science, engineering, and art creates a lifelike quality that encourages people to treat Kismet as a social creature rather than just a machine.

Since social-emotional learning may be defined as a vital component of the learning process in professional instructional design practices, online learners not only need to develop the ability to apply their knowledge, attitudes, and skills but also to understand and manage their emotions. In which setting and achieving positive goals through social interaction, sharing feelings, and developing empathy for others can help with the process. This paper outlines the possibility of using emotion recognition, and social sharing of emotion techniques to support the regulation of emotion in pre-service teacher education. This study aimed to investigate pre-service teachers’ emotion recognition tools acquired by emotion tracker and physiological signals based on their perceptions (without a concrete experience and knowledge). Moreover, the predictive ability was examined along with the relationships between emotion recognition, social sharing of emotion, and emotion regulation. Finally, we investigated emotion adjustment techniques that can be adapted into mobile computer-supported collaborative learning (mCSCL). In this study, 183 pre-service teachers from three different teacher-education institutions in Thailand, were voluntarily participated based on convenience sampling. The results of a self-report via online survey revealed that most pre-service teachers own at least one of the mobile technologies e.g., smartphones, tablets, or laptops. However, there is an increasing number of additional gadgets and wearable devices like EarPods and smartwatches. At the current time, it is nearly impossible to use of the IoT and other wearable devices. According to their subjective impressions in which corresponded to emotion recognition in the scientific literature, Heart rate (HR) and Heart rate variability (HRV) have recognized the most possibilities for emotion detection among physiological signals. Regarding regression analysis, the two-predictor models of emotion recognition and the social sharing of emotion were also able to account for 31% of the variance in emotion regulation, p<.001, R2=.31, and 95% CI [.70, .77].

Nowadays, one sixth of the world’s population is represented by adolescents, nearly 1.2 billion people being of age 10-19. According to the 2011 census in Iran, the estimation of adolescent population was 12 million, which represents 16% of the Iran population. Undoubtedly, adolescence is the most dominant stage of life. During this period, adolescents face biological, cognitive, and emotional changes that may be accompanied by inappropriate behavioral responses such as aggression. Considering pressures of peer groups during adolescence, assertiveness has an important role as a social skill. It seems that the success of adolescents in dealing with these problems depends on their self-efficacy. This study was designed to explore the role of self-efficacy and assertiveness in aggression among high-school students. Material and methods. This cross-sectional and correlational study was conducted among 321 first grade high-school students during 2014 and 2015. Samples were extracted from six education and training regions by a multi-stage random sampling. In this study, the questionnaire included demographic, Rathus Assertiveness, self-efficacy for children and aggression data. Results. The results showed that there was a notable negative association between aggression and assertiveness (p < 0.003) and also between assault and self-efficacy (p < 0.001). Conclusions. An increase in assertiveness and self-efficacy resulted in a decrease of aggression. So, training was recommended to reinforce self-efficacy beliefs and assertiveness behaviors for mental health promotion.",2015.0,36.0,19.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '225 - 231', 'name': 'Journal of Medicine and Life'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mofrad2015TheRO,\n author = {SH Khademi Mofrad and T.

Such a mechanism is crucial for the design of resource-bounded agents that must operate in highly-dynamic, semi-predictable environments and which need mechanisms for allocating their computational resources efficiently. The aim of this work is to propose a logical analysis of emotions and their influences on an agent's behavior. We focus on four emotion types (viz., hope, fear, joy, and distress) and provide their logical characterizations in a modal logic frame-work. As the intensity of emotion is essential for its influence on an agent's behavior, the logic is devised to represent and reason about graded beliefs, graded goals and intentions. The belief strength and the goal strength determine the intensity of emotions. Emotions trigger different types of coping strategy which are aimed at dealing with emotions either by forming or revising an intention to act in the world, or by changing the agent's interpretation of the situation (by changing beliefs or goals).",2012.0,23.0,37.0,{'pages': '1133-1140'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Dastani2012ALO,\n author = {M.

The process takes place in a few seconds and it is spontaneous and unaware. While the process is not necessarily accurate (attributed traits do not necessarily correspond to the actual traits of the speaker), still it significantly influences our behavior toward others, especially when it comes to social interaction. This paper proposes an approach for the automatic prediction of the traits the listeners attribute to a speaker they never heard before. The experiments are performed over a corpus of 640 speech clips (322 identities in total) annotated in terms of personality traits by 11 assessors. The results show that it is possible to predict with high accuracy (more than 70 percent depending on the particular trait) whether a person is perceived to be in the upper or lower part of the scales corresponding to each of the Big -Five, the personality dimensions known to capture most of the individual differences.",2012.0,56.0,175.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '273-284', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mohammadi2012AutomaticPP,\n author = {Gelareh Mohammadi and A.

In emergency conditions, both external resources and cognitive capabilities are limited. A decision maker must man­ age his/her cognitive load, that of others in the situation, and allocate the often limited resources in a short period of time. The main job of a decision maker in an emergency sit­ uation is to allocate resources wisely where the situation changes constantly, outcomes are delayed, decisions are interdependent, priorities change over time, and there is high uncertainty of outcomes. These types ofdecision-making conditions are part of a field of research called Dynamic Some classical examples of DDM include, among others: firefighting resource allocation and management in real time; triage decisions in a medical emergency room; 911 operators determining relative urgency and deploy­ ing resources; and supply-chain manage­ ment. In general, DDM often involves a dynamic allocation of limited resources in real time. Disaster and emergency responses are examples of decision making in dynamic conditions. For instance in an emergency room, doctors must allocate limited hospi­ tal resources (i.e., nurses, doctors, beds) in the presence of a large number of patients in need of help. The rate and timing of the inflow of patients is unknown, and physi­ cians must make assignments in real time. These allocations are interdependent, per­ haps producing suboptimal decisions like when a mildly injured patient is given pri­ ority over future unknown severely injured patients. A common paradigm in the behavioral decision sciences has been that of decisions from description (DFD, Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004). A human is given access to descriptive information, often including probabilities and outcomes, and asked to make a choice based on the con­ ditions described. This is also a common paradigm in the real world. For example, to make an investment decision, people often read brochures with the different pros and cons of the alternatives while considering the risk of the different alternatives.

However, the single signal is difficult to obtain completely and accurately description for emotion. Multiple physiological signals fusing models, building the uniform classification model by means of consistent and complementary information from different emotions to improve recognition performance. Original fusing models usually choose the particular classification method to recognition, which is ignoring different distribution of multiple signals. Aiming above problems, in this work, we propose an emotion classification model through multiple modal physiological signals for different emotions. Features are extracted from EEG, EMG, EOG signals for characterizing emotional state on valence and arousal levels. For characterization, four bands filtering theta, beta, alpha, gamma for signal preprocessing are adopted and three Hjorth parameters are computing as features. To improve classification performance, an ensemble classifier is built. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark DEAP datasets. For the two-class task, the best result on arousal is 94.42\%, the best result on valence is 94.02\%, respectively.

Objective To conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy of psychotherapies for BPD populations. Data Sources Search terms were combined for borderline personality and randomized trials in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from database inception to November 2015), as well as the reference lists of earlier meta-analyses. Study Selection Included were randomized clinical trials of adults with diagnosed BPD randomized to psychotherapy exclusively or to a control intervention. Study selection differentiated stand-alone designs (in which an independent psychotherapy was compared with control interventions) from add-on designs (in which an experimental intervention added to usual treatment was compared with usual treatment alone). Data Extraction and Synthesis Data extraction coded characteristics of trials, participants, and interventions and assessed risk of bias using 4 domains of the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool (independent extraction by 2 assessors). Outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures Standardized mean differences (Hedges g) were calculated using all outcomes reported in the trials for borderline symptoms, self-harm, suicide, health service use, and general psychopathology at posttest and follow-up. Differential treatment retention at posttest was analyzed, reporting odds ratios. Results Thirty-three trials (2256 participants) were included. For borderline-relevant outcomes combined (symptoms, self-harm, and suicide) at posttest, the investigated psychotherapies were moderately more effective than control interventions in stand-alone designs (g = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.51) and add-on designs (g = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.15-0.65). Results were similar for other outcomes, including stand-alone designs: self-harm (g = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.09-0.54), suicide (g = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.15-0.74), health service use (g = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.58), and general psychopathology (g = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.09-0.55), with no differences between design types. There were no significant differences in the odds ratios for treatment retention (1.32; 95% CI, 0.87-2.00 for stand-alone designs and 1.01; 95% CI, 0.55-1.87 for add-on designs). Thirteen trials reported borderline-relevant outcomes at follow-up (g = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.15-0.75). Dialectical behavior therapy (g = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.53) and psychodynamic approaches (g = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69) were the only types of psychotherapies more effective than control interventions. Risk of bias was a significant moderator in subgroup and meta-regression analyses (slope &bgr; = −0.16; 95% CI, −0.29 to −0.03; P = .02). Publication bias was persistent, particularly for follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance Psychotherapies, most notably dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic approaches, are effective for borderline symptoms and related problems. Nonetheless, effects are small, inflated by risk of bias and publication bias, and particularly unstable at follow-up.",2017.0,57.0,470.0,"{'volume': '74', 'pages': '319–328', 'name': 'JAMA Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cristea2017EfficacyOP,\n author = {I.

It has been applied to many areas, such as product recommendation, clustering, and Web search. Most of the existing metrics can provide personalized services for users by taking a meta-path or meta-structure as input. However, these metrics may highly depend on the user-specified meta-path or meta-structure. In addition, users must know how to select an appropriate meta-path or meta-structure. In this article, we propose a novel similarity measure in HINs, called Recurrent Meta-Structure (RecurMS)-based Similarity (RMSS). The RecurMS as a schematic structure in HINs provides a unified framework for integrating all of the meta-paths and meta-structures, and can be constructed automatically by means of repetitively traversing the network schema. In order to formalize the semantics, the RecurMS is decomposed into several recurrent meta-paths and recurrent meta-trees, and we then define the commuting matrices of the recurrent meta-paths and meta-trees. All of these commuting matrices are combined together according to different weights. We propose two kinds of weighting strategies to determine the weights. The first is called the local weighting strategy that depends on the sparsity of the commuting matrices, and the second is called the global weighting strategy that depends on the strength of the commuting matrices. As a result, RMSS is defined by means of the weighted summation of the commuting matrices. Note that RMSS can also provide personalized services for users by means of the weights of the recurrent meta-paths and meta-trees. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed RMSS is robust and outperforms the existing metrics in terms of ranking and clustering task.",2017.0,42.0,11.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '1 - 33', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhou2017RecurrentMF,\n author = {Yu Zhou and Jianbin Huang and Heli Sun and Yizhou Sun and Shaojie Qiao and S.

The narratives were coded with 15 golf destination attributes with 136 headwords and they reflected both place-centred images and interactions through perceptual experiences with different social groups. The golfers greatly appreciated congestion control at courses and social interaction during their tours, including the services of local human resources and play partners.

Although this approach has improved reliability of categorization, its validity and utility has been questioned (Harvey, Watkins, Mansell, & Shafran, 2004; Insel et al., 2009; Sanislow et al., 2010). Limitations include high comorbidity between supposedly distinct disorders; heterogeneity within diagnoses; limited treatment efficacy; and similarities across disorders in aetiology, latent symptom structure, and underlying biology. There is also evidence of transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioural processes (Harvey et al., 2004). An alternative approach is therefore to focus on fundamental underlying mechanisms of psychopathology rather than observed symptom clusters. This article considers the possible benefits, hurdles, and steps towards implementation of this transdiagnostic mechanistic approach, using the example of repetitive negative thought.",2015.0,34.0,30.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '250 - 255', 'name': 'Emotion Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Watkins2015AnAT,\n author = {E.

More than 75% of the African-American elementary school children sampled indicated that they had witnessed incidents of community violence ranging from homicides to nonfatal shootings, physical assaults, gang violence, robbery with assaults, and rape in their neighborhoods. Yet, almost half of the parents in the study denied that their children had been exposed to any community violence. When these discrepancies were examined, results revealed that children whose parents were in disagreement regarding their exposure to community violence were less likely to experience social support from their peers. Parents' possible lack of awareness as to the experience of their children may place them at further risk by eliminating the possibility for adult-child interaction and guidance regarding their experience with violence in their neighborhoods.

To date, crisis interventions for BPD have been conducted via telephone calls and emergency units, which are associated with an extra amount of resources. The aim of this research was to test the usability and satisfaction with a psychotherapeutic mobile app for self-managing crises in BPD. Method: The B·RIGHT app was designed based on Artificial Intelligence psychotherapeutic algorithms. Usability and satisfaction with the app were assessed in 25 outpatients diagnosed with BPD (84% female, mean age = 35.80 years) using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and other questionnaires. Clinical features were assessed using the Borderline Symptom List, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and Beck’s Depression Inventory. Results: Patients with BPD considered the app user-friendly (mean total score = 4.03) and highly satisfactory (mean total score = 4.02), resulting in a positive user experience (mean total score = 4.09). Total usability was negatively associated with age (r = −.44), positively associated with educational level (rho = .47) and with overall emotion dysregulation (r = .51), and negatively associated with depression severity (r = −.47).

Others condemn the use of secret algorithms to sentence criminal defendants or recoil at the prospect of machines gunning for blue, pink, and white-collar jobs. Some worry aloud that artificial intelligence will be humankind’s “final invention.”  This essay, prepared in connection with UC Davis Law Review's 50th anniversary symposium, explains why AI is suddenly on everyone's mind and provides a roadmap to the major policy questions AI raises. The essay is designed to help policymakers, investors, technologists, scholars, and students understand the contemporary policy environment around AI at least well enough to initiate their own exploration. Topics covered include: justice and equity, use of force, safety and certification, privacy (including data parity) and taxation and displacement of labor. In addition to these topics, the essay will touch briefly on a selection of broader systemic questions: institutional configuration and expertise, investment and procurement, removing hurdles to accountability and correcting mental models of AI.",2017.0,16.0,177.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '180-218', 'name': 'University of Bologna Law Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Calo2017ArtificialIP,\n author = {Ryan Calo},\n journal = {University of Bologna Law Review},\n pages = {180-218},\n title = {Artificial Intelligence Policy: A Primer and Roadmap},\n volume = {3},\n year = {2017}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3014341', 'name': 'Ryan Calo'}]"

However, data subjects are perceived to be always unwilling to share their data on security and privacy reasons. They apprehend that those data will be misused at the cost of their privacy jeopardising their human rights. Thus, personal data sharing is closely associated with human right issues. This concern of data subjects has increased manifolds owing to the interference of Artificial Intelligence (AI) since AI can analyse data without human intervention.

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of 33% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly.

The present review examines this model in terms of whether different types of emotion-evocative stimuli are associated with discrete and invariant patterns of responding in each response system, how such responses are structured, and if such responses converge across different response systems. Across response systems, the bulk of the available evidence favours the idea that measures of emotional responding reflect dimensions rather than discrete states. In addition, experiential, physiological, and behavioural response systems are associated with unique sources of variance, which in turn limits the magnitude of convergence across measures. Accordingly, the authors suggest that there is no “gold standard” measure of emotional responding. Rather, experiential, physiological, and behavioural measures are all relevant to understanding emotion and cannot be assumed to be interchangeable.",2009.0,201.0,1661.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '209 - 237', 'name': 'Cognition and Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mauss2009MeasuresOE,\n author = {I.

919,4a191bb8c04538cae794379502ce552a0b7adf15,Resilience in the face of stress: emotion regulation as a protective factor,"Introduction Everyone experiences stress at one time or another – from major events such as the death of a loved one, to more minor stressors such as financial difficulties. Not surprisingly, exposure to stress is generally associated with a wide range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased incidence of disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974; Kendler et al., 1999; Monat et al., 2007). However, not all individuals who are exposed to even high levels of stress develop such negative outcomes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that a considerable number of individuals exhibit resilience, which is commonly defined as maintained or improved mental health in the face of stress, after short disruptions (if any) to normal functioning (Freitas & Downey, 1998; Rutter, 1999; Luthar et al., 2000; Bonanno, 2005). Note that this definition, which we adapt here, conceptualizes resilience as a potential outcome after exposure to stress rather than a psychological trait that leads to positive outcomes (c.f. Norris et al., 2008). It, therefore, appears that, in the face of comparable stressors, some individuals exhibit significantly impaired functioning while others show impressive resilience. Understanding the factors that govern the great individual variance in outcomes after stress is important for understanding mental health and for developing interventions and prevention programs that foster resilience. What factors, then, might predict resilience? One key to this question might lie in the fact that stressful events are inherently highly emotional (Sarason et al., 1978; Lazarus, 1999). For this reason, people’s ability to regulate emotions may be a critically important factor in determining resilience (Figure 2.1). The present chapter will review relevant literatures and suggest that there is indeed evidence to support this thesis. More specifically, we will propose that a specific type of emotion regulation, cognitive emotion regulation, holds particular promise for contributing to resilience.",2011.0,94.0,264.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '30-44', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Troy2011ResilienceIT,\n author = {Allison S.

Objectives Assistive social robots are believed to be useful in eldercare for two reasons, a functional one and an affective one. Such robots are developed to function as an interface for the elderly with digital technology, and to help increase the quality of life of the elderly by providing companionship, respectively. There is a growing attention for these devices in the literature. However, no comprehensive review has yet been performed to investigate the effectiveness of such robots in the care of the elderly. Therefore, we systematically reviewed and analyzed existing literature on the effects of assistive social robots in health care for the elderly. We focused in particular on the companion function. Data Sources A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library databases, IEEE, ACM libraries and finally Google Scholar was performed for records through December 2007 to identify articles of all studies with actual subjects aimed to assess the effects of assistive social robots on the elderly. This search was completed with information derived from personal expertise, contacts and reports. Study Selection and Data Extraction Since no randomized controlled trials (RCT)’s have been found within this field of research, all studies reporting effects of assistive robotics in elderly populations were included. Information on study design, interventions, controls, and findings were extracted for each article. In medical journals only a few articles were found, whereas about 50 publications were found in literature on ICT and robotics. Data Synthesis The identified studies were all published after 2000 indicating the novelty of this area of research. Most of these publications contain the results of studies that report positive effects of assistive social robots on health and psychological well-being of elders. Solid evidence indicating that these effects can indeed be attributed to the actual assistive social robot, its behavior and its functionality is scarce. Conclusions There is some qualitative evidence as well as limited quantitative evidence of the positive effects of assistive social robots with respect to the elderly. The research designs, however, are not robust enough to establish this. Confounding variables often cannot be excluded. This is partly due to the chosen research designs, but also because it is unclear what research methodology is adequate to investigate such effects. Therefore, more work on methods is needed as well as robust, large-scale studies to establish the effects of these devices.",2009.0,59.0,863.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': 'Caries Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Broekens2009AssistiveSR,\n author = {J.

922,4a5181b0fcd55289788281f8dff1dbb79c0a59f2,Personality and emotional intelligence as factors in sales performance,"In this study, salespersons in a telecommunications company were tested for emotional intelligence (EI), additional dimensions of work motivation and personality, and work performance. It was found that EI was related as expected to other variables, most noticeably to life/work balance (positively), to positive affective tone (positively), and to materialistic values and money obsession (negatively). EI was most clearly related to citizenship behavior and less to core task performance, as expected. Core task performance was strongly related to conscientiousness and positive affect, and to willingness to work and work interest. Job satisfaction had a weaker relationship to performance, in agreement with much earlier work. EI emerged as a dimension possible to measure and with expected properties. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a concept which currently attracts much interest (Matthews, Zeidner, & Roberts, 2002). It is defined as the ability to identify and manage emotions (Mayer & Salovey, 1997), in oneself and others. Salovey, Mayer and colleagues were the first to devise operational procedures for the measurement of EI (Mayer, DiPaolo, & Salovey, 1990; P. Salovey & Mayer, 1989-1990). In their later work, they have demonstrated that EI is a facet of intelligence, with psychometric properties similar to those of traditional intelligence constructs (Mayer, Caruso, & Salovey, 1999; Mayer, Salovey, Caruso, & Sitarenios, 2001), and its value in accounting for various aspects of positive life adjustment (Engelberg & Sjöberg, 2004a, 2004b, 2005; Peter Salovey, Caruso, Mayer, Linley, & Joseph, 2004) and leadership (Caruso, Mayer, Salovey, Riggio, & Murphy, 2002). Organisational Theory and Practice No 2/2005 Personality and emotional intelligence as factors in sales performance 21 Personality and emotional intelligence as factors in sales performance EI has been implicated in the writings of several authors as an important factor in job performance (Boyatzis, Goleman, & Rhee, 2000; Goleman, 1995, 1998). This is allegedly true for jobs which have important social ingredients, and many or even most jobs do. However, rather few studies have been published so far where these notions have been tested on data from industrial applications. Most empirical work on emotional intelligence has tended to use small convenience samples of college students, and testing situations carrying no important outcomes for the participants in the study. The present work builds on our experience of EI testing in a high-stakes situation (Sjöberg, 2001a, 2001b, 2005a; Sjöberg & Engelberg, 2005). It is commonly noted that salespeople vary strongly in performance. There could be many reasons for this fact, including personality, aptitudes and training (Farrell & Hakstian, 2001). The performance of salespeople is related to their ability to manage various kinds of social problems, and to deal with the motivational and emotional problems arising because of negative feedback and failures (Badovick, Hadaway, & Kaminski, 1992; Brown, Cron, & Slocum, 1997). A person high in EI should be resilient and able to handle the emotionally threatening outcomes of failure, and failure is frequent in the life of the salesperson. We therefore saw it as interesting to test the notions of emotional intelligence with sales personnel. Sales personnel work in a job where social and possibly emotional skills are of importance (Manna & Smith, 2004). Within an EI framework, social skills involve the ability to interpret emotional expressions and to draw on emotion knowledge that will enable the individual to adapt to social contexts of different kinds (Engelberg & Sjöberg, 2005). Research, however, suggests that social skills also involve the ability to enter the bidirectional exchange of emotional information with another person. This aspect draws on the ability to respond to other people’s emotional cues to affect their moods and emotions and has been studied within research on the emotional contagion theory (Hatfield, Cacioppo, & Rapson, 1994). When explored in a sales context, emotions via facial cues during a conversation were monitored in a study by Verbeke (1997). Results showed that sales performance was better among personnel with a high ability to transfer emotions, whereas performance was worse among salespersons with less of this ability, although they showed an equal sensitivity to the customer’s emotions. In a similar vein, we found that susceptibility to mood contagion is a social skill grounded in EI-related abilities to perceive and process emotional cues from other people when present in a concurrent situation (Engelberg & Sjöberg, 2004a) Emotional intelligence is currently measured in two different ways: as performance and as selfreport (Roberts & Schulze, 2005). The former approach was the first thrust when the concept was launched in the beginning of the 1990’s (Mayer, DiPaolo, & Salovey, 1990; Salovey & Mayer, 1989-1990). However, it was soon to be overtaken in applications by self-report scales, such as the one devised by Bar-On (Bar-On, 1997, 2000). Mayer and colleagues have continued their work on performance measures (Mayer, Perkins, Caruso, & Salovey, 2001;Mayer, Salovey, Caruso, & Sitarenios, 2001; Salovey et al., 2003). This is undoubtedly a promising approach. One important advantage is that such measures seem to be unaffected by impression management strategies (Sjöberg & Engelberg, 2005). They also provide new information beyond that given by the five factor model dimensions of personality. Only one of the latter dimensions, agreeableness, has been found to be related to performance measures of (Sjöberg & Engelberg, 2005), and that is expected and constitutes construct Organisational Theory and Practice No 2/2005 Personality and emotional intelligence as factors in sales performance",2006.0,63.0,17.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sjöberg2006PersonalityAE,\n author = {L.

As businesses work alongside governments to build this superhighway and expand it into private areas as well, there is a growing need to develop methodologies of questioning these practices. The goal of this paper is to stimulate inquiry into both surveillance and the rhetoric used to justify its use. “Reflectionism” is proposed as a new philosophical and tactical framework that takes the Situationist tradition of appropriating the methodology of the oppressor one step further by targeting that methodology directly against the oppressor.

Psychological well-being was lower in years when adolescents spent more time on screens and higher in years when they spent more time on nonscreen activities, with changes in activities generally preceding declines in well-being. Cyclical economic indicators such as unemployment were not significantly correlated with well-being, suggesting that the Great Recession was not the cause of the decrease in psychological well-being, which may instead be at least partially due to the rapid adoption of smartphones and the subsequent shift in adolescents’ time use.",2018.0,61.0,357.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '765–780', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Twenge2018DecreasesIP,\n author = {J.

We argue that as ICTs have become increasingly modular and recombinable, so have organizational processes and forms. The narrative network draws on concepts from structuration theory, actor network theory (ANT), and the theory of organizational routines. A narrative network expresses the set of stories (performances) that have been, or could be, generated by combining and recombining fragments of technology in use. This paper discusses how thinking of technology and organizations as narrative networks influences our understanding of design.",2007.0,101.0,330.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '781-795', 'name': 'Organ.

Can the information professional play a role?,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies are rapidly maturing and proliferating through all public and private sectors. The potential for these technologies to do good and to help us in our everyday lives is immense. But there is a risk that unless managed and controlled AI can also cause us harm. Questions about regulation, what form it takes and who is responsible for governance are only just beginning to be answered. In May 2019, 42 countries came together to support a global governance framework for AI. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principles on Artificial Intelligence (OECD (2019) OECD principles on AI. Available at: https://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/principles/ (accessed 2 March 2020)) saw like-minded democracies of the world commit to common AI values of trust and respect. In Europe, the European Commission’s (EC) new president, Ursula von der Leyen has made calls for a General Data Protection Regulation style. As a first step the EC has published a white paper: ‘On Artificial Intelligence – A European Approach to Excellence and Trust’ (European Commission (2020) Report, Europa, February). In February 2020, the UK government has published a report on ‘Artificial Intelligence in the Public Sector’ (The Committee on Standards in Public Life (2020) Artificial intelligence and public standards. Report, UK Government, February). This article discusses some of the potential threats AI may hold if left unregulated. It provides a brief overview of the regulatory activities for AI worldwide, and in more detail the current UK AI regulatory landscape.

Existing annotated databases of facial expressions in the wild are small and mostly cover discrete emotions (aka the categorical model). There are very limited annotated facial databases for affective computing in the continuous dimensional model (e.g., valence and arousal). To meet this need, we collected, annotated, and prepared for public distribution a new database of facial emotions in the wild (called AffectNet). AffectNet contains more than 1,000,000 facial images from the Internet by querying three major search engines using 1,250 emotion related keywords in six different languages. About half of the retrieved images were manually annotated for the presence of seven discrete facial expressions and the intensity of valence and arousal. AffectNet is by far the largest database of facial expression, valence, and arousal in the wild enabling research in automated facial expression recognition in two different emotion models. Two baseline deep neural networks are used to classify images in the categorical model and predict the intensity of valence and arousal. Various evaluation metrics show that our deep neural network baselines can perform better than conventional machine learning methods and off-the-shelf facial expression recognition systems.",2017.0,73.0,1096.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '18-31', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mollahosseini2017AffectNetAD,\n author = {A.

This review paper describes basic statistical design problems in biomedical or medical studies and directs the basic scientists to better use of statistical thinking. The contents of this paper were based on previous literatures and our daily basic support work. It includes the sample size determination and sample allocation in experimental design stage, numerical and graphical data summarization, and statistical test methods as well as the related common errors at design and analytic stages. Literatures and our daily support works show that misunderstanding and misusing of statistical concept and statistical test methods are significant problems. These may include ignoring the sample size and data distribution, incorrect summarization measurement, wrong statistical test methods especially for repeated measures, ignoring the assumption for t-test or ANOVA test, failing to perform the adjustment for multiple comparison.

The authors' analysis suggests that such expressive suppression should disrupt communication and increase stress levels. To test this hypothesis, the authors conducted 2 studies in which unacquainted pairs of women discussed an upsetting topic. In Study 1, one member of each pair was randomly assigned to (a) suppress her emotional behavior, (b) respond naturally, or (c) cognitively reappraise in a way that reduced emotional responding. Suppression alone disrupted communication and magnified blood pressure responses in the suppressors' partners. In Study 2, suppression had a negative impact on the regulators' emotional experience and increased blood pressure in both regulators and their partners.

Assertiveness is often considered as the balance point between passive and aggressive behaviour, and being assertive also means one should respect the thoughts, feelings and beliefs of other people. In the present study, the researcher had attempted to assess the relationship between perceived stress and assertiveness among young adults belonging to colleges in India and to study the gender difference in their perceived stress and assertive levels. The data was collected using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and Rathus Assertiveness Schedule for adults (RAS) from a sample of 104 college students of age group ranging from 18-23 years. The study found that there was no significant relationship between their perceived stress and assertiveness.

In particular, this study used a combination of self-report and psychophysiological measures of emotion and explored the consistency between these two measurement techniques. A total of 101 participants were exposed to 18 existing destination commercials while their real-time psychophysiological responses and self-report data were collected. The results show that the influence of ad-evoked emotions on tourism advertising effectiveness varied according to the way emotion was measured. The effects of pleasure on tourism advertising effectiveness were much weaker when pleasure was measured physiologically than when self-report measures were used. Physiological arousal, however, was not found to be a significant indicator of advertising effectiveness. The results highlight the importance of valid and reliable measurement of emotion and raise concern over the possible overestimation of the relationship between self-reported emotional responses and advertising effectiveness.",2018.0,86.0,60.0,"{'volume': '57', 'pages': '1078 - 1092', 'name': 'Journal of Travel Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2018ACA,\n author = {Shanshi Li and Gabrielle Walters and J.

This idea was eagerly adopted in HCI and applied in multiple contexts, including health, sustainability and privacy. Despite this, we still lack an understanding of how to design effective technology-mediated nudges. In this paper we present a systematic review of the use of nudging in HCI research with the goal of laying out the design space of technology-mediated nudging - the why (i.e., which cognitive biases do nudges combat) and the how (i.e., what exact mechanisms do nudges employ to incur behavior change). All in all, we found 23 distinct mechanisms of nudging, grouped in 6 categories, and leveraging 15 different cognitive biases. We present these as a framework for technology-mediated nudging, and discuss the factors shaping nudges' effectiveness and their ethical implications.",2019.0,105.0,218.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Caraban201923WT,\n author = {A.

972,4ddc1497ad01a799f0b7ccbe0d45c5a047682fd5,The utility of artificial intelligence in suicide risk prediction and the management of suicidal behaviors,"Objective: Suicide is a growing public health concern with a global prevalence of approximately 800,000 deaths per year. The current process of evaluating suicide risk is highly subjective, which can limit the efficacy and accuracy of prediction efforts. Consequently, suicide detection strategies are shifting toward artificial intelligence platforms that can identify patterns within ‘big data’ to generate risk algorithms that can determine the effects of risk (and protective) factors on suicide outcomes, predict suicide outbreaks and identify at-risk individuals or populations. In this review, we summarize the role of artificial intelligence in optimizing suicide risk prediction and behavior management. Methods: This paper provides a general review of the literature. A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases with coverage from January 1990 to June 2019. Results were restricted to peer-reviewed, English-language articles. Conference and dissertation proceedings, case reports, protocol papers and opinion pieces were excluded. Reference lists were also examined for additional articles of relevance. Results: At the individual level, prediction analytics help to identify individuals in crisis to intervene with emotional support, crisis and psychoeducational resources, and alerts for emergency assistance. At the population level, algorithms can identify at-risk groups or suicide hotspots, which help inform resource mobilization, policy reform and advocacy efforts. Artificial intelligence has also been used to support the clinical management of suicide across diagnostics and evaluation, medication management and behavioral therapy delivery. There could be several advantages of incorporating artificial intelligence into suicide care, which includes a time- and resource-effective alternative to clinician-based strategies, adaptability to various settings and demographics, and suitability for use in remote locations with limited access to mental healthcare supports. Conclusion: Based on the observed benefits to date, artificial intelligence has a demonstrated utility within suicide prediction and clinical management efforts and will continue to advance mental healthcare forward.",2019.0,78.0,55.0,"{'volume': '53', 'pages': '954 - 964', 'name': 'Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fonseka2019TheUO,\n author = {Trehani M Fonseka and Venkat Bhat and S.

Recently declared a human right by the United Nations, it also forms a central pillar of the USA's 21st Century Statecraft foreign policy doctrine. This article argues that although there is a clear human rights agenda present in this policy, there is also a power element which is much less discussed or acknowledged in the vast literature on Internet freedom. Through an exploration of both a short history and some important lessons learned about Internet freedom, this article demonstrates how the US Department of State has adapted to the information age in such a way as to harness individual agency (reconceptualised in policy terms as ‘civilian power’) for the promotion of state power. Although this is by no means as stable or reliable as some more conventional mechanisms, it is an expression of power that meets with few challenges to its legitimacy.",2013.0,69.0,12.0,"{'volume': '67', 'pages': '621 - 637', 'name': 'Australian Journal of International Affairs'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Carr2013InternetFH,\n author = {Madeline Carr},\n journal = {Australian Journal of International Affairs},\n pages = {621 - 637},\n title = {Internet freedom, human rights and power},\n volume = {67},\n year = {2013}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '37012097', 'name': 'Madeline Carr'}]"

Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.",2012.0,64.0,3433.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '662 - 679', 'name': 'Information, Communication & Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Boyd2012CRITICALQF,\n author = {D.

In the emerging pre-crime society, crime is conceived essentially as risk or potential loss, ordering practices are pre-emptive and security is a commodity sold for profit. Though this dichotomy oversimplifies a more complex set of changes, it captures an important temporal shift. As the intellectual offspring of the post-crime society, criminology must adapt to meet the challenges of pre-crime and security. This article examines the key features a theory of security needs to encompass. It explores the immanent capacities of criminology for change and suggests exterior intellectual resources upon which it might draw.

In this pilot study, a movie clips method has been designed to induce 5 kinds of emotion states. 90-sec corresponding ECG signal have been measured in the end of video stimulus. Heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted from ECG signal by using time-domain, frequency-domain, Poincare, and statistic analysis. Then these HRV features were used to classify different emotion states by support vectors machine (SVM). Also, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of extracted features. Briefly, in the classification for 2 emotion states (positive/negative) and 5 kinds of emotion states, the accuracy of 71.4%, 56.9% are reached, respectively.

Researchers have established that acoustic features such as pitch height, tempo, and intensity carry important emotional information in both domains. In this investigation, we examined the emotional significance of melodic and rhythmic contrasts between successive syllables or tones in speech and music, referred to as Melodic Interval Variability (MIV) and the normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI). The spoken stimuli were 96 tokens expressing the emotions of irritation, fear, happiness, sadness, tenderness, or no emotion. The music stimuli were 96 phrases, played with or without performance expression and composed with the intention of communicating the same emotions. Results showed that nPVI, but not MIV, operates similarly in music and speech. Spoken stimuli, but not musical stimuli, were characterized by changes in MIV as a function of intended emotion.

984,4f309712e705210df5695240a5d5fb53ea1f8641,Counterfactual Explanations Without Opening the Black Box: Automated Decisions and the GDPR,"There has been much discussion of the right to explanation in the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and its existence, merits, and disadvantages. Implementing a right to explanation that opens the black box of algorithmic decision-making faces major legal and technical barriers. Explaining the functionality of complex algorithmic decision-making systems and their rationale in specific cases is a technically challenging problem. Some explanations may offer little meaningful information to data subjects, raising questions around their value. Explanations of automated decisions need not hinge on the general public understanding how algorithmic systems function. Even though such interpretability is of great importance and should be pursued, explanations can, in principle, be offered without opening the black box. Looking at explanations as a means to help a data subject act rather than merely understand, one could gauge the scope and content of explanations according to the specific goal or action they are intended to support. From the perspective of individuals affected by automated decision-making, we propose three aims for explanations: (1) to inform and help the individual understand why a particular decision was reached, (2) to provide grounds to contest the decision if the outcome is undesired, and (3) to understand what would need to change in order to receive a desired result in the future, based on the current decision-making model. We assess how each of these goals finds support in the GDPR. We suggest data controllers should offer a particular type of explanation, unconditional counterfactual explanations, to support these three aims. These counterfactual explanations describe the smallest change to the world that can be made to obtain a desirable outcome, or to arrive at the closest possible world, without needing to explain the internal logic of the system.",2017.0,21.0,1641.0,{'name': 'Cybersecurity'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Wachter2017CounterfactualEW,\n author = {Sandra Wachter and B.

We introduce a system that implements a passive interaction loop as part of narrative generation, monitoring users' physiological responses to an on-going narrative visualization and using these to adapt the subsequent development of character relationships, narrative focus and pacing. Idiomatic cinematographic techniques applied to the visualization utilize existing theories of establishing characteristic emotional tone and viewer expectations to foster additional user response.

Domains may be contingent on different neuropsychological processing that may vary with age. Behavioral indices were measured in three age groups, to detect differences in the neuropsychological processing allegedly involved in the evaluation of rule transgressions in different domains. Acceptance of the transgressions was also investigated. Twenty-four children, 32 early adolescents, and 31 adolescents judged acceptability of rule transgressions when an authority figure allowed the transgression. Across age, moral-rule transgressions were less accepted and took significantly longer to be evaluated. In evaluating moral rule scenarios, children had the longest reaction times. Older adolescents took the least amount of time evaluating socio-conventional rule scenarios. Results suggest differences in the neuropsychological processing underlying decision making for moral and socio-conventional domains and that rule comprehension and distinction amongst domains increase by age.",2019.0,23.0,2.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Brain Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Caravita2019BehavioralIO,\n author = {S.

We develop an EEG dataset acquired from 15 subjects. Each subject performs the experiments twice at the interval of a few days. DBNs are trained with differential entropy features extracted from multichannel EEG data. We examine the weights of the trained DBNs and investigate the critical frequency bands and channels. Four different profiles of 4, 6, 9, and 12 channels are selected. The recognition accuracies of these four profiles are relatively stable with the best accuracy of 86.65%, which is even better than that of the original 62 channels. The critical frequency bands and channels determined by using the weights of trained DBNs are consistent with the existing observations. In addition, our experiment results show that neural signatures associated with different emotions do exist and they share commonality across sessions and individuals. We compare the performance of deep models with shallow models. The average accuracies of DBN, SVM, LR, and KNN are 86.08%, 83.99%, 82.70%, and 72.60%, respectively.",2015.0,61.0,1060.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '162-175', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zheng2015InvestigatingCF,\n author = {Wei-Long Zheng and Bao-Liang Lu},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development},\n pages = {162-175},\n title = {Investigating Critical Frequency Bands and Channels for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition with Deep Neural Networks},\n volume = {7},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3108302', 'name': 'Wei-Long Zheng'}, {'authorId': '1715839', 'name': 'Bao-Liang Lu'}]"

Given the complex nature of human brain signals, emotion recognition and regulation are still challenging problems. By emphasizing and aiming to improve the human living, how could be possible to prevent emotional or behavioral disorder in children in their early age? Therefore, it is essential to investigate the children’s emotions. In this study, we present a mechanism to regulate children’s emotions. Over 40 subjects’ EEG data were collected and performed a late-positive-potential (LPP) analysis in EEGLAB.

The approach is based on standard speech recognition technology using hidden semi-continuous Markov models. Both the selection of low level features and the design of the recognition system are addressed. Results are given on speaker dependent emotion recognition using the Spanish corpus of INTERFACE Emotional Speech Synthesis Database. The accuracy recognising seven different emotions—the six ones defined in MPEG-4 plus neutral style—exceeds 80% using the best combination of low level features and HMM structure. This result is very similar to that obtained with the same database in subjective evaluation by human judges. Dealing with the speaker’s emotion is one of the latest challenges in speech technologies. Three different aspects can be easily identified: speech recognition in the presence of emotional speech, synthesis of emotional speech, and emotion recognition. In this last case, the objective is to determine the emotional state of the speaker out of the speech samples. Possible applications include from help to psychiatric diagnosis to intelligent toys, and is a subject of recent but rapidly growing interest [1]. This paper describes the TALP researchers first approach to emotion recognition. The work is inserted in the scope of the INTERFACE project [2]. The objective of this European Commission sponsored project is “to define new models and implement advanced tools for audio-video analysis, synthesis and representation in order to provide essential technologies for the implementation of large-scale virtual and augmented environments. The work is oriented to make man-machine interaction as natural as possible, based on everyday human communication by speech, facial expressions and body gestures.” In the field of emotion recognition out of speech, the main goal of the INTERFACE project will be the construction of a real-time multi-lingual speaker independent emotion recogniser. For this purpose, large speech databases with recordings from many speakers and languages are needed. As these resources are not available yet, a reduced problem will be addressed first: emotion recognition in multi-speaker language dependent conditions.

In this paper, we propose a modular framework for human facial emotions’ recognition. The framework consists of two machine learning algorithms (for detection and classification) that could be trained offline for real-time applications. Initially, we detect faces in the images by exploring the AdaBoost cascade classifiers. We then extract neighborhood difference features (NDF), which represent the features of a face based on localized appearance information. The NDF models different patterns based on the relationships between neighboring regions themselves instead of considering only intensity information. The study is focused on the seven most important facial expressions that are extensively used in day-to-day life. However, due to the modular design of the framework, it can be extended to classify N number of facial expressions. For facial expression classification, we train a random forest classifier with a latent emotional state that takes care of the mis-/false detection. Additionally, the proposed method is independent of gender and facial skin color for emotion recognition. Moreover, due to the intrinsic design of NDF, the proposed method is illumination and orientation invariant. We evaluate our method on different benchmark datasets and compare it with five reference methods. In terms of accuracy, the proposed method gives 13% and 24% better results than the reference methods on the static facial expressions in the wild (SFEW) and real-world affective faces (RAF) datasets, respectively.",2020.0,60.0,32.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '6', 'name': 'Informatics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Alreshidi2020FacialER,\n author = {Abdulrahman Alreshidi and M.

As opposed to many traditional computer games, users are not expected to manipulate control devices in a skillful manner to win the game.

The first is the emotion regulation (ER) tradition, which focuses on the processes which permit individuals to influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express these emotions. The second is the emotional intelligence (EI) tradition, which focuses—among other things—on individual differences in ER. To integrate these two traditions, we employed the process model of ER (Gross, 1998b) to review the literature on EI. Two key findings emerged. First, high EI individuals shape their emotions from the earliest possible point in the emotion trajectory and have many strategies at their disposal. Second, high EI individuals regulate their emotions successfully when necessary but they do so flexibly, thereby leaving room for emotions to emerge. We argue that ER and EI traditions stand to benefit substantially from greater integration.",2015.0,254.0,349.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Peña-Sarrionandia2015IntegratingER,\n author = {Ainize Peña-Sarrionandia and Moïra Mikolajczak and J.

A key regulatory tool since 1978 is the annual designation of county air quality attainment status. Nonattainment status triggers specific equipment requirements, with the severity and enforcement of regulations rising with plant size. The differential in regulation favors attainment areas, reducing births for polluting industries in nonattainment areas by 26–45 percent. Industries and sectors with bigger plants are affected the most, shifting industrial structure toward less regulated single‐plant firms. Large preregulation plants do benefit from grand‐fathering provisions, but both grandfathering and shifts to small‐scale new plants contribute to environmental degradation.",1997.0,28.0,643.0,"{'volume': '108', 'pages': '379 - 421', 'name': 'Journal of Political Economy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Becker1997EffectsOA,\n author = {Randy A.

Mobile health (mHealth) technology has the potential to intervene at various points in the emotion regulation process of adolescent mothers to provide them support for more adaptive emotional and behavioral regulation in the course of their daily life. Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the acceptability, feasibility, use patterns, and mechanisms by which a mobile technology used as an adjunct to in-person, provider-delivered sessions fostered adolescent mothers’ adaptive emotion regulation strategies under real-life conditions. Methods: Participants (N=49) were enrolled in the intervention condition of a larger pilot study of homeless adolescent mothers living in group-based shelters. The mHealth technology. Calm Mom, consisted of a mobile app and a wrist-worn sensorband for the ambulatory measurement and alerting of increased electrodermal activity (EDA), a physiological measurement of stress. We examined logs of mobile app activity and conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with a subsample (N=10) of participants. Qualitative data analysis was guided by the theoretical frames of the intervention and a technology acceptance model and included an analysis of emerging themes and concepts. Results: Overall, participants indicated that one or more of the elements of Calm Mom supported their ability to effectively regulate their emotions in the course of their daily life in ways that were consonant with the intervention’s theoretical model. For many adolescent mothers, the app became an integral tool for managing stress. Due to technical challenges, fewer participants received sensorband alerts; however, those who received alerts reported high levels of acceptability as the technology helped them to identify their emotions and supported them in engaging in more adaptive behaviors during real-life stressful situations with their children, peers, and family members. Conclusions: Calm Mom is a promising technology for providing theoretically driven behavioral intervention strategies during real-life stressful moments among a highly vulnerable population.

This issue is increasingly important in a world where functional international regimes proliferate to address globalization and national interdependence without any overarching legal hierarchy. The article makes three core claims in contradistinction to the existing literature. The first and primary claim is that international hard and soft law instruments can serve not only as alternatives or complements, but also as antagonists in many situations. The second, related claim is that this interaction has particular implications in a fragmented international law system, affecting the very nature of international hard and soft law regimes and their purported advantages. The interaction of hard and soft law regimes can lead to the hardening of soft law regimes, resulting in more strategic bargaining and reducing their purported advantages of consensus-building through information-sharing and persuasion; and it can lead to the softening of hard law regimes, resulting in reduced legal certainty and predictability, especially where there is distributive conflict between powerful states. The third and final claim is that the interaction of hard and soft law is not a binary either/or question, but one of specifying the conditions under which we can expect actors to employ hard and soft law as alternatives, complements or antagonists. The existing literature is not wrong in focusing on how hard and soft law may be employed as complements, but this literature tells only part of the story. The article provides an overarching theoretical framework for understanding the conditions under which states and other actors choose to employ hard and soft law in different ways, emphasizing the importance of distributive conflict among countries and their constituencies and the rise of regime complexes as conditions favorable to the use of hard and soft law as antagonists.",2009.0,1.0,278.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Shaffer2009HardVS,\n author = {G.

However, an alternative model that integrates the nine dimensions in two second-order factors shows appropriate global fit indices and has interesting implications.

1039,5406e2a25aafb558be8d11ec817075ab2378f85e,Advertisers Theories of Consumers: Why Use Negative Emotions to Sell?,"This paper explores the views of advertising professionals regarding consumers, and uses them as a framework to compare practitioner and academic theories regarding negative emotional appeals in advertising. We identify three broad views of consumers that appear to guide advertisers when they develop ads: (1) a “desensitized consumer” who pays little attention to advertising; (2) a “sophisticated consumer” who is conscious of advertisers’ persuasive intentions and skilled at recognizing specific tactics, and; (3) a “tribal consumer” who is driven by a fundamental need to be accepted as part of a larger group. In addition to identifying areas of agreement and discrepancy between practitioner and academic theories, our research exposes interesting limitations in the working theories of advertising professionals. We also argue that dialogue between academics and practitioners provides an opportunity to enhance advertising theory and practice, and suggest that our approach could be widely applied for this purpose. When seeking to persuade consumers and stir them to action, advertising professionals select tactics based on their understanding of the effects these tactics are likely to produce. It follows, then, that the design of real-world ads is not necessarily driven by formal academic theory, but by the beliefs held by these professionals about the consequences of using various tactics and the moderating conditions that make such techniques more or less effective. Notwithstanding this fact–and in spite of the occasional bemoaning of it in the literature–there have been relatively few efforts to study the implicit theories of advertising professionals regarding “what works,” and compare these to the research-based models developed by academics (Kover 1995, is a notable exception). This paper helps to address this shortcoming by exploring general views of advertising agency creative staff regarding consumers, and using these as an organizing framework to compare practitioner and academic theories in an important but under-researched domain–namely, the use of negative emotions in advertising. Such efforts to tap into the minds of practitioners are helpful for a variety of reasons–some less apparent than others. Most directly, they offer insight into the thinking that drives marketing practice. This is useful in its own right as a descriptor of prevailing industry sentiment on how best to influence consumers, since practitioners may hold different views from academics despite employing the same terminology (Cornelissen 2002). Moreover, observing such sentiment and its changes over time provides a basis for explaining the emergence and relative prevalence of specific advertising tactics and types of appeals in the marketplace. This can serve, among other things, as a source of guidance for public policymakers and social scientists seeking to draw connections between advertising and its impact on society. A less direct but equally important benefit is that the implicit theories of advertisers offer a fresh and distinctly different perspective on the nature of consumers and their response to negativeemotion appeals. While they can scarcely be characterized as superior to formal academic models, practitioner theories have the virtue of a very different set of strengths and limitations: Although they are data- rather than theory-driven and only informally and subjectively tested, they are also descriptive of behavior in a naturalistic setting, based on extensive replication across a wide variety of product categories and ad types, and pragmatic with respect to their implications. Moreover, practitioner theories are not usually designed to abstract from the particular to the general, so they do not tend to disregard finer aspects of the phenomenon as academic theories often do, and capture insights that the latter may overlook (Brinberg and Hirschman 1986). As a final and added benefit, practitioner theories also tend to be grounded in the response of real audiences rather than student subjects, making them a useful “reality check” on academic theories that are based on student data. The task of identifying and cataloging the full range of these practitioner theories is a daunting one. Accordingly, for the purposes of this paper we were somewhat less ambitious: After eliciting general comments regarding the nature of consumers, we probed advertising creative staff about their theories in a very specific domain in which the authors had some experience–the effectiveness of using negative emotions in advertising, and the conditions under which such a tactic might be more or less effective. This is a promising area to explore, in large part because appeals which seek to evoke negative emotions represent an increasingly common (Huhmann and Brotherton 1997) but under-researched advertising tactic. Just as importantly, the academic literature has struggled to adequately specify the conditions under which such approaches will be more or less effective. The paper begins with a brief review of the academic literature on the use of negative emotional appeals in advertising, in order to provide context for our research and set the stage for our own findings. We then present the results of our phenomenological interviews with advertising creative personnel, organized around three main views of consumers that emerged from these informants. Based on these findings, we propose a conceptual framework that summarizes these practitioner theories-in-use and relates them to their academic counterparts, with the goal of identifying commonalities and inconsistencies that suggest avenues for future research. We then conclude with a discussion of the implications of our research for advertising theory in general, and for the effectiveness of negative-emotion appeals in particular.",2005.0,43.0,29.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': 'ACR North American Advances'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cotte2005AdvertisersTO,\n author = {June Cotte and Robin J.

A qualitative study of a bill-collection organization was used to identify norms about the emotions that collectors are expected to convey to debtors and the means used by the organization to maintain such norms given that collectors' expressed emotions are simultaneously influenced by their inner feelings. These data indicate that collectors are selected, socialized, and rewarded for following the general norm of conveying urgency (high arousal with a hint of irritation) to debtors. Collectors are further socialized and rewarded to adjust their expressed emotions in response to variations in debtor demeanor. These contingent norms sometimes clash with collectors' feelings toward debtors. Bill collectors are taught to cope with such emotive dissonance by using cognitive appraisals that help them become emotionally detached from debtors and by releasing unpleasant feelings without communicating these emotions to debtors.

This paper describes a computational model of the appraisal process, implemented within the broader context of a cognitive agent architecture. A particular focus here is on modeling the interacting influences of states and traits on perception and cognition, including their effects on the appraisal process itself. These effects are modeled by manipulating a series of architecture parameters, such as the speed and processing capacity of the individual modules. The paper presents results of an evaluation experiment modeling the behavior of three types of agents: ‘normal’, ‘anxious’, and ‘aggressive’. The appraisal model generated different affective appraisals of the same set of external circumstances for the different agent types, resulting in distinct emotions, and eventually leading to observable differences in behavior.

In this paper we present a clinical protocol for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD) based on the ubiquitous use of a biofeedback enhanced virtual reality (VR) system: the protocol also includes the use of a mobile exposure system allowing patients to perform the virtual experience in an outpatient setting.

In evolutionary theories, emotions are thought to prepare an organism for action. The interplay of acoustic environments, emotions, and evolutionary needs are currently subject to discussion in soundscape research. Universal definitions of emotion and its nature are currently missing, but there seems to be a fundamental consensus that emotions are internal, evanescent, mostly conscious, relational, manifest in different forms, and serve a purpose. Research in this area is expanding, particularly in regards to the context-related, affective, and emotional processing of environmental stimuli. A number of studies present ways to determine the nature of emotions elicited by a soundscape and to measure these reliably. Yet the crucial question—which basic and complex emotions are triggered and how they relate to affective appraisal—has still not been conclusively answered. To help frame research on this topic, an overview of the theoretical background is presented that applies emotion theory to soundscape. Two latent fundamental dimensions are often found at the center of theoretical concepts of emotion: valence and arousal. These established universal dimensions can also be applied in the context of emotions that are elicited by soundscapes. Another, and perhaps more familiar, parallel is found between emotion and music. However, acoustic environments are more subtle than musical arrangements, rarely applying the compositional and artistic considerations frequently used in music. That said, the measurement of emotion in the context of soundscape studies is only of additional value if some fundamental inquiries are sufficiently answered: To what extent does the reporting act itself alter emotional responses? Are all important affective qualities consciously accessible and directly measurable by self-reports? How can emotion related to the environment be separated from affective predisposition? By means of a conceptual analysis of relevant soundscape publications, the consensus and conflicts on these fundamental questions in the light of soundscape theory are highlighted and needed research actions are framed. The overview closes with a proposed modification to an existing, standardized framework to include the meaning of emotion in the design of soundscapes.",2020.0,93.0,25.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fiebig2020AssessmentsOA,\n author = {A.

During a cold-pressor pain induction, 63 Ss were instructed either to concentrate on their room at home (distraction), to pay close attention to their hand sensations (monitoring), or to remove awareness of those sensations from mind (suppression). Two min of postpressor pain ratings showed that monitoring produced the most rapid recovery from the pain and that suppression produced the slowest. Suppression also contaminated the interpretation of a subsequent somatic stimulation; later in the experimental hour, Ss who had suppressed their cold-pressor discomfort rated an innocuous vibration as more unpleasant than did other Ss.

In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills.

Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far.

We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.",2018.0,87.0,1191.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '155 - 172', 'name': 'Journal of Service Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2018ArtificialII,\n author = {Ming-Hui Huang and R.

Purpose
This study aims to investigate the impact of both physical and personality-related anthropomorphic features of an artificial intelligence service robot on the cognitive and affective appraisals and acceptance of consumers during service delivery.


Design/methodology/approach
The proposed hypotheses that investigate the effects of service robots’ physical appearance on the emphasis consumers place on each evaluation criteria they use in determining their willingness to accept the use of service robots in service delivery and the moderating role of sense of humor are tested by conducting two studies using scenario-based experiments.


Findings
The results show that humanlike appearance leads to higher performance expectancy, mascot-like appearance generates higher positive emotions and machine-like appearance results in higher effort expectancy. The effects of humanlike and mascot-like appearances on consumer acceptance are moderated by the sense of humor of service robots. However, the sense of humor effect is attenuated with a machine-like appearance owing to the lack of anthropomorphism.


Practical implications
This study provides crucial insights for hospitality managers who plan to use service robots in service delivery. The findings highlight the key roles of appearance type and sense of humor of service robots in influencing the appraisals and acceptance of consumers regarding the use of service robots in service delivery.


Originality/value
This study focuses on comparing the effects of traditional and mascot-like appearances of service robots on consumer appraisals and identifies sense of humor as a cute anthropomorphized personality trait of service robots.

Besides, the article shows how the photography club implements such goals, as well as evaluates the effectiveness of its activities. The educational aim of the photography club was to familiarize persons with MSDs with the basic types of working with digital photography and basic computer programmes that enable processing of digital information; to develop their knowledge about the photography and design business, computer skills and independent work skills. The experimental group (EG) consists of 40 leavers (18 males and 22 females) from the Vinnytsia Centre for Social Rehabilitation of Children with Special Needs “Promin”, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy and six leavers with mild mental disorders. The age requirement for EG is 14-19 years old. The control group (CG) consists of 40 persons diagnosed with CP and seven persons with mild mental disorders (23 males and 17 females). The respondents managed to study different types of shooting: portraits, landscapes, group and individual photography. The photography club used different methods: verbal methods (mini-lectures, stories, explanations, conversations); practical methods (computer exercises, independent work, role-playing games), as well as paid considerable attention to the psychological correction of persons with MSDs. Unfortunately, most options of the respondents for employment are rather passive. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare persons with MSDs for competition in the labour market through psychological training and counselling. It is also crucial to promptly inform them about the dynamics of the labour market. The international relevance of the article lies in an attempt to adjust available electronic and software technologies to labour adaptation of people with MSDs and consider neurophysiological patterns of such a process.",2021.0,38.0,27.0,{'name': 'BRAIN.

Yet the increased visibility of the technology’s risks has led to ever-louder calls for regulators to look beyond the benefits, and also secure appropriate regulation to ensure AI that is ‘trustworthy’ – i.e. legal, ethical and robust. Besides minimising those risks, such regulation could facilitate AI’s uptake, boost legal certainty, and hence also contribute to advancing countries’ position in the race. Consequently, this paper argues that the ‘race to AI’ also brings forth a ‘race to AI regulation’. After discussing the regulatory toolbox for AI and some of the challenges that regulators face when making use thereof, this paper assesses to which extent regulatory competition for AI – or its counterpart, regulatory convergence – is (1) a possibility, (2) a reality and (3) a desirability.",2019.0,33.0,42.0,{'name': 'IO: Regulation'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Smuha2019FromA,\n author = {Nathalie A.

Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.
 MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.
 RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score ≥10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.
 CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.",2001.0,27.0,19186.0,"{'volume': '16', 'pages': '606-613', 'name': 'Journal of General Internal Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kroenke2001TheP,\n author = {K.

In contrast to offline classification, feature extraction for online applications sets other requirements to the window size in which data is analyzed as the delay between a change of a person's arousal level and the reaction of an application should be as short as possible. For this purpose we compare various HRV features in order to evaluate how far window size can be decreased to enable online arousal recognition. Using data from a study where high and low arousal were induced in a game scenario, HRV features are analyzed for their discriminatory power depending on the window size using Fisher's discriminant analysis. Moreover, we use these features to train an SVM based classifier. Results indicate that for some features it is possible to use ultra-short term window sizes, i.e. window sizes shorter than the 5 minute window which has traditionally been used for short term HRV analysis.",2013.0,41.0,39.0,"{'pages': '362-368', 'name': '2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schaaff2013MeasuringEA,\n author = {Kristina Schaaff and M.

Caliskan et al. now show that machines can learn word associations from written texts and that these associations mirror those learned by humans, as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (see the Perspective by Greenwald). Why does this matter? Because the IAT has predictive value in uncovering the association between concepts, such as pleasantness and flowers or unpleasantness and insects. It can also tease out attitudes and beliefs—for example, associations between female names and family or male names and career. Such biases may not be expressed explicitly, yet they can prove influential in behavior. Science, this issue p. 183; see also p. 133 Computers can learn which words go together more or less often and can thus mimic human performance on a test of implicit bias. Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names.

This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of respiration sensing systems. After several systematic searches in scientific repositories, the 198 most relevant papers in this field were analyzed in detail. Different items were examined: sensing technique and sensor, respiration parameter, sensor location and size, general system setup, communication protocol, processing station, energy autonomy and power consumption, sensor validation, processing algorithm, performance evaluation, and analysis software. As a result, several trends and the remaining research challenges of respiration sensors were identified. Long-term evaluations and usability tests should be performed. Researchers designed custom experiments to validate the sensing systems, making it difficult to compare results. Therefore, another challenge is to have a common validation framework to fairly compare sensor performance. The implementation of energy-saving strategies, the incorporation of energy harvesting techniques, the calculation of volume parameters of breathing, or the effective integration of respiration sensors into clothing are other remaining research efforts. Addressing these and other challenges outlined in the paper is a required step to obtain a feasible, robust, affordable, and unobtrusive respiration sensing system.",2020.0,277.0,53.0,"{'volume': '20', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vanegas2020SensingSF,\n author = {Erik Vanegas and R.

There is no doubt that the digital environment has enormous potential for the empowerment of children and their exercise of the UNCRC rights. Yet, children (and their parents) are expected to make difficult decisions about whether or not or how to use platforms, devices and services that function in complex and opaque manners and whose impact on the rights of the child are difficult to grasp. This is especially the case for data- and advertising-driven practices that intentionally deceive or manipulate children or that are based on pervasive tracking and inferences about children's behaviour, attention and emotions. Based on a legal study of the UNCRC, legislation and policy documents at UN, Council of Europe and European Union level, and scholarship, this article studies the extent to which duties and responsibilities rest on policymakers, platforms and service providers and regulators to uphold the best interests of the child as a primary consideration (Article 3 (1) UNCRC) and what this means for the digital spaces in which children grow up. In particular, the article explores how the application of the precautionary principle might better serve the best interests of the child and how this might require legal restrictions on certain practices, enhanced responsibilities for public and private actors, and stronger enforcement by regulators.",2021.0,39.0,2.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '128 - 145', 'name': 'Nordic Journal of Human Rights'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lievens2021GrowingUW,\n author = {E.

Participants rated each video in terms of the levels of arousal, valence, like/dislike, dominance, and familiarity. For 22 of the 32 participants, frontal face video was also recorded. A novel method for stimuli selection is proposed using retrieval by affective tags from the last.fm website, video highlight detection, and an online assessment tool. An extensive analysis of the participants' ratings during the experiment is presented. Correlates between the EEG signal frequencies and the participants' ratings are investigated. Methods and results are presented for single-trial classification of arousal, valence, and like/dislike ratings using the modalities of EEG, peripheral physiological signals, and multimedia content analysis. Finally, decision fusion of the classification results from different modalities is performed.

Five scales (of four items each) measure conceptually distinct aspects of problem-focused coping (active coping, planning, suppression of competing activities, restraint coping, seeking of instrumental social support); five scales measure aspects of what might be viewed as emotional-focused coping (seeking of emotional social support, positive reinterpretation, acceptance, denial, turning to religion); and three scales measure coping responses that arguably are less useful (focus on and venting of emotions, behavioral disengagement, mental disengagement). Study 1 reports the development of scale items. Study 2 reports correlations between the various coping scales and several theoretically relevant personality measures in an effort to provide preliminary information about the inventory's convergent and discriminant validity.

However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations’ investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.",2020.0,167.0,224.0,"{'volume': '85', 'pages': '131 - 151', 'name': 'Journal of Marketing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Puntoni2020ConsumersAA,\n author = {S.

However, much evidence challenges this view, raising the question of when “Economic Man” dominates the outcome of social interactions, and when bounded rationality or other-regarding preferences dominate. Here we show that strategic incentives are the key to answering this question. A minority of self-regarding individuals can trigger a “noncooperative” aggregate outcome if their behavior generates incentives for the majority of other-regarding individuals to mimic the minority's behavior. Likewise, a minority of other-regarding individuals can generate a “cooperative” aggregate outcome if their behavior generates incentives for a majority of self-regarding people to behave cooperatively. Similarly, in strategic games, aggregate outcomes can be either far from or close to Nash equilibrium if players with high degrees of strategic thinking mimic or erase the effects of others who do very little strategic thinking. Recently developed theories of other-regarding preferences and bounded rationality explain these findings and provide better predictions of actual aggregate behavior than does traditional economic theory.",2006.0,63.0,597.0,"{'volume': '311', 'pages': '47 - 52', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Camerer2006WhenD,\n author = {Colin Camerer and E.

It calls for the collection of information, its storage, examination and – as a rule – its transmission. It is a distinguishing feature of 
modernity, though until the 1980s the centrality of surveillance to the making of our world had been underestimated in social analysis. Over the years surveillance has become increasingly systematic and embedded in everyday life, particularly as state 
(and, latterly, supra-state) agencies and corporations have 
strengthened and consolidated their positions. More and more we are surveilled in quite routine activities, as we make telephone calls, pay by debit card, walk into a store and into the path of security cameras, or enter a library through electronic turnstiles. It is important that this routine character of much surveillance is registered, since commentators so often focus exclusively on the dramatic manifestations of surveillance such as communications interceptions and spy satellites in pursuit of putative and deadly enemies. In recent decades, aided by innovations in information and communications technologies (ICTs), surveillance has expanded 
and deepened its reach enormously.",2007.0,0.0,56.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ball2007TheIO,\n author = {K. Ball and F.

1128,5b936a52f56a3390f7355c5e29cec63cbdba3a0b,Mood detection from daily conversational speech using denoising autoencoder and LSTM,"In current studies, an extended subjective self-report method is generally used for measuring emotions. Even though it is commonly accepted that speech emotion perceived by the listener is close to the intended emotion conveyed by the speaker, research has indicated that there still remains a mismatch between them. In addition, the individuals with different personalities generally have different emotion expressions. Based on the investigation, in this study, a support vector machine (SVM)-based emotion model is first developed to detect perceived emotion from daily conversational speech.

However, the existing methods cannot rely on the common smart bracelets or watches for emotion monitoring in daily life. To address this issue, our study proposes a method for emotional recognition using heart rate data from a wearable smart bracelet. A ‘neutral + target’ pair emotion stimulation experimental paradigm was presented, and a dataset of heart rate from 25 subjects was established, where neutral plus target emotion (neutral, happy, and sad) stimulation video pairs from China’s standard Emotional Video Stimuli materials (CEVS) were applied to the recruited subjects. Normalized features from the data of target emotions normalized by the baseline data of neutral mood were adopted. Emotion recognition experiment results approved the effectiveness of ‘neutral + target’ video pair simulation experimental paradigm, the baseline setting using neutral mood data, and the normalized features, as well as the classifiers of Adaboost and GBDT on this dataset. This method will promote the development of wearable consumer electronic devices for monitoring human emotional moods.",2020.0,33.0,82.0,"{'volume': '20', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Shu2020WearableER,\n author = {Lin Shu and Y.

It explains how, once these are put aside, an HCI perspective can help define interaction between AI and users that can enhance rather than substitute one important aspect of human life: creativity. Key to developing such creative interactions are abstractions and grammars of action and other notions; the article explores the history of these in HCI and how they are to be used in the contemporary interaction and design space, in relation to AI.

Policymakers, both domestically and abroad, now face many new challenges influencing the secondary market’s effectiveness as a generator of economic growth and stability. Faced with these rapid structural changes, many are quick to denounce high frequency trading as opportunistic and parasitic. This article, however, instead argues that while high frequency trading presents certain general risks to secondary market efficiency, liquidity, stability, and integrity, the practice encompasses a wide variety of strategies, many of which can enhance, not inhibit, the secondary trading market’s core goals.

This article proposes a regulatory model aimed at maximizing high frequency trading’s beneficial effects on secondary market functions. The model’s foundation, however, requires information. By analyzing more data on how high frequency traders interact with markets, regulators can assess the viability and scope of other potentially worthwhile measures targeting more general market threats. Likewise, regulators can determine who is in the best position to bear supervisory responsibility for particular trading activities: agencies, exchanges, traders, or some combination thereof. Crucially, the model also calls on regulators to share information on a global scale: trading no longer only affects a single exchange, a single asset class, or even a single country. By sharing information, regulators can enact more informed regulations, stabilize secondary markets, and minimize regulatory arbitrage. In short, high frequency trading can be a force for good, but a principled and coordinated effort is needed to ensure it fulfills that potential.",2017.0,14.0,4.0,{'name': 'Michigan Business &amp; Entrepreneurial Law Review'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Morelli2017ImplementingHF,\n author = {M.

With the popularity increase in affective computing techniques the number of emotion detection and recognition systems has risen considerably. However, despite their steady accuracy improvement, they are yet faced with application domain transferability and practical implementation issues. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for modelling individuals’ emotional states in multimedia interactive environments, while addressing the aforementioned transferability and practical implementation issues. Our method relies on a two-layer classification process to classify Arousal and Valence based on four distinct physiological sensor inputs. The first classification layer uses several regression models to normalize each of the sensor inputs across participants and experimental conditions, while also correlating each input to either Arousal or Valence. The second classification layer then employs decision trees to merge the various regression outputs into one optimal Arousal/Valence classification. The presented method not only exhibits convincing accuracy ratings – 89% for Arousal and 84% for Valence - but also presents an adaptable and practical approach at emotional state detection in interactive environment experiences.",2013.0,18.0,11.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Nogueira2013ARM,\n author = {P.

Nevertheless, there is little evidence from cross-cultural and/or cross-country studies of the simultaneous relationship between these psychological variables. The objective of this study was to address this lack of research, examining the associations between emotional intelligence, resilience and perceived stress in a cross-country context. A total sample of 696 undergraduate students from two universities in the United States and the Basque Country (an autonomous community in northern Spain) participated in the study. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the effects of emotional intelligence and resilience that may affect students’ perceived stress. The results revealed that emotional intelligence functions as a negative predictor of perceived stress through the mediating variable resilience for the American and Basque students. The findings suggest that university students with better emotional intelligence and resilience present lower perceived stress. Thus, improving emotional intelligence and resilience could prevent students from suffering perceived stress in higher education. Implications and directions for further research are discussed; in particular, it is highlighted that intervention programs that improve both EI and resilience could be helpful in reducing perceived stress.",2018.0,69.0,72.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sarrionandia2018ResilienceAA,\n author = {Ainize Sarrionandia and Estibaliz Ramos-Díaz and Oihane Fernández-Lasarte},\n journal = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n title = {Resilience as a Mediator of Emotional Intelligence and Perceived Stress: A Cross-Country Study},\n volume = {9},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '35557209', 'name': 'Ainize Sarrionandia'}, {'authorId': '1405061872', 'name': 'Estibaliz Ramos-Díaz'}, {'authorId': '1422665004', 'name': 'Oihane Fernández-Lasarte'}]"

Using a three-wave, short-term prospective design, we examined the influence of individual differences in two disparate psychophysiological measures of risk (i.e., resting frontal brain electrical activity and respiratory sinus arrhythmia) on the trajectories of extraversion and neuroticism in a sample of female adolescents (N = 55; M age = 14.02 years) exposed to child maltreatment. Adolescents exposed to child maltreatment with relatively higher left frontal absolute alpha power (i.e., lower brain activity) at rest exhibited increasing trajectories of extraversion, and adolescents exposed to child maltreatment with relatively lower respiratory sinus arrhythmia at rest displayed increasing trajectories of neuroticism over 1 year.

Based on theoretical arguments it is often assumed that the emotional effects of films exceed those of pictures, but to date this assumption has not been investigated directly. The aim of the present study was to compare pictures and films in terms of their capacity to induce emotions verified by means of explicit measures. Stimuli were (a) single pictures presented for 6 s, (b) a set of three consecutive pictures with emotionally congruent contents presented for 2 s each, (c) short film clips with a duration of 6 s. A total of 144 participants rated their emotion and arousal states following stimulus presentation. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed that the film clips and 3-picture version were as effective as the classical 1-picture method to elicit positive emotions, however, modulation toward positive valence was little. Modulation toward negative valence was more effective in general. Film clips were less effective than pictorial stimuli in producing the corresponding emotion states (all p < 0.001) and were less arousing (all p ≤ 0.02).

In Europe, a similar sentiment advances under the banner of 'subsidiarity'. One of the underlying and critical theoretical premises of these two movements is the suggestion that 'regulatory competition' among horizontally arrayed governments will generate pressures for improved governmental efficiency in the regulatory realm. Critics have suggested that rather than welfare-enhancing competitive pressures, divergent regulatory standards may instead trigger a welfare-reducing 'race toward the bottom'. In this article we argue that both race-toward-the-bottom and regulatory competition theories are overstated from a descriptive point of view and unsatisfactory from a normative perspective. Regulatory theory must reflect the diversity and complexity of the world. Optimal governance thus requires a flexible mix of competition and cooperation between government actors as well as between governmental and non-governmental actors, along both horizontal and vertical dimensions. This enriched model of 'regulatory co-opetition' recognizes that sometimes regulatory competition will prove to be advantageous but in other cases some form of collaboration will produce superior results. In a world that is pluralistic, not simplistic, a combination of regulatory competition and cooperation will almost always be optimal.",2000.0,0.0,83.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '235-255', 'name': 'Journal of International Economic Law'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Esty2000RegulatoryC,\n author = {D.

There is mounting evidence that the technology fueled by ML has the potential to detect and substantially improve treatment of complex mental disorders such as depression. We developed a framework capable of detecting depression with minimal human intervention: artificial intelligence mental evaluation (AiME). This framework consists of a short human-computer interactive evaluation that utilizes artificial intelligence, namely deep learning, and can predict whether the participant is depressed or not with satisfactory performance. Because of its ease of use, this technology can offer a viable tool for mental health professionals to identify symptoms of depression, thus enabling a faster preventative intervention. Furthermore, it may alleviate the challenge of observing and interpreting highly nuanced physiological and behavioral biomarkers of depression by providing a more objective evaluation.

1152,5dad9cf0f3e32e24e7f7c2bc1d5fcd771c2fd73c,Crisis interventions for people with borderline personality disorder.,"BACKGROUND
People with borderline personality disorder (BPD) frequently present to health services in crisis, often involving suicidal thoughts or actions. Despite this, little is known about what constitutes effective management of acute crises in this population.


OBJECTIVES
To review the evidence for the effectiveness of crisis interventions for adults with BPD in any setting. For the purposes of the review, we defined crisis intervention as 'an immediate response by one or more individuals to the acute distress experienced by another individual, which is designed to ensure safety and recovery and lasts no longer than one month.'


SEARCH METHODS
We searched the following databases in September 2011: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1948 to August Week 5 2011), MEDLINE In Process & Other Non-indexed Citations (8 September 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 36 2011), PsycINFO (1806 to September Week 1 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), Social Services Abstracts (1979 to current), Social Care Online (12 September 2011), Science Citation Index (1970 to current), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to current), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (1990 to current), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science and Humanities (1990 to current) and ZETOC Conference proceedings (12 September 2011). We searched for dissertations in WorldCat (12 September 2011), Australasian Digital Theses Program (ADTP; 12 September 2011), Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), 12 September 2011 and Theses Canada Portal (12 September 2011). We searched for trials in the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and searched reference lists from relevant literature. We contacted the 10 most published researchers in the field of BPD (as indexed by BioMed Experts), in addition to contacting topic experts, Marsha Linehan, Arnoud Arntz and Paul Links, about ongoing trials and unpublished data.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing crisis interventions with usual care or no intervention or a waiting list control for adults of any age with BPD.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles and assessed these against the inclusion criteria.


MAIN RESULTS
The search identified 15 studies, 13 of which we excluded. Reasons for exclusion were: lack of randomisation (N = 8); retrospective design (N = 2); or the intervention was a complex psychological therapy lasting longer than one month (N = 3). We identified two ongoing RCTs that met the inclusion criteria, with a combined predicted sample size of 688. These trials are ongoing and the results are therefore not included in the review, although they will be incorporated into future updates.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
A comprehensive search of the literature showed that currently there is no RCT-based evidence for the management of acute crises in people with BPD and therefore we could not reach any conclusions about the effectiveness of any single crisis intervention. High-quality, large-scale, adequately powered RCTs in this area are urgently needed.",2012.0,40.0,62.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '\n          CD009353\n        ', 'name': 'The Cochrane database of systematic reviews'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Borschmann2012CrisisIF,\n author = {R.

Although recent studies have shown animated ads to be more effective than still ads, the role played by the rate of motion in animated ads has been neglected. An experiment was designed to address this issue by focusing specifically on the physiological and psychological effects of animation speeds in Web ads. Hypotheses derived from motion effects, excitation transfer, limited capacity, and vividness effects theories were tested via a mixed-design experiment wherein participants (N = 47) were exposed to both slow-paced and fast-paced animated ads in one of two sequences (fast then slow, or slow then fast). Arousal was monitored during reception, while memory, conation, and impression formation were measured via a postexposure paper-and-pencil questionnaire.

1158,5e0b22e68e029bff835a1f197ad79e2ea3cf9a87,Ownership when AI robots do more of the work and earn more of the income,"
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine the likely impact of AI robotics technology on the labor market through the lens of comparative advantage.


Design/methodology/approach
The first section reviews the recent success of AI in outperforming humans in cognitive intense activities such as Go, poker and other strategic games, which portends a shift in comparative advantage in human brain power work to machines. It notes the potential for a portfolio of specialized computer algorithms to compete with human general intelligence in work. The analysis contributes to the debate between economists dubious about claims that AI robotics will disrupt work and futurists who expect many jobs to be fully automated in coming years. It advances three “laws of robo-economics” to guide thinking about the new technologies and presents evidence that growing robot intensity has begun to impact the job market.


Findings
The paper finds that the case for AI robotics substantially changing the world of work and the distribution of income is more compelling than the case that it will have similar impacts on wages and employment as past technological changes. It advances an ownership solution to spread the benefits of AI robot-driven automation widely.


Originality/value
To the extent that who owns the robots rules the world, it argues for a concerted social effort to widen the “who” in ownership from the few to the many. It reviews policies to expand employee ownership of their own firm and of the stream of revenue via profit-sharing and gain-sharing bonuses. But the paper notes that ensuring that growth of AI robotics benefits all through ownership will require expansion of workers’ and citizens’ stake in business broadly, through collective investment via pension funds, individual investment in mutual funds and development of sovereign wealth funds.

Methods: To investigate patients’ preferred social media networks and the type of posts they wished to see, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a single aesthetic practice of two plastic surgeons by surveying 100 consecutive patients. Results: The age of the patients averaged 44.4 years (range, 17 to 78 years). Facebook had the greatest patient use and engagement, with YouTube second in use, and Instagram second in number of engaged users. Over half used Pinterest, but with little daily engagement. Only one-fourth used Snapchat, but the percentage of users who were highly engaged was second only to Facebook. The least popular network was Twitter, with the fewest patient users and least engagement. Social media played a minor role compared with the practice’s Web site in both influencing patients to choose the practice and providing information on the day of the appointment. Patients most wanted to see posts on a plastic surgeon’s social media platform related to practice information, before-and-after photographs, and contests. Articles about plastic surgery held the least interest. Among five types of Web site content, patients expressed most interest in before-and-after photographs.

The research framework defined the meaning, models, and methods that successfully guided four waves of research to date on the nature and processes involved in human resilience. The applied framework emerged in response to urgent needs of children and families faced by adversity and those charged with helping them, resulting in guidelines for translating the unfolding but incomplete research evidence into action. The application of a resilience approach transformed practice in many fields concerned with promoting resilience in people at risk for problems, revolutionizing the mission, models, measures, and methods of practice to align with the emphasis on positive adaptation and strengths defining a resilience-based approach. Yet these interventions rarely translated back to inform and refine resilience theory in ways that would accelerate progress to promote resilience more effectively. The concluding section on translational synergy discusses the potential for a synthesis of basic and applied resilience frameworks as the next steps toward realizing the original objective and promise of resilience science.",2011.0,124.0,827.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '493 - 506', 'name': 'Development and Psychopathology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Masten2011ResilienceIC,\n author = {A.

Yet the increased visibility of the technology’s risks has led to ever-louder calls for regulators to look beyond the benefits, and also secure appropriate regulation to ensure AI that is ‘trustworthy’ – i.e. legal, ethical and robust. Besides minimising risks, such regulation could facilitate AI’s uptake, boost legal certainty, and hence also contribute to advancing countries’ position in the race. Consequently, this paper argues that the ‘race to AI’ also brings forth a ‘race to AI regulation’. After discussing the regulatory toolbox for AI and some of the challenges that regulators face when making use thereof, this paper assesses to which extent regulatory competition for AI – or its counterpart, regulatory convergence – is a possibility, a reality and a desirability.",2021.0,28.0,45.0,"{'name': 'Law, Innovation and Technology', 'pages': '57 - 84', 'volume': '13'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Smuha2021FromA,\n author = {Nathalie A.

Because of the advances in machine learning, especially with use of deep (multilayered) convolutional neural networks, artificial intelligence has undergone a transformation that has improved the quality of the predictions of the models. Recently, such deep learning algorithms have been applied to mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). In this review, the authors explain how deep learning works in the context of mammography and DBT and define the important technical challenges. Subsequently, they discuss the current status and future perspectives of artificial intelligence-based clinical applications for mammography, DBT, and radiomics. Available algorithms are advanced and approach the performance of radiologists-especially for cancer detection and risk prediction at mammography. However, clinical validation is largely lacking, and it is not clear how the power of deep learning should be used to optimize practice. Further development of deep learning models is necessary for DBT, and this requires collection of larger databases. It is expected that deep learning will eventually have an important role in DBT, including the generation of synthetic images.",2019.0,138.0,147.0,"{'pages': '\n          182627\n        ', 'name': 'Radiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Geras2019ArtificialIF,\n author = {Krzysztof J.

The study at hand will examine companies´ awareness, readiness and capability to meet this challenge taking into account the special role of SMEs. Methodology: The results of nine studies dealing with this range of topics are examined in the framework of a systematic review and compared with regard to the objective of the study at hand. Findings: The review showed that, as a rule, there is an awareness concerning the relevance of the topic. The readiness and the capability to meet this challenge exist in parts; however, they strongly depend on the enterprise size. The smaller SMEs are, the higher the risk that they will become victims instead of beneficiaries of this revolution. Originality/value : Considering different studies concerning Industry 4.0 the article gives an insight into the dependence of the Industry 4.0 readiness in reference to the company size.

Thus, a small number of discrete categories (e.g., happiness and sadness) may not reflect the subtlety and complexity of the affective states conveyed by such rich sources of information. Therefore, affective and behavioural computing researchers have recently invested increased effort in exploring how to best model, analyse, interpret and respond to the subtlety, complexity and continuity (represented along a continuum e.g., from −1 to +1) of affective behaviour in terms of latent dimensions (e.g., arousal, power and valence) and appraisals. Accordingly, this paper aims to present the current state of the art and the new challenges in automatic, dimensional and continuous analysis and synthesis of human emotional behaviour in an interdisciplinary perspective.",2011.0,122.0,296.0,"{'pages': '827-834', 'name': 'Face and Gesture 2011'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gunes2011EmotionRA,\n author = {H.

1171,5f408723bb8fc325749d2d27cdec968eade1730a,#PlasticSurgery,"Background: Social media use is growing inexorably, and there is public appetite for evidence-based information. Little is known about engagement by plastic surgeons with social media. The aim of this study was to examine posting about plastic surgery on Twitter, to best inform how board-certified plastic surgeons could use the hashtag #PlasticSurgery as a tool to educate patients and the public. Methods: A prospective analysis of 2880 “tweets” containing the words “plastic surgery” was performed. The following were assessed: identity of author, use of the hashtag #PlasticSurgery, subject matter, whether link to study was provided, and whether posts by surgeons were self-promotional or educational. Results: Social media posting about plastic surgery is dominated by the public, accounting for 70.6 percent of posts versus only 6.0 percent by plastic surgeons. Only 5.4 percent of all tweets contained the hashtag #PlasticSurgery, although almost half of those that did were by plastic surgeons. Of these, 61.3 percent of posts by plastic surgeons were about aesthetic surgery; additional posts were about basic science, patient safety, and reconstruction (13.9, 4.0, and 2.3 percent, respectively). Eighteen scientific articles were referenced, with a link to the Journal site posted in two tweets. Of posts by plastic surgeons, 37.0 percent were self-promotional. Conclusions: The American Society of Plastic Surgeons and its Journal have recognized that social media may be used to educate and engage. Board-certified plastic surgeons have a great opportunity to promote evidence-based plastic practice by means of #PlasticSurgery in the interests of supporting patients and the profession.",2016.0,19.0,116.0,"{'volume': '138', 'pages': '1354–1365', 'name': 'Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Branford2016PlasticSurgery,\n author = {O.

Students are expected to be more autonomous. To cope with these increased levels of autonomy, self-regulated learning skills might help. Previous research has shown that parents play a crucial role in students’ self-regulated learning development. However, research focusing on parental involvement during middle school and the ways in which parents support self-regulated learning at home is limited. Therefore, the present study explores the practices that parents use at home to support middle school students’ autonomy and self-regulated learning. It draws upon semi-structured interviews with eighteen families. The results show that parents mainly guide students’ learning behaviours and motivation. Additionally, parents and students can be divided into three groups based on differences in autonomy granted during learning; these groups reported varying parental practices in fostering self-regulated learning. Overall, the present study highlights the importance of parents’ educational involvement during middle school.",2019.0,99.0,12.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '261 - 279', 'name': 'Journal of Family Studies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Thomas2019ExploringSL,\n author = {V.

From the sinking of the Titanic to Hitchcock's Rear Window, from the operas of Wagner to science fiction, from Alien to the Jewish Joke, the author's acute analyses explore the ideological fantasies of wholeness and exclusion which make up human society. Zizek takes issue with analysts of the postmodern condition from Habermas to Sloterdijk, showing that the idea of a 'post-ideological' world ignores the fact that 'even if we do not take things seriously, we are still doing them'. Rejecting postmodernism's unified world of surfaces, he traces a line of thought from Hegel to Althusser and Lacan, in which the human subject is split, divided by a deep antagonism which determines social reality and through which ideology operates. Linking key psychoanalytical and philosophical concepts to social phenomena such as totalitarianism and racism, the book explores the political significance of these fantasies of control. In so doing, The Sublime Object of Ideology represents a powerful contribution to a psychoanalytical theory of ideology, as well as offering persuasive interpretations of a number of contemporary cultural formations.",1989.0,0.0,3735.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Žižek1989TheSO,\n author = {S.

Often, this token is a cryptocurrency, a digital medium of value exchange based on the distributed ledger technology. Both the number of ICOs and the amount of capital raised have exploded since 2017. Despite attracting significant attention from ventures, investors, and policy makers, little is known about the dynamics of ICOs. This initial study therefore assesses the determinants of the amount raised in 423 ICOs. Drawing on signaling theory, the study explores the role of signaling ventures' technological capabilities in ICOs. The results show that technical white papers and high-quality source codes increase the amount raised, while patents are not associated with increased amounts of funding. Exploring further determinants of the amount raised, the results indicate that some of the underlying mechanisms in ICOs resemble those found in prior research into entrepreneurial finance, while others are unique to the ICO context. The study's implications are multifold and discussed in detail. Importantly, the results enable investors to more accurately understand crucial determinants of the amount raised (e.g., technical white papers, source code quality, token supply, Ethereum-standard). This reduces the considerable uncertainty that investors face when investing in ICOs and enables more informed decision-making.",2018.0,87.0,375.0,{'name': 'DecisionSciRN: Other Investment Decision-Making (Sub-Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Fisch2018InitialCO,\n author = {Christian Fisch},\n journal = {DecisionSciRN: Other Investment Decision-Making (Sub-Topic)},\n title = {Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to Finance New Ventures},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '97695116', 'name': 'Christian Fisch'}]"

They validate the proposed framework with data from 120 companies over two time periods, and they develop strategies to help firms raise their levels of CE and EE to improve performance. They also observe that the influence of EE on CE is moderated by employee empowerment, type of firm (business-to-business [B2B] vs. business-to-consumer [B2C]), and nature of industry (manufacturing vs. service); in particular, this effect is stronger for B2B (vs. B2C) firms and service (vs. manufacturing) firms.

The role of consumer control,"Abstract The development of technology-mediated media has enabled marketers and advertisers to use personalization when interacting with customers. In this article, we explore two boundary conditions (i.e. task difficulty and relevancy) and two consumer controls (i.e. behavioral control and cognitive control) that affect the effectiveness of personalized promotions. In Experiment 1, we find that consumers working with difficult tasks exhibit higher behavioral control and higher patronage behaviors when they receive personalized than non-personalized promotions. In Experiment 2, we show that when consumers receive any promotion with irrelevant items, they exhibit higher cognitive control and higher patronage behavior with non-personalized (with many irrelevant items) than personalized (with one item) promotions. An additional test validates that behavioral and cognitive control play significant mediating roles in the relationship between contexts (i.e. task difficulty and relevancy) and patronage behaviors. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications for the development and management of personalized promotions and consumer control in new media-oriented environments.",2019.0,70.0,9.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '628 - 647', 'name': 'International Journal of Advertising'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kim2019WhenAP,\n author = {Hye-young Kim and Ji Hee Song and Jong-Ho Lee},\n journal = {International Journal of Advertising},\n pages = {628 - 647},\n title = {When are personalized promotions effective?

The broaden-and-build theory suggests that this is because positive emotions help people build lasting resources. To test this hypothesis, the authors measured emotions daily for 1 month in a sample of students (N = 86) and assessed life satisfaction and trait resilience at the beginning and end of the month. Positive emotions predicted increases in both resilience and life satisfaction. Negative emotions had weak or null effects and did not interfere with the benefits of positive emotions. Positive emotions also mediated the relation between baseline and final resilience, but life satisfaction did not. This suggests that it is in-the-moment positive emotions, and not more general positive evaluations of one's life, that form the link between happiness and desirable life outcomes. Change in resilience mediated the relation between positive emotions and increased life satisfaction, suggesting that happy people become more satisfied not simply because they feel better but because they develop resources for living well.",2009.0,48.0,1257.0,"{'volume': '9 3', 'pages': '\n          361-8\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cohn2009HappinessUP,\n author = {M.

A multi- module architecture may be employed in order to carry out the interactions. The model also has a learning mechanism to diversify behavioural patterns.

This is accompanied by physiological changes such as galvanic skin response (GSR), an indicator for emotional arousal, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), referring to vagal activity. We investigated whether the presence of a cinema audience affects these psychophysiological processes. The study was conducted in a real cinema in Berlin. Participants came twice to watch previously rated emotional film scenes eliciting amusement, anger, tenderness or fear. Once they watched the scenes alone, once in a group. We tested whether the vagal modulation in response to the mere presence of others influences explicit (reported) and implicit markers (RSA, heart rate (HR) and GSR) of emotional processes in function of solitary or collective enjoyment of movie scenes. On the physiological level, we found a mediating effect of vagal flexibility to the mere presence of others. Individuals showing a high baseline difference (alone vs. social) prior to the presentation of film, maintained higher RSA in the alone compared to the social condition. The opposite pattern emerged for low baseline difference individuals. Emotional arousal as reflected in GSR was significantly more pronounced during scenes eliciting anger independent of the social condition. On the behavioural level, we found evidence for emotion-specific effects on reported empathy, emotional intensity and Theory of Mind. Furthermore, people who decrease their RSA in response to others’ company are those who felt themselves more empathically engaged with the characters. Our data speaks in favour of a specific role of vagal regulation in response to the mere presence of others in terms of explicit empathic engagement with characters during shared filmic experience.",2019.0,84.0,15.0,"{'volume': '14', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kaltwasser2019SharingTF,\n author = {Laura Kaltwasser and Nicolas Rost and M.

1184,613eb8f9a416d05b916f4bf9d9f48b80e6e4fd1f,Self-report captures 27 distinct categories of emotion bridged by continuous gradients,"Significance Claims about how reported emotional experiences are geometrically organized within a semantic space have shaped the study of emotion. Using statistical methods to analyze reports of emotional states elicited by 2,185 emotionally evocative short videos with richly varying situational content, we uncovered 27 varieties of reported emotional experience. Reported experience is better captured by categories such as “amusement” than by ratings of widely measured affective dimensions such as valence and arousal. Although categories are found to organize dimensional appraisals in a coherent and powerful fashion, many categories are linked by smooth gradients, contrary to discrete theories. Our results comprise an approximation of a geometric structure of reported emotional experience. Emotions are centered in subjective experiences that people represent, in part, with hundreds, if not thousands, of semantic terms. Claims about the distribution of reported emotional states and the boundaries between emotion categories—that is, the geometric organization of the semantic space of emotion—have sparked intense debate. Here we introduce a conceptual framework to analyze reported emotional states elicited by 2,185 short videos, examining the richest array of reported emotional experiences studied to date and the extent to which reported experiences of emotion are structured by discrete and dimensional geometries. Across self-report methods, we find that the videos reliably elicit 27 distinct varieties of reported emotional experience. Further analyses revealed that categorical labels such as amusement better capture reports of subjective experience than commonly measured affective dimensions (e.g., valence and arousal). Although reported emotional experiences are represented within a semantic space best captured by categorical labels, the boundaries between categories of emotion are fuzzy rather than discrete. By analyzing the distribution of reported emotional states we uncover gradients of emotion—from anxiety to fear to horror to disgust, calmness to aesthetic appreciation to awe, and others—that correspond to smooth variation in affective dimensions such as valence and dominance. Reported emotional states occupy a complex, high-dimensional categorical space. In addition, our library of videos and an interactive map of the emotional states they elicit (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/emogifs/map.html) are made available to advance the science of emotion.",2017.0,133.0,494.0,"{'volume': '114', 'pages': 'E7900 - E7909', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cowen2017SelfreportC2,\n author = {Alan S.

A search of the published and unpublished literature uncovered 116 articles (the list of which is available upon request) that yielded 1653 reported associations between performance and determinants of that performance. The results indicate the determinants can be ordered in the following way in terms of the average size of their association with performance: (1) role variables, (2) skill, (3) motivation, (4) personal factors, (5) aptitude, and (6) organizational/environmental factors. When ordered according to the amount of the observed variation in correlations across studies that is real variation (i.e., not attributable to sampling error), the determinants rank as follows: (1) personal factors, (2) skill, (3) role variables, (4) aptitude, (5) motivation, and (6) organizational/environmental factors. To investigate whether the associations between each of the categories of predictors and performance could be partially accounted for by the presence of moderator variables, the results were broken out by customer type, product type, and type of dependent measure used. The results indicate that the strength of the relationship between the major determinants and salespeople's performance is affected by the type of products salespeople sell.

However, objective evaluation of the efficacy of emotion regulation and assessment of the improvement in emotion regulation ability at the individual level remain challenging. In this study, we leveraged neurofeedback training to design a real-time EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system for users to effectively regulate their emotions. Twenty healthy subjects performed 10 BCI-based neurofeedback training sessions to regulate their emotion towards a specific emotional state (positive, negative, or neutral), while their EEG signals were analyzed in real time via machine learning to predict their emotional states. The prediction results were presented as feedback on the screen to inform the subjects of their immediate emotional state, based on which the subjects could update their strategies for emotion regulation. The experimental results indicated that the subjects improved their ability to regulate these emotions through our BCI neurofeedback training. Further EEG-based spectrum analysis revealed how each emotional state was related to specific EEG patterns, which were progressively enhanced through long-term training. These results together suggested that long-term EEG-based neurofeedback training could be a promising tool for helping people with emotional or mental disorders.",2023.0,55.0,7.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '998-1011', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2023NeurofeedbackTW,\n author = {Weichen Huang and Wei Wu and Molly V.

Traditionally, interactions between humans and machines like computers do not exhibit any emotional exchanges. If we could build any system that is intelligent enough to interact with humans that involves emotions, that is, it can detect user emotions and change its behaviour accordingly, then using machines could be more effective and friendly. Many approaches have been taken to detect user emotions. Affective computing is the field that detects user emotion in a particular moment. Our approach in this paper is to detect user emotions by analysing the keyboard typing patterns of the user and the type of texts (words, sentences) typed by them. This combined analysis gives us a promising result showing a substantial number of emotional states detected from user input. Several machine learning algorithms were used to analyse keystroke timing attributes and text pattern. We have chosen keystroke because it is the cheapest and most available medium to interact with computers. We have considered seven emotional classes for classifying the emotional states. For text pattern analysis, we have used vector space model with Jaccard similarity method to classify free-text input.

Recently, the American Psychological Association has indicated that suicide prevention should be a public health priority. Suicidal ideation appears as a key variable in suicide prevention. The objective of this research was to verify the adjustment of an explanatory model for suicidal ideation, which considers the effects of cognitive emotion regulation strategies, affectivity and hopelessness. An open mode on-line sample of 2,166 Argentine participants was used and a path analysis was carried out. The results make it possible to conclude that the model presents an optimal fit (χ2 = .10, p = .75, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .01) and predicts 42% of suicidal thoughts. The model proves to be invariant based on age and gender. In conclusion, there is an importance of reducing the use of automatic strategies, such as repetitive negative thoughts of ruminative type, and increasing the use of more controlled strategies, such as reinterpretation or planning.",2019.0,59.0,25.0,"{'volume': '22', 'name': 'The Spanish Journal of Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kanter2019TowardsAE,\n author = {Pablo Ezequiel Flores Kanter and Zoilo Emilio García-Batista and L.

Assessing EU data governance implications of out of home appraisal based emotional AI,"The boundaries of personal space and borders of bodily integrity are being tested by deployments of emotional artificial intelligence (EAI) in private and public spaces. By means of sensing, seeing and machine learning of facial expressions, voice, gaze, gestures and range of physiological signals (heart rate, skin conductivity and temperature, muscle activity, body temperature, respiration and other bio-signals), the goal is to make interior emotional life machine-readable for personal, commercial and security objectives.In this paper, we focus on computer vision and face-based analytics to consider the nature, method and development of facial coding, the potential demise of existing approaches, and the rise of even more invasive methods. Criticisms of facial coding have long existed, but recent scholarship and industrial development signals a lack of confidence in ‘basic emotions’ and a turn to appraisal-based accounts of emotion. This inevitably entails use of data about internal physiological and experiential contexts, but also factors external to an individual.

Much of the progress has come from studies of fear, and especially fear conditioning. This work has pinpointed the amygdala as an important component of the system involved in the acquisition, storage, and expression of fear memory and has elucidated in detail how stimuli enter, travel through, and exit the amygdala. Some progress has also been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie fear conditioning, and recent studies have also shown that the findings from experimental animals apply to the human brain. It is important to remember why this work on emotion succeeded where past efforts failed. It focused on a psychologically well-defined aspect of emotion, avoided vague and poorly defined concepts such as ""affect,"" ""hedonic tone,"" or ""emotional feelings,"" and used a simple and straightforward experimental approach. With so much research being done in this area today, it is important that the mistakes of the past not be made again.

At the same time, a person is still a self-organizing system that has a high degree of adaptability. The study aims to consider creativity, talent and genius in human beings, identify their grounds for subordination and manifestation and justify the content of their demarcation in a systemic aspect. The system-parametric method developed by A. Uyemov allows revealing the nature of the creative principle of a person. The basis of this method is a dual definition of the system to which any object can be represented. When defining an object, the concept, structure and substrate are highlighted in it. This hierarchy constitutes integrity in the system under consideration. A systemic model of several objects is proposed to determine the demarcation lines in the properties of person, which are creative, talented and ingenious: a person is a biological creature; a person is a creative human being. Sub-systems are distinguished: “creative and talented people”, “creative, talented and genius people”. Isolating subsystems helps to analyze demarcation lines. Using the system parameters “minimum-non-minimum” systems and “strong-weak” systems shows that the “creative person” system is minimal and strong, as well as more complex than the “human-biological being” system. The “creative person” system includes the other powerful systems listed above.

However, mechanisms for intervention effects have not been fully determined. This study tested emotion regulation strategies as mediators of intervention effects in a sample of younger women treated for breast cancer, a group at risk for psychological distress. We focused on two distinct strategies targeted by the intervention—rumination and self-kindness—and further examined the broader construct of mindfulness as a potential mediator. Method: Women (n = 71) with Stage 0-III breast cancer diagnosed at or before age 50 who had completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to a 6-week mindfulness intervention or wait-list control group. Assessments occurred at study entry, postintervention, and a 3-month follow-up. Results: In single mediator analyses, increases in self-kindness (CIB [−7.83, −1.93]), decreases in rumination (CIB [−5.05, −.31]), and increases in mindfulness (CIB [−6.58, −.82]) each mediated reductions in depressive symptoms from pre- to postintervention. Increases in self-kindness also mediated reductions in perceived stress (CIB [−5.37, −.62]) from pre- to postintervention, and increases in self-kindness (CIB [−5.67, −.22]) and in mindfulness (CIB [−5.51, −.16]) each mediated intervention effects on perceived stress from preintervention to 3-month follow-up. In multiple mediator analysis, only self-kindness mediated intervention effects on depressive symptoms from pre- to postintervention (CIB [−6.41, −.61]), and self-kindness and mindfulness together mediated intervention effects on perceived stress from preintervention to follow-up (CIB [−6.77, −.35]).

1217,63ef22bf7ae5b02bfc49bc3d80d0a2bda63f54c9,Artificial intelligence in personnel management: the development of APM model,"
Purpose
Managers have mixed views of how artificial intelligence (AI) affects personnel management (PM). The purpose of this paper is to identify potential knowledge gap and bring new insights to the AI-personnel-management literature.


Design/methodology/approach
Both applicability and theoretical perspectives are adopted to critically discuss the constraint and opportunity of AI in PM. Tables and narrative analysis are used to clarify the role of AI in managerial practices.


Findings
Research findings have helped to develop a new model titled AI in Personnel Management (APM). The APM model unfolds itself in three levels, followed by potential outcome. The three levels comprise “organizational, managerial and individual job levels,” and the outcome comprises “organizational performance, employees’ well-being and staff turnover rate”.


Research limitations/implications
The APM model helps managers to understand the implication of AI in their workplace. With better understanding of AI’s implication, managers are more likely to develop appropriate AI-driven managerial policies, which in turn benefit employees and their organizations. The APM model acts as a reference guide, helping managers to evaluate the AI’s constraint and opportunity in their managerial practices.


Originality/value
The APM model is valuable and informative to the academic researchers, as it has first responded to Malik et al. (2019)’s call (re: the absence of AI and management literature), and, more importantly, it has advanced the knowledge of AI–management relationship, supporting scholars to further understand the role of AI in PM.

1222,64a2261b178f09e19a4dbbe5296f9f15cee053e3,EEGNet: a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based brain–computer interfaces,"Objective. Brain–computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic feature extraction and classification, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible. Approach. In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and cross-subject classification, to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). Main results. We show that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than, and achieves comparably high performance to, the reference algorithms when only limited training data is available across all tested paradigms. In addition, we demonstrate three different approaches to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the learned features. Significance. Our results suggest that EEGNet is robust enough to learn a wide variety of interpretable features over a range of BCI tasks.

Transcribed interviews with 28 women and 22 men from the Child Guidance Study, conducted over 34 years, were reviewed and rated for frequency of interaction, satisfaction with the relationship, and degree of emotional closeness in 6 types of relationships. Interaction frequency with acquaintances and close friends declined from early adulthood on. Interaction frequency with spouses and siblings increased across the same time period and emotional closeness increased throughout adulthood in relationships with relatives and close friends.

The present article aims to verify the mediation role of resilience on the relationship between workplace bullying and strain. A total of 88 Romanian employees participated in the present study by completing online questionnaires referring to workplace bullying, resilience, and strain. The results showed the mediation role of resilience on the relationship between workplace bullying and physical strain in that the direct relationship between workplace bullying and physical strain decreases when resilience is introduced as a mediator. These results showed that those employees who have higher levels of resilience have lower levels of physical strain when they are confronted with workplace bullying behaviours. The findings of the present study can help human resources practitioners improve their antibullying programs by developing not only resilient individuals in their workplaces, but also by helping the organization to develop as a resilient company.",2015.0,48.0,22.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '120-133', 'name': 'Revista De Cercetare Si Interventie Sociala'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Maidaniuc-Chirilă2015TheMR,\n author = {Teodora Maidaniuc-Chirilă},\n journal = {Revista De Cercetare Si Interventie Sociala},\n pages = {120-133},\n title = {The Mediation Role of Resilience on the Relationship between Workplace Bullying and Romanian Employees' Strain},\n year = {2015}\n}\n""}","[{'authorId': '1409921295', 'name': 'Teodora Maidaniuc-Chirilă'}]"

1233,65936b35e9aa5cce9a75ea4e994e4949a104ae5f,Towards a framework for understanding societal and ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most discussed technologies today. There are many innovative applications such as the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, customer experience, new business, education, contagious diseases propagation and optimization of the management of humanitarian catastrophes. However, with all those opportunities also comes great responsibility to ensure good and fair practice of AI. The objective of this paper is to identify the main societal and ethical challenges implied by a massive uptake of AI. We have surveyed the literature for the most common challenges and classified them in seven groups: 1) Non-desired effects, 2) Liability, 3) Unknown consequences, 4) Relation people-robots, 5) Concentration of power and wealth, 6) Intentional bad uses, and 7) AI for weapons and warfare. The challenges should be dealt with in different ways depending on their origin; some have technological solutions, while others require ethical, societal, or political answers. Depending on the origin, different stakeholders might need to act. Whatever the identified stakeholder, not treating those issues will lead to uncertainty and unforeseen consequences with potentially large negative societal impact, hurting especially the most vulnerable groups of societies. Technology is helping to take better decisions, and AI is promoting data-driven decisions in addition to experience- and intuition-based discussion, with many improvements happening. However, the negative side effects of this technology need to be well understood and acted upon before we launch them massively into the world.",2020.0,4.0,3.0,"{'volume': 'abs/2001.09750', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Benjamins2020TowardsAF,\n author = {Richard Benjamins and I.

1237,65aed135eb5a0e61df15e1178a86d38e7b938624,Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World,"From the Publisher: 
Many of us, especially since 9/11, have become personally concerned about issues ofsecurity, and this is no surprise. Security is near the top of government and corporate agendas around the globe. Security-related stories appear on the front page everyday. How well though, do any of us truly understand what achieving real security involves? In Beyond Fear, Bruce Schneier invites us to take a critical look at not just the threats to our security, but the ways in which we're encouraged to think about security by law enforcement agencies, businesses of all shapes and sizes, and our national governments and militaries. Schneier believes we all can and should be better security consumers, and that the trade-offs we make in the name of security - in terms of cash outlays, taxes, inconvenience, and diminished freedoms - should be part of an ongoing negotiation in our personal, professional, and civic lives, and the subject of an open and informed national discussion. With a well-deserved reputation for original and sometimes iconoclastic thought, Schneier has a lot to say that is provocative, counter-intuitive, and just plain good sense. He explains in detail, for example, why we need to design security systems that don't just work well, but fail well, and why secrecy on the part of government often undermines security. He also believes, for instance, that national ID cards are an exceptionally bad idea: technically unsound, and even destructive of security. And, contrary to a lot of current nay-sayers, he thinks online shopping is fundamentally safe, and that many of the new airline security measure (though by no means all) are actually quite effective. A skeptic of much that's promised by highly touted technologies like biometrics, Schneier is also a refreshingly positive, problem- solving force in the often self-dramatizing and fear-mongering world of security pundits. Schneier helps the reader to understand the issues at stake, and how to best come to one's own conclusions, including the vast infrastructure we already have in place, and the vaster systemssome useful, others useless or worsethat we're being asked to submit to and pay for. Bruce Schneier is the author of seven books, including Applied Cryptography (which Wired called ""the one book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published"") and Secrets and Lies (described in Fortune as ""startlingly lively [a] jewel box of little surprises you can actually use.""). He is also Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Counterpane Internet Security, Inc., and publishes Crypto- Gram, one of the most widely read newsletters in the field of online security.",2003.0,0.0,440.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Schneier2003BeyondFT,\n author = {B.

We developed a mobile version of a virtual reality scenario where the participants were able to interact with virtual human characters through their psychophysiological activity. Music was played in the background of the scenario and, depending on the experimental condition, the virtual humans were initially either barely dancing or dancing very euphorically. The task of the participants was to encourage the apathetic virtual humans to dance or to calm down the frenetically dancing characters, through the modulation of their own mood and physiological activity. Results from our study show that by using this mobile game with the physiologically aware and affective virtual humans the participants were able to emotionally arouse themselves in the Activation condition and were able to relax themselves in the Relaxation condition, during the same session with only a brief break between conditions. The self-reported affective data was also corroborated by the physiological data (heart rate, respiration and skin conductance) which significantly differed between the Activation and Relaxation conditions.",2016.0,57.0,13.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '326-336', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Arroyo-Palacios2016DancingWP,\n author = {J.

This results in certain malfunctioning of neurons that can be detected by an electroencephalogram (EEG) using several electrodes on a human skull at appropriate positions. It is of great interest to be able to classify an EEG activity as that of a normal person or an alcoholic person using data from the minimum possible electrodes (or channels). Due to the complex nature of EEG signals, accurate classification of alcoholism using only a small dataset is a challenging task. Artificial neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), provide efficient and accurate results in various pattern-based classification problems. In this work, we apply CNN on raw EEG data and demonstrate how we achieved 98% average accuracy by optimizing a baseline CNN model and outperforming its results in a range of performance evaluation metrics on the University of California at Irvine Machine Learning (UCI-ML) EEG dataset. This article explains the stepwise improvement of the baseline model using the dropout, batch normalization, and kernel regularization techniques and provides a comparison of the two models that can be beneficial for aspiring practitioners who aim to develop similar classification models in CNN.

In diesem Beitrag wird die Analyse von Metaphern, – so wie Metaphern in neueren Ansatzen der Kognitiven Linguistik verstanden werden – aus mehreren Grunden als qualitative Forschungsmethode fur die Psychologie vorgeschlagen. Zum einen sind Metaphern sozial und kulturell definiert, gleichzeitig ist die Verwendung von Metaphern jedoch eine grundlegende kognitive Strategie und ein Beispiel fur analoges Problemlosen. Metaphern sind kontextabhangig, gleichzeitig reprasentieren Metaphern aber abstrakte Modelle der Wirklichkeit und entsprechen damit weitgehend dem Verstandnis von mentalen Modellen und Schemata in der kognitiven Psychologie. Diese vielschichtigen Eigenschaften von Metaphern ermoglichen die Untersuchung der Mikrointeraktionen von Kultur und Kognition in offenen und qualitativen Forschungsansatzen. Ebenso ermoglicht die Analyse von Metaphern eine Verbindung von quantitativ-experimentellen und qualitativen Ansatzen in der Psychologie. Die hohe Plausibilitat von Metaphern in der alltaglichen Erfahrung macht die Metaphernanalyse zudem zu einem geeigneten Medium fur Interventionen in angewandten Forschungsfeldern wie beispielsweise der Arbeits- und Organisationspsychologie.

Simultaneously, health system challenges underline the need for patient-centred, empowering and citizen-engaging care, which facilitates a focus on prevention and health promotion. Through enhanced patient-engagement, patient-provider interactions and reduced information gaps, electronic patient-generated health data (PGHD) may facilitate both patient-centeredness and preventive scare. Despite that, comprehensive knowledge syntheses on their utilisation for prevention and health promotion purposes are lacking. The review described in this protocol aims to fill that gap. Methods and analysis Our methodology is guided by Arksey and O’ Malley’s methodological framework for scoping reviews, as well as its advanced version by Levac, Colquhoun and O’Brien. Seven electronic databases will be systematically searched using predefined keywords. Key electronic journals will be hand searched, while reference lists of included documents and grey literature sources will be screened thoroughly. Two independent reviewers will complete study selection and data extraction. One of the team’s senior research members will act as a third reviewer and make the final decision on disputed documents. We will include literature with a focus on electronic PGHD and linked to prevention and health promotion. Literature on prevention that is driven by existing discomfort or disability goes beyond the review’s scope and will be excluded. Analysis will be narrative and guided by Shapiro et al’s adapted framework on PGHD flow. Ethics and dissemination The scoping review described in this protocol aims to establish a baseline understanding of electronic PGHD generation, collection, communication, sharing, interpretation, utilisation, context and impact for preventive purposes. The chosen methodology is based on the use of publicly available information and does not require ethical approval. Review findings will be disseminated in digital health conferences and symposia. Results will be published and additionally shared with relevant local and national authorities.",2018.0,49.0,30.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'BMJ Open'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nittas2018ElectronicPH,\n author = {V.

A challenging objective of the field of humanoid robotics is to make robots able to interact with people in a believable way. Recent studies have demonstrated that human-like robots with high similarity to human beings do not generate the sense of unease that is typically associated to human-like robots. For this reason designing of aesthetically appealing and socially attractive robots becomes necessary for realistic human-robot interactions. In this paper HEFES (Hybrid Engine for Facial Expressions Synthesis), an engine for generating and controlling facial expressions both on physical androids and 3D avatars is described. HEFES is part of a software library that controls a human robot called FACE (Facial Automaton for Conveying Emotions). HEFES was designed to allow users to create facial expressions without requiring artistic or animatronics skills and it is able to animate both FACE and its 3D replica. The system was tested in human-robot interaction studies aimed to help children with autism to interpret their interlocutors' mood through facial expressions understanding.",2012.0,22.0,70.0,"{'pages': '195-200', 'name': '2012 4th IEEE RAS & EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BioRob)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mazzei2012HEFESAH,\n author = {D.

Nevertheless, some people still use their mobile phones despite recognized safety concerns, legislation, and informal bans. Drawing potential predictors from the addiction literature, this study sought to predict usage and, specifically, problematic mobile phone use from extraversion, self-esteem, neuroticism, gender, and age. To measure problem use, the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale was devised and validated as a reliable self-report instrument, against the Addiction Potential Scale and overall mobile phone usage levels. Problem use was a function of age, extraversion, and low self-esteem, but not neuroticism. As extraverts are more likely to take risks, and young drivers feature prominently in automobile accidents, this study supports community concerns about mobile phone use, and identifies groups that should be targeted in any intervention campaigns.",2005.0,73.0,1264.0,"{'volume': '8 1', 'pages': '\n          39-51\n        ', 'name': 'Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bianchi2005PsychologicalPO,\n author = {Adriana Bianchi and J.

In this paper, the effects of the sentiment lexicon, aggregation level, and aggregation method on the sentiment polarity and rating classification of Persian reviews are investigated. To this aim, a new sentiment aggregation method based on the cross-ratio operator is proposed. The results on four Persian review data sets show that the review-level aggregation can improve rating classification, although this approach does not have a positive impact on polarity classification.",2020.0,61.0,22.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '1394 - 1421', 'name': 'Enterprise Information Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Basiri2020TheEO,\n author = {Mohammad Ehsan Basiri and Arman Kabiri and Moloud Abdar and W.

The construct was defined as the expectancy that some behavior or cognition will alleviate a negative mood state. Data from five samples of college undergraduates (N = 1,630) were reported. Internal consistency, discriminant validity from social desirability, and temporal stability were demonstrated for a 30-item scale derived from an initial pool of 50 items. Further analyses revealed (a) modest correlations of the 30-item scale with internal-external control, (b) that high scorers on the NMR scale reported few symptoms of depression, and (c) that the NMR scale predicted a different pattern of emotions than the Beck Depression Inventory did. Discussion focused on possible roles for expectancies for negative mood regulation in the coping process and directions for future research on the mood regulation process.",1990.0,25.0,602.0,"{'volume': '54 3-4', 'pages': '\n          546-63\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality assessment'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Catanzaro1990MeasuringGE,\n author = {S.

In this investigation, we examined the interaction between adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in the prediction of psychopathology symptoms (depression, anxiety, and alcohol problems) concurrently and prospectively. We assessed trait emotion regulation and psychopathology symptoms in a sample of community residents at Time 1 (N = 1,317) and then reassessed psychopathology at Time 2 (N = 1,132). Cross-sectionally, we found that the relationship between adaptive strategies and psychopathology symptoms was moderated by levels of maladaptive strategies: adaptive strategies had a negative association with psychopathology symptoms only at high levels of maladaptive strategies. In contrast, adaptive strategies showed no prospective relationship to psychopathology symptoms either alone or in interaction with maladaptive strategies.

Finally, it demonstrates how the model may be used to further research and understanding in well-known theoretical traditions. This model is not meant to stand in opposition to any of these theories but, rather, should work well with them by providing hypothesized mechanisms that may underlie well-known effects. This model should prove useful both to researchers and, eventually, to message producers.

Based on empirical findings from previous studies, we created photographs of facial-bodily expressions of 18 states and presented these to participants in nine cultures. In a well-validated recognition paradigm, participants matched stories of causal antecedents to one of four expressions of the same valence. All 18 facial-bodily expressions were recognized at well above chance levels. We conclude by discussing the methodological shortcomings of our study and the conceptual implications of its findings.

1286,6ae8e0ea13abfaaeed3fb4c720716e0e89667094,Manufacturing Analytics and Industrial Internet of Things,"Over the last two decades, manufacturing across the globe has evolved to be more intel-ligent and data driven. In the age of industrial Internet of Things, a smart production unit can be perceived as a large connected industrial system of materials, parts, machines, tools, inventory, and logistics that can relay data and communicate with each other. While, traditionally, the focus has been on machine health and predictive maintenance, the manufacturing industry has also started focusing on analyzing data from the entire production line. These applications bring a new set of analytics challenges. Unlike tradi-tional data mining analysis, which consists of lean datasets (that is, datasets with few fea-tures), manufacturing has fat datasets. In addition, previous approaches to manufacturing analytics restricted themselves to small time periods of data. The latest advances in big data analytics allows researchers to do a deep dive into years of data. Bosch collects and utilizes all available information about its products to increase its understanding of complex linear and nonlinear relationships between parts, machines, and assembly lines. This helps in use cases such as the discovery of the root cause of internal defects.

In doing so, it provides the first direct test of a key proposition of dialect theory, namely that greater accuracy of detecting emotions from one's own cultural group-known as in-group advantage-results from a match between culturally specific schemas in emotional expression style and culturally specific schemas in emotion recognition. Study 1 used stimuli from 100 professional actors from five English-speaking nations vocally conveying 11 emotional states (anger, contempt, fear, happiness, interest, lust, neutral, pride, relief, sadness, and shame) using standard-content sentences. Detailed acoustic analyses showed many similarities across groups, and yet also systematic group differences. This provides evidence for cultural accents in expressive style at the level of acoustic cues. In Study 2, listeners evaluated these expressions in a 5 × 5 design balanced across groups. Cross-cultural accuracy was greater than expected by chance. However, there was also in-group advantage, which varied across emotions. A lens model analysis of fundamental acoustic properties examined patterns in emotional expression and perception within and across groups. Acoustic cues were used relatively similarly across groups both to produce and judge emotions, and yet there were also subtle cultural differences. Speakers appear to have a culturally nuanced schema for enacting vocal tones via acoustic cues, and perceivers have a culturally nuanced schema in judging them. Consistent with dialect theory's prediction, in-group judgments showed a greater match between these schemas used for emotional expression and perception.

It has created an overly publicized attention on machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Early this year, Google AlphaGo has marked a major breakthrough in AI by winning the first game against the world’s best champion human player in the world’s most complex game, the ancient Chinese Go game. With no doubt, the interests in AI and its related products had reached a global frenzy. As scientists advance in technology, a concern of job security has risen up: will robots take our jobs? IBM Watson has evolved from a “question answering machine” to a highly intelligent “cognitive diagnostic engine” or a “decision support system” over the past 6 yr. Based on Carl Frey and his collaborators, future family health centers may transition to a team of nurse practitioners with the support of Watson Health and overseen by one single doctor. Will AI technology also marginalize medical physicists in the near future? In this series, we have Dr. Xiaoli Tang arguing for the proposition that “AI will reduce the need for clinical medical physicists” and Dr. Brian Wang arguing against it. Dr. Xiaoli Tang received a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She then did her postdoctoral training in Medical Physics at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of California at San Diego. She previously worked at the University of North Carolina and now is working as an Assistant Attending and chief physicist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Westchester regional site. She is an expert in motion management, Deep Inspiration Breath Hold (DIBH) for left-sided breast cancer, and machine learning algorithms on medical physic applications. She is interested in developing related clinical trials, and bringing new technology to the clinic. She is a member of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), and the American Society for Radiation Oncology. Dr. Brian Wang received his PhD in nuclear engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY in 2005. He currently works at University of Louisville as the chief of physics and medical physics residency director. Dr. Wang is an associate editor for the JACMP. His research interests include motion management, image guidance, and SRS/SBRT.

1306,6c5558aadf68f5e5460fcebc5d55db3325b12e1d,Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ,"Is IQ destiny? Perhaps not nearly as much as humans think. This text argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, ignoring a crucial range of abilities that matter immensely in terms of how we do in life. Drawing on brain and behavioural research, the author shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors add up to a different way of succeeding in life - one the author terms ""emotional intelligence"". Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness and impulse control, persistence, zeal and self-motivation, empathy and social deftness. These are the qualities that mark people that excel. They are also the hallmarks of character and self-discipline, of altruism and compassion. As Goleman demonstrates, the personal costs of deficits in emotional intelligence can range from problems in marriage and poor physical health in adults to eating disorders and depression in children. But the news is hopeful. Emotional intelligence is not fixed at birth. Goleman's argument gives insights into the brain architecture underlying emotion and rationality. He shows how emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened in all of us. Since the emotional lessons a child learns actually sculpt the brain's circuitry, Goleman provides detailed guidance as to how parents and schools can benefit from this.",1995.0,0.0,6762.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Goleman1995EmotionalIW,\n author = {D.

For many decades following World War II, mainstream psychology researchers placed negative emotions (e.g., anxiety) ahead of positive emotions (e.g., happiness) but positive emotions are now a genuine, promising field of research because of their influence on specific components of performance (e.g., attention) and psychological well-being. The benefits of these emotions have hitherto not been wholly realized in a sport context, especially in their capacity to generate greater self-efficacy, motivation, attention, problem-solving, and coping with adversity. Although the sport emotion literature is sprinkled with studies that specifically examined positive emotion in sport settings, the breadth and depth of this research is too thin to make bold claims about the value of positive emotions in the emotion-performance relation. There are, however, at least three theoretical models available to sport psychologists to better understand the influence of positive emotions on sport performance and two of these models are specifically designed for sport contexts. Not only can these models deepen and widen this knowledge base, but they can also support interventions in applied settings to improve performance and psychological well-being.",2011.0,155.0,121.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '50 - 69', 'name': 'International Review of Sport and Exercise Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McCarthy2011PositiveEI,\n author = {P.

The authors suggest that the mechanism involved is the perception-behavior link, the recently documented finding (e.g., J. A. Bargh, M. Chen, & L. Burrows, 1996) that the mere perception of another's behavior automatically increases the likelihood of engaging in that behavior oneself. Experiment 1 showed that the motor behavior of participants unintentionally matched that of strangers with whom they worked on a task. Experiment 2 had confederates mimic the posture and movements of participants and showed that mimicry facilitates the smoothness of interactions and increases liking between interaction partners. Experiment 3 showed that dispositionally empathic individuals exhibit the chameleon effect to a greater extent than do other people.",1999.0,110.0,3889.0,"{'volume': '76 6', 'pages': '\n          893-910\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chartrand1999TheCE,\n author = {T.

A subfield of robotics, Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR), is particularly suitable for expanding these benefits into the healthcare setting because of its unique ability to provide cognitive, social, and emotional support. This paper presents our recent research on developing SAR by evaluating the ability of a life-like conversational social robot, called Ryan, to administer internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) to older adults with depression. For Ryan to administer the therapy, we developed a dialogue-management system, called Program-R. Using an accredited CBT manual for the treatment of depression, we created seven hour-long iCBT dialogues and integrated them into Program-R using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). To assess the effectiveness of Robot-based iCBT and users’ likability of our approach, we conducted an HRI study with a cohort of elderly people with mild-to-moderate depression over a period of four weeks. Quantitative analyses of participant’s spoken responses (e.g. word count and sentiment analysis), face-scale mood scores, and exit surveys, strongly support the notion robot-based iCBT is a viable alternative to traditional human-delivered therapy.",2019.0,32.0,21.0,"{'pages': '2089-2095', 'name': '2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dino2019DeliveringCB,\n author = {Francesca Dino and Rohola Zandie and Hojjat Abdollahi and Sarah Schoeder and M.

We begin by examining the validity of grounding standards that aim for international reach on human right agreements, and the need to accommodate variations in prioritization and tradeoffs in implementing rights in different societal and cultural settings. We then examine the major recent proposals from the OECD, the EU and the IEEE on ethical governance of Trustworthy AI systems in terms of their scope and use of normative language. From this analysis, we propose a preliminary minimal model for the functional roles relevant to Trustworthy AI as a framing for further standards development in this area. We also identify the different types of interoperability reference points that may exist between these functional roles and remark on the potential role they could play in future standardization. Finally we examine a current AI standardization effort under ISO/IEC JTC1 to consider how future Trustworthy AI standards may be able to build on existing standards in developing ethical guidelines and in particular on the ISO standard on Social Responsibility.We conclude by proposing some future directions for research and development of Trustworthy AI standards.",2020.0,27.0,9.0,"{'volume': '8', 'pages': '123-150', 'name': 'J.

Developmental Changes in Mental Performance. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 1973, 38 (3, Serial No. 150). A distinction was made between the general level of a person's IQ (i.e., the average of his scores across age) and his profile contour (i.e., the developmental pattern of inflections in performance). Most research has focused on the general level of IQ and its correlates; this project systematically investigated patterns of IQ change with data from the Fels Longitudinal Study. Normal middle-class children changed an average of 28.5 IQ points between 21/2 and 17 years of age, and one in seven displayed shifts of more than 40 points. While siblings were more similar in their general level of IQ than unrelated children matched or unmatched for social class, the pattern of developmental changes in childhood IQs or infant DQs was not more similar among siblings than among unrelated children. Twins and triplets scored lower in general level and were less variable in IQ over age than singletons, thus potentially qualifying attempts to generalize IQ change results based upon multiple-birth samples to singletons. Parent-child IQ correlations were higher when the parent was assessed as an adult than if both parent and child were tested at the same chronological ages. A sample of 80 subjects who had relatively complete IQ data (maximum of 17 tests) between 2/2 and 17 years were clustered into five groups which represented different patterns of IQ change over age. These profiles were relatively simple linear or quadratic trends and not random fluctuations about a constant value. Major inflection points occurred at 6 and 10 years of age. It was not obvious that these patterns were simple products of repeated testing or the changing nature of the IQ test. The children in the five IQ profile clusters had parents who were different in the extent to which they attempted to accelerate their child's development and the severity of punishments they administered. These parental correlates appeared to hold up even when parental education and IQ as well as the general level of the child's IQ were statistically controlled. Given the assumptions prompted by these data, the changing nature of environmental circumstances across the childhood years for a given individual may be as potent in changing IQ as the differences between family environments.

THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN IQ Several reviews of the literature on the development of mental performance are available (Bayley 1970; Bloom 1964; Pinneau 1961). However, most of the research surveyed involves correlations between mental test performance at several different ages and correlations between personality and social variables with IQ at one age versus another. Such research strategies are valuable and have yielded important results, but they are ""developmental"" only in the sense that data are available at several ages on the same subjects and correlational relationships are derived within and across age periods. Because the correlation coefficient is independent of the means of the distributions, it is possible to obtain high correlational stability of IQ across age but marked fluctuations in the group mean.

Cross-sectional analysis of developmental trajectories,"ABSTRACT The ability to process social information is part of the social cognition construct and it includes the ability to select the appropriate social responses. Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show difficulties in these competences that could compromise the development of adequate social behaviour. The aim of the study was to examine the development of the ability to process social cues across the Social Information Processing Interview (SIP-I) conducted with 38 children with ASD compared with 39 children with typical development using cross-sectional developmental trajectory analysis. Children with ASD showed slower development of complex abilities according to the SIP-I measures, particularly for the response construction component. This component evaluates the capacity of a child to put himself/herself in the shoes of other people and try to explain how he/she would act in the same situation. Slower development of this competence could explain the difficulty encountered by children with ASD in interacting with their peers and making an adequate behavioural response.",2018.0,36.0,13.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '71 - 87', 'name': 'European Journal of Developmental Psychology'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Pino2018WhenDC,\n author = {M.

The article exposes the importance of the autonomic nervous system, features of electrical activity, cerebral blood flow on functioning of the child’s body. 
Childhood is a sensitive period of development of many neurophysiological and physiological functions. In children the electrical activity of the brain can be considered as an indicator of general properties of the nervous system and takes the leading place in the structure of the neurodynamic constitution of a person and some individual-psychological differences underlying them. 
Prolonged psycho-emotional overstrain, a high level of personal anxiety in children and the etiological factor cause increased activity of adaptation-compensatory reactions, in which the most important role is played by the autonomic nervous system. Disturbances of neurovegetative regulation, occurring practically in all diseases, under the influence of a huge number of damaging factors are nonspecific, adaptive-compensatory. In children, psycho-vegetative syndrome, characterized by a combination of psycho-emotional and vegetative disorders is encountered in most cases.",2022.0,11.0,0.0,{'name': 'BRAIN.

1329,6ef6adf8777c50c4f4f0a7cc7804cf9d3317084b,Narrative Planning: Balancing Plot and Character,"Narrative, and in particular storytelling, is an important part of the human experience. Consequently, computational systems that can reason about narrative can be more effective communicators, entertainers, educators, and trainers. One of the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative generation, the automated creation of meaningful event sequences. There are many factors - logical and aesthetic - that contribute to the success of a narrative artifact. Central to this success is its understandability. We argue that the following two attributes of narratives are universal: (a) the logical causal progression of plot, and (b) character believability. Character believability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by characters do not negatively impact the audience's suspension of disbelief. Specifically, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional agents. In this article, we explore the use of refinement search as a technique for solving the narrative generation problem - to find a sound and believable sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a world state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel refinement search planning algorithm - the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL) planner - that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression, reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those characters commit to their goals. We present the results of an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the IPOCL algorithm support audience comprehension of character intentions better than plans generated by conventional partial-order planners.",2010.0,96.0,536.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1401.3841', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Riedl2010NarrativePB,\n author = {Mark O.

1338,6f9c0220f38cda3934382509a96876ad8109150b,Heterogeneity of Synovial Molecular Patterns in Patients with Arthritis,"Objectives Early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an unmet medical need in the field of rheumatology. Previously, we performed high-density transcriptomic studies on synovial biopsies from patients with arthritis, and found that synovial gene expression profiles were significantly different according to the underlying disorder. Here, we wanted to further explore the consistency of the gene expression signals in synovial biopsies of patients with arthritis, using low-density platforms. Methods Low-density assays (cDNA microarray and microfluidics qPCR) were designed, based on the results of the high-density microarray data. Knee synovial biopsies were obtained from patients with RA, spondyloarthropathies (SA) or osteoarthritis (OA) (n = 39), and also from patients with initial undifferentiated arthritis (UA) (n = 49). Results According to high-density microarray data, several molecular pathways are differentially expressed in patients with RA, SA and OA: T and B cell activation, chromatin remodelling, RAS GTPase activation and extracellular matrix regulation. Strikingly, disease activity (DAS28-CRP) has a significant influence on gene expression patterns in RA samples. Using the low-density assays, samples from patients with OA are easily discriminated from RA and SA samples. However, overlapping molecular patterns are found, in particular between RA and SA biopsies. Therefore, prediction of the clinical diagnosis based on gene expression data results in a diagnostic accuracy of 56.8%, which is increased up to 98.6% by the addition of specific clinical symptoms in the prediction algorithm. Similar observations are made in initial UA samples, in which overlapping molecular patterns also impact the accuracy of the diagnostic algorithm. When clinical symptoms are added, the diagnostic accuracy is strongly improved. Conclusions Gene expression signatures are overall different in patients with OA, RA and SA, but overlapping molecular signatures are found in patients with these conditions. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis in patients with UA requires a combination of gene expression and clinical data.",2015.0,21.0,30.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lauwerys2015HeterogeneityOS,\n author = {B.

Contrary to this, we provide evidence that China’s planning system has been transformed alongside the economic transition, yet remains central to almost all domains of public policy making and the political institutions that have fostered China’s high-speed growth and economic stability. The incorporation of experimental programs into macro-plans, a tiered hierarchy of policy oversight, newly introduced mid-course plan evaluations, and systematic top-level policy review have allowed Chinese planners to play a central role in economic policy making without succumbing to the rigidity traps that debased traditional planned economies. By better understanding how the planning cycle influences incentives and resources of successive layers of bureaucracies and jurisdictions, and how it updates itself and adapts to new challenges, it is possible to explain a greater proportion of the Chinese policy-making process, including many of its successes and pathologies.",2013.0,75.0,109.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '580 - 628', 'name': 'Modern China'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Heilmann2013TheRO,\n author = {S.

Firstly we see engagement as being positive (we characterize interaction as being re-active) and exploratory: it is this exploration which creates a 'space' in which engagement occurs. What we reveal in this space are the affordances of the artefact which we subsequently exploit. We engage with something and continue to do so because we enjoy doing so -- thus affect has an important role in engagement. Finally, we engage with technology because it allows us to achieve our purposes and these purposes are a reciprocal expression of ourselves. Research limitations/Implications -- Future work will add empirical support to the theoretically-based account. Originality/Value -- The work contributes to the understanding of how to design engaging user experiences. Take away message -- An ontologically-based account of engagement may be more tractable than the many more expansive accounts of user experience.",2010.0,46.0,17.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 28th Annual European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Turner2010TheAO,\n author = {Phil Turner},\n journal = {Proceedings of the 28th Annual European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics},\n title = {The anatomy of engagement},\n year = {2010}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '8250858', 'name': 'Phil Turner'}]"

However, the MASNs cannot be directly derived on demand for various Android systems from existing social networks (SNs) without having access to end-to-end IT network infrastructure. In this article, we propose a detailed solution called BASA which would help in rapidly building local mobile ad-hoc social networks on top of the current Android platform. BASA establishes a four-layer system architecture according to the underlying challenges and requirements in MASNs. BASA is implemented in an EU project named ""SOCITIES"".

The Nao robot imitates gross arm movements of the child in real-time. Different behavioral criteria (i.e. eye gaze, gaze shifting, free initiations and prompted initiations of arm movements, and smile/laughter) were analyzed based on the video data of the interaction. The results are mixed and suggest a high variability in reactions to the Nao robot. The results are as follows: For Child2 and Child3, the results indicate no effect of the Nao robot in any of the target variables. Child1 and Child4 showed more eye gaze and smile/laughter in the interaction with the Nao robot compared to the human partner and Child1 showed a higher frequency of motor initiations in the interaction with the Nao robot compared to the baselines, but not with respect to the human-interaction. The robot proved to be a better facilitator of shared attention only for Child1.

One may think of the adoption of technology as a form of social contract, which may evolve or fluctuate in time, scale, and impact. It is important to keep in mind that for AI, meeting the expectations of this social contract is critical, because recklessly driving the adoption and implementation of unsafe, irresponsible, or unethical AI systems may trigger serious backlash against industry and academia involved which could take decades to resolve, if not actually seriously harm society. For the purpose of this paper, we consider that a social contract arises when there is sufficient consensus within society to adopt and implement this new technology.

Focus groups have advantages for researchers in the field of health and medicine: they do not discriminate against people who cannot read or write and they can encourage participation from people reluctant to be interviewed on their own or who feel they have nothing to say. This is the fifth in a series of seven articles describing non-quantitative techniques and showing their value in health research Rationale and uses of focus groups Focus groups are a form of group interview that capitalises on communication between research participants in order to generate data. Although group interviews are often used simply as a quick and convenient way to collect data from several people simultaneously, focus groups explicitly use group interaction as part of the method. This means that instead of the researcher asking each person to respond to a question in turn, people are encouraged to talk to one another: asking questions, exchanging anecdotes and commenting on each others' experiences and points of view. 1 The method is particularly useful for exploring people's knowledge and experiences and can be used to examine not only what people think but how they think and why they think that way. Focus groups were originally used within communication studies to explore the effects of films and television programmes, 2 and are a popular method for assessing health education messages and examining public understandings of illness and of health behaviours. 3 4 5 6 7 They are widely used to examine people's experiences of disease and of health services. 8 9 and are an effective technique for exploring the attitudes and needs of staff. The idea behind the focus group method is that group processes can help people to explore and clarify their views in ways that would be less easily accessible in a one to one interview. Group discussion is particularly appropriate when the interviewer has a series of open ended questions and wishes to encourage research participants to explore the issues of importance to them, in their own vocabulary, generating their own questions and pursuing their own priorities. When group dynamics work well the participants work alongside the researcher, taking the research in new and often unexpected directions. Group work also helps researchers tap into the many different forms of communication that people use in day to …",1995.0,28.0,5238.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Kitzinger1995EducationAD,\n author = {J.

Results showed that effect sizes (ESs) for the level of achievement metaanalysis were minimal (Weighted Mean ES = .10, SD = .07), a finding consistent with a previous meta-analysis by Rowley, Landers, Kyllo, and Etnier (1995). Larger effects were found for the performance outcome meta-analysis (Weighted Mean ES = .31, SD = .12). Effects were moderate for vigor, confusion, and depression, small for anger and tension, and very small for fatigue. All effects were in the direction predicted by Morgan's (1985) Mental Health Model. Effects were larger in sports of short duration, in sports involving open skills, and where performance was judged using self-referenced criteria.

While millions of individuals have become infected, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggest this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes, but rarely are researchers able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these to previous years of data on the same individuals.ObjectivesWe seek to answer two overarching questions by combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students participating in a longitudinal study for the past two years. First, have behaviors and mental health changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to previous time periods within the same participants? Second, did behavior and mental health changes track the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media?MethodsBehaviors were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs). Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term (the term in which the coronavirus pandemic started), as compared to prevous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models.ResultsDuring the initial COVID-19 impacted academic term (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001), relative to the previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and week of academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term, were strongly associated with increased coronavirus-related news. When mental health metrics (e.g., depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P<.05) were significantly associated with coronavirus-related news.ConclusionsCompared with prior academic terms, individuals in Winter 2020 were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, are associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods that could reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.",2020.0,0.0,30.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Huckins2020MentalHA,\n author = {Jeremy F.

Recent behavioral, neuropsychological, neuroanatomy, and neuroimaging research, however, suggests that emotion interacts with cognition in the brain. In this book, Luiz Pessoa moves beyond the debate over functional specialization, describing the many ways that emotion and cognition interact and are integrated in the brain. The amygdala is often viewed as the quintessential emotional region of the brain, but Pessoa reviews findings revealing that many of its functions contribute to attention and decision making, critical components of cognitive functions. He counters the idea of a subcortical pathway to the amygdala for affective visual stimuli with an alternate framework, the multiple waves model. Citing research on reward and motivation, Pessoa also proposes the dual competition model, which explains emotional and motivational processing in terms of their influence on competition processes at both perceptual and executive function levels. He considers the broader issue of structure-function mappings, and examines anatomical features of several regions often associated with emotional processing, highlighting their connectivity properties. As new theoretical frameworks of distributed processing evolve, Pessoa concludes, a truly dynamic network view of the brain will emerge, in which ""emotion"" and ""cognition"" may be used as labels in the context of certain behaviors, but will not map cleanly into compartmentalized pieces of the brain.",2013.0,0.0,270.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Pessoa2013TheCB,\n author = {L.

Emotion regulation (ER) supports multiple individual functions and promotes mental health and wellbeing. Among the tools that may be used to help people in managing their affective states, videogames are reaching attention and are showing positive effects. Yet, little is known about their effectiveness.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to assess the amount and quality of studies investigating the effects and modalities of the use of videogames for ER.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A systematic literature search according to PRISMA guidelines was performed. Subsequently, according to expert advice other few studies have been added.


RESULTS
Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; they can be categorized into three groups, namely (1) cross-sectional and qualitative studies, (2) experimental studies investigating the effects of videogame experience on ER and (3) ER intervention with serious games.


DISCUSSION
Discussion of the reviewed studies highlights that frequent gaming with commercial games offers more opportunities for ER improvement (related to gameplay and enjoyment of fictional properties) than limited-time experiences, such as those supported by bespoke serious games. This research area is still in its infancy and findings need to be interpreted with caution; furthermore, future reviews are encouraged to include clinical populations.


CONCLUSION
Videogames offer several opportunities for ER and a challenge for educational and psychological interventions.",2018.0,84.0,149.0,"{'volume': '7 2', 'pages': '\n          85-99\n        ', 'name': 'Games for health journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Villani2018VideogamesFE,\n author = {D.

This review discusses the available clinical, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological data on this issue.

In Psychiatry, most of the current interventions involving the usage of virtual reality technology is limited to its application for anxiety disorders. With the advances in technology, Internet addiction and Internet gaming disorders are increasingly prevalent. To date, these disorders are still being treated using conventional psychotherapy methods such as cognitive behavioural therapy. However, there is an increasing number of research combining various other therapies alongside with cognitive behavioural therapy, as an attempt possibly to reduce the drop-out rates and to make such interventions more relevant to the targeted group of addicts, who are mostly adolescents. To date, there has been a prior study done in Korea that has demonstrated the comparable efficacy of virtual reality therapy with that of cognitive behavioural therapy. However, the intervention requires the usage of specialized screens and devices. It is thus the objective of the current article to highlight how smartphone applications could be designed and be utilized for immersive virtual reality treatment, alongside low cost wearables.",2017.0,12.0,40.0,"{'volume': '25 2', 'pages': '\n          367-372\n        ', 'name': 'Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zhang2017SmartphoneAF,\n author = {M.

Emotion analysis, as a subfield of sentiment analysis, explores text data and, based on the characteristics of the text and generally known emotional models, evaluates what emotion is presented in it. The analysis of emotions in the human–robot interaction aims to evaluate the emotional state of the human being and on this basis to decide how the robot should adapt its behavior to the human being. There are several approaches and algorithms to detect emotions in the text data. We decided to apply a combined method of dictionary approach with machine learning algorithms. As a result of the ambiguity and subjectivity of labeling emotions, it was possible to assign more than one emotion to a sentence; thus, we were dealing with a multi-label problem. Based on the overview of the problem, we performed experiments with the Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Neural Network classifiers.

In 2014, the Chinese government proposed to build a social credit system (SCS) to better collect and evaluate citizens’ creditworthiness and grant rewards and punishments based on one’s social credit. Since then, various SCS pilots have been enacted. While current media and scholars often perceive SCS as a single and unified system, this paper argues that there are in fact multiple SCSs in China. I identify four main types of SCS and articulate the relationships among them. Each SCS has different assumptions, operationalizations, and implementations. China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, and the macroeconomic management agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, are the two most important actors in the design and implementation of the multiple SCSs. Yet their distinctive views about what “credit” is and what an SCS should be produced great tensions on the SCS landscape. I also historicize current SCSs and show that many elements and assumptions of SCSs can be traced back to a broader political history of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Finally, I propose an alternative theoretical framework to understand Chinese SCSs as a symbolic system with performative power that is more than a simple repressive and direct political project.",2019.0,33.0,54.0,{'name': 'International Institutions: Politics of International Institutions & Global Governance eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Liu2019MultipleSC,\n author = {C.

1402,755326c45481f0534c3430c19fac1e7d48edfed7,Patient Privacy in the Era of Big Data,"Privacy was defined as a fundamental human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the 1948 United Nations General Assembly. However, there is still no consensus on what constitutes privacy. In this review, we look at the evolution of privacy as a concept from the era of Hippocrates to the era of social media and big data. To appreciate the modern measures of patient privacy protection and correctly interpret the current regulatory framework in the United States, we need to analyze and understand the concepts of individually identifiable information, individually identifiable health information, protected health information, and de-identification. The Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act defines the regulatory framework and casts a balance between protective measures and access to health information for secondary (scientific) use. The rule defines the conditions when health information is protected by law and how protected health information can be de-identified for secondary use. With the advents of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics, computational text de-identification algorithms produce de-identified results nearly as well as those produced by human experts, but much faster, more consistently and basically for free. Modern clinical text de-identification systems now pave the road to big data and enable scientists to access de-identified clinical information while firmly protecting patient privacy. However, clinical text de-identification is not a perfect process. In order to maximize the protection of patient privacy and to free clinical and scientific information from the confines of electronic healthcare systems, all stakeholders, including patients, health institutions and institutional review boards, scientists and the scientific communities, as well as regulatory and law enforcement agencies must collaborate closely. On the one hand, public health laws and privacy regulations define rules and responsibilities such as requesting and granting only the amount of health information that is necessary for the scientific study. On the other hand, developers of de-identification systems provide guidelines to use different modes of operations to maximize the effectiveness of their tools and the success of de-identification. Institutions with clinical repositories need to follow these rules and guidelines closely to successfully protect patient privacy. To open the gates of big data to scientific communities, healthcare institutions need to be supported in their de-identification and data sharing efforts by the public, scientific communities, and local, state, and federal legislators and government agencies.",2017.0,58.0,77.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '8 - 17', 'name': 'Balkan Medical Journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kayaalp2017PatientPI,\n author = {M.

In Study 1, we found a close convergence of the Spanish consensus scores and the general and expert consensus scores determined with Mayer, Salovey, Caruso, and Sitarenios (2003) data. The MSCEIT also demonstrated adequate evidence of reliability of test scores as estimated by internal consistency and test-retest correlation after 12 weeks. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a 3-level higher factor model with 8 manifest variables (task scores), 4 first-level factors (corresponding to the 4-branch model of Mayer & Salovey [1997], with 2 tasks for each branch), 2 second-level factors (experiential and strategic areas, with 2 branches for each area), and 1 third-level factor (overall emotional intelligence [EI]), and multigroup analyses supported MSCEIT cross-gender invariance. Study 2 found evidence for the discriminant validity of scores on the MSCEIT subscales, which were differentially related to personality and self-reported EI. Study 3 provided evidence of the incremental validity of scores on the MSCEIT, which added significant variance to the prospective prediction of psychological well-being after controlling for personality traits. The psychometric properties of the Spanish MSCEIT are similar to those of the original English version, supporting its use for assessing emotional abilities in the Spanish population.

Using both quantitative and qualitative longitudinal data from the daily diaries of 222 employees in seven companies, we examined the nature, form, and temporal dynamics of the affect-creativity relationship. The results indicate that positive affect relates positively to creativity in organizations and that the relationship is a simple linear one. Time-lagged analyses identify positive affect as an antecedent of creative thought, with incubation periods of up to two days. Qualitative analyses identify positive affect as a consequence of creative thought events, as well as a concomitant of the creative process. A preliminary theory of the affect-creativity cycle in organizations includes each of these links and proposes mechanisms by which they may operate.",2005.0,141.0,1807.0,"{'volume': '50', 'pages': '367 - 403', 'name': 'Administrative Science Quarterly'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Amabile2005AffectAC,\n author = {Teresa M.

In Experiment 1, participants received information about the opponent's emotion (anger, happiness, or none) in a computer-mediated negotiation. As predicted, they conceded more to an angry opponent than to a happy one (controls falling in between), but only when they had a low (rather than a high) need for cognitive closure. Experiment 2 similarly showed that participants were only affected by the other's emotion under low rather than high time pressure, because time pressure reduced their degree of information processing. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that negotiators were only influenced by their opponent's emotion if they had low (rather than high) power. These results support the motivated information processing model by showing that negotiators are only affected by their opponent's emotions if they are motivated to consider them.",2004.0,126.0,553.0,"{'volume': '87 4', 'pages': '\n          510-28\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kleef2004TheIE,\n author = {Gerben A. van Kleef and C.

Twenty competitive athletes completed four laboratory-based conditions; familiarization, control, emotion suppression, and nonsuppression. In each condition participants completed a 10-km cycling time trial requiring self-regulation. In the experimental conditions participants watched an upsetting video before performing the cycle task. When participants suppressed their emotional reactions to the video (suppression condition) they completed the cycling task slower, generated lower mean power outputs, and reached a lower maximum heart rate and perceived greater physical exertion than when they were given no self-regulation instructions during the video (nonsuppression condition) and received no video treatment (control condition). The findings suggest that emotional self-regulation resource impairment affects perceived exertion, pacing and sport performance and extends previous research examining the regulation of persistence on physical tasks. The results are discussed in line with relevant psychophysiological theories of self-regulation and fatigue and pertinent potential implications for practice regarding performance and well-being are suggested.",2014.0,45.0,143.0,"{'volume': '36 4', 'pages': '\n          401-12\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of sport & exercise psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wagstaff2014EmotionRA,\n author = {C.

However, most datasets for sentiment analysis only have the sentiment label for each document or sentence. In other words, there is no information about which words play an important role in sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying key words discriminating positive and negative sentences by using a weakly supervised learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In our model, each word is represented as a continuous-valued vector and each sentence is represented as a matrix whose rows correspond to the word vector used in the sentence. Then, the CNN model is trained using these sentence matrices as inputs and the sentiment labels as the output. Once the CNN model is trained, we implement the word attention mechanism that identifies high-contributing words to classification results with a class activation map, using the weights from the fully connected layer at the end of the learned CNN model. In order to verify the proposed methodology, we evaluated the classification accuracy and inclusion rate of polarity words using two movie review datasets. Experimental result show that the proposed model can not only correctly classify the sentence polarity but also successfully identify the corresponding words with high polarity scores.",2017.0,34.0,87.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1709.09885', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lee2017SentimentCW,\n author = {Gichang Lee and Jaeyun Jeong and Seungwan Seo and Czangyeob Kim and Pilsung Kang},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Sentiment Classification with Word Attention based on Weakly Supervised Learning with a Convolutional Neural Network},\n volume = {abs/1709.09885},\n year = {2017}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '26419196', 'name': 'Gichang Lee'}, {'authorId': '2112511402', 'name': 'Jaeyun Jeong'}, {'authorId': '2072586892', 'name': 'Seungwan Seo'}, {'authorId': '26426582', 'name': 'Czangyeob Kim'}, {'authorId': '2994930', 'name': 'Pilsung Kang'}]"
1420,765838e2fcdd26b3b3725547ecfa0093f8765129,Emotional input for character-based interactive storytelling,"In most Interactive Storytelling systems, user interaction is based on natural language communication with virtual agents, either through isolated utterances or through dialogue. Natural language communication is also an essential element of interactive narratives in which the user is supposed to impersonate one of the story's characters. Whilst techniques for narrative generation and agent behaviour have made significant progress in recent years, natural language processing remains a bottleneck hampering the scalability of Interactive Storytelling systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel interaction technique based solely on emotional speech recognition. It allows the user to take part in dialogue with virtual actors without any constraints on style or expressivity, by mapping the recognised emotional categories to narrative situations and virtual characters feelings. Our Interactive Storytelling system uses an emotional planner to drive characters' behaviours. The main feature of this approach is that characters' feelings are part of the planning domain and are at the heart of narrative representations. The emotional speech recogniser analyses the speech signal to produce a variety of features which can be used to define ad-hoc categories on which to train the system. The content of our interactive narrative is an adaptation of one chapter of the XIXth century classic novel, Madame Bovary, which is well suited to a formalisation in terms of characters' feelings. At various stages of the narrative, the user can address the main character or respond to her, impersonating her lover. The emotional category extracted from the user utterance can be analysed in terms of the current narrative context, which includes characters' beliefs, feelings and expectations, to produce a specific influence on the target character, which will become visible through a change in its behaviour, achieving a high level of realism for the interaction. A limited number of emotional categories is sufficient to drive the narrative across multiple courses of actions, since it comprises over thirty narrative functions.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes.",2002.0,83.0,3653.0,"{'volume': '39 3', 'pages': '\n          281-91\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gross2002EmotionRA,\n author = {J.

Presence is currently being emphasised in modern gaming technologies (e.g. Playstation 3, Nintendo Wii) and it is thought that games which engender presence will be more enjoyable (Ravaja et al. 2006). However such views may be misguided. Presence research traditionally focuses on user experiences in virtual reality systems (e.g. head mounted displays, CAVE-like systems). In contrast, the experience of gaming is very different. Gamers willingly submit to the rules of the game, learn arbitrary relationships between the controls and the screen output, and take on the persona of their game character. Also whereas presence in VR systems is immediate, presence in gaming is gradual. Due to these differences, one can question the extent to which people feel present during gaming. A qualitative study was conducted to explore what gamers actually mean when they describe themselves as being “in the game”. Thirteen gamers were interviewed (8 male, 5 female, age range 19-32 years). The resulting grounded theory suggests being “in the game” does not necessarily mean presence (i.e. feeling like you are the character). Some people use this phrase just to emphasise their high involvement in the game. These findings differ with Brown and Cairns (2004) as they suggest at the highest state of immersion not everybody experiences presence. Furthermore, the experience of presence does not appear dependent on the game being in the first person perspective or the gamer being able to empathise with the character. Future research should investigate why some people experience presence and others do not. Possible explanations include: use of language, perception of presence, personality traits, types of immersion.",2008.0,23.0,30.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Jennett2008BeingT,\n author = {C.

The data includes over 3,000 cross-sectional observations and 39 demographic control variables. The large number of observations provides enough degrees of freedom to obtain estimates for the U.S. as a whole and for 32 states in and of themselves. This data contains measures of educational attainment for four distinct categories: (a) 9 to11 years, (b) high school diploma, (c) some college and (d) bachelor degree or more. These variables represent human capital stocks for each and every county. This is a departure from much of the economic growth literature, which has (at least in part) relied on extrapolation of stocks from flows, e.g. school enrollment data. We use a consistent two stage least squares estimation procedure. We find that (i) the percentage of a county’s population with less than a high-school education is negatively correlated with economic growth, (ii) the percentage obtaining a high school diploma is positively correlated with growth, and (iii) the percentage obtaining some college education has no clear relationship with economic growth but (iv) the percentage that obtains a bachelor degree or more is positively correlated with growth. Further, we find that (v) there is significant qualitative heterogeneity in estimated coefficients across states for the 9 to 11 years and high school diploma categories but (vi) no qualitative heterogeneity for the college level categories. The most consistent conclusion across samples is that the percent of a county’s population obtaining a bachelor degree or higher level of college education has a positive relationship with economic growth.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper was to identify whether artificial intelligence (AI) products can possess human rights, how to define their rights and obligations and what ethical standards they should follow. In this study, the human rights ethical dilemma encountered in the application and development of AI technology has been focused on and analyzed in detail in the light of the existing research status of AI ethics.


Design/methodology/approach
In this study, first of all, the development and application of AI technology, as well as the concept and characteristics of human rights ethics, are introduced. Second, the human rights ethics of AI technology are introduced in detail, including the human rights endowment of AI machines, the fault liability of AI machines and the moral orientation of AI machines. Finally, the approaches to human rights ethics are proposed to ensure that AI technology serves human beings. Every link of its research, production and application should be strictly managed and supervised.


Findings
The results show that the research in this study can provide help for the related problems encountered in AI practice. Intelligent library integrates human rights protection organically so that readers or users can experience more intimate service in this system. It is a kind of library operation mode with more efficient and convenient characteristics, which is based on digital, networked and intelligent information science. It aims at using the greenest way and digital means to realize the reading and research of human rights protection literature in the literature analysis method.


Originality/value
Intelligent library is the future development mode of new libraries, which can realize broad interconnection and sharing. It is people-oriented and can make intelligent management and service and establish the importance of the principle of human rights protection and the specific idea of the principle. The development of science and technology brings not only convenience to people's social life but also questions to be thought. People should reduce its potential harm, so as to make AI technology continue to benefit humankind.

To date, Augmented Reality has been used in many fields, such as medicine, entertainment, maintenance, architecture, education, and cognitive and motor rehabilitation but very few studies and applications of AR exist in clinical psychology. In the treatment of psychological disorders, Augmented Reality has given preliminary evidence to be a useful tool due to its adaptability to the patient needs and therapeutic purposes and interactivity. Another relevant factor is the quality of the user's experience in the Augmented Reality system determined from emotional engagement and sense of presence.

We argue that in marketing their work online, it is important to understand not only the emotional responses of the artistic works themselves but also that the sentiment evoked on their websites matters. Developing the correct website sentiment can have favorable consequences. It can increase the interest of potential consumers, assure that appropriate expectations are set for the actual consumption experience, and lead to increased sales and word of mouth marketing. Online sentiment that is ill-aligned to the emotions the actual offering evokes can have adverse consequences, including disappointment with the actual offering and buyer's remorse. To better understand the online sentiment of artists' websites, we begin by briefly revisiting the interplay between art, emotions, and the issue of online “sentiment.” Then, we describe a study of a sample of artists' websites that had the objective of gauging both the nature of and the extent of the emotions present in its text, as well as gaining an indication of the sentiment of the website. We describe the use of a relatively new content analysis tool to do this. Following this, we explore the data gathered, with the specific purpose of determining whether the emptions expressed on artists' websites can significantly predict sentiment, if so, which emotions tend to be the strongest predictors.

1447,78b017b4db92e9057cc1be290add5845b772072d,A Multi-Componential Approach to Emotion Recognition and the Effect of Personality,"Emotions are an inseparable part of human nature affecting our behavior in response to the outside world. Although most empirical studies have been dominated by two theoretical models including discrete categories of emotion and dichotomous dimensions, results from neuroscience approaches suggest a multi-processes mechanism underpinning emotional experience with a large overlap across different emotions. While these findings are consistent with the influential theories of emotion in psychology that emphasize a role for multiple component processes to generate emotion episodes, few studies have systematically investigated the relationship between discrete emotions and a full componential view. This article applies a componential framework with a data-driven approach to characterize emotional experiences evoked during movie watching. The results suggest that differences between various emotions can be captured by a few (at least 6) latent dimensions, each defined by features associated with component processes, including appraisal, expression, physiology, motivation, and feeling. In addition, the link between discrete emotions and component model is explored and results show that a componential model with a limited number of descriptors is still able to predict the level of experienced discrete emotion(s) to a satisfactory level. Finally, as appraisals may vary according to individual dispositions and biases, we also study the relationship between personality traits and emotions in our computational framework and show that the role of personality on discrete emotion differences can be better justified using the component model.",2020.0,66.0,19.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '1127-1139', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mohammadi2020AMA,\n author = {Gelareh Mohammadi and P.

Particularly since Xi Jinping’s coming-to-power in 2012 China’s reputation in the global climate change regime has improved markedly and it has gained accolades for a new determination to reverse environmental degradation at home. China’s incipient green transformation is partly due to a new actor constellation in environmental governance, a striking feature of which is the prominence of ad hoc campaigns that offer quick results but that may undermine the creation of law-based enforcement mechanisms in the long term. Another development – China’s increasing use of emerging technologies and big data analytics – has given rise to new forms of government-business alliances. These new players and innovative approaches have injected momentum into China’s environmental governance system and suggest that, contrary to conventional wisdom, authoritarian regimes can be responsive to citizen demands under certain circumstances. Yet it remains to be seen whether long-term environmental goals can be met, due to a pervasive lack of accountability, the weakening of civil society and heavy constraints on public participation.",2018.0,43.0,117.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '769 - 781', 'name': 'Environmental Politics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kostka2018TighteningTG,\n author = {Genia Kostka and Chunman Zhang},\n journal = {Environmental Politics},\n pages = {769 - 781},\n title = {Tightening the grip: environmental governance under Xi Jinping},\n volume = {27},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '66174779', 'name': 'Genia Kostka'}, {'authorId': '40911128', 'name': 'Chunman Zhang'}]"

Review of a Book by Frank Pasquale «New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI»,"The article discusses the main ideas of F. Pasquale’s book “New Laws of Robotics: Defending The Human Knowledge in the Age of AI”. In his work, Pasquale actively uses the experience gained over many years in understanding the processes of digitalization, suggesting that the transition to new forms of the economy is not an inevitable catastrophe, but as an opening of the widest range of opportunities for people who are ready to integrate the latest technologies into their lives. The book proposes the laws of robotics, supplementing the classical postulates of A. Asimov, and outlines the contours of a new paradigm for understanding scientific and technological development. This paradigm is based on the idea of synthesisof human expertise with computing power. Pasquale notes that albeit the development of artificial intelligence and robotics will require large-scale reforms of the socio-economic system, the result of them may be not the displacement of people from the labor market, but rather the transformation of machines into assistants for human work. Achieving such a goal, Pasquale emphasizes, necessarily requires that digitalization and automatization have not so much technological as legal and cultural constraints that guide its course. In this case, the introduction of AI will become a factor that increases the value of human expertise, insteadof ending up reshaping the economy in the interests of large corporations and technocratic elites.",2023.0,0.0,46.0,{'name': 'Science Management: Theory and Practice'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Sokolov2023TowardAS,\n author = {Dmitry P.

This article deals with basic biostatistical concepts and their application to enable postgraduate medical students and researchers to analyze and interpret their study data and to critically interpret published literature. The adequate choice of statistical tests has a strong influence on data interpretation. Understanding this choice is important for critical evaluation of biomedical research. The question often arises on whether to use parametric or nonparametric test. If we are planning a study and trying to determine how many patients/cases to include, a nonparametric test will require a slightly larger sample size to have the same power as the corresponding parametric test. In summary, nonparametric procedures are useful in many cases and necessary in individual, but they are not the perfect solution. Fortunately, the most frequently used parametric analyses have their non-parametric counterparts. This can be useful when the assumptions of a parametric test are violated and we can thus choose a nonparametric alternative instead.

Factor analysis and reliability results confirmed the validity of ERQ to assess adolescents’ regulation strategies. Correlation and regression results showed that a greater reliance on CR was positively associated with better well-being outcomes for most indicators, especially life satisfaction, social support perception, and positive affect; greater preference for ES conversely was associated with lower well-being level for all indicators, including psychological health, emotional loneliness, and negative affect. Neither gender nor age differences were observed for CR and ES; CR and ES were positively correlated with each other. Both analysis of variance and regression results showed gender to be a significant factor for well-being indicators (e.g. males’ higher positive affect and life satisfaction than females’), whereas age was associated with differences in psychological health only, with 16-year olds reporting the lowest health, and 14-year olds the highest. The findings overall show that adolescents’ well-being is related to preferred EmR strategies, mirroring associations found in the adult population. The study results also suggest the need to further explore this relationship in adolescence.",2016.0,69.0,88.0,"{'volume': '3', 'name': 'Cogent Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Verzeletti2016EmotionRS,\n author = {Chiara Verzeletti and V.

Although most of these existing works focus on game adaptation based on player's performance, affective state experienced by the players could play a key role in gaming experience and may provide a useful indicator for a DDA mechanism. In this article, an affect-based DDA was designed and implemented for computer games. In this DDA mechanism, a player's physiological signals were analyzed to infer his or her probable anxiety level, which was chosen as the target affective state, and the game difficulty level was automatically adjusted in real time as a function of the player's affective state. Peripheral physiological signals were measured through wearable biofeedback sensors and several physiological indices were explored to determine their correlations with anxiety. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the affect-based DDA on game play by comparing it with a performance-based DDA.

Purpose To compare the performance of radiologists in detecting malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs when assisted by deep learning-based DCNN software with that of radiologists or DCNN software alone in a multicenter setting. Materials and Methods Investigators at four medical centers retrospectively identified 600 lung cancer-containing chest radiographs and 200 normal chest radiographs. Each radiograph with a lung cancer had at least one malignant nodule confirmed by CT and pathologic examination. Twelve radiologists from the four centers independently analyzed the chest radiographs and marked regions of interest. Commercially available deep learning-based computer-aided detection software separately trained, tested, and validated with 19 330 radiographs was used to find suspicious nodules. The radiologists then reviewed the images with the assistance of DCNN software. The sensitivity and number of false-positive findings per image of DCNN software, radiologists alone, and radiologists with the use of DCNN software were analyzed by using logistic regression and Poisson regression. Results The average sensitivity of radiologists improved (from 65.1% [1375 of 2112; 95% confidence interval {CI}: 62.0%, 68.1%] to 70.3% [1484 of 2112; 95% CI: 67.2%, 73.1%], P < .001) and the number of false-positive findings per radiograph declined (from 0.2 [488 of 2400; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.22] to 0.18 [422 of 2400; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.2], P < .001) when the radiologists re-reviewed radiographs with the DCNN software. For the 12 radiologists in this study, 104 of 2400 radiographs were positively changed (from false-negative to true-positive or from false-positive to true-negative) using the DCNN, while 56 of 2400 radiographs were changed negatively. Conclusion Radiologists had better performance with deep convolutional network software for the detection of malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs than without. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

From the moment patients come into contact with the health care system, their entire medical history is recorded electronically. Whether a patient is in the operating room or on the hospital ward, technological advancement has facilitated the expedient and reliable measurement of clinically relevant health metrics, all in an effort to guide care and ensure the best possible clinical outcomes. However, as the volume and complexity of biomedical data grow, it becomes challenging to effectively process “big data” using conventional techniques. Physicians and scientists must be prepared to look beyond classic methods of data processing to extract clinically relevant information. The purpose of this article is to introduce the modern plastic surgeon to machine learning and computational interpretation of large data sets. What is machine learning? Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, can address clinically relevant problems in several domains of plastic surgery, including burn surgery; microsurgery; and craniofacial, peripheral nerve, and aesthetic surgery.

This article aims to provide an integrative review of the latest theoretical and empirical developments in this rapidly growing field of research. Recent findings Deficits in emotion regulation appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and treatment of various forms of psychopathology. Increasing evidence demonstrates that deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with challenging emotions are related to depression, borderline personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and a variety of other psychopathological symptoms. Unfortunately, studies differ with regard to the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation, thus limiting the ability to compare findings across studies. Future research should systematically work to use comparable methods in order to clarify the following: which individuals have; what kinds of emotion regulation difficulties with; which types of emotions; and what interventions are most effective in alleviating these difficulties.

Factor analyses yielded evidence for three major dimensions resembling those proposed by Schlosberg (1954): Pleasantness, Activation, and Control. A hypothetical emotional-expression solid, a pyramid truncated at the far end (passive direction), is proposed as a resolution of recent controversies over the number and nature of dimensions. Cluster analyses confirm the existence of some seven to ten regions within this space, densely populated with quasi-synonymous states, which warrant identification as ‘primary affects’.",1966.0,20.0,316.0,"{'volume': '7 1', 'pages': '\n          1-30\n        ', 'name': 'Scandinavian journal of psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Osgood1966DimensionalityOT,\n author = {C.

Task progression relies on team members strategically taking control of the problems and adapting accordingly. Theory indicates that productive collaboration involves groups using three modes of regulation: self-regulation, co-regulation, and socially shared regulation. Despite research demonstrating the occurrence of all three modes in collaboration, it is unclear how these modes interact and how co-regulation supports the emergence of self- and shared-regulation of motivation. The study aimed to examine the role co-regulation played in dynamically stimulating the emergence of self- and shared-regulation of motivation. A cross-case comparison was conducted between two groups who experienced high levels of motivation challenges but achieved contrasting perceptions of the overall team learning productivity. During analysis, groups’ dynamic regulatory processes within the online environment were visually represented using a tool called the Chronologically-ordered Representation for Tool-Related Activity (CORDTRA). Findings demonstrate that co-regulation of motivation may afford and thwart the emergence of self- and shared-regulation, and these processes interacted with the group’s situational challenges and the regulatory skills group members possessed. Comparisons between the two groups indicated that groups' motivation regulation should (a) match the demands of the challenges at hand, (b) be positively supported by group members through co-regulation, and (b) involve a more varied strategic responses so that the group may continue to learn and co-construct knowledge effectively as a team.",2020.0,58.0,12.0,{'name': 'Frontline Learning Research'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Bakhtiar2020DynamicIB,\n author = {Aishah Bakhtiar and A.

The HAL 9000 computer, in the 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, for example, assured, “I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.” Machine learning raises many challenging legal and ethical questions as to the relationship between man and machine, humans’ control -- or lack of it -- over machines, and accountability for machine activities. While these issues have long captivated our interest, few would envision the day when these developments (and the legal and ethical challenges raised by them) would become an antitrust issue. Sophisticated computers are central to the competitiveness of present and future markets. With the accelerating development of AI, they are set to change the competitive landscape and the nature of competitive restraints. As pricing mechanisms shift to computer pricing algorithms, so too will the types of collusion. We are shifting from the world where executives expressly collude in smoke-filled hotel rooms to a world where pricing algorithms continually monitor and adjust to each other’s prices and market data. Our paper addresses these developments and considers the application of competition law to an advanced ‘computerised trade environment.’ After discussing the way in which computerised technology is changing the competitive landscape, we explore four scenarios where AI can foster anticompetitive collusion and the legal and ethical challenges each scenario raises.",2015.0,5.0,137.0,{'name': ''},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ezrachi2015ArtificialI,\n author = {Ariel Ezrachi and M.

My focus will be the contrasts between two approaches to coping, one that emphasizes style—that is, it treats coping as a personality characteristic—and another that emphasizes process—that is, efforts to manage stress that change over time and are shaped by the adaptational context out of which it is generated. I begin with an account of the style and process approaches, discuss their history briefly, set forth the principles of a process approach, describe my own efforts at measurement, and define coping and its functions from a process standpoint. This is followed by a digest of major generalizations that resulted from coping process research. The essay concludes with a discussion of special issues of coping measurement, in particular, the limitations of both coping style and process approaches and how these limitations might be dealt with. There has been a prodigious volume of coping research in the last decade or two, which I can only touch on very selectively. In this essay, I also ignore a host of important developmental issues that have to do with the emergence of coping and its cognitive and motivational bases in infants, as well as a growing literature on whether, how, and why the coping process changes with aging.",1993.0,85.0,3119.0,"{'volume': '55', 'pages': '234–247', 'name': 'Psychosomatic Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lazarus1993CopingTA,\n author = {R.

Yet, while academic AI research recently produced notable advances both in different methods and in real-world applications, the use of modern AI techniques, such as deep learning remains curiously sparse in commercial video games. Related work has shown that there is a notable separation between AI in games and academic AI, down to the level of the definitions of what AI is and means. To address the practical barriers that sustain this gap, we conducted a series of interviews with industry professionals.

Repressors, who fail to report negative affect, answer many self-report measures in a positive fashion. Research has identified an association between repressors, who are identified by low trait anxiety scores and high defensiveness scores, and adverse health outcomes. Therefore, repressors are an important group for health psychologists to investigate.

Subjects counted aloud during the trials. It was found that heart rate, speaking fundamental frequency (pitch), and vocal intensity (loudness) increased significantly with workload demands. Speaking rate showed a marginal increase, while vocal jitter and vocal shimmer did not show reliable changes.

The use of emojis in tweets complicates efforts in text mining and emotion analysis, as such emojis can also be used to express sarcasm when used in different contexts. In this paper, we use Twitter API to mine tweets that were geotagged by users and apply text analytics to the tweets. We also develop a system to detect events using the geospatial emotion vector in the area we are monitoring. Combining graph theory, machine learning semantics, and statistics with the geospatial emotion vectors, we track trending topics during times of extreme emotion.

It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains.

NTLs cause significant harm to the economy, as in some countries they may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed. The predominant research direction is employing artificial intelligence to predict whether a customer causes NTL. This paper first provides an overview of how NTLs are defined and their impact on economies, which include loss of revenue and profit of electricity providers and decrease of the stability and reliability of electrical power grids. It then surveys the state-of-the-art research efforts in a up-to-date and comprehensive review of algorithms, features and data sets used.

To realize such an application, an emotion recognition system should be in real time and highly accurate. As a mobile device has limited processing power, the algorithm in the emotion recognition system should be implemented using less computation. In this paper, we propose an emotion recognition with high performance for mobile applications. In the proposed system, facial video is captured by an embedded camera of a smart phone. Some representative frames are extracted from the video, and a face detection module is applied to extract the face regions in the frames. The Bandlet transform is realized on the face regions, and the resultant subband is divided into non-overlapping blocks. Local binary patterns’ histograms are calculated for each block, and then are concatenated over all the blocks. The Kruskal–Wallis feature selection is applied to select the most dominant bins of the concatenated histograms. The dominant bins are then fed into a Gaussian mixture model-based classifier to classify the emotion. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves high recognition accuracy in a reasonable time.",2017.0,30.0,77.0,"{'volume': '5', 'pages': '2281-2287', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hossain2017AnER,\n author = {M.

This paper presents a comprehensive system that models the emotional state of users and an agent to dynamically adapt dialogue utterance selection. A Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with an online solver is used to model user reactions in real-time. The model decides the emotional content of the next utterance based on the rewards from the users and the agent. The previous approaches are extended through jointly modeling the user and agent emotions, maintaining this model over time with a memory, and enabling interactions with multiple users.

1495,7c9da18856ca070add0a2d6c3a6199f0e4f64c35,A Cognitive Perspective for Understanding and Training Assertiveness,"Abstract. Assertiveness has for long been considered an optimal way of expressing oneself while at the same time maintaining and/or enhancing social rewards, leading to the conclusion that it should be promoted as an intra and interpersonal protective factor. Yet, few researchers have tried to provide a comprehensive model on assertiveness that may better sustain why and how to train it. We propose a cognitive model for explaining how assertiveness comes to be enacted and maintained, considering the activation of previous individual schemas, how they influence the processing of social cues, which in turn influence the interactive activation of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral assertive products. The assertive behavior in turn prompts reactions from the interaction partner. This interpersonal exchange will serve to confirm previous schemas and make them more accessible when facing future social events. We further review previous findings on several assumptions involved in this model and propose how the...",2016.0,52.0,10.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '109-121', 'name': 'European Psychologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vagos2016ACP,\n author = {P.

ACT is based on the premise that normal cognitive processes distort and enhance the experience of unpleasant emotion, leading clients to engage in problematic behaviors designed to avoid or attenuate those unpleasant emotions. Such avoidant behavior patterns can hinder and prevent client movement toward valued goals and place the client in harmful situations. Rather than working to change cognitions or decrease levels of emotion, the ACT approach involves the client directly experiencing problematic emotions in a context in which the literal functions of language enhancing the negative implications of those emotions are stripped away. The focus throughout the treatment is facilitating the client's movement toward a more valued and personally fulfilling life, in a context in which previously obstructive unpleasant emotions no longer serve as obstructions.

Gewiss war es unsere Absicht, ein weiteres e&iHeft dem Thema Artificial Intelligence (AI) zu widmen, die vergleichsweise junge Disziplin hat in den vergangenen vier Jahren welter an Raum gewonnen, praktische AI-Anwendungen haben sich voll bew&hrt, und stets kommen neue dazu. Nun, worin lag der glL~ckliche Zufall? ,~,nderungen im e&i-Redaktionsplan erforderten eine Verschiebung des Abdrucks der I&ngst fertig gestellten und begutachteten technisch-wissenschaftlichen AI-Originalarbeiten um zwei Monate. Dazu kam ein Interview, welches uns Herr Professor Dr. Heinz Zemanek anI~.sslich seines 85. Geburtstags gab, worin gro~e AI-Skepsis deutlich wurde (siehe Anhang). Was gait es zu tun? Es musste ~)ber den Tellerrand geschaut werden! Und dies wurde durch den ersten wissenschaftlichen Beitrag dieses Heftes von den Professoren Dr. Gittler und Dr. Arendasy der Fakult&t fSr Psychologie an der Universit&t Wien mSglich. Die menschliche Intelligenz und die k0nstliche Intelligenz haben scheinbar voneinander getrennte Problemfelder; 0ber beide sollte man Bescheid wissen, denn die Zukunft wird in jedem Fall sehr spannend! Jetzt ware bei einem Vorwort der Platz, um die einzelnen technisch-wissenschaftlichen Beitr~.ge zu erSrtern. Auch an dieser Stelle woltten wir zun~chst von Gewohntem abweichen. Der geneigte fachkundige Leser werde sich ja ohnedies anhand des Inhaltsverzeichnisses rasch zurechtfinden und urteilen. Fer den interessierten Neuling wollten wir nichts vorwegnehmen, unsere Stellungnahmen kSnnten f~r ihn ohnehin erst nach Lekt~Jre der Beitr&ge das nStige Gewicht erlangen. Bei der Zusammenstellung der Artikel haben wir darauf geachtet, verschiedenste Anwendungsgebiete der Artificial Intelligence zu beleuchten. So dL#fen wir Ihnen mit den folgenden f0nf Beitr&gen interessante 6sterreichische Forschungsarbeiten vorstellen, die nicht nur internationale Beachtung gefunden haben, sondem auch praktische Verwendung finden. Obwohl wir mit diesen Beitr&gen ein sehr breites Spektrum abdecken konnten d i e Beitr&ge reichen von Vertriebsunterst0tzung durch wissensbasierte Systeme 0ber flexible intelligente Benutzerschnittstellen zur L6sungssuche, Extraktion von Informationen aus dem Web, autonome mobile Roboter bis hin zur automatischen Strukturierung und Visualisierung von digitalen Musiksammlungen kann ein Sonderheft bei weitem nicht dem Anwendungsspektrum der Artificial Intelligence gerecht werden.

Wenn auch der Begrift ,,Artificial Intelligence"" zu Widerspruch herausfordern mag und bei manchen Personen ~,ngste provoziert, so darf man nicht die Augen vor den Fakten verschlieBen.

Acoustic measures of speaking fundamental frequency (SFF), pitch sigma, jitter, shimmer, and signal‐to‐noise ratio, as well as respiratory‐based measures of vital capacity (VC), maximum phonation time (MPT), and phonation quotient (PQ) were obtained. Results indicated that the aging groups differed significantly in terms of SFF, pitch sigma, MPT, and VC. In addition, discriminant function analysis was used to classify subjects into age group via a three‐variable model consisting of VC, SFF, and pitch sigma (84% accuracy), and into pre‐ vs. post‐menopausal status via a two‐variable model consisting of VC and pitch sigma (92% accuracy).

Wilson's (1967) review of the area of subjective well-being (SWB) advanced several conclusions regarding those who report high levels of ""happiness."" A number of his conclusions have been overturned: youth and modest aspirations no longer are seen as prerequisites of SWB. E. Diener's (1984) review placed greater emphasis on theories that stressed psychological factors. In the current article, the authors review current evidence for Wilson's conclusions and discuss modern theories of SWB that stress dispositional influences, adaptation, goals, and coping strategies. The next steps in the evolution of the field are to comprehend the interaction of psychological factors with life circumstances in producing SWB, to understand the causal pathways leading to happiness, understand the processes underlying adaptation to events, and develop theories that explain why certain variables differentially influence the different components of SWB (life satisfaction, pleasant affect, and unpleasant affect).",2004.0,271.0,11004.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Diener2004SubjectiveWT,\n author = {E.

The current article reviews the levels of understanding of informational states that are believed to underlie cognitive perspective-taking from this conceptual framework. An alternative approach to perspective-taking from a functional behavioral framework is also presented. The concepts and methodologies behind this approach are driven by a modern behavioral account of human language and cognition known as Relational Frame Theory. As well as providing a brief summary of the core concepts of Relational Frame Theory, the article presents the relational frame account of cognitive perspective-taking. The empirical evidence in support of this view of perspective-taking as well as related research on false belief and deception are reviewed.

1513,7e6e62c34aa836fe0792c9bda1231e465efb7eb8,Parenting and Digital Media: From the Early Web to Contemporary Digital Society,"Parents have accessed websites, online discussion forums and blogs for advice, information and support since the early days of the World Wide Web (which first became widely available to users in the mid-1990s). In this century, the advent of mobile media such as smartphones and tablet computers and Wi-Fi has allowed parents to access the web from almost any location. They can use social-media platforms and apps (software applications for mobile devices) as part of their parenting practices. These technologies have brought with them opportunities for parents to seek information and support and exchange details of their experiences with each other in a variety of ways. These practices contribute to datafication, that is, rendering details of people’s lives into digital data formats (van Dijck 2014) - not only of parents themselves but also of their children. The possibilities that now exist not only for voluntary sharing of one’s personal data with others, but also for data leakage and commercial exploitation of this information, are key differences between the early digital media that were available to parents and those that they currently use. 
 
In this article, we review the literature in sociology and related social research addressing the ways in which digital media have been used for parenting-related purposes. We begin with the longer-established media of parenting websites, online discussion forums, blogs, email, mobile phones and message and video services and then move on to the newer technologies of social media and apps.

The concluding section summarises some major issues arising from the review and points to directions for further research.",2016.0,123.0,138.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '730-743', 'name': 'Sociology Compass'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lupton2016ParentingAD,\n author = {Deborah Lupton and Sarah Pedersen and G.

1517,7eb251bd50fd5c8c4736bbb4052bb417c4750f95,Cognitive Science: The Newest Science of the Artificial,"Cognitive science is, of course, not really a new discipline, but a recognition of a fundamental set of common concerns shared by the disciplines of psychology, computer science, linguistics, economics, epistemology, and the social sciences generally. All of these disciplines are concerned with information processing systems, and all of them are concerned with systems that are adaptive—that are what they are from being ground between the nether millstone of their physiology or hardware, as the case may be, and the upper millstone of a complex environment in which they exist. Systems that are adaptive may equally well be described as “artificial,” for as environments change, they can be expected to change too, as though they were deliberately designed to fit those environments (as indeed they sometimes are). The task of empirical science is to discover and verify invariants in the phenomena under study. The artificiality of information processing systems creates a subtle problem in defining empirical invariants in such systems. For observed regularities are very likely invariant only within a limited range of variation in their environments, and any accurate statement of the laws of such systems must contain reference to their relativity to environmental features. It is a common experience in experimental psychology, for example, to discover that we are studying sociology—the effects of the past histories of our subjects—when we think we are studying physiology—the effects of properties of the human nervous system. Similarly, business cycle economists are only now becoming aware of the extent to which the parameters of the system they are studying are dependent on the experiences of a population with economic events over the previous generation. In artificial sciences, the descriptive and the normative are never far apart. Thus, in economics, the “principle of rationality” is sometimes asserted as a descriptive invariant, sometimes as advice to decision makers. Similarly, in psychology, the processes of adaptation (learning) have always been a central topic, at one time a topic that dominated the whole field of research. Linguistics, too, has suffered its confusions between descriptive and normative attitudes towards its subject. But we must avoid the error, in studying information processing systems, of thinking that the adaptive processes themselves must be invariant; and we must be prepared to face the complexities of regression in the possibility that they themselves may be subject to improvement and adaptation. It might have been necessary a decade ago to argue for the commonality of the information processes that are employed by such disparate systems as computers and human nervous systems. The evidence for that commonality is now overwhelming, and the remaining questions about the boundaries of cognitive science have more to do with whether there also exist nontrivial commonalities with information processing in genetic systems than with whether men and machines both think.",1980.0,22.0,262.0,"{'volume': '4', 'pages': '33-46', 'name': 'Cogn.

The critical and creative voice of students,"Abstract University accounting education typically develops the technical skills that students require to enter into the world of commerce. However, in the context of the rapidly changing socioeconomic environment, and a proliferation of corporate and financial collapses, there have been calls for educators to provide a more contextual appreciation of accounting practice. The changing nature of work has also generated calls for the development of generic skills in students, such as creativity and critical thinking. We outline our efforts to offer third-year university students the opportunity to use creativity in response to their major assessment task. This task required students to explore the ethical dimension of a recent corporate collapse and present their understanding in a modality of their choice. Our analysis of the creative experience of students suggests that such a creative approach to assessment opens up possibilities for a transformative educational experience.

Are these signals reliant on culturally learned cues or are they intelligible across individuals lacking exposure to a common culture? To find out, we traveled to a remote Kreung village in Ratanakiri, Cambodia. First, we recorded Kreung portrayals of 5 emotions through bodily movement. These videos were later shown to American participants, who matched the videos with appropriate emotional labels with above chance accuracy (Study 1). The Kreung also viewed Western point-light displays of emotions. After each display, they were asked to either freely describe what was being expressed (Study 2) or choose from 5 predetermined response options (Study 3). Across these studies, Kreung participants recognized Western point-light displays of anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and pride with above chance accuracy. Kreung raters were not above chance in deciphering an American point-light display depicting love, suggesting that recognizing love may rely, at least in part, on culturally specific cues or modalities other than bodily movement. In addition, multidimensional scaling of the patterns of nonverbal behavior associated with each emotion in each culture suggested that similar patterns of nonverbal behavior are used to convey the same emotions across cultures. The considerable cross-cultural intelligibility observed across these studies suggests that the communication of emotion through movement is largely shaped by aspects of physiology and the environment shared by all humans, irrespective of differences in cultural context.",2017.0,65.0,26.0,"{'volume': '17', 'pages': '459–477', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Parkinson2017EmotionsAU,\n author = {Carolyn Parkinson and Trent Walker and Sarah Memmi and T.

Previous correlational evidence suggests that subjective time loss occurs during playing videogames. This study examined experiences of time loss among a relatively large group of gamers (n = 280). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through an online survey. Results showed that time loss occurred irrespective of gender, age, or frequency of play, but was associated with particular structural characteristics of games such as their complexity, the presence of multi-levels, missions and/or high scores, multiplayer interactions, and plot. Results also demonstrated that time loss could have both positive and negative outcomes for players. Positive aspects of time loss included helping players to relax and temporarily escape from reality. Negative aspects included the sacrificing of other things in their lives, guilty feelings about wasted time, and social conflict.

1525,7f6acbbeabcbd585ef52105749705ca9cc3854bc,"What is consciousness, and could machines have it?","The controversial question of whether machines may ever be conscious must be based on a careful consideration of how consciousness arises in the only physical system that undoubtedly possesses it: the human brain. We suggest that the word “consciousness” conflates two different types of information-processing computations in the brain: the selection of information for global broadcasting, thus making it flexibly available for computation and report (C1, consciousness in the first sense), and the self-monitoring of those computations, leading to a subjective sense of certainty or error (C2, consciousness in the second sense). We argue that despite their recent successes, current machines are still mostly implementing computations that reflect unconscious processing (C0) in the human brain. We review the psychological and neural science of unconscious (C0) and conscious computations (C1 and C2) and outline how they may inspire novel machine architectures.",2017.0,108.0,424.0,"{'volume': '358', 'pages': '486 - 492', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dehaene2017WhatIC,\n author = {S.

Much surveillance is applied categorically and beyond persons to places, spaces, networks and categories of person and the distinction between self and other surveillance can be blurred. Drawing from characteristics of the technology, the data collection process and the nature of the data, this article identifies 28 dimensions that are useful in characterizing means of surveillance. These dimensions highlight the differences between the new and traditional surveillance and offer a way to capture major sources of variation relevant to contemporary social, ethical and policy considerations. There can be little doubt that major changes have occurred. However the normative implications of this are mixed and dependent on the technology in question and evaluative framework. The concept of surveillance slack is introduced. This involves the extent to which a technology is applied, rather than the absolute amount of surveillance.

1527,7f971c2cb3b1ecf9c7f13e524fb481a70da596bd,Social control and the institutionalization of human rights as an ethical framework for media and ICT corporations,"
Purpose
This paper is concerned with the place of human rights in the process of technological development but specifically as this process is situated within the corporate-technological complex of modern digital communications and their derivatives. This paper aims to argue that expecting and institutionalizing the incorporation of human rights in the process of technological innovation and production, particularly in the context of global economic actors, constitutes a necessary act if we want to navigate the immediate future of artificial intelligence and ubiquitous connectivity in ways that protect democracy and human dignity.


Design/methodology/approach
The discussion presents the case for defending human rights through a social control perspective, which assumes the conscious quest for impacting change and cartographing a path of actions and intentions. The authors approach the problem from James Ralph Beniger’s theory of the Control Revolution (1986) to explain the emergence of a new social order and to outline the main challenges brought particularly by media and information and communication technology (ICT) corporations as global actors of power.


Findings
Ethics initiatives, considering human rights as an ethical framework for media and ICT businesses, can be based on social control perspectives to regard the more complex variables interacting in the formation of effective policy making. It is the right to participate in the construction of knowledge in society and, informed by this knowledge, help manage or control democratic issues, including influencing on the regulation of technology and other cultural formats of control (Altheide, 1995). Knowing social control tools enable citizens to lead their destinies, plan their freedom and the change what they wish in the societies they live in.


Originality/value
Social control is often understood as a term taken for granted and many times faced as representing malignant and anti-democratic forms. Here, the authors try to build a theoretical ground where both sides – the benign and the malignant – can be taken in consideration to bring awareness to the need to discuss social control as a democratic endeavor, and consider human rights as part of this and not something apart and idealized. The practice of human rights is directly associated with social control forms and is from within these practices individuals must understand its role on social control and act.

1533,80614632d4b8be36ffa6cab129db1da0d87f8189,Computer-Based Social Anxiety Regulation in Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD), commonly referred to social phobia, is one of the most an immense and unreasonable fear of social interaction. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the most thoroughly studied nonpharmacologic approach to the treatment of SAD patients. In CBT, patients are gradually, in vivo, exposed to anxiety-provoking real-life situations until habituation occurs and patients’ fear dissipates. Although effective for most patients, there are some clear limitations: some specific and required social situations are difficult to arrange due to unpredictability and possibly short duration of these naturally occurring social interactions, the therapist has limited control over anxiety provoking elements during the exposure, and individuals with social phobia have high refusal rate for in vivo exposure to the dreaded and fearful social situation. Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) has been suggested as an alternative to overcome many shortcomings of in vivo exposure. Contrary to exposure in vivo, in a VRET system the therapist can manipulate the exposure elements in a safer, manageable and cost-effective way. A VRET system presents fear eliciting stimuli to the patient in a Virtual Reality environment where the parameters of its anxiety evoking stimuli can be easily gradually manipulated by a therapist. The state of the art and recent enhancement of Internet and VR technology seems to be able to meet the ever-increasing demand for more accessibility and efficiency of mental healthcare services by bringing the VRET system directly at patient’s home. This thesis presents the development and evaluation of such an envisioned home-based VRET system for SAD patients. The blue-print of the envisioned system design entails several key elements that need to be established. All those key elements were investigated and evaluated empirically in three separated studies followed up by a feasibility study. The first key element identified, is the system’s ability to measure the patient’s anxiety level automatically. Traditionally in VRET this is done using self-reported anxiety measurements, where patients are asked to report their anxiety every four or five minutes. Without the direct involvement of a therapist, it is up to the system to determine the appropriate timing, therefore, the timing is a crucial element. An empirical study involving 24 participants investigated the effects of three different types of automatic self-reported anxiety timing mechanisms (dialogue dependent, speech dependent and context independent). The results showed that the participants preferred a dialogue dependent timing mechanism above speech dependent or timing dependent mechanism, since it was considered as less interruptive. Moreover, the study also confirmed the needs for an accurate automatic self-reported anxiety timing mechanisms, as it could affect people’s experience and their behaviour in a dialogue with virtual human. The second key element is the system’s ability to elicit and control the anxiety evoking stimuli within the social scene. This was investigated in two successive empirical studies. The first study investigated whether an exposure to various virtual social scenarios was associated with different levels of anxiety. The 24 participants were exposed to a free-speech dialogue interaction with a virtual character in a neutral world, blind date and job interview setting. The results showed that the participants’ level of anxiety increased significantly from the neutral world, the blind date to the job interview. This indicates that various virtual social scenarios are indeed able to evoke different levels of anxiety. The second study investigated anxiety control within a dialogue in VRET system. For this, the study assessed the association between the ratio of negative and positive dialogue responses made by a virtual character and individual’s level of anxiety. Twenty-four participants were exposed to two different experimental conditions: a positive, and a negative virtual job interview condition. In the positive condition, in the course of time the number of positive responses from the virtual character increased while negative responses decreased. In the negative condition, the opposite happened. The results showed that the manipulation of the dialogue style in both conditions had a significant effect on people’s level of anxiety, their attitude, their speech behaviour, their dialogue experiences, their own emotion, and how they perceived the emotion of the virtual human. These finding demonstrate that social dialogues in a virtual environment can be manipulated for therapeutic purposes effectively. The third key element of the envisioned system is the possibility to introduce autonomous anxiety regulation. Traditionally, in the clinic a therapist tries to regulate the patients’ anxiety. However, in a home situation, a system would have to do this regulation automatically. A third empirical study was conducted to investigate and evaluate the ability and effectiveness of an automatic feedback-loop regulation mechanism for maintaining individual’s anxiety on a predefined target level. A group of 24 participants were exposed into two different system response conditions: a static and a dynamic condition. In the static condition participants were exposed to a static set of virtual reality stressors while in the dynamic condition they were exposed to a set of virtual reality stressors that changed dynamically aiming at keeping the anxiety of the participants at stable level. In the static condition, the anxiety dropped as indicated by decreased self-reported anxiety, decreased heart rate, increased heart rate variability, and longer answers. In contrary, in the dynamic condition, the participant’s anxiety level was maintained around a pre-set anxiety reference level. Therefore, the findings demonstrate that individuals’ level of anxiety can be regulated automatically using an automatic feedback-loop mechanism. Besides those three important key elements of the system design blue-print, the envisioned system also has a number of practical and important elements such as the development of a virtual health agent, the therapist application, and a secure remote database server. Together these elements lay the foundation for a home-based VRET system. To evaluate the feasibility of such proposed system to treat people with SAD at home, an empirical study was conducted. The home-based VRET system was evaluated with a group of five social anxiety disorder patients. All patients received a complete home-based VRET system and were scheduled to perform 10 treatment sessions at home. The study findings showed that the proposed system could evoke the required anxiety, as expected, which over time dropped as patients’ self-reported anxiety and heart rate gradually decreased during the exposure sessions. To conclude, this thesis argues that the proposed home-based VRET system could evoke the required anxiety in patients with substantial level of presence. By meeting the above mentioned key challenges of our study, we showed that an effective home-based VRET system can be built and provided in due course. Therefore, this finding suggests that delivering a home-based VRET system is indeed possible, which could provide numerous benefits for both patients and therapists.",2019.0,149.0,2.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Hagen2019ComputerBasedSA,\n author = {Tim van der Hagen and Dwi Hartanto},\n title = {Computer-Based Social Anxiety Regulation in Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2255068550', 'name': 'Tim van der Hagen'}, {'authorId': '2255246438', 'name': 'Dwi Hartanto'}]"

Emotion is commonly associated with logical decision making, perception, human interaction, and to a certain extent, human intelligence itself. With the growing interest of the research community towards establishing some meaningful “emotional” interactions between humans and computers, the need for reliable and deployable solutions for the identification of human emotional states is required. Recent developments in using electroencephalography (EEG) for emotion recognition have garnered strong interest from the research community as the latest developments in consumer-grade wearable EEG solutions can provide a cheap, portable, and simple solution for identifying emotions. Since the last comprehensive review was conducted back from the years 2009 to 2016, this paper will update on the current progress of emotion recognition using EEG signals from 2016 to 2019. The focus on this state-of-the-art review focuses on the elements of emotion stimuli type and presentation approach, study size, EEG hardware, machine learning classifiers, and classification approach. From this state-of-the-art review, we suggest several future research opportunities including proposing a different approach in presenting the stimuli in the form of virtual reality (VR). To this end, an additional section devoted specifically to reviewing only VR studies within this research domain is presented as the motivation for this proposed new approach using VR as the stimuli presentation device.

The aim is to develop a smart device capable of promoting and measuring the actions of infants in the first months of life. The CareToy system, inspired by a commercially available gym for infants and equipped with a variety of sensors, can provide an intensive, individualized, home-based and family-centered EI program remotely telemonitored by clinicians. An array of sensors measures the activity of infants inside the gym.

1546,81d3ce427e0707b30ce80f6e07f9a8cab79dbb9b,Why a Right to Explanation of Automated Decision-Making Does Not Exist in the General Data Protection Regulation,"Since approval of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016, it has been widely and repeatedly claimed that the GDPR will legally mandate a ‘right to explanation’ of all decisions made by automated or artificially intelligent algorithmic systems. This right to explanation is viewed as an ideal mechanism to enhance the accountability and transparency of automated decision-making. However, there are several reasons to doubt both the legal existence and the feasibility of such a right. In contrast to the right to explanation of specific automated decisions claimed elsewhere, the GDPR only mandates that data subjects receive meaningful, but properly limited, information (Articles 13-15) about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of automated decision-making systems, what we term a ‘right to be informed’. Further, the ambiguity and limited scope of the ‘right not to be subject to automated decision-making’ contained in Article 22 (from which the alleged ‘right to explanation’ stems) raises questions over the protection actually afforded to data subjects. These problems show that the GDPR lacks precise language as well as explicit and well-defined rights and safeguards against automated decision-making, and therefore runs the risk of being toothless. We propose a number of legislative and policy steps that, if taken, may improve the transparency and accountability of automated decision-making when the GDPR comes into force in 2018.",2017.0,63.0,654.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '76-99', 'name': 'International Data Privacy Law'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wachter2017WhyAR,\n author = {Sandra Wachter and B.

1547,81da5a72433a2740f6224ddb72fc9d77cea894fd,"Smart tourist information points by combining agents, semantics and AI techniques","The tourism sector in the province of Teruel (Aragon, Spain) is increasing 
 rapidly. Although the number of domestic and foreign tourists is continuously 
 growing, there are some tourist attractions spread over a wide geographical 
 area, which are only visited by a few people at specific times of the year. 
 Additionally, having human tourist guides everywhere and speaking different 
 languages is unfeasible. An integrated solution based on smart and 
 interactive Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) tourist guides combined 
 with ontologies would overcome this problem. This paper presents a smart 
 tourist information points approach which gathers tourism information about 
 Teruel, structured according to a novel lightweight ontology built on OWL 
 (Ontology Web Language), known as TITERIA (Touristic Information of TEruel 
 for Intelligent Agents). Our proposal, which combines TITERIA with the Maxine 
 platform, is capable of responding appropriately to the users thanks to its 
 Artificial Intelligence Modeling Language (AIML) database and the AI 
 techniques added to Maxine. Preliminary results indicate that our prototype 
 is able to inform users about interesting topics, as well as to propose other 
 related information, allowing them to acquire a complete information about 
 any issue. Furthermore, users can directly talk with an artificial actor 
 making communication much more natural and closer.",2017.0,39.0,21.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '1-23', 'name': 'Comput. Sci. Inf.

Adolescents seek new experiences and higher levels of rewarding stimulation, and often engage in risky behaviors, without considering future outcomes or consequences. These behaviors can have adaptive benefits with regard to the development of independence and survival without parental protection, but also render the adolescent more vulnerable to harm. Indeed, the risk of injury or death is higher during the adolescent period than in childhood or adulthood, and the incidence of depression, anxiety, drug use and addiction, and eating disorders increases. Brain pathways that play a key role in emotional regulation and cognitive function undergo distinct maturational changes during this transition period. It is clear that adolescents think and act differently from adults, yet relatively little is known about the precise mechanisms underlying neural, behavioral, and cognitive events during this period. Increased investigation of these dynamic alterations, particularly in prefrontal and related corticolimbic circuitry, may aid this understanding. Moreover, the investigation of mammalian animal models of adolescence—such as those examining impulsivity, reward sensitivity, and decision making—may also provide new opportunities for addressing the problem of adolescent vulnerability.",2004.0,24.0,293.0,"{'volume': '1021', 'name': 'Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kelley2004RiskTA,\n author = {A.

Despite efforts made in developing various methods for FER, existing approaches lack generalizability when applied to unseen images or those that are captured in wild setting (i.e. the results are not significant). Most of the existing approaches are based on engineered features (e.g. HOG, LBPH, and Gabor) where the classifier's hyper-parameters are tuned to give best recognition accuracies across a single database, or a small collection of similar databases. This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture to address the FER problem across multiple well-known standard face datasets. Specifically, our network consists of two convolutional layers each followed by max pooling and then four Inception layers. The network is a single component architecture that takes registered facial images as the input and classifies them into either of the six basic or the neutral expressions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on seven publicly available facial expression databases, viz. MultiPIE, MMI, CK+, DISFA, FERA, SFEW, and FER2013. The results of our proposed architecture are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods and better than traditional convolutional neural networks in both accuracy and training time.",2015.0,57.0,752.0,"{'pages': '1-10', 'name': '2016 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mollahosseini2015GoingDI,\n author = {A.

It seems to be a general rule that variations in what we call the augmented prosodic domain (APD) are emotive-perhaps because they signal departure from a reference point corresponding to a well-controlled, neutral state. The studies show that various departures from that reference point are reflected in the APD, including central and sensory impairments (schizophrenia and deafness) as well as emotion. Intuitively it seems right to acknowledge that departures from well-controlled neutrality are highly confusable, and it is unclear that phonetics should to try draw those distinctions more sharply than listeners tend to.

Students are often found to suffer from poor self-awareness, low self-esteem, lack of motivation, little self-discipline, poor peer interaction, an inability to express feelings effectively, and sometimes, a significant amount of emotional pain such as feeling sad, unhappy, anxious, frustrated, and angry. Based on the concept and model of Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EQ) by Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso (1997), the authors discuss how the mechanism of EQ can enhance students’ emotional competency which in turn improve their learning in the classroom. Present study was conducted in 5 secondary schools in the state of Selangor, Malaysia, to examine students’ overall level of EQ and the relationship between students’ level of EQ and their level of negative affect (anxiety, anger, and frustration) towards specific school tasks and academic achievement. Research findings indicate that there is linear negative relationship between students’ level of EQ and their level of negative affect towards specific school tasks, and positive linear relationship between EQ and academic achievement.

For the United States with its advanced industrial and technological base, many examples of ‘doctrine driving technology’ can be found. For the People's Liberation Army (PLA), however, most evidence from military sources indicates that ‘technology drives doctrine’ or, as the Chinese say, ‘technology determines tactics’ (but not necessarily strategy). Within an overarching Chinese strategic framework, tactics and doctrine will be developed appropriate for (a) the weapons and technologies that are actually in the Chinese armed forces and (b) the people who must operate and maintain them. The Chinese civilian and military leadership has designated 2049 for completion of the modernization of the Chinese armed forces, a date selected in conjunction with the target for achieving China's main strategic priority, national economic modernization. Barring a major change in the strategic or domestic environment, we can expect that Beijing will continue to pursue the development of new weapons and technology in a manner consistent with the larger goal of national economic development. Exactly how China fights in the future will be dependent upon the weapons and technologies available – and they will be employed within the parameters defined by active defense and People's War.",2011.0,19.0,23.0,"{'volume': '34', 'pages': '355 - 381', 'name': 'Journal of Strategic Studies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Blasko2011TechnologyDT,\n author = {Dennis J.

As a result, many organizations have launched a wide range of initiatives to establish ethical principles for the adoption of socially beneficial AI. Unfortunately, the sheer volume of proposed principles threatens to overwhelm and confuse. How might this problem of ‘principle proliferation’ be solved? In this paper, we report the results of a fine-grained analysis of several of the highest-profile sets of ethical principles for AI. We assess whether these principles converge upon a set of agreed-upon principles, or diverge, with significant disagreement over what constitutes ‘ethical AI.’ Our analysis finds a high degree of overlap among the sets of principles we analyze. We then identify an overarching framework consisting of five core principles for ethical AI. Four of them are core principles commonly used in bioethics: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice. On the basis of our comparative analysis, we argue that a new principle is needed in addition: explicability, understood as incorporating both the epistemological sense of intelligibility (as an answer to the question ‘how does it work?’) and in the ethical sense of accountability (as an answer to the question: ‘who is responsible for the way it works?’). In the ensuing discussion, we note the limitations and assess the implications of this ethical framework for future efforts to create laws, rules, technical standards, and best practices for ethical AI in a wide range of contexts.KeywordsAccountability; Autonomy; Artificial Intelligence; Beneficence; Ethics; Explicability; Fairness; Intelligibility; Justice; Non-maleficence.",2019.0,22.0,347.0,{'name': 'Issue 1'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Floridi2019AUF,\n author = {L.

China urgently needs political reform to deal with the rapidly mounting problems of corruption, abuse of power, financial scandals, rising crime and inequality, and declining legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. A rule of law, with an independent judiciary and other autonomous institutions of horizontal accountability, is vital if China is to rein in these problems and deliver better, fairer, more transparent and effective governance. However, Pan Wei's proposed system goes only part of the way toward addressing the deficiencies of governance in China, and is therefore best viewed as a transitional framework. To work, horizontal accountability must be supplemented with and reinforced by vertical account ability, through competitive elections, which give local officials an incentive to serve the public good and enable bad officials to be removed by the people. Ultimately, I argue, China can only achieve adequate and enduring political accountability by moving toward democracy. Among the other issues addressed in the paper are the architecture and appointment of a system of horizontal accountability for China; the role of the Communist Party (or its successor hegemon) in a 'rule of law' system; and the timing and phasing of the transition to a rule of law.",2003.0,7.0,19.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '319 - 331', 'name': 'Journal of Contemporary China'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Diamond2003TheRO,\n author = {L.

We use concepts from control theory to model the interaction between human physiology and game difficulty during game play. We validate the approach on a car-racing game with real-time adaptive game mechanics. Specifically, we use car speed, road visibility, and steering jitter as three mechanisms to manipulate game difficulty. We propose quantitative measures to characterize the effectiveness of these game adaptations in manipulating the player's arousal. For this purpose, we use electro dermal activity (EDA) as a physiological correlate of arousal. Experimental trials with 20 subjects in both open-loop (no feedback) and closed-loop (negative feedback) conditions show statistically significant differences among the three game mechanics in terms of their effectiveness. Specifically, manipulating car speed provides higher arousal levels than changing road visibility or vehicle steering.

We hypothesize that individuals can be characterized by their own network with unique architecture and resulting dynamics. With respect to architecture, we show that individuals vulnerable to developing MD are those with strong connections between symptoms: e.g., only one night of poor sleep suffices to make a particular person feel tired. Such vulnerable networks, when pushed by forces external to the system such as stress, are more likely to end up in a depressed state; whereas networks with weaker connections tend to remain in or return to a non-depressed state. We show this with a simulation in which we model the probability of a symptom becoming ‘active’ as a logistic function of the activity of its neighboring symptoms. Additionally, we show that this model potentially explains some well-known empirical phenomena such as spontaneous recovery as well as accommodates existing theories about the various subtypes of MD. To our knowledge, we offer the first intra-individual, symptom-based, process model with the potential to explain the pathogenesis and maintenance of major depression.",2016.0,117.0,297.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cramer2016MajorDA,\n author = {A.

Shapes and their characteristics such as roundness, angularity, simplicity, and complexity have been postulated to affect the emotional responses of human beings in the field of visual arts and psychology. However, no prior research has modeled the dimensionality of emotions aroused by roundness and angularity. Our contributions include an in depth statistical analysis to understand the relationship between shapes and emotions. Through experimental results on the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) dataset we provide evidence for the significance of roundness-angularity and simplicity-complexity on predicting emotional content in images. We combine our shape features with other state-of-the-art features to show a gain in prediction and classification accuracy. We model emotions from a dimensional perspective in order to predict valence and arousal ratings which have advantages over modeling the traditional discrete emotional categories. Finally, we distinguish images with strong emotional content from emotionally neutral images with high accuracy.",2012.0,55.0,137.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Multimedia'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Lu2012OnSA,\n author = {Xin Lu and Poonam Suryanarayan and Reginald B.

1588,855cd6e83866fc69f219dc5738bb6ad901de9250,How Can We Be Moved to Shoot Zombies? A Paradox of Fictional Emotions and Actions in Interactive Fiction,"Abstract How can we be moved by the fate of Anna Karenina? By asking this question, Colin Radford introduced the paradox of fiction, or the problem that we are often emotionally moved by characters and events which we know don’t really exist (1975). A puzzling element of these emotions that always resurfaced within discussions on the paradox is the fact that, although these emotions feel real to the people who have them, their difference from ›real‹ emotions is that they cannot motivate us to perform any actions. The idea that actions towards fictional particulars are impossible still underlies recent work within the philosophy of fiction (cf. Matravers 2014, 26 sqq.; Friend 2017, 220; Stock 2017, 168). In the past decennia, however, the medium of interactive fiction has challenged this crystallized idea. Videogames, especially augmented and virtual reality games, offer us agency in their fictional worlds: players of computer games can interact with fictional objects, save characters that are invented, and kill monsters that are clearly non-existent within worlds that are mere representations on a screen. In a parallel to Radford’s original question, we might ask: how can we be moved to shoot zombies, when we know they aren’t real? The purpose of this article is to examine the new paradox of interactive fiction, which questions how we can be moved to act on objects we know to be fictional, its possible solutions, and its connection to the traditional paradox of fictional emotions. Videogames differ from traditional fictional media in that they let their appreciators enter their fictional worlds in the guise of a fictional proxy, and grant their players agency within this world. As interactive fictions, videogames reveal new elements of the relationship between fiction, emotions, and actions that have been previously neglected because of the focus on non-interactive fiction such as literature, theatre, and film. They show us that fictional objects can not only cause actions, but can also be the intentional object of these actions. Moreover, they show us that emotions towards fictions can motivate us to act, and that conversely, the possibility of undertaking actions within the fictional world makes a wider array of emotions towards fictional objects possible. Since the player is involved in the fictional world and responsible for his actions therein, self-reflexive emotions such as guilt and shame are common reactions to the interactive fiction experience. As such, videogames point out a very close connection between emotions and actions towards fictions and introduce the paradox of interactive fiction: a paradox of fictional actions. This paradox of fictional actions that is connected to our experiences of interactive fiction consists of three premises that cannot be true at the same time, as this would result in a contradiction: 1. Players act on videogame objects. 2. Videogame objects are fictional. 3. It is impossible to act on fictional objects.   The first premise seems to be obviously true: gamers manipulate game objects when playing. The second one is true for at least some videogame objects we act upon, such as zombies. The third premise is a consequence of the ontological gap between the real world and fictional worlds. So which one needs to be rejected? Although the paradox of interactive fiction is never discussed as such within videogame philosophy, there seem to be two strategies at hand to solve this paradox, both of which are examined in this article. The first strategy is to deny that the game objects we can act on are fictional at all. Espen Aarseth, for example, argues that they are virtual objects (cf. 2007), while other philosophers argue that players interact with real, computer-generated graphical representations (cf. Juul 2005; Sageng 2012). However, Aarseth’s concept of the virtual seems to be ad hoc and unhelpful, and describing videogame objects and characters as real, computer-generated graphical representations does not account for the emotional way in which we often relate to them. The second solution is based on Kendall Walton’s make-believe theory, and, similar to Walton’s solution to the original paradox of fictional emotions, says that the actions we perform towards fictional game objects are not real actions, but fictional actions. A Waltonian description of fictional actions can explain our paradoxical actions on fictional objects in videogames, although it does raise questions about the validity of Walton’s concept of quasi-emotions. Indeed, the way players’ emotions can motivate them to act in a certain manner seems to be a strong argument against the concept of quasi-emotions, which Walton introduced to explain the alleged non-motivationality of emotions towards fiction (cf. 1990, 201 sq.). Although both strategies to solve the paradox of interactive fiction might ultimately not be entirely satisfactory, the presentation of these strategies in this paper not only introduces a starting point for discussing this paradox, but also usefully supplements and clarifies existing discussions on the paradoxical emotions we feel towards fictions. I argue that if we wish to solve the paradox of actions towards (interactive) fiction, we should treat it in close conjunction with the traditional paradox of emotional responses to fiction.",2018.0,26.0,7.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '279 - 299', 'name': 'Journal of Literary Theory'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mosselaer2018HowCW,\n author = {Nele Van de Mosselaer},\n journal = {Journal of Literary Theory},\n pages = {279 - 299},\n title = {How Can We Be Moved to Shoot Zombies?

They also represent one of the major limitations in today’s human-computer interaction systems. It is thus only natural that the possibility of interpreting and analysing human emotion has been a widely research topic within the field of affective computing. This thesis is located at the intersection of artificial intelligence, humancomputer interaction and psychophysiology, bringing together emerging concepts from user research studies with methodologies from artificial intelligence and usability design; a novel take on user experience analysis and affect-driven, real-time adaption. Various studies have correlated emotions and user experience, establishing them as a crucial factor in attaining engaging experiences. Unfortunately, improving the player’s experience by actively adapting the provided affective experience is still a considerably under-explored research field. This creates the need for accurate real-time emotion detection and – primarily – to systems capable of learning from each user's reactions, so that they are able to trigger the most adequate emotional states in a logical, coherent and timely manner. Implementing such a system is riddled with a series of challenging obstacles. These range from the aforementioned real-time emotional detection systems to emotional reaction annotation methods and systems capable of dynamically altering their content coherently. However, the main obstacle is that a system capable of 1) identifying its users' emotional responses, 2) creating a computational model of them, and 3) using this model to shape the affective experience, does not currently exist. In this sense, many researchers have strived to provide methods that could indirectly be used to mould the affective experience. However, most of them still rely on static, simple state adaptations and thus fall short from the grander scheme here proposed. In light of these issues, in thesis we study how human emotional responses to digital (game) events can be used to regulate the overall affective experience. The proposed methodology enables the correlation of human-computer interaction events to emotional responses, from which a computational user affective model can be extracted. This model can then be used to simulate and predict the result of future interactions, thus determining the most adequate course to achieve the desired affective experience. We analyse both the impact of simple (static) affective adaptation mechanisms in a procedural horror game and use a simulated environment to establish the models’ ability to regulate the user’s affective experience towards a specific emotional state or emotional pattern. In addition, this thesis includes a conceptual framework for designing adaptive affective systems. This framework presents a modular design so that it can cope with the immense particularities of affective computing systems and is formally defined so that its internal processes can be easily replicated. Many new research avenues open from here. The birth of these systems now creates vast new possibilities, ranging from artificial agents capable of emotional thought to emotionally aware therapeutic, guidance or assistance systems. From a scientific perspective, this work presents the possibility and feasibility of harnessing the power of human emotions for optimising human-machine interaction, as well as a first step towards systems capable of a contextualised and potentially evolutionary emotional interaction. In sum, the inclusion of more complex and detailed psychophysiological metrics will enable a comprehensive analysis of human behaviour, emotion, and motivation. Finally, the integration of new measurement and experience adaptation technologies in interactive entertainment applications will not only allow a detailed assessment of user’s overall experience, but also improve the digital content’s overall perceived quality.",2016.0,119.0,1.0,"{'name': '', 'volume': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Nogueira2016EmotionalSR,\n author = {P.

Impact of CEO affective traits on strategic and performance conformity in the spanish banking industry,"Research on how managers influence firm outcomes has generated promising explanations of differences in organizational strategies and performance within a given industry, but has largely ignored the role of emotions in shaping managers' strategic choices. This article analyzes the influence of the affective traits of CEOs—their long-term tendency to experience positive or negative moods or emotions—on strategy and performance conformity in a sample of Spanish banks and savings banks. Our results show that managers' negative affective traits are related to more conformist strategies and more typical performance, whereas positive affective traits seem to promote outcomes that deviate from the central tendencies of the industry. Results also show that strategic conformity mediates the relationship between CEO negative affective traits and typical performance.

The purpose of this study was to specify overlapping symptom domains and to identify symptoms that can reliably differentiate adults with ASD (n = 53), SZ (n = 39), and typical development (TD; n = 40). All participants regardless of diagnosis were administered gold-standard diagnostic assessments of ASD and SZ characteristics including the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Sensitivity and specificity of the ADOS were assessed using diagnostic cut-off scores. The degree of symptom overlap on these measures between participant groups was analyzed using Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves, and Analyses of Covariance (ANCOVAs) to control for group differences in IQ and sex distributions. The ADOS reliably discriminated ASD and TD adults, but there was a high rate of “false positives” in SZ patients who did not meet the DSM-5 criteria for ASD. To identify the reasons for low specificity in the SZ sample, we categorized ASD and SZ symptoms into ‘positive’ (presence of atypical behaviors) and ‘negative’ (absence of typical behaviors) symptoms. ASD and SZ groups overlapped on negative symptoms largely related to the absence of typical social and communicative behaviors, whereas disorder-specific positive symptoms differentiated ASD and SZ. For example, those with ASD scored higher on restricted and repetitive behaviors and stereotyped language, whereas those with SZ scored higher on psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. These results suggest that, when making a differential diagnosis between ASD and SZ, clinicians may benefit from focusing on the presence or absence of positive ASD and SZ symptoms.

1604,875d7fb323f9c0e840dbdb3f7d7d4675d96773dd,Building resilience through exposure to stressors: The effects of challenges versus hindrances.,"This paper explores the potential for certain types of stressors to build resilience in the occupational setting. Using the challenge-hindrance stressor framework (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, & Boudreau, 2000), we propose that challenge stressors have the potential to promote the capacity for resilience, whereas hindrance stressors experienced in the workplace erode resilient functioning. Employing a 2-wave longitudinal design we examined the effects of challenge and hindrance stressors on psychological resilience and strain 3 months later. Two-hundred and 8 working adults (48.1% female) participated in both surveys. Findings indicated that Time 1 challenge stressors had a significant effect on psychological resilience 3 months later (Time 2). In contrast, Time 1 hindrance stressors positively predicted Time 2 strain and negatively predicted psychological resilience. Moreover, resilience mediated the relationship between Time 1 stressors and Time 2 strain. These results demonstrate the potential positive and negative impacts of workplace stressor types on psychological resilience, and provide an exploration of a mechanism through which challenge and hindrance stressors influence well-being.

Similarly, the effect of strategy when applying a regulatory process is still poorly explored. The present study seeks to elucidate these issues comparing the effect of regulation and of strategy to both neutral and emotional words and pictures. Methodology/Principal findings Thirty young adults applied the strategy of distancing to the emotions elicited by unpleasant and neutral pictures and words while their subjective ratings and ERPs were recorded. At a behavioral level, participants successfully regulated the arousal and the valence of both pictures and words. At a neural level, unpleasant pictures produced an increase in the late positive potential modulated during the regulate condition. Unpleasant linguistic stimuli elicited a posterior negativity as compared to neutral stimuli, but no effect of regulation on ERP was detectable. More importantly, the effect of strategy independently of stimulus type, produced a significant larger Stimulus Preceding Negativity. Dipole reconstruction localized this effect in the middle frontal areas of the brain. Conclusions As such, these new psychophysiological findings might help to understand how pictures and words can be regulated by distancing in daily life and clinical contexts, and the neural bases of the effect of strategy for which we suggest an integrative model.",2019.0,75.0,15.0,"{'volume': '14', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Grecucci2019SeeingER,\n author = {A.

Several theoretical perspectives suggest that emotion dysregulation is a predisposing risk factor for many psychiatric disorders. Yet despite a rapidly evolving literature, difficulties with emotion regulation (ER) are often measured inconsistently across studies, with little regard to whether different approaches capture the same construct. In this study, we evaluate the correspondence between two widely used measures of emotion dysregulation that cut across self-report and physiological levels of analysis. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate whether youth self-reports of ER difficulties correspond with physiological measures of emotion dysregulation collected at baseline and during sad emotion induction, and (2) validate the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) in a youth sample.


METHOD
We measured emotion dysregulation among a sample of youth with depression, conduct problems, comorbid depression/conduct problems, or no psychiatric condition. Youth were assessed initially at ages 8-12 (Year 1) and followed up at Years 2 and 3. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a widely used physiological index of emotion regulation, was measured across all three years during sad emotion induction. At Year 3, the DERS was also administered.


RESULTS
Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that slopes in RSA collected across the three assessments were associated with later self-reported ER abilities at the transition into adolescence. These findings were replicated across contexts (baseline and emotional challenge), suggesting that adolescents whose physiological responding to emotional challenge improves also experience fewer difficulties with emotion regulation as they mature.",2009.0,23.0,212.0,"{'volume': '50 11', 'pages': '\n          1357-64\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vasilev2009CorrespondenceBP,\n author = {Christina A.

This digital infrastructure has, in turn, accelerated the emergence of new technologies that enable transformations in how we live and work, how companies organize, and the structure of entire industries. 
 
As a result, it has become important for all business students to have a strong grounding in IT and digital innovation in order to manage, lead, and transform organizations that are increasingly dependent on digital innovation. Yet, at many schools, students do not get such grounding because the required information systems core class is stuck in the past. We present a vision for a redesigned IS core class that adopts digital innovation as a fundamental and powerful concept (FPC). A good FPC serves as both a foundational concept and an organizing principle for a course. 
 
We espouse a particularly broad conceptualization of digital innovation that allows for a variety of teaching styles and topical emphases for the IS core class. This conceptualization includes three types of innovation (i.e., process, product, and business model innovation), and four stages for the overall innovation process (i.e., discovery, development, diffusion, and impact). Based on this conceptualization, we examine the implications of adopting digital innovation as an FPC. We also briefly discuss broader implications relating to (1) the IS curriculum beyond the core class, (2) the research agenda for the IS field, and (3) the identity and legitimacy of IS in business schools.",2014.0,143.0,625.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '329-343', 'name': 'MIS Q.'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fichman2014DigitalIA,\n author = {R.

1625,8902ab2fd2e9c8e45fc72d4fb02dfae3f85bfa0e,Editorial: Emotional Intelligence and Cognitive Abilities,"A quarter-century after Peter Salovey and John Mayer introduced the concept of emotional intelligence (EI; Salovey and Mayer, 1990), it remains an important and growing research area. EI is usually analyzed from the perspective of the ability model or mixed models. The ability model focuses on an individual's mental abilities to apply information provided by emotions for the improvement of cognitive processing. Mixed models conceptualize EI as the combination of mental abilities, stable behavioral traits and personality variables (see Mayer et al., 2008). The present research topic brings together 14 articles that, building on previous studies (Mayer et al., 2008; Fernandez-Berrocal et al., 2014; Webb et al., 2014), analyze the relevance of EI in different domains of daily life, including health-related outcomes, social functioning, and academic and workplace performance. These articles approach the problem from different theoretical perspectives using different measurements. 
 
The research topic opens with a review by Pena-Sarrionandia et al. on studies that apply the emotion regulation conceptual framework to understanding how emotion regulation processes underlie EI.

Researchers continue to debate whether EI contributes significantly to emotional, cognitive, and social processes beyond the well-known contribution of IQ and personality traits. The link between cognitive ability and general intelligence is well-established, and evidence also suggests a link between cognitive ability and EI. Checa and Fernandez-Berrocal show that the Managing Emotions dimension of EI measured by the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) is negatively related to impulsivity during cognitive tasks. Boyatzis et al. report that the association of general intelligence with the behavioral dimension of EI differs from its association with other EI dimensions. Individuals with greater EI ability (based on the MSCEIT) perceive more available social support, after controlling for fluid intelligence and personality traits (Di Fabio). EI abilities have also been implicated in divergent thinking and motivational state (Takeuchi et al.). At the same time, not all studies suggest a significant contribution of EI beyond IQ or personality. Furnham et al. examine associations of personality traits with self- and other-reported EI (based on the Bar-on EQ-I) in business settings, and they find poor incremental benefit of this EI measure beyond personality testing. Together, these studies suggest that EI is a relevant and useful variable for understanding and explaining various human processes, though further research should clarify its importance relative to IQ and personality. 
 
The importance of EI in cognitive and behavioral processes prompts the question: what is the brain system that supports EI? Studies have implicated the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Krueger et al., 2009), as well as the dopaminergic system (Takeuchi et al.). 
 
Recent studies suggest that EI contributes to relationships among emotions, health, and well-being. Some articles in this research topic focus on this contribution in different contexts. Fernandez-Abascal and Martin-Diaz suggest that dimensions of self-report EI are better predictors of Mental Health than of Physical Health in adults. Limonero et al. suggest that the Emotional Facilitation and Emotional Understanding branches of MSCEIT are related to previous mood states and to mood recovery after induction of negative mood. Elipe et al. analyze perceived EI as a moderator between cyber-victimization and its emotional impact on university students, while Amdurer et al. provides longitudinal data suggesting that EI predicts career satisfaction and success. Sanchez-Alvarez et al. confirm in a 2-year longitudinal study that positive and negative affect mediate the relationships between EI and life satisfaction in adolescents. 
 
EI also appears to play important roles during early development (Mayer et al., 2008). This provides a clear example of where knowledge about EI may lead to useful interventions to improve quality of life. During middle childhood, reading and discussing children's books with emotional content can improve emotional competence (Kumschick et al.). Efforts to evaluate EI in different populations, such as deaf people (Mestre et al.), may open up promising avenues for designing interventions to improve integration, reduce alienation and enrich quality of life. Indeed, the research topic closes with an article by Cabello and Fernandez-Berrocal that provides the first evidence that implicit beliefs about emotions and EI may influence emotional abilities (based on MSCEIT). This may have important consequences for personal and professional EI training. 
 
While this research topic answers some important questions from various perspectives, it does not address several other questions and it also raises new ones. For example, longitudinal and interventional studies should examine how different EI measures may interact with socio-demographic, educational and cultural factors, as well as with psychological factors such as IQ and personality, to impact personal, professional, and social outcomes (Cabello et al.; Cabello and Fernandez-Berrocal, 2015; Pena-Sarrionandia et al.). 
 
We hope that this research topic highlights new knowledge and raises further questions about how individual differences in EI explain differences in cognitive processes and emotion regulation, which can have important real-world consequences.",2016.0,8.0,6.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fernández-Berrocal2016EditorialEI,\n author = {P.

The key idea of this hypothesis is that decision making is a process that is influenced by marker signals that arise in bioregulatory processes, including those that express themselves in emotions and feelings. This influence can occur at multiple levels of operation, some of which occur consciously and some of which occur non-consciously. Here we review studies that confirm various predictions from the hypothesis. The orbitofrontal cortex represents one critical structure in a neural system subserving decision making. Decision making is not mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex alone, but arises from large-scale systems that include other cortical and subcortical components. Such structures include the amygdala, the somatosensory/insular cortices and the peripheral nervous system. Here we focus only on the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in decision making and emotional processing, and the relationship between emotion, decision making and other cognitive functions of the frontal lobe, namely working memory.",2000.0,62.0,3296.0,"{'volume': '10 3', 'pages': '\n          295-307\n        ', 'name': 'Cerebral cortex'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bechara2000EmotionDM,\n author = {A.

1633,89bd1de0d4e28fde91d468caf3998788acc9d71d,Beyond Shallow Models of Emotion,"There is a huge diversity of definitions of “emotion” some of which are associated with relatively shallow behavioural or measurable criteria or introspectable experiences, for instance use of facial expression, physiological measures, activity of specific regions of the brain, or the experience of bodily changes or desires, such as wanting to run away, or to hurt someone. There are also deeper theories that link emotional states to a variety of mechanisms within an information processing architecture that are not easily observable or measurable, not least because they are components of virtual machines rather than physical or physiological mechanisms. We can compare this with “shallow” definitions of chemical compounds such as salt, sugar, or water, in terms of their appearance and observed behaviours in various test situations, and their definitions in the context of a theory of the architecture of matter which is mostly concerned with postulated sub-atomic entities and and a web of relationships between them which cannot easily be observed, so that theories about them are not easily confirmed or refuted. This paper outlines an approach to the search for deeper explanatory theories of emotions and many other kinds of mental phenomena, which includes an attempt to define the concepts in terms of the underlying information processing architectures and the classes of states and processes that they can support. A serious problem with this programme is the difficulty of finding good constraints on theories, since in general observable facts are consistent with infinitely many explanatory mechanisms. This “position paper” offers as a partial solution the requirement that proposed architectures be capable of having been produced by biological evolution, in addition to being subject to constraints such as implementability in known biological mechanisms, various resource limits (time, memory, energy, etc.) and being able to account for a wide range of human functionality. Within such an architecture-based theory we can distinguish (at least) primary emotions, secondary emotions, and tertiary emotions, and produce a coherent theory which explains a wide range of phenomena and also partly explains the diversity of theories:",2001.0,48.0,221.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sloman2001BeyondSM,\n author = {A.

A multimethod psychometric approach provides preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the AFQ-Y and AFQ-Y8.

Depression is associated with impaired emotion-regulation skills, but few studies have examined whether such impairments apply to a musical context also. The aim of the present study was thus to compare depressed and non-depressed individuals with regard to their use of music for emotion regulation in everyday life. Seventy-seven listeners (19–65 years old) filled out a brief questionnaire, which measured emotion regulation in terms of the prevalence of various regulation goals, strategies, and mechanisms. The overall results indicated that the most frequent goal was to enhance positive emotions. Discharge was the most frequently used strategy and suppression was the least frequently used. A range of causal mechanisms were reported to occur. Contrary to our hypotheses, there were few differences between depressed and non-depressed listeners. We argue that knowledge gained from studies of emotion regulation may be used in field interventions that aim to teach depressed individuals how to use music to regulate emotions effectively.",2018.0,63.0,29.0,"{'volume': '1', 'name': 'Music & Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sakka2018EmotionRW,\n author = {Laura S.

He argues persuasively that emotions, intuitions, and feelings are not distinct things, but different ways of thinking.By examining these different forms of mind activity, Minsky says, we can explain why our thought sometimes takes the form of carefully reasoned analysis and at other times turns to emotion. He shows how our minds progress from simple, instinctive kinds of thought to more complex forms, such as consciousness or self-awareness. And he argues that because we tend to see our thinking as fragmented, we fail to appreciate what powerful thinkers we really are.

This study examines coping styles used by suicidal patients. Objectives: The researchers in this study try to identify coping strategies used by suicide attempters admitted to Shiraz Shahid Faghihi Hospital emergency room. Materials and Methods: This is a analytical cross-sectional study. Participants consisted of 50 suicide-attempted people admitted to Shiraz Faghihi Hospital. Instruments for data collections were a demographic checklist and the coping styles scale of Carver, Schier and Wintrope. Data were collected conveniently and analyzed using descriptive and analytic (Pearson Correlation, Student’s t-tests, and ANOVA) statistical methods. Results: Suicide attempted people used less useful coping strategies (Mean = 49.32) more than the other strategies (respectively mean of problem focused and emotion focused strategies were 30.27 and 27.83). Using ANOVA, in different educational level, problem focused and less effective coping skills of samples differed significantly (P = 0.009, P = 0.006, respectively). People with low educational level used less effective coping skills. There was a significant difference between men and women scores in use of less effective coping skills (P = 0.029). Conclusions: Teaching effective coping skills by psychological consultants in suicide attempted people, especially for women and people with low educational level, is important",2014.0,19.0,31.0,"{'volume': '3', 'name': 'International Journal of High Risk Behaviors & Addiction'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bazrafshan2014CopingSI,\n author = {Mohammad-Rafi Bazrafshan and Fereidun Jahangir and A.

For example, why does a complex ensemble predict a particular class? Existing approaches to interpretable machine learning tend to be either local in their explanations, apply only to a particular algorithm, or overly complex in their global explanations. In this work, we propose a global model extraction method which uses multi-objective genetic programming to construct accurate, simplistic and model-agnostic representations of complex black-box estimators. We found the resulting representations are far simpler than existing approaches while providing comparable reconstructive performance.

1651,8b98a23a80c2b76da5afd7426ce8e87c663e23b3,The Uneasy Case for Product Liability,"In this Article we compare the benefits of product liability to its costs and conclude that the case for product liability is weak for a wide range of products. One benefit of product liability is that it can induce firms to improve product safety. Even in the absence of product liability, however, firms are often motivated by market forces to enhance product safety because their sales may fall if their products harm consumers. Moreover, products must frequently conform to safety regulations. Consequently, product liability might not be expected to exert a significant additional influence on product safety — and empirical studies of several widely sold products fail to find an effect of product liability on the frequency of product accidents. A second benefit of product liability is that it can improve consumer purchase decisions by causing product prices to increase to reflect product risks. But because of litigation costs and other factors, product liability may raise prices excessively and undesirably chill purchases. A third benefit of product liability is that it compensates victims of product-related accidents for their losses. Yet this benefit is only partial, for accident victims are frequently compensated by insurers for some or all of their losses. Furthermore, the payment of compensation for pain and suffering actually reduces the welfare of individuals because it effectively forces them to purchase insurance for a type of loss for which they ordinarily do not wish to be covered. Offsetting the potential benefits of product liability are its costs, which are great. Notably, the transfer of a dollar to a victim of a product accident via the liability system requires more than a dollar on average in legal expenses. Given the limited benefits and the high costs of product liability, we come to the judgment that its use is often unwarranted. This is especially likely for products for which market forces and regulation are relatively strong, which includes many widely sold products. On the other hand, the use of product liability may be desirable for products for which these factors are weak. Our generally skeptical assessment of product liability for products for which market forces and regulation are strong is in tension with the broad social endorsement of such liability.",2009.0,60.0,136.0,"{'volume': '123', 'pages': '1437-1493', 'name': 'Harvard Law Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Polinsky2009TheUC,\n author = {A.

1654,8bda4cab59d29082038610149be2b200533aa158,Principal Semantic Components of Language and the Measurement of Meaning,"Metric systems for semantics, or semantic cognitive maps, are allocations of words or other representations in a metric space based on their meaning. Existing methods for semantic mapping, such as Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, are based on paradigms involving dissimilarity metrics. They typically do not take into account relations of antonymy and yield a large number of domain-specific semantic dimensions. Here, using a novel self-organization approach, we construct a low-dimensional, context-independent semantic map of natural language that represents simultaneously synonymy and antonymy. Emergent semantics of the map principal components are clearly identifiable: the first three correspond to the meanings of “good/bad” (valence), “calm/excited” (arousal), and “open/closed” (freedom), respectively. The semantic map is sufficiently robust to allow the automated extraction of synonyms and antonyms not originally in the dictionaries used to construct the map and to predict connotation from their coordinates. The map geometric characteristics include a limited number (∼4) of statistically significant dimensions, a bimodal distribution of the first component, increasing kurtosis of subsequent (unimodal) components, and a U-shaped maximum-spread planar projection. Both the semantic content and the main geometric features of the map are consistent between dictionaries (Microsoft Word and Princeton's WordNet), among Western languages (English, French, German, and Spanish), and with previously established psychometric measures. By defining the semantics of its dimensions, the constructed map provides a foundational metric system for the quantitative analysis of word meaning. Language can be viewed as a cumulative product of human experiences. Therefore, the extracted principal semantic dimensions may be useful to characterize the general semantic dimensions of the content of mental states. This is a fundamental step toward a universal metric system for semantics of human experiences, which is necessary for developing a rigorous science of the mind.",2010.0,42.0,49.0,"{'volume': '5', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Samsonovic2010PrincipalSC,\n author = {Alexei V.

By examining findings across studies, we sought to determine if common or segregated patterns of activations exist across various emotional tasks. We reviewed 55 PET and fMRI activation studies (yielding 761 individual peaks) which investigated emotion in healthy subjects. Peak activation coordinates were transformed into a standard space and plotted onto canonical 3-D brain renderings. We divided the brain into 20 nonoverlapping regions, and characterized each region by its responsiveness across individual emotions (positive, negative, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust), to different induction methods (visual, auditory, recall/imagery), and in emotional tasks with and without cognitive demand. Our review yielded the following summary observations: (1) The medial prefrontal cortex had a general role in emotional processing; (2) fear specifically engaged the amygdala; (3) sadness was associated with activity in the subcallosal cingulate; (4) emotional induction by visual stimuli activated the occipital cortex and the amygdala; (5) induction by emotional recall/imagery recruited the anterior cingulate and insula; (6) emotional tasks with cognitive demand also involved the anterior cingulate and insula.

The American presence has had significant consequences for Australia and for the wider region. This is how the Australian government sees it, at least according to the 2009 Defence White Paper: ‘Australia has been a very secure country for many decades, in large measure because the wider Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed an unprecedented era of peace and stability underwritten by US strategic primacy’. The United States, in other words, has acted as a pacifier in this part of the world. However, according to the very next sentence in the White Paper, ‘That order is being transformed as economic changes start to bring about changes in the distribution of strategic power’. The argument here, of course, is that the rise of China is having a significant effect on the global balance of power. In particular, the power gap between China and the United States is shrinking and in all likelihood ‘US strategic primacy’ in this region will be no more. This is not to say that the United States will disappear; in fact, its presence is likely to grow in response to China’s rise. But the United States will no longer be the preponderant power in the Asia-Pacific region, as it has been since 1945.

1665,8cedeba11c2c6095e21a7318b2807bcf8a9a7300,Negative Emotion and Joint-Stiffness Regulation Strategies After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury.,"CONTEXT
Fear of reinjury after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) may be associated with persistent deficits in knee function and subsequent injury. However, the effects of negative emotion on neuromuscular-control strategies after an ACL injury has remained unclear.


OBJECTIVE
To identify how negative emotional stimuli affect neural processing in the brain and muscle coordination in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared with healthy control participants.


DESIGN
Case-control study.


SETTING
Neuromechanics laboratory.


PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS
Twenty patients after unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and 20 healthy recruits.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Electrocortical θ (4-8 Hz) activity (event-related synchronization, % increased power relative to a nonactive baseline) at selected electrodes placed at the frontal (F3, Fz, F4) and parietal (P3, Pz, P4) cortices using electroencephalograph, neurophysiological cardiac changes (beats/min), and subjective fear perceptions were measured, along with joint stiffness (Nm/°/kg) with and without an acoustic stimulus in response to 3 types of emotionally evocative images (neutral, fearful, and knee-injury pictures).


RESULTS
Both groups had greater frontoparietal θ power with fearful pictures (Fz: 35.9% ± 29.4%; Pz: 81.4% ± 66.8%) than neutral pictures (Fz: 24.8% ± 29.7%, P = .002; Pz: 64.2 ± 54.7%, P = .024). The control group had greater heart rate deceleration with fearful (-4.6 ± 1.4 beats/min) than neutral (-3.6 ± 1.3 beats/min, P < .001) pictures, whereas the ACLR group exhibited decreased heart rates with both the fearful (-4.6 ± 1.3 beats/min) and injury-related (-4.4 ± 1.5 beats/min) pictures compared with neutral pictures (-3.4 ± 1.4 beats/min, P < .001). Furthermore, during the acoustic startle condition, fearful pictures increased joint stiffness (Nm/°/kg) in the ACLR group at the midrange (0°-20°: 0.027 ± 0.02) and long range (0°-40°: 0.050 ± 0.02) compared with the neutral pictures (0°-20°: 0.017 ± 0.01, P = .024; 0°-40°: 0.043 ± 0.02, P = .014).


CONCLUSIONS
Negative visual stimuli simultaneously altered neural processing in the frontoparietal cortices and joint-stiffness regulation strategies in response to a sudden perturbation.

Most empirical research on upper echelons treats psychological phenomena as a ‘black box’—the unobserved intervening mechanisms—that causes associations between more observable executive characteristics and organizational outcomes. In contrast, this paper attempts to directly examine the determinants of an important element of an executive's psychological orientation—commitment to the status quo (CSQ). We focus on a select set of variables which have been posited in prior research as determinants of executive CSQ, but which have not been directly tested for such a relationship. Based on a large-scale survey methodology, results suggest that an executive's tenure in an industry is a pronounced determinant of CSQ, and has significantly more impact than organizational tenure. As expected, the firm's current performance was found to be positively related to CSQ; this relationship was stronger in high-discretion than in low-discretion industries. Finally, the project reaffirms a well known human tendency: incumbent CEOs tend to believe that their eventual successors should be just like them.",1993.0,40.0,989.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '401-418', 'name': 'Southern Medical Journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hambrick1993TOPEC,\n author = {D.

1667,8cf3cca034986cd6fb45466f7b3a540ffa684a02,A comprehensive study on bilingual and multilingual speech emotion recognition using a two-pass classification scheme,"Emotion recognition plays an important role in human-computer interaction. Previously and currently, many studies focused on speech emotion recognition using several classifiers and feature extraction methods. The majority of such studies, however, address the problem of speech emotion recognition considering emotions solely from the perspective of a single language. In contrast, the current study extends monolingual speech emotion recognition to also cover the case of emotions expressed in several languages that are simultaneously recognized by a complete system. To address this issue, a method, which provides an effective and powerful solution to bilingual speech emotion recognition, is proposed and evaluated. The proposed method is based on a two-pass classification scheme consisting of spoken language identification and speech emotion recognition. In the first pass, the language spoken is identified; in the second pass, emotion recognition is conducted using the emotion models of the language identified. Based on deep learning and the i-vector paradigm, bilingual emotion recognition experiments have been conducted using the state-of-the-art English IEMOCAP (four emotions) and German FAU Aibo (five emotions) corpora. Two classifiers along with i-vector features were used and compared, namely, fully connected deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). In the case of DNN, 64.0% and 61.14% unweighted average recalls (UARs) were obtained using the IEMOCAP and FAU Aibo corpora, respectively. When using CNN, 62.0% and 59.8% UARs were achieved in the case of the IEMOCAP and FAU Aibo corpora, respectively. These results are very promising, and superior to those obtained in similar studies on multilingual or even monolingual speech emotion recognition. Furthermore, an additional baseline approach for bilingual speech emotion recognition was implemented and evaluated. In the baseline approach, six common emotions were considered, and bilingual emotion models were created, trained on data from the two languages. In this case, 51.2% and 51.5% UARs for six emotions were obtained using DNN and CNN, respectively. The results using the baseline method were reasonable and promising, showing the effectiveness of using i-vectors and deep learning in bilingual speech emotion recognition. On the other hand, the proposed two-pass method based on language identification showed significantly superior performance. Furthermore, the current study was extended to also deal with multilingual speech emotion recognition using corpora collected under similar conditions. Specifically, the English IEMOCAP, the German Emo-DB, and a Japanese corpus were used to recognize four emotions based on the proposed two-pass method. The results obtained were very promising, and the differences in UAR were not statistically significant compared to the monolingual classifiers.",2019.0,69.0,22.0,"{'volume': '14', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Heracleous2019ACS,\n author = {P.

These concerns include the possibility of biases, lack of transparency with certain AI algorithms, privacy concerns with the data used for training AI models, and safety and liability issues with AI application in clinical environments. While there has been extensive discussion about the ethics of AI in health care, there has been little dialogue or recommendations as to how to practically address these concerns in health care.

In Study 1, participants in whom transient positive or negative affective states were induced by reading a short story showed systematic differences in issue interpretation and risk taking in a strategic decision making context. Compared to negative mood participants, those in a positive mood were more likely to interpret the strategic issue as an opportunity and displayed lower levels of risk taking. Study 2 replicated and extended these results by crossing affective states with threat and opportunity frames. Results showed that framing an issue (as a threat or an opportunity) had a stronger impact on issue interpretation among negative affect participants than among positive affect participants. Affective states also moderated the impact of issue framing on risk taking: the effect of framing on risk-taking was stronger under negative rather than positive affect. These results are interpreted via information-processing and motivational effects of affect on a decision maker.

The study investigates the impact of level design on brainwave activity measured with EEG and on player experience measured with questionnaires. The goal of the study was to investigate cognition, emotion, and player behavior from a psychological perspective. For this purpose, a methodology for assessing gameplay experience with subjective and objective measures was developed extending prior work in physiological measurements of affect in digital gameplay. The authors report the result of this pilot study, the impact of three different level design conditions (boredom, immersion, and flow) on EEG, and subjective indicators of gameplay experience. Results from the subjective gameplay experience questionnaire support the validity of our level design hypotheses. Patterns of EEG spectral power show that the immersion-level design elicits more activity in the theta band, which may support a relationship between virtual spatial navigation or exploration and theta activity. The research shows that facets of gameplay experience can be assessed with affective ludology measures, such as EEG, in which cognitive and affective patterns emerge from different level designs.",2011.0,64.0,67.0,"{'volume': '42', 'pages': '632 - 655', 'name': 'Simulation & Gaming'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nacke2011ElectroencephalographicAO,\n author = {L.

Robots are expected to be prevalent in society to assist humans in various tasks. Human–robot interaction (HRI) is of critical importance in the assistive robotics sector. Smart digital assistants and assistive robots fail quite often when a request is not well defined verbally. When the assistant fails to provide services as desired, the person may exhibit an emotional response such as anger or frustration through expressions in their face and voice. It is critical that robots understand not only the language, but also human psychology. A novel affection-based perception architecture for cooperative HRIs is studied in this paper, where the agent is expected to recognize human emotional states, thus encourages a natural bonding between the human and the robotic artifact. We propose a method to close the loop using measured emotions to grade HRIs. This metric will be used as a reward mechanism to adjust the assistant’s behavior adaptively. Emotion levels from users are detected through vision and speech inputs processed by deep neural networks (NNs).

1687,8e5d7405ece81f0ac9fcb4574e53bf0c827e9ad7,Interpersonal emotion regulation.,"Contemporary emotion regulation research emphasizes intrapersonal processes such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, but people experiencing affect commonly choose not to go it alone. Instead, individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a framework. We first map a ""space"" differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person's emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes--response-dependent and response-independent--that could support interpersonal regulation. This framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse, heretofore independent data on ""pieces"" of interpersonal regulation, and identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.",2013.0,105.0,655.0,"{'volume': '13 5', 'pages': '\n          803-10\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zaki2013InterpersonalER,\n author = {Jamil Zaki and W.

Regulating Robo-Advisors Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,"In the past decade, robo-advisors — online platforms providing investment advice driven by algorithms — have emerged as a low-cost alternative to traditional, human investment advisers. This presents a regulatory wrinkle for the Investment Advisers Act, the primary federal statute governing investment advice. Enacted in 1940, the Advisers Act was devised with human behavior in mind. Regulators now must determine how an automated alternative fits into the Act’s framework. 
A popular narrative, driven by investment advice professionals and the popular press, argues that robo-advisors are inherently structurally incapable of exercising enough care to meet Advisers Act standards. This Note draws upon common law principles and interpretations of the Advisers Act to argue against this narrative. It then finds that regulators should instead focus on robo-advisor duty of loyalty issues because algorithms can be programmed to reflect a firm’s existing conflicts of interest. The Note concludes by arguing for a shift in regulatory focus and proposing a two-part heightened disclosure rule that would make robo-advisor conflicts of interest more transparent.",2017.0,0.0,43.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': 'Social Science Research Network'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ji2017AreRG,\n author = {Megan Ji},\n journal = {Social Science Research Network},\n title = {Are Robots Good Fiduciaries?

Understanding how agents can achieve cooperation in social dilemmas through learning from local experience is a critical problem that has motivated researchers for decades. This paper investigates the possibility of exploiting emotions in agent learning in order to facilitate the emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas. In particular, the spatial version of social dilemmas is considered to study the impact of local interactions on the emergence of cooperation in the whole system. A double-layered emotional multiagent reinforcement learning framework is proposed to endow agents with internal cognitive and emotional capabilities that can drive these agents to learn cooperative behaviors. Experimental results reveal that various network topologies and agent heterogeneities have significant impacts on agent learning behaviors in the proposed framework, and under certain circumstances, high levels of cooperation can be achieved among the agents.",2015.0,43.0,54.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '3083-3096', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yu2015EmotionalMR,\n author = {Chao Yu and Minjie Zhang and F.

At present, affective acoustic models are constructed through deep learning and abstracted into a mathematical model, making computers learn from data and equipping them with prediction abilities. Although this method can result in accurate predictions, it has a limitation in that it lacks explanatory capability; there is an urgent need for an empirical study of the connection between acoustic features and psychology as the theoretical basis for the adjustment of model parameters. Accordingly, this study focuses on exploring the differences between seven major “acoustic features” and their physical characteristics during voice interaction with the recognition and expression of “gender” and “emotional states of the pleasure-arousal-dominance (PAD) model.” In this study, 31 females and 31 males aged between 21 and 60 were invited using the stratified random sampling method for the audio recording of different emotions. Subsequently, parameter values of acoustic features were extracted using Praat voice software. Finally, parameter values were analyzed using a Two-way ANOVA, mixed-design analysis in SPSS software. Results show that gender and emotional states of the PAD model vary among seven major acoustic features. Moreover, their difference values and rankings also vary. The research conclusions lay a theoretical foundation for AI emotional voice interaction and solve deep learning's current dilemma in emotional recognition and parameter optimization of the emotional synthesis model due to the lack of explanatory power.",2021.0,127.0,8.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology', 'volume': '12'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2021AffectiveVI,\n author = {Kuo-Liang Huang and Shengfeng Duan and Xi Lyu},\n booktitle = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n journal = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n title = {Affective Voice Interaction and Artificial Intelligence: A Research Study on the Acoustic Features of Gender and the Emotional States of the PAD Model},\n volume = {12},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '49454264', 'name': 'Kuo-Liang Huang'}, {'authorId': '2125026568', 'name': 'Shengfeng Duan'}, {'authorId': '2142657063', 'name': 'Xi Lyu'}]"

The continuous model defines each facial expression of emotion as a feature vector in a face space. This model explains, for example, how expressions of emotion can be seen at different intensities. In contrast, the categorical model consists of C classifiers, each tuned to a specific emotion category. This model explains, among other findings, why the images in a morphing sequence between a happy and a surprise face are perceived as either happy or surprise but not something in between. While the continuous model has a more difficult time justifying this latter finding, the categorical model is not as good when it comes to explaining how expressions are recognized at different intensities or modes. Most importantly, both models have problems explaining how one can recognize combinations of emotion categories such as happily surprised versus angrily surprised versus surprise. To resolve these issues, in the past several years, we have worked on a revised model that justifies the results reported in the cognitive science and neuroscience literature. This model consists of C distinct continuous spaces. Multiple (compound) emotion categories can be recognized by linearly combining these C face spaces. The dimensions of these spaces are shown to be mostly configural. According to this model, the major task for the classification of facial expressions of emotion is precise, detailed detection of facial landmarks rather than recognition. We provide an overview of the literature justifying the model, show how the resulting model can be employed to build algorithms for the recognition of facial expression of emotion, and propose research directions in machine learning and computer vision researchers to keep pushing the state of the art in these areas. We also discuss how the model can aid in studies of human perception, social interactions and disorders.",2012.0,60.0,166.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '\n          1589-1608\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of machine learning research : JMLR'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Martinez2012AMO,\n author = {Aleix M.

Because of the immense pressure imposed on adolescents due to the complications and ambiguities of this transition, their level of excitement increases and sometimes it appears in the form of sensitivity and intense excitement. Objectives: This study aimed at determining the effectiveness of assertiveness training on the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression of high school students. Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on high school students of Isfahan in academic year 2012 - 13. A total of 126 second grade high school students were collected according to simple random sampling method and divided into two groups: experimental with 63 participants and control with the same number. Data gathering instruments included a demographic questionnaire, Gambill-Richey assertiveness scale, and depression anxiety stress scales (DASS-21). Assertiveness training was carried out on the experimental group in 8 sessions; after 8 weeks, posttest was carried out on both groups. Statistical tests such as independent t test, repeated measures ANOVA, Chi-square test, and the Mann-Whitney test were used to interpret and analyze the data. Results: The Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests did not show significant statistical differences between the two groups in terms of demographic variables (P ≥ 0.05). Repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant difference between the mean scores for assertiveness before (100.23 ± 7.37), immediately after (101.57 ± 16.06), and 2 months after (100.77 ± 12.50) the intervention in the control group. However, the same test found a significant difference between the mean score for assertiveness in the experimental group before (101.6 ± 9.1), immediately after (96.47 ± 10.84), and 2 months after (95.41 ± 8.37) implementing the training program (P = 0.002). The independent t test showed no significant difference in the mean score for anxiety and stress between two groups before the assertiveness training program; however, 2 months after the intervention, the mean score for anxiety in the experimental group was found significantly lower than the control group. As for the mean score for depression, the independent t test showed no significant difference between two groups before training; however, despite the decrease in the mean scores for depression in the experimental group following the intervention, the difference was not significant (P = 0.09). Conclusions: The results of the current study show that conducting assertive training in high school students decreases their anxiety, stress, and depression. Given that high school years are among the most sensitive stages of one’s life plus the fact that conducting such training programs besides their safe and low cost nature are effective and practical, it is highly recommended that such programs be carried out among high school adolescents.",2016.0,35.0,56.0,"{'volume': '18', 'name': 'Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Eslami2016TheEO,\n author = {A.

Although mindfulness-enhancing interventions reduce pathological mental and physical health symptoms across a wide variety of conditions and diseases, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Converging evidence from the mindfulness and neuroscience literature suggests that labeling affect may be one mechanism for these effects. Methods: Participants (n = 27) indicated trait levels of mindfulness and then completed an affect labeling task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The labeling task consisted of matching facial expressions to appropriate affect words (affect labeling) or to gender-appropriate names (gender labeling control task). Results: After controlling for multiple individual difference measures, dispositional mindfulness was associated with greater widespread prefrontal cortical activation, and reduced bilateral amygdala activity during affect labeling, compared with the gender labeling control task. Further, strong negative associations were found between areas of prefrontal cortex and right amygdala responses in participants high in mindfulness but not in participants low in mindfulness. Conclusions: The present findings with a dispositional measure of mindfulness suggest one potential neurocognitive mechanism for understanding how mindfulness meditation interventions reduce negative affect and improve health outcomes, showing that mindfulness is associated with enhanced prefrontal cortical regulation of affect through labeling of negative affective stimuli. fMRI = functional magnetic resonance imaging; PFC = prefrontal cortex; VLPFC = ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; VMPFC = ventromedial prefrontal cortex; MPFC = medial prefrontal cortex; DLPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.",2007.0,27.0,778.0,"{'volume': '69', 'pages': '560-565', 'name': 'Psychosomatic Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Creswell2007NeuralCO,\n author = {J.

The sample included 328 Iranian students who were recruited using a cluster sampling method. The results reveal that acculturative strategies (biculturalism, bicultural integration, or bicultural marginalisation) are associated with enhanced creativity. Specifically, strategies that involve disengaging from cultural practices, also referred to as marginalisation, are associated with creative achievements and finding creative solutions to problems. Moreover, heritage cultural identification mediated the relationship between culture shock and creative solution. That is, students who experienced culture shock in the mainstream culture relied on their cultural heritage knowledge and showed decline in their ability to solve a problem creatively. The findings illuminate how creative accomplishment and enhanced creativity potential may be linked to acculturation strategies.",2017.0,77.0,16.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '2219 - 2239', 'name': 'Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Falavarjani2017TheIO,\n author = {Mehrdad F.

The performances were evaluated not only in terms of overall classification and prediction accuracy but also in terms of relative error cost ratios. The results showed that ANN and SVM were very applicable models in bankruptcy prediction with data from Korean hotels. When jointly measuring both type I and type II errors, especially allowing for the greater costs associated with type I errors, however, ANN was more accurate with smaller estimated relative error costs than SVM. Thus, if the objective is to find the best early warning technique that performs accurately with small relative error costs, then, it will be worth considering ANN method for hotel bankruptcy prediction.",2011.0,167.0,96.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '441 - 468', 'name': 'The Service Industries Journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kim2011PredictionOH,\n author = {Soo-Yeol Kim},\n journal = {The Service Industries Journal},\n pages = {441 - 468},\n title = {Prediction of hotel bankruptcy using support vector machine, artificial neural network, logistic regression, and multivariate discriminant analysis},\n volume = {31},\n year = {2011}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '49899375', 'name': 'Soo-Yeol Kim'}]"

We argue that this inconsistency may be due to the modeling of information and system quality and the importance of the system usage context. We extend Wixom and Todd’s (2005) integrated model of IS satisfaction by proposing and modeling information and system quality as second-order constructs and by testing the model in the system administration context. Our findings provide support for modeling information and system quality as second-order constructs in the integrated model. Furthermore, our findings support using additional constructs, unique to the context studied, in the integrated model. We contribute to current literature by 1) enhancing the construct validity of information and system quality, which ultimately improves statistical conclusion validity and internal validity for studies that focus on information and system quality; and 2) testing the extended model in the system administration context. Our findings suggest that future research should measure information quality and system quality as second-order constructs and that including context-specific information and system characteristics provides researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of IS characteristics important in system administration.",2016.0,0.0,30.0,"{'volume': '38', 'pages': '39', 'name': 'Commun.

There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views, applying in varying degrees across species. An adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism can integrate these views. Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups. This view can advance our evolutionary understanding of empathy beyond inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism and can explain different levels of empathy across individuals, species, stages of development, and situations.",2001.0,680.0,3337.0,"{'volume': '25 1', 'pages': '\n          1-20; discussion 20-71\n        ', 'name': 'The Behavioral and brain sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Preston2001EmpathyIU,\n author = {S.

In this piece I investigate why consent can make such a difference and whether consent is always valid. I focus especially on whether the validity of consent depends on the content of what is consented to, rather than on the circumstances in which consent is given. The idea explored is that the limits on the validity of consent are provided by self-regarding duties that people have. These duties can be provided by the interest in welfare that people have, but also in the fact that their lives and their bodies are sacred. The implications for the permission on others to harm people with consent depends on whether such self-regarding duties are violated when a person gives consent to be harmed.",2011.0,0.0,8.0,"{'volume': '64', 'pages': '23-49', 'name': 'Current Legal Problems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Tadros2011ConsentTH,\n author = {Victor Tadros},\n journal = {Current Legal Problems},\n pages = {23-49},\n title = {Consent to Harm},\n volume = {64},\n year = {2011}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '47601310', 'name': 'Victor Tadros'}]"

In experiment one, 30 subjects' pupillary responses were measured while listening to 10 negatively and 10 positively arousing sounds, and 10 emotionally neutral sounds. In addition, the subjects rated their subjective experiences to these stimuli. The results showed that the pupil size was significantly larger after highly arousing positive and negative stimuli than after neutral stimuli with medium arousal.
In experiment two, the contents of the stimuli were more controlled than in experiment one. 22 subjects' pupillary responses were measured while listening to four negatively and four positively arousing sounds, and four emotionally neutral sounds. The results showed that the pupil size was significantly larger during negative highly arousing stimuli than during moderately arousing positive stimuli. The pupil size was also significantly larger after highly arousing negative stimuli than after moderately arousing neutral and positive stimuli.
The results of the two experiments suggest that pupil size discriminates during and after different kinds of emotional stimuli.

These symptoms have been exacerbated among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajivar is an app that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training. Objective The main objective of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness techniques using an AI conversation platform, Ajivar, to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic. Methods A total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49%) were given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group members (50/99, 51%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results Study participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years; 27% (27/99) of the group were male and 60% (59/99) identified as Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to 6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P<.001). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was 10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22%) where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score 11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score 13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001). Conclusions It is possible to deliver EI and mindfulness training in a scalable way using the Ajivar app during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in improvements in anxiety, depression, and EI in the college student population.",2020.0,40.0,11.0,"{'name': 'JMIR Formative Research', 'volume': '5'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sturgill2020ANA,\n author = {Ronda Sturgill and M.

This rhetoric also reflects real shifts in strategy, as industry research groups compete for a limited pool of talented researchers, and nation states such as China announce ambitious goals for global leadership in AI. This paper assesses the potential risks of the AI race narrative and of an actual competitive race to develop AI, such as incentivising corner-cutting on safe-ty and governance, or increasing the risk of conflict. It explores the role of the research community in respond-ing to these risks. And it briefly explores alternative ways in which the rush to develop powerful AI could be framed so as instead to foster collaboration and respon-sible progress.",2017.0,34.0,82.0,"{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2018 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cave2017AnAR,\n author = {S.

They are generally expected to sell a firm's products and services to generate immediate profits, while simultaneously building customer satisfaction and promoting lifetime customers and the long-term economic viability of the firm. The concept of customer-oriented selling illustrates the conflict, as salespeople are required to forgo immediate benefits in lieu of long-term rewards. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships existing between customer-oriented selling, emotional intelligence, and organizational commitment. The results indicate that a salesperson's customer orientation level is significantly related to emotional intelligence. Implications of the findings indicate that managers should consider using emotional intelligence as a selection and human-resource development tool, as improvements in emotional intelligence are correlated with greater levels of customer orientation. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2004.0,33.0,154.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '405-424', 'name': 'Psychology & Marketing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rozell2004CustomerorientedSE,\n author = {E.

The Italian ERQ also showed the predicted associations with measures of coping, affect, personality, and social functioning. Specifically, Reappraisal was positively correlated with positive reinterpretation, positive affect, and extraversion, and negatively correlated with negative affect and neuroticism. Suppression, by contrast, was negatively correlated with the venting of emotions, positive affect, extraversion, social support and social diversion.

The notion of weak semantic maps was introduced recently as distribution of representations in abstract spaces that are not derived from human judgments, psychometrics, or any other a priori information about their semantics. Instead, they are defined entirely by binary semantic relations among representations, such as synonymy and antonymy. An interesting question concerns the ability of the antonymy-based semantic maps to capture all “universal” semantic dimensions. The present work shows that those narrow weak semantic maps are not complete in this sense and can be augmented with other semantic relations. Specifically, including hyponym-hypernym relations yields a new semantic dimension of the map labeled here “abstractness” (or ontological generality) that is not reducible to any dimensions represented by antonym pairs or to traditional affective space dimensions. It is expected that including other semantic relations (e.g., meronymy/holonymy) will also result in the addition of new semantic dimensions to the map. These findings have broad implications for automated quantitative evaluation of the meaning of text and may shed light on the nature of human subjective experience.",2013.0,42.0,21.0,"{'volume': '2013', 'name': 'Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Samsonovich2013AugmentingWS,\n author = {A.

 Designing adaptive games for individual emotional experiences is a tricky task, especially when detecting a player’s emotional state in real time requires physiological sensing hardware and signal processing software. There is currently a lack of software that can identify and learn how emotional states in games are triggered. To address this problem, we developed a system capable of understanding the fundamental relations between emotional responses and their eliciting events. We propose time-evolving Affective Reaction Models (ARM), which learn new affective reactions and manage conflicting ones. These models are then meant to provide information on how a set of predetermined game parameters (e.g., enemy and item spawning, music and lighting effects) should be adapted, to modulate the player’s emotional state. In this paper, we propose and describe a framework for modulating player emotions and the main components involved in regulating players’ affective experience. We expect our technique will allow game designers to focus on defining high-level rules for generating gameplay experiences instead of having to create and test different content for each player type.

To examine the association between trait emotional intelligence and learning strategies and their influence on academic performance among first-year accelerated nursing students.


DESIGN
The study used a prospective survey design.


METHODS
A sample size of 81 students (100% response rate) who undertook the accelerated nursing course at a large university in Sydney participated in the study. Emotional intelligence was measured using the adapted version of the 144-item Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. Four subscales of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire were used to measure extrinsic goal motivation, peer learning, help seeking and critical thinking among the students. The grade point average score obtained at the end of six months was used to measure academic achievement.


RESULTS
The results demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between emotional intelligence scores and critical thinking (r = 0.41; p < 0.001), help seeking (r = 0.33; p < 0.003) and peer learning (r = 0.32; p < 0.004) but not with extrinsic goal orientation (r = -0.05; p < 0.677). Emotional intelligence emerged as a significant predictor of academic achievement (β = 0.25; p = 0.023).


CONCLUSION
In addition to their learning styles, higher levels of awareness and understanding of their own emotions have a positive impact on students' academic achievement. Higher emotional intelligence may lead students to pursue their interests more vigorously and think more expansively about subjects of interest, which could be an explanatory factor for higher academic performance in this group of nursing students.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
The concepts of emotional intelligence are central to clinical practice as nurses need to know how to deal with their own emotions as well as provide emotional support to patients and their families. It is therefore essential that these skills are developed among student nurses to enhance the quality of their clinical practice.",2012.0,39.0,171.0,"{'volume': '21 23-24', 'pages': '\n          3485-92\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of clinical nursing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fernandez2012EmotionalIA,\n author = {R.

The incidence and mortality keep high in some remote and poor medical condition regions in China. In order to improve the current situation and promote the pathologists’ diagnostic accuracy of CC in such regions, we tried to propose an intelligent and efficient classification model for CC based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with relatively simple architecture compared with others. The model was trained and tested by two groups of image datasets, respectively, which were original image group with a volume of 3012 datasets and augmented image group with a volume of 108432 datasets. Each group has a number of fixed-size RGB images (227*227) of keratinizing squamous, non-keratinizing squamous, and basaloid squamous. The method of three-folder cross-validation was applied to the model. And the classification accuracy of the models, overall, 93.33% for original image group and 89.48% for augmented image group. The improvement of 3.85% has been achieved by using augmented images as input data for the model. The results got from paired-samples ttest indicated that two models’ classification accuracy has a significant difference (P<0.05).

Secondly, we adopt feedback strategy for weight definition, according to recognition rate of each emotion of each physiological signal based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier independently. Finally, we introduce weight in decision level by linear fusing weight matrix with classification result of each SVM classifier. The experiments on the MAHNOB-HCI database show the highest accuracy.

Seventy-one adult psychiatric inpatients completed a suicide risk scale, a measure of interpersonal problems, and a coping scale designed to measure eight coping styles. Patients admitted with a history of suicidal attempts were compared with patients admitted for other reasons. Interpersonal problems were found to be significantly and positively related to suicide risk. The coping style of ""suppression"" (tendency to avoid threatening or uncomfortable situations) was found to be significantly and positively related to suicide risk [F(2, 68) = 4.54, p < .01].

This study applied data mining techniques to the two most frequently viewed videos related to the employment of robots in hotels. Thematic content analysis was conducted based on the Godspeed dimensions. The findings suggest that potential users’ perceptions tend to be negative when it comes to any discussion of humanlike robots. However, people are more receptive towards robots with animated features. Finally, this study contributes to both theoretical and practical discussions on robots and their related modes of analyses.

Emitters of the controlled pollutants in nonattainment counties were subject to greater regulatory oversight than emitters in attainment counties. The preferred statistical model for plant‐level growth includes plant fixed effects, industry by period fixed effects, and county by period fixed effects. The estimates from this model suggest that in the first 15 years in which the Clean Air Act was in force (1972–87), nonattainment counties (relative to attainment ones) lost approximately 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (1987 dollars) of output in pollution‐intensive industries.

As a first step in designing the concept, the notion of semantics is operationalized in terms of human subjective experience and is related to the concept of spatial position. Then synonymy and antonymy are introduced in geometrical terms. Further analysis building on previous studies of the authors indicates that the universal semantic cognitive map should be locally low-dimensional. This essay ends with a proposal to develop a metric system for subjective experiences based on the outlined approach. We conclude that a computationally defined universal semantic cognitive map is a necessary tool for the emerging new science of the mind: a scientific paradigm that includes subjective experience as an object of study. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Unfavourable socio-economic conditions have been joining the behavior problems and school absenteeism. When the family fails in its competence for education, social security or the Court withdraws the child or adolescent to a host institution. The aim of this research was to characterize self-esteem, assertiveness and resilience of institutionalized adolescents in the northern region of Portugal and to establish associations with these dependent variables and gender, scholar level and duration of the institutionalization. For the purpose of this study a wider questionnaire was carried out, and validated with a smaller group. It was a transversal study following a predominantly quantitative methodology, with a convenience sample. The sample included 101 adolescents (55 female and 46 males) from eight institutions, aged between 11 to 21 years old (average 15.45). For self-esteem the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), already validate for Portuguese adolescents, was used. For assertiveness and resilience it was applied the Global Evaluation Scale of Assertiveness and the Global Evaluation Scale of Resilience (Jardim & Pereira, 2006) we previously adapted and validated for adolescents. Collected data was introduced in a SPSS database. A descriptive analysis was done to characterize the sample concerning all the variables. To establish associations between individual factors and dependent variables t test, correlations and non-parametric test were applied. Results indicated a relatively low self-esteem (28.03), with girls having a lower value than boys, without significant differences. No correlations were found between self-esteem and the time in the institution. Assertiveness of the sample is average (23.97) and higher for girls than boys, with a positive significant correlation with the scholar grade.

Unlike previous works that use syntactic parsing results for sentiment analysis, we develop a statistical parser to directly analyze the sentiment structure of a sentence. We show that complicated phenomena in sentiment analysis (e.g., negation, intensification, and contrast) can be handled the same way as simple and straightforward sentiment expressions in a unified and probabilistic way. We formulate the sentiment grammar upon Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), and provide a formal description of the sentiment parsing framework. We develop the parsing model to obtain possible sentiment parse trees for a sentence, from which the polarity model is proposed to derive the sentiment strength and polarity, and the ranking model is dedicated to selecting the best sentiment tree. We train the parser directly from examples of sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity labels but without any syntactic annotations or polarity annotations of constituents within sentences. Therefore we can obtain training data easily. In particular, we train a sentiment parser, s.parser, from a large amount of review sentences with users' ratings as rough sentiment polarity labels.

In this investigation, we explored the role of reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy that involves construing an emotion-eliciting situation in a way that diminishes the intensity of the emotional experience. We hypothesized that although emotional reactions evoke initial moral intuitions, reappraisal weakens the influence of these intuitions, leading to more deliberative moral judgments. Three studies of moral judgments in emotionally evocative, disgust-eliciting moral dilemmas supported our hypothesis. A greater tendency to reappraise was related to fewer intuition-based judgments (Study 1). Content analysis of open-ended descriptions of moral-reasoning processes revealed that reappraisal was associated with longer time spent in deliberation and with fewer intuitionist moral judgments (Study 2). Finally, in comparison with participants who simply watched an emotion-inducing film, participants who had been instructed to reappraise their reactions while watching the film subsequently reported less intense emotional reactions to moral dilemmas, and these dampened reactions led, in turn, to fewer intuitionist moral judgments (Study 3).",2012.0,41.0,72.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '788 - 795', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Feinberg2012LiberatingRF,\n author = {M.

In computed tomography (CT), AI holds the promise of enabling further reductions in patient radiation dose through automation and optimisation of data acquisition processes, including patient positioning and acquisition parameter settings. Subsequent to data collection, optimisation of image reconstruction parameters, advanced reconstruction algorithms, and image denoising methods improve several aspects of image quality, especially in reducing image noise and enabling the use of lower radiation doses for data acquisition. Finally, AI-based methods to automatically segment organs or detect and characterise pathology have been translated out of the research environment and into clinical practice to bring automation, increased sensitivity, and new clinical applications to patient care, ultimately increasing the benefit to the patient from medically justified CT examinations. In summary, since the introduction of CT, a large number of technical advances have enabled increased clinical benefit and decreased patient risk, not only by reducing radiation dose, but also by reducing the likelihood of errors in the performance and interpretation of medically justified CT examinations.",2020.0,16.0,32.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '113 - 125', 'name': 'Annals of the ICRP'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McCollough2020UseOA,\n author = {C.

1787,97e845025565cab6e2a29fbd0f394cfde9a6362e,Jobs Versus the Environment: An Industry-Level Perspective,"The possibility that workers could be adversely affected by environmental policies imposed on heavily regulated industries has led to claims of a ""jobs versus the environment"" trade-off by both business and labor leaders. The present research examines this claim at the industry level for four heavily polluting industries: pulp and paper mills, plastic manufacturers, petroleum refiners, and iron and steel mills. By focusing on labor effects across an entire industry, we construct a measure relevant to the concerns of key stakeholders, such as labor unions and trade groups. We decompose the link between environmental regulation and employment into three distinct components: factor shifts to more or less labor intensity, changes in total expenditures, and changes in the quantity of output demanded. We use detailed plant-level data to estimate the key parameters describing factor shifts and changes in total expenditures. We then use aggregate time-series data on industry supply shocks and output responses to estimate the demand effect. We find that increased environmental spending generally does not cause a significant change in industry-level employment. Our average across all four industries is a net gain of 1.5 jobs per $1 million in additional environmental spending, with a standard error of 2.2 jobs—an insignificant effect. In the plastics and petroleum sectors, however, there are small but significantly positive effects: 6.9 and 2.2 jobs, respectively, per $1 million in additional expenditures. These effects can be linked to favorable factor shifts—environmental spending is more labor intensive than ordinary production—and relatively inelastic estimated demand.",2002.0,52.0,255.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '412-436', 'name': 'Journal of Environmental Economics and Management'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Morgenstern2002JobsVT,\n author = {R.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory.",2008.0,170.0,1043.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '\n          279-300\n        ', 'name': 'Annual review of psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Waal2008PuttingTA,\n author = {F.

In this groundbreaking collaboration, regulatory lawyer Christopher Marsden and computer scientist Ian Brown analyze the regulatory shaping of ""code"" -- the technological environment of the Internet -- to achieve more economically efficient and socially just regulation. They examine five ""hard cases"" that illustrate the regulatory crisis: privacy and data protection; copyright and creativity incentives; censorship; social networks and user-generated content; and net neutrality. The authors describe the increasing ""multistakeholderization"" of Internet governance, in which user groups argue for representation in the closed business-government dialogue, seeking to bring in both rights-based and technologically expert perspectives. Brown and Marsden draw out lessons for better future regulation from the regulatory and interoperability failures illustrated by the five cases. They conclude that governments, users, and better functioning markets need a smarter ""prosumer law"" approach. Prosumer law would be designed to enhance the competitive production of public goods, including innovation, public safety, and fundamental democratic rights.",2013.0,2.0,121.0,"{'pages': 'I-XIX, 1-267'}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Brown2013RegulatingC,\n author = {I.

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit.

Thus, this study sought to examine the relationships among emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, and subjective well-being in high school athletic directors. Participants included 394 U.S. high school athletic directors who completed questionnaires relating to emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, and subjective well-being. The results revealed positive associations between emotional intelligence and subjective well-being and also demonstrated that both job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion mediated the emotional intelligence-subjective well-being relationship.

Despite this, interventions aimed at reducing stress have low adherence rates. The proliferation of mobile phone devices along with gaming-style applications allows for a unique opportunity to broaden the reach and appeal of stress-reduction interventions in modern society. We assessed the effectiveness of two smartphone applications games combined with biofeedback in reducing stress. Methods: We compared a control game to gaming-style smartphone applications combined with a skin conductance biofeedback device (the Pip). Fifty participants aged between 18 and 35 completed the Trier Social Stress Test. They were then randomly assigned to the intervention (biofeedback game) or control group (a non-biofeedback game) for thirty minutes. Perceived stress, heart rate and mood were measured before and after participants had played the games. Results: A mixed factorial ANOVA showed a significant interaction between time and game type in predicting perceived stress [F(1,48) = 14.19, p < 0.001]. Participants in the biofeedback intervention had significantly reduced stress compared to the control group. There was also a significant interaction between time and game in predicting heart rate [F(1,48) = 6.41, p < 0.05]. Participants in the biofeedback intervention showed significant reductions in heart rate compared to the control group.

In addition, the focus was on sex differences in the predictive value of coping strategies in relation to psychosomatic symptoms. Males preferred problem-focused coping strategies, planned and rational actions, positive thinking, personal growth and humour, day-dreaming and fantasies. Women preferred emotion-focused coping solutions, self-blame, expression of emotions/seeking of social support, and wishful thinking/emotionality. In spite of the gender differences the results of multiple regression analyses indicated congruous relationships between coping and complaints for both sexes. Stressors and coping factors contributed in much the same way to the explained variance of symptoms and the results were generally similar for males and females. The present data also emphasize the bidirectionality of the coping–symptoms link. This holds especially for self-blame, day-dreaming and fantasizing, and wishful thinking/emotionality. In contrast, distancing was found to be associated with self-reported psychosocial load. Future prospective studies should explicitly pay attention to this bidirectional relationship.",1990.0,60.0,191.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '125 - 135', 'name': 'Psychological Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vingerhoets1990GenderCA,\n author = {Ad.J.J.M.

1801,99589a106fc09ede9b08cacc20af2a3881f7fc45,Should Robots Pay Taxes? Tax Policy in the Age of Automation,"Existing technologies can already automate most work functions, and the cost of these technologies is decreasing at a time when human labor costs are increasing. This, combined with ongoing advances in computing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, has led experts to predict that automation will lead to significant job losses and worsening income inequality. Policy makers are actively debating how to deal with these problems, with most proposals focusing on investing in education to train workers in new job types, or investing in social benefits to distribute the gains of automation. 
The importance of tax policy has been neglected in this debate, which is unfortunate because such policies are critically important. The tax system incentivizes automation even in cases where it is not otherwise efficient. That is because the vast majority of tax revenue is now derived from labor income, so firms avoid taxes by eliminating employees. More importantly, when a machine replaces a person, the government loses a substantial amount of tax revenue—potentially trillions of dollars a year in the aggregate. All of this is the unintended result of a system designed to tax labor rather than capital. Such a system no longer works once the labor is capital. Robots are not good taxpayers. 
We argue that existing tax policies must be changed. The system should be at least “neutral” as between robot and human workers, and automation should not be allowed to reduce tax revenue. This could be achieved by disallowing corporate tax deductions for automated workers, creating an “automation tax” which mirrors existing unemployment schemes, granting offsetting tax preferences for human workers, levying a corporate self-employment tax, or increasing the corporate tax rate. We argue the ideal solution may be a combination of these proposals.",2017.0,4.0,83.0,{'name': 'ERN: Wages; Intergenerational Income Distribution (Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Abbott2017ShouldRP,\n author = {Ryan B.

Alongside, it reviews a number of long-standing English administrative law rules designed to regulate the discretionary power of the state. The principles of administrative law are concerned with human decisions involved in the exercise of state power and discretion, thus offering a promising avenue for the regulation of the growing number of algorithm-assisted decisions within the public sector. This article attempts to re-frame key rules for the new algorithmic environment and argues that ‘old’ law—interpreted for a new context—can help guide lawyers, scientists and public sector practitioners alike when considering the development and deployment of new algorithmic tools.

Little is known, however, about whether emotion regulation also has cognitive consequences. A process model of emotion suggests that expressive suppression should reduce memory for emotional events but that reappraisal should not. Three studies tested this hypothesis. Study 1 experimentally manipulated expressive suppression during film viewing, showing that suppression led to poorer memory for the details of the film. Study 2 manipulated expressive suppression and reappraisal during slide viewing. Only suppression led to poorer slide memory. Study 3 examined individual differences in typical expressive suppression and reappraisal and found that suppression was associated with poorer self-reported and objective memory but that reappraisal was not.

These methods have strong mathematical foundations and are based on the intuition that the topology in low dimensions should be close to that of high dimensions. Given that the initial topological structure is a precursor to the success of the algorithm, this naturally raises the question: What makes a ""good"" topological structure for dimensionality reduction? %Insight into this will enable us to design better algorithms which take into account both local and global structure. In this paper which focuses on UMAP, we study the effects of node connectivity (k-Nearest Neighbors vs \textit{mutual} k-Nearest Neighbors) and relative neighborhood (Adjacent via Path Neighbors) on dimensionality reduction. We explore these concepts through extensive ablation studies on 4 standard image and text datasets; MNIST, FMNIST, 20NG, AG, reducing to 2 and 64 dimensions. Our findings indicate that a more refined notion of connectivity (\textit{mutual} k-Nearest Neighbors with minimum spanning tree) together with a flexible method of constructing the local neighborhood (Path Neighbors), can achieve a much better representation than default UMAP, as measured by downstream clustering performance.",2021.0,29.0,3.0,"{'volume': 'abs/2108.05525', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dalmia2021ClusteringWU,\n author = {Ayushi Dalmia and Suzanna Sia},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Clustering with UMAP: Why and How Connectivity Matters},\n volume = {abs/2108.05525},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2428997', 'name': 'Ayushi Dalmia'}, {'authorId': '1666941674', 'name': 'Suzanna Sia'}]"

For this reason, dispositional mindfulness (DM) measures for children and adolescents have been developed to determine the effectiveness of MBI at this age stage. However, little is known about how key elements of DM (for example, cognitive de/fusion or experiential avoidance that both confirm psychological inflexibility) are involved in the mechanisms of the children and adolescents’ mental health outcomes. This research examined the mediating effect of cognitive fusion between DM and anxiety and other negative emotional states in a sample of 318 Spanish primary-school students (aged between 8 and 16 years, M = 11.24, SD = 2.19, 50.8% males). Participants completed the AFQ-Y (Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for youth), which is a measure of psychological inflexibility that encompasses cognitive defusion and experiential avoidance; CAMM (DM for children and adolescents), PANAS-N (positive and negative affect measure for children, Spanish version of PANASC), and STAIC (an anxiety measure for children). The study accomplished ethical standards. As MBI relevant literature has suggested, cognitive defusion was a significant mediator between DM and symptoms of both negative emotions and anxiety in children and adolescents. However, experiential avoidance did not show any significant mediating relationship. Probably, an improvement of the assessment of experiential avoidance is needed.

The utility of the approach is demonstrated for two data sets from two different cultures and languages, based on corpora of vocal emotion enactment by professional actors and emotion inference by naïve listeners. Lens model equations, hierarchical regression, and multivariate path analysis are used to compare the relative contributions of objectively measured acoustic cues in the enacted expressions and subjective voice cues as perceived by listeners to the variance in emotion inference from vocal expressions for four emotion families (fear, anger, happiness, and sadness). While the results confirm the central role of arousal in vocal emotion communication, the utility of applying an extended path modeling framework is demonstrated by the identification of unique combinations of distal cues and proximal percepts carrying information about specific emotion families, independent of arousal. The statistical models generated show that more sophisticated acoustic parameters need to be developed to explain the distal underpinnings of subjective voice quality percepts that account for much of the variance in emotion inference, in particular voice instability and roughness. The general approach advocated here, as well as the specific results, open up new research strategies for work in psychology (specifically emotion and social perception research) and engineering and computer science (specifically research and development in the domain of affective computing, particularly on automatic emotion detection and synthetic emotion expression in avatars).",2015.0,62.0,50.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bänziger2015PathMO,\n author = {T.

The notion of health changed in 1947, when the World Health Organization defined health as a state of physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity? Further expansion of the definition of health has led to today’s use of the term ""wellness."" Wellness is the process by which one responsibly identifies areas of life in need of improvement and subsequently makes choices conducive to a more satisfying life style. TestWell, Wellness Inventory reportedly measures the extent to which lifestyle behaviors reflect potential risks and hazards. 2 However, evidence that TestWell was developed according to a research methodology or statistical test does not exist. The absence of a delphi panel, factor analysis, norm reference, or field test warrants investigations into TestWell’s utility among a variety of populations. Jones and Frazier -~ tested the hypothesis that wellness professionals possess high levels of both wellness and selfesteem. Total serf-esteem scores correlated with total TestWell scores (r = .59; p < .05). Jones and Frazier calculated a Cronbach coefficient alpha of .84 for TestWell.

However, there is more to adolescents' agency in the socialization process than simple reciprocity. Adolescents contribute actively to the quality and nature of the parent-adolescent relationship by giving meaning to parental behaviors and by engaging in cognitive-behavioral responses to parenting. These processes are discussed in the context of autonomy-relevant parenting, a dimension of parenting with pivotal importance for adolescents' psychosocial adjustment. We call for more research on the micro-processes involved in adolescents' agency because such research can yield a deeper insight in adolescents' differential susceptibility to parenting (depending on factors such as age, culture, and personality). It can also help to explain the multifinality involved in parenting, with, for instance, controlling parenting relating to distinct developmental problems in different adolescents. Finally, such research has applied value because it can help identify adolescents most at risk for the consequences of adverse parenting, and because it can help inform prevention programs aimed at strengthening constructive parent-adolescent communication.",2020.0,73.0,19.0,{'name': 'New directions for child and adolescent development'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Soenens2020TakingAA,\n author = {B.

However, most research has been only focused on autonomous behaviors in order to perform robots like animals, whereas it is lacked of determinant to those behaviours: energy. Approaching to clusted amimal and the higher, collective and sharing food among individuals are major activity to keep society being. This paper issues an approach to sociable robots using self-maintained energy in cooperative mobile robots, which is dominantly inspired from swarm behavior of collecting and sharing food of honey-bee and ant. Autonomous mobile robots are usually equipped with a finite energy, thus they can operate in a finite time. To overcome the finitude, we describe practical deployment of mobile robots that are capable of carrying and exchanging fuel to other robots. Mechanism implementation including modular hardware and control architecture to demonstrate the capabicities of the approach is presented. Subsequently, the battery exchange algorithm basically based on probabilistic modeling of total energy on each robot located in its local vicinity is described.

Contrast with the peak experience of winning should lessen the impact of ordinary pleasures, while habituation should eventually reduce the value of new pleasures made possible by winning. Study 1 compared a sample of 22 major lottery winners with 22 controls and also with a group of 29 paralyzed accident victims who had been interviewed previously. As predicted, lottery winners were not happier than controls and took significantly less pleasure from a series of mundane events. Study 2 indicated that these effects were not due to preexisting differences between people who buy or do not buy lottery tickets or between interviews that made or did not make the lottery salient.

In this work we study, on a sample of 1.2 million of individuals, how information related to very distinct narratives—i.e. main stream scientific and conspiracy news—are consumed and shape communities on Facebook. Our results show that polarized communities emerge around distinct types of contents and usual consumers of conspiracy news result to be more focused and self-contained on their specific contents.

The book, based on the author's PhD dissertation, discusses how European law could improve privacy protection in the area of behavioural targeting. Behavioural targeting, also referred to as online profiling, involves monitoring people’s online behaviour, and using the collected information to show people individually targeted advertisements. To protect privacy in the area of behavioural targeting, the EU lawmaker mainly relies on the consent requirement for the use of tracking technologies in the e-Privacy Directive, and on general data protection law. With informed consent requirements, the law aims to empower people to make choices in their best interests. But behavioural studies cast doubt on the effectiveness of the empowerment approach as a privacy protection measure. Many people click “I agree” to any statement that is presented to them. Therefore, to mitigate privacy problems such as chilling effects, this study argues for a combined approach of protecting and empowering the individual.

The constructed model retrieves photos based on human memory characteristics such as learning, forgetting, inhibition, and noise. These memory characteristics are regulated with parameter values corresponding to cognitive and emotional health. The authors assumed that a user's mental health could be assessed from their reactions to photo sequences retrieved by models with various parameter settings.

Many neural network models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recursive Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been proposed to learn representations of phrase/sentence, however, rich syntactic knowledge has not been fully explored when composing a longer text from its shorter constituent words. In most traditional models, only word embeddings are utilized to compose phrase/sentence representations, while the syntactic information of words is yet to be explored. In this article, we discover that encoding syntactic knowledge (part-of-speech tag) in neural networks can enhance sentence/phrase representation. Specifically, we propose to learn tag-specific composition functions and tag embeddings in recursive neural networks, and propose to utilize POS tags to control the gates of tree-structured LSTM networks. We evaluate these models on two benchmark datasets for sentiment classification, and demonstrate that improvements can be obtained with such syntactic knowledge encoded.",2017.0,61.0,115.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '1 - 27', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huang2017EncodingSK,\n author = {Minlie Huang and Qiao Qian and Xiaoyan Zhu},\n journal = {ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)},\n pages = {1 - 27},\n title = {Encoding Syntactic Knowledge in Neural Networks for Sentiment Classification},\n volume = {35},\n year = {2017}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1730108', 'name': 'Minlie Huang'}, {'authorId': '2066197339', 'name': 'Qiao Qian'}, {'authorId': '145213540', 'name': 'Xiaoyan Zhu'}]"

1856,9f5dd8afb171c99c631c12da5cded0ad2caafda0,SEAI: Social Emotional Artificial Intelligence Based on Damasio’s Theory of Mind,"A socially intelligent robot must be capable to extract meaningful information in real time from the social environment and react accordingly with coherent human-like behavior. Moreover, it should be able to internalize this information, to reason on it at a higher level, build its own opinions independently, and then automatically bias the decision-making according to its unique experience. In the last decades, neuroscience research highlighted the link between the evolution of such complex behavior and the evolution of a certain level of consciousness, which cannot leave out of a body that feels emotions as discriminants and prompters. In order to develop cognitive systems for social robotics with greater human-likeliness, we used an “understanding by building” approach to model and implement a well-known theory of mind in the form of an artificial intelligence, and we tested it on a sophisticated robotic platform. The name of the presented system is SEAI (Social Emotional Artificial Intelligence), a cognitive system specifically conceived for social and emotional robots. It is designed as a bio-inspired, highly modular, hybrid system with emotion modeling and high-level reasoning capabilities. It follows the deliberative/reactive paradigm where a knowledge-based expert system is aimed at dealing with the high-level symbolic reasoning, while a more conventional reactive paradigm is deputed to the low-level processing and control. The SEAI system is also enriched by a model that simulates the Damasio’s theory of consciousness and the theory of Somatic Markers. After a review of similar bio-inspired cognitive systems, we present the scientific foundations and their computational formalization at the basis of the SEAI framework. Then, a deeper technical description of the architecture is disclosed underlining the numerous parallelisms with the human cognitive system. Finally, the influence of artificial emotions and feelings, and their link with the robot’s beliefs and decisions have been tested in a physical humanoid involved in Human–Robot Interaction (HRI).",2018.0,58.0,34.0,"{'name': 'Frontiers in Robotics and AI', 'volume': '5'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Cominelli2018SEAISE,\n author = {Lorenzo Cominelli and D.

In the current article, the authors propose and then test a theoretical model that integrates these factors. They specify a progressive (cascading) pattern among ability-based EI facets, in which emotion perception must causally precede emotion understanding, which in turn precedes conscious emotion regulation and job performance. The sequential elements in this progressive model are believed to selectively reflect Conscientiousness, cognitive ability, and Neuroticism, respectively. ""Mixed-based"" measures of EI are expected to explain variance in job performance beyond cognitive ability and personality. The cascading model of EI is empirically confirmed via meta-analytic data, although relationships between ability-based EI and job performance are shown to be inconsistent (i.e., EI positively predicts performance for high emotional labor jobs and negatively predicts performance for low emotional labor jobs). Gender and race differences in EI are also meta-analyzed.

Participants in an fMRI scanner were asked to adopt a self-immersed or self-distanced perspective while reading and thinking about negative social feedback, and to report on felt changes in negative affect during that period using an emotion intensity profile tracking approach. We replicated previous findings showing that emotion explosiveness and accumulation were related to activity in regions involved in self-referential processing (such as the medial prefrontal cortex) and sustained visceral arousal (such as the posterior insula), respectively. The finding that adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective lowers emotion explosiveness and accumulation was also replicated at a self-report level.

This book explains what privacy is, what privacy isn’t, and why privacy matters. Privacy is the extent to which human information is known or used, and it is fundamentally about the social power that human information provides over other people. The best way to ensure that power is checked and channeled in ways that benefit humans and their society is through rules—rules about human information. And because human information rules of some sort are inevitable, we should craft our privacy rules to promote human values. The book suggests three such values that our human information rules should promote: identity, freedom, and protection. Identity allows us to be thinking, self-defining humans; freedom lets us be citizens; while protection safeguards our roles as situated consumers and workers, allowing us, as members of society, to trust and rely on other people so that we can live our lives and hopefully build a better future together.",2021.0,0.0,11.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Richards2021WhyPM,\n author = {Neil M.

1873,a04e57b8ce858e579201fd852628043d979db0b1,A PLAGUE ON THE PANOPTICON: Surveillance and power in the global information economy,"With technological advances in data-manipulation, the increased 'informability' of our daily lives and the potential for social management, surveillance has become a key site for understanding the workings of power within the global informational economy. Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon has, courtesy of Foucault, become a dominant metaphor in surveillance studies. This central eye, aimed at the moral reform of institutionalized bodies and operating through a de facto closure of individual agency, tends to limit our conception of the complex ways surveillance serves and disrupts power. Through analysis of commercial and workplace surveillance, this paper shows that power is contested and agency never completely closed down.

In response to the criticisms of the construct, we argue that the protagonists have not distinguished adequately between the streams, and have inappropriately characterized emotional intelligence as a variant of social intelligence. More significantly, two of the critical authors assert incorrectly that emotional intelligence research is driven by a utopian political agenda, rather than scientific interest. We argue, on the contrary, that emotional intelligence research is grounded in recent scientific advances in the study of emotion; specifically regarding the role emotion plays in organizational behavior. We conclude that emotional intelligence is attracting deserved continuing research interest as an individual difference variable in organizational behavior related to the way members perceive, understand, and manage their emotions.",2005.0,44.0,518.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '441-452', 'name': 'Journal of Organizational Behavior'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ashkanasy2005RumorsOT,\n author = {N.

In contrast, most AI systems are designed to solve only one type of problem, such as playing chess, searching the Internet, or scheduling aircraft departures. Soar is both a software system for agent development and a theory of what computational structures are necessary to support human-level agents. Over the years, both software system and theory have evolved. This book offers the definitive presentation of Soar from theoretical and practical perspectives, providing comprehensive descriptions of fundamental aspects and new components. The current version of Soar features major extensions, adding reinforcement learning, semantic memory, episodic memory, mental imagery, and an appraisal-based model of emotion. This book describes details of Soar's component memories and processes and offers demonstrations of individual components, components working in combination, and real-world applications. Beyond these functional considerations, the book also proposes requirements for general cognitive architectures and explicitly evaluates how well Soar meets those requirements.",2012.0,27.0,878.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Laird2012TheSC,\n author = {J.

As empirical research on resilience has burgeoned in recent years, criticisms have been levied at work in this area. These critiques have generally focused on ambiguities in definitions and central terminology; heterogeneity in risks experienced and competence achieved by individuals viewed as resilient; instability of the phenomenon of resilience; and concerns regarding the usefulness of resilience as a theoretical construct. We address each identified criticism in turn, proposing solutions for those we view as legitimate and clarifying misunderstandings surrounding those we believe to be less valid. We conclude that work on resilience possesses substantial potential for augmenting the understanding of processes affecting at-risk individuals. Realization of the potential embodied by this construct, however, will remain constrained without continued scientific attention to some of the serious conceptual and methodological pitfalls that have been noted by skeptics and proponents alike.",2000.0,172.0,7662.0,"{'volume': '71 3', 'pages': '\n          543-62\n        ', 'name': 'Child development'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Luthar2000TheCO,\n author = {S.

However, the contributions of this network to social and emotional aspects of intellectual function remain to be well characterized. Here we investigated the neural basis of emotional intelligence in 152 patients with focal brain injuries using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Latent variable modeling was applied to obtain measures of emotional intelligence, general intelligence and personality from the Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Inventory, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that latent scores for measures of general intelligence and personality reliably predicted latent scores for emotional intelligence. Lesion mapping results further indicated that these convergent processes depend on a shared network of frontal, temporal and parietal brain regions. The results support an integrative framework for understanding the architecture of executive, social and emotional processes and make specific recommendations for the interpretation and application of the MSCEIT to the study of emotional intelligence in health and disease.",2014.0,119.0,88.0,"{'volume': '9 3', 'pages': '\n          265-72\n        ', 'name': 'Social cognitive and affective neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Barbey2014DistributedNS,\n author = {A.

We focus on two aspects of clinical artiﬁcial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artiﬁcial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artiﬁcial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artiﬁcial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artiﬁcial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artiﬁcial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulﬁl the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artiﬁcial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artiﬁcial intelligence system before the system has been deployed.",,0.0,63.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n title = {Artiﬁcial intelligence in health care: accountability and safety}\n}\n'}",[]

To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi et al. used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by ∼3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed. Science, this issue p. 1146 A large-scale analysis of tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than the truth. We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.",2018.0,72.0,4420.0,"{'volume': '359', 'pages': '1146 - 1151', 'name': 'Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vosoughi2018TheSO,\n author = {Soroush Vosoughi and D.

Recent work on graph convolutional networks and neural graph learning methods has successfully combined the expressiveness of neural networks with graph structures. We propose a technique that, when applied to these methods, achieves state-of-the-art results on semi-supervised learning datasets. Traditional graph-based algorithms, such as label propagation, were designed with the underlying assumption that the label of a node can be imputed from that of the neighboring nodes. However, real-world graphs are either noisy or have edges that do not correspond to label agreement. To address this, we propose Graph Agreement Models (GAM), which introduces an auxiliary model that predicts the probability of two nodes sharing the same label as a learned function of their features. The agreement model is used when training a node classification model by encouraging agreement only for the pairs of nodes it deems likely to have the same label, thus guiding its parameters to better local optima. The classification and agreement models are trained jointly in a co-training fashion. Moreover, GAM can also be applied to any semi-supervised classification problem, by inducing a graph whenever one is not provided. We demonstrate that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 72% for various node classification models, and obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple established datasets.",2019.0,42.0,56.0,{'pages': '8710-8720'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Stretcu2019GraphAM,\n author = {Otilia Stretcu and K.

Moreover, research results – especially in the domain of positive psychology – indicate that high levels of well-being are associated with additional benefits improving teachers’ professional performance. Therefore, a training to foster subjective well-being with one training day, two booster sessions, and exercises before, during, and after the meetings was developed. It consisted of about 10 h of face-to-face time and about 3 h for the exercises in total over a 5-week training period. Main contents were conditions and consequences of positive and negative emotions and well-being, emotion regulation, time management, savoring and gratitude and the application of positive psychological interventions (like Three Good Things). Analyses of planned contrasts by means of a waiting control group design with three measurement points (pre, post, and follow-up) showed a significantly higher increase for the training group (n = 42) than for the control group (n = 47) in the frequency of positive emotions, life satisfaction, and flourishing (interaction effects d = 0.44, d = 0.31, and d = 0.32) and a significantly stronger decrease in the frequency of negative emotions, perceived stress, and experiencing emotional exhaustion (interaction effects d = 0.69, d = 0.51, and d = 0.47) from pre to 1-month follow-up.

Artificial intelligence masters poker Computers can beat humans at games as complex as chess or go. In these and similar games, both players have access to the same information, as displayed on the board. Although computers have the ultimate poker face, it has been tricky to teach them to be good at poker, where players cannot see their opponents' cards. Moravčík et al. built a code dubbed DeepStack that managed to beat professional poker players at a two-player poker variant called heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. Instead of devising its strategy beforehand, DeepStack recalculated it at each step, taking into account the current state of the game. The principles behind DeepStack may enable advances in solving real-world problems that involve information asymmetry. Science, this issue p. 508 Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker, the quintessential game of imperfect information, is a long-standing challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect-information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated, with statistical significance, professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em.

Thereby, in the SCS, ""good"" behavior can result in material rewards and reputational gain while ""bad"" behavior can lead to exclusion from material resources and reputational loss. Crucially, for the implementation of the SCS, society must be able to distinguish between behaviors that result in reward and those that lead to sanction. In this paper, we conduct the first transparency analysis of two central administrative information platforms of the SCS to understand how the SCS currently defines ""good"" and ""bad"" behavior. We analyze 194,829 behavioral records and 942 reports on citizens' behaviors published on the official Beijing SCS website and the national SCS platform ""Credit China"", respectively. By applying a mixed-method approach, we demonstrate that there is a considerable asymmetry between information provided by the so-called Redlist (information on ""good"" behavior) and the Blacklist (information on ""bad"" behavior). At the current stage of the SCS implementation, the majority of explanations on blacklisted behaviors includes a detailed description of the causal relation between inadequate behavior and its sanction. On the other hand, explanations on redlisted behavior, which comprise positive norms fostering value internalization and integration, are less transparent. Finally, this first SCS transparency analysis suggests that socio-technical systems applying a scoring mechanism might use different degrees of transparency to achieve particular behavioral engineering goals.",2019.0,36.0,46.0,"{'name': 'Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Engelmann2019ClearSV,\n author = {Severin Engelmann and Mo Chen and Felix A.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to influence every aspect of our lives, not least the way production is organised. AI, as a technology platform, can automate tasks previously performed by labour or create new tasks and activities in which humans can be productively employed. Recent technological change has been biased towards automation, with insufficient focus on creating new tasks where labour can be productively employed. The consequences of this choice have been stagnating labour demand, declining labour share in national income, rising inequality and lowering productivity growth. The current tendency is to develop AI in the direction of further automation, but this might mean missing out on the promise of the ‘right’ kind of AI, with better economic and social outcomes.",2019.0,59.0,194.0,{'name': 'International Political Economy: Globalization eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Acemoglu2019TheWK,\n author = {D.

This is a problem that may extent to multivariate analyses in general, in the field of information systems as well as in many other fields. In multivariate analyses, collinearity is usually assessed as a predictor-predictor relationship phenomenon, where two or more predictors are checked for redundancy. This type of assessment addresses vertical, or “classic,” collinearity. However, another type of collinearity may also exist, called here “lateral” collinearity. It refers to predictor-criterion collinearity. Lateral collinearity problems are exemplified based on an illustrative variance-based structural equation modeling analysis. The analysis employs WarpPLS 2.0, with the results double-checked with other statistical analysis software tools.

Applications of data fusion for Department of Defense (DoD) applications include automatic target recognition (ATR), identification-friend-foe-neutral (IFFN), and battlefield surveillance and situation assessment. The use of data fusion for these applications is appealing. Conceptually, the use of a broad spectrum of sensors should improve system accuracy, decrease uncertainty, and make these systems more robust to changes in the targets and environmental conditions. Techniques for data fusion are drawn from a diverse set of disciplines including signal and image processing, pattern recognition, statistical estimation, and artificial intelligence. Many of these techniques have an extensive history, ranging from Bayesian inference (first published in 1793) to fuzzy logic (originating in the 1920s) to neural nets (developed in the 1940s). In the past two decades an enormous amount of DoD funds have been expended to develop data fusion systems. While there are many successes, there are still a number of challenges and limitations. Indeed, critics of data fusion argue that data fusion technology is disappointing and ask, ""why is it that when all is said and done (in data fusion), there is so much more said than done?"" This paper presents a summary of the current state and limitations of data fusion. Key issues are identified that limit the ability to implement a successful data fusion system.",2001.0,22.0,89.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Hall2001DirtySI,\n author = {D.

This can be detrimental for teachers’ health but the effects of such inauthentic emotion expressions on students are largely unexplored. In two exploratory studies we investigated the impact of teachers’ emotions and emotional authenticity (expressing truly felt emotions) on students’ emotions of enjoyment, anger, and anxiety. In study 1 we used generalised (trait-level) assessments from teachers (N = 81) and students (N = 786) on emotions and emotional authenticity. As emotions are dynamic in nature, we further used the experience sampling method with a randomly chosen subsample (N = 128 students) in study 2 to assess momentarily perceived teacher emotional authenticity and students’ emotions in the classroom. In study 1 we found teachers’ and students’ self-reported enjoyment (but not anger and anxiety) to be interrelated. In study 2, all three (perceived) teacher emotions were related to students’ emotions. Further, in both studies students’ perceptions of their teachers’ emotional authenticity related to their own emotions. Although teachers’ self-reported and students’ perceived emotional authenticity did not converge, the results show that emotional authenticity matters to students. Implications for future studies but also for teachers’ emotion regulation are discussed.",2020.0,64.0,25.0,"{'volume': '27', 'pages': '404 - 422', 'name': 'Teachers and Teaching'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Keller2020TeachersEA,\n author = {M.

To show that members of a preliterate culture who had minimal exposure to literate cultures would associate the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors as do members of Western and Eastern literate cultures, data were gathered in New Guinea by telling subjects a story, showing them a set of three faces, and asking them to select the face which showed the emotion appropriate to the story.

For example, a better algorithm for finding good policies in (PO)MDPs can be instantly used in a variety of applications. But such a general theory is lacking when it comes to moral decision making.

Relevant nonverbal literature was organized according to a Brunswikian lens model. Nonverbal behavioral composites, grouped according to their likely proximal percepts, were hypothesized to significantly affect both credibility and persuasiveness. A sample of 60 speakers gave videotaped speeches that were judged on credibility and persuasiveness by classmates. Pairs of trained raters coded 22 vocalic, kinesic, and proxemic nonverbal behaviors evidenced in the tapes. Results confirmed numerous associations between nonverbal behaviors and attributions of credibility and persuasiveness. Greater perceived competence and composure were associated with greater vocal and facial pleasantness, with greater facial expressiveness contributing to competence perceptions. Greater sociability was associated with more kinesic/proxemic immediacy, dominance, and relaxation and with vocal pleasantness. Most of these same cues also enhanced character judgments. No cues were related to dynamism judgments. Greater perceived persuasiveness correlated with greater vocal pleasantness (especially fluency and pitch variety), kinesic/proxemic immediacy, facial expressiveness, and kinesic relaxation (especially high random movement but little tension).

This article aims to confront that uncertainty. To date, most regulations have treated robots and A.I. agents either as tools or people, making questionable assignments of rights and responsibilities. Instead, regulations should reckon that robots and A.I. agents escape this dichotomy. The law must assign rights and responsibilities for entities with characteristics that exist on a continuum between tools and people. This article describes this continuum through three characteristics that help us consistently place robots and A.I. agents along it: emergence, embodiment, and social valence. It proposes a framework for analogizing A.I. entities to existing entities that the law already understands, thereby creating a baseline for assigning rights and responsibilities for their actions.",2018.0,0.0,8.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cofone2018ServersAW,\n author = {Ignacio Cofone},\n title = {Servers and Waiters: What Matters in the Law of A.I.},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '116471090', 'name': 'Ignacio Cofone'}]"

If we aim to build artificial companions (agents or robots) capable of establishing long-term relationships with users, they should be able to understand the user's affective state and react accordingly, that is, behave in an empathic manner.
 Recent advances in affect recognition research show that it is possible to automatically analyse and interpret affective expressions displayed by humans. However, affect recognition in naturalistic environments is still a challenging issue and there are many unanswered questions related to how a virtual agent or a social robot should react to those states, and how that improves the interaction. We have developed a scenario in which a social robot recognises the user's affective state and displays empathic behaviours. In this paper, we present part of the results of a study assessing the influence of the robot's empathic behaviour on the user's understanding of the interaction.",2010.0,19.0,22.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '43-48', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Leite2010ClosingTL,\n author = {Iolanda Leite and André Pereira and S.

Today, basic forms of machine learning algorithms are commonly used by a variety of companies. Also, advanced forms of machine learning are increasingly making their way into the consumer sphere and promise to optimize existing markets. For financial advising, machine learning algorithms promise to make advice available 24–7 and significantly reduce costs, thereby opening the market for financial advice to lower-income individuals. However, the use of machine learning algorithms also raises concerns. Among them, whether these machine learning algorithms can meet the existing fiduciary standard imposed on human financial advisers and how responsibility and liability should be partitioned when an autonomous algorithm falls short of the fiduciary standard and harms a client. After summarizing the applicable law regulating investment advisers and the current state of robo-advising, this Note evaluates whether roboadvisers can meet the fiduciary standard and proposes alternate liability schemes for dealing with increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms.

Performance on these tasks is affected strongly by the amount and quality of the visual input, as well as by the resultant visual perception and cognitive performance. Visual perception is defined as the mental organization and interpretation of the visual sensory information with the intent of attaining awareness and understanding of the local environment, e.g., objects and events. Cognition refers to the faculty for the human-like processing of this information and application of previously acquired knowledge (i.e., memory) to build understanding and initiate responses. Cognition involves attention, expectation, learning, memory, language, and problem solving. The direct physical stimuli for visual perception are the emitted or reflected quanta of light energy from objects in the visual environment that enters the eyes. It is important to understand that the resulting perception of the stimuli is not only a result of their physical properties (e.g., wavelength, intensity, and hue) but also of the changes induced by the transduction, filtering, and transformation of the physical input by the entire human visual system. This chapter explores some of the more important visual processes that contribute to visual perception and cognitive performance. These include brightness perception, size constancy, visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity, color discrimination, motion perception, depth perception and stereopsis. An analogous discussion of input via the auditory sense is discussed in Chapter 11, Auditory Perception and Cognitive Performance.",2009.0,187.0,12.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Capó-Aponte2009VISUALPA,\n author = {J.

Recent advances in affective computing, however, allow for the detection of such states and give us tools to tackle the connected problems within automotive user interfaces. We see potential in building a system which reacts upon possibly dangerous driver states and influences the driver in order to drive more safely. We compare different interaction approaches for an affective automotive interface, namely Ambient Light, Visual Notification, a Voice Assistant, and an Empathic Assistant. Results of a simulator study with 60 participants (30 each with induced sadness/anger) indicate that an emotional voice assistant with the ability to empathize with the user is the most promising approach as it improves negative states best and is rated most positively. Qualitative data also shows that users prefer an empathic assistant but also resent potential paternalism.

Affective games - those that adapt or incorporate a player's emotional state - have shown promise in creating exciting and engaging user experiences. However, a dearth of systematic exploration into what types of game elements should adapt to affective state leaves game designers with little guidance on how to incorporate affect into their games. We created an affective game engine, using it to deploy a design probe into how adapting the player's abilities, the enemy's abilities, or variables in the environment affects player performance and experience. Our results suggest that affectively adapting games can increase player arousal. Furthermore, we suggest that reducing challenge by adapting non-player characters is a worse design choice than giving players the tools that they need (through enhancing player abilities or a supportive environment) to master greater challenges.",2014.0,38.0,31.0,"{'pages': '1-8', 'name': '2014 IEEE Games Media Entertainment'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Negini2014UsingAS,\n author = {Faham Negini and R.

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues. Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.",2014.0,15.0,2529.0,"{'volume': '111', 'pages': '8788 - 8790', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kramer2014ExperimentalEO,\n author = {Adam D.

CDSSs have shown great potential to improve healthcare, increase patient safety and reduce costs. However, the use of CDSSs is not without pitfalls, as an inadequate or faulty CDSS can potentially deteriorate the quality of healthcare and put patients at risk. In addition, the adoption of a CDSS might fail because its intended users ignore the output of the CDSS due to lack of trust, relevancy or actionability. Aim In this article, we provide guidance based on literature for the different aspects involved in the adoption of a CDSS with a special focus on machine and deep learning based systems: selection, acceptance testing, commissioning, implementation and quality assurance. Results A rigorous selection process will help identify the CDSS that best fits the preferences and requirements of the local site. Acceptance testing will make sure that the selected CDSS fulfills the defined specifications and satisfies the safety requirements. The commissioning process will prepare the CDSS for safe clinical use at the local site. An effective implementation phase should result in an orderly roll out of the CDSS to the well‐trained end‐users whose expectations have been managed. And finally, quality assurance will make sure that the performance of the CDSS is maintained and that any issues are promptly identified and solved. Conclusion We conclude that a systematic approach to the adoption of a CDSS will help avoid pitfalls, improve patient safety and increase the chances of success.",2020.0,63.0,49.0,"{'volume': '47', 'pages': 'e228 - e235', 'name': 'Medical Physics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mahadevaiah2020ArtificialIC,\n author = {Geetha Mahadevaiah and Prasad Rv and I.

We tested these possibilities among participants with BPD, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no disorder (controls). Study 1 participants (N = 272) were recruited online; Study 2 participants (N = 90) completed in-person diagnostic assessments. The BPD groups reported greater use of maladaptive strategies than the MDD (d = .35) and control (d = 1.54) groups and lower quality implementation than the MDD (d = -.33) and control groups (d = -.97). BPD participants reported similar use of adaptive strategies as the MDD group (d = -.09) but less use than controls (d = -.47).

The results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed that a structure of four factors of effort (workload, emotional demands, student-related issues, and social responsibility) and two factors of reward (emotional reward and material reward) in accordance with the ERI model had significant factor loadings and acceptable model fit. The Cronbach’s Alpha coefficients of all dimensions’ scores showed that the questionnaire scores had good reliability. Criterion validity was indicated by significant correlation coefficients of scores of most dimensions along with teachers’ self-reported job burnout and non-reciprocal social relations, as well as the ANOVA results showing that the differences of the scores of the two criterion scales in different ERI ratio levels were significant. The results also showed that teacher’s ERI level varied with demographic variables such as age, gender and school type. The Teacher ERIQ is a valid and reliable new measurement for assessing teachers’ psychosocial work characteristics. It can be an important tool to provide new explanations of stress-related health risks among teachers and to guide the development of preventive measurements.",2019.0,42.0,14.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ren2019PsychometricPO,\n author = {Chuang Ren and Xiying Li and Xuemei Yao and Zhongling Pi and Senqing Qi},\n journal = {Frontiers in Psychology},\n title = {Psychometric Properties of the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire for Teachers (Teacher ERIQ)},\n volume = {10},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2064257070', 'name': 'Chuang Ren'}, {'authorId': '50079222', 'name': 'Xiying Li'}, {'authorId': '2115586846', 'name': 'Xuemei Yao'}, {'authorId': '17963996', 'name': 'Zhongling Pi'}, {'authorId': '36488215', 'name': 'Senqing Qi'}]"

It is shown that reciprocal preferences, which place negative weight on the payoffs of materialists and positive weight on the payoffs of sufficiently altruistic individuals can invade a population of materialists in a class of aggregative games under both individual selection and random matching. Such preferences are efficiency-reducing when they are rare and efficiency-enhancing when they are widespread, suggesting that they can persist even under group selection and assortative matching. In comparison with simpler specifications of preference interdependence (such as pure altruism or envy), the survival of such preferences is therefore less sensitive to details of the evolutionary selection process.",2001.0,37.0,212.0,"{'volume': '97', 'pages': '273-297', 'name': 'J.

Conversely, less attention has been devoted to the examination of the relationship between psychopathology and overt emotion regulation strategies (e.g., drinking alcohol, seeking advice). This has resulted in a limited understanding of the complex repertoire of emotion regulation strategies that individuals possess, and how patterns in the use of strategies might relate to psychopathology. We asked 218 undergraduates to report on their habitual use of 15 covert and overt emotion regulation strategies and symptoms of seven different mental disorders. Overt strategies were associated with symptoms and, at times, they predicted psychopathology above and beyond the more frequently studied covert strategies. These findings have implications for developing a more sophisticated understanding of patterns of adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation.",2014.0,40.0,122.0,"{'volume': '43', 'pages': '22 - 33', 'name': 'Cognitive Behaviour Therapy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Aldao2014BroadeningTS,\n author = {A.

Unfortunately, when taken separately, these measures are vulnerable to different sources of bias, and alternative explanations might account for changes in these indicators of negative affect. What is needed is a study that (a) obtains measures of self-reported affect together with facial electromyography, and (b) examines the use of reappraisal to regulate externally and internally generated affective responses. In the present study, participants up- or down-regulated negative affect in the context of both negative and neutral pictures. Up-regulation led to greater self reports of negative affect, as well as greater corrugator and startle responses to both negative and neutral stimuli. Down-regulation led to lesser reports of negative affect, and lesser corrugator responses to negative and neutral stimuli. These results extend prior research by (a) showing simultaneous effects on multiple measures of affect, and (b) demonstrating that cognitive reappraisal may be used both to regulate responses to negative stimuli and to manufacture a negative response to neutral stimuli.",2010.0,22.0,223.0,"{'volume': '10 4', 'pages': '\n          587-92\n        ', 'name': 'Emotion'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ray2010CognitiveRO,\n author = {R.

Methods: One hundred and thirty four patients (121 female, mean age = 29 years) with anorexia nervosa (n = 30), bulimia nervosa (n = 54), binge eating (n = 20), or Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (n = 30) and 74 healthy control participants (51 female, mean age = 21 years) reported on general psychopathology, ED severity, personality traits and difficulties in emotion regulation. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine the psychometrics of the DERS in this Spanish sample (Aim 1). Additionally, to examine the role of emotion regulation difficulties in ED (Aim 2), differences in emotion regulation difficulties across eating disorder subgroups were examined and structural equation modeling was used to explore the interrelations among emotion regulation, personality traits, and eating disorder severity. Results: Results support the validity and reliability of the DERS within this Spanish adult sample and suggest that this measure has a similar factor structure in this sample as in the original sample. Moreover, emotion regulation difficulties were found to differ as a function of eating disorder subtype and to mediate the relation between two specific personality traits (i.e., high harm avoidance and low self-directedness) and ED severity. Conclusions: Personality traits of high harm avoidance and low self-directedness may increase vulnerability to ED pathology indirectly, through emotion regulation difficulties.",2015.0,101.0,55.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wolz2015EmotionRI,\n author = {I.

However, supervised methods assume that the training domain and the testing domain share the same distribution; otherwise, accuracy drops dramatically. Although this does not pose problems when training data are readily available, in some circumstances, labeled data is quite expensive to acquire. For instance, if we want to detect sentiment from Tweets or Facebook comments, the only way to acquire is to manually label it, and this is prohibitively burdensome and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates the sentiment information from source-domain labeled data and a set of preselected sentiment words to solve this problem.

Before moving deeper into data-driven regulation, I explain the difference between law and regulation, and the relevance of such a difference for the rule of law. I discuss artificial legal intelligence (ALI) as a means to enable quantified legal prediction and argumentation mining which are both based on machine learning. This raises the question of whether the implementation of such technologies should count as law or as regulation, and what this means for their further development. Finally, I propose the concept of ‘agonistic machine learning’ as a means to bring data-driven regulation under the rule of law. This entails obligating developers, lawyers and those subject to the decisions of ALI to re-introduce adversarial interrogation at the level of its computational architecture.

 Personal autonomy is at the core of liberal societies, and its preservation has been a focus of European Union (EU) consumer and data protection law. Professionals increasingly use artificial intelligence in consumer markets to shape user preferences and influence their behaviours. This paper focuses on the long-term impact of artificial intelligence on consumer autonomy by studying three specific commercial practices: (1) dark patterns in user interfaces; (2) behavioural advertising; and (3) personalisation through recommender systems. It explores whether and to what extent EU regulation addresses the risks to consumer autonomy of using artificial intelligence in markets in the long term. It finds that new EU regulation does bring novelties to protect consumer autonomy in this context but fails to sufficiently consider the long-term consequences of autonomy capture by professionals. Finally, the paper makes several proposals to integrate the long-term risks affecting consumer autonomy in EU consumer and data protection regulation.

The concept of ‘core self-evaluation’ (CSE), which has been recently validated in the psychology literature, concisely encompasses and consolidates the common, overlapping portions of four previously unconnected personality dimensions: self-esteem, self-efficacy, locus of control, and emotional stability. CSE has great potential to provide substantial leverage for research on executive self-concept. We review and reconcile prior research on related constructs in executive settings (including narcissism, hubris, and overconfidence) and argue that CSE should be adopted as a robust, well-validated umbrella construct for research on executive self-concept. Indeed, a very high level of CSE, or hyper-CSE, aligns closely with what is often colloquially called ‘hubris.’ We anticipate that hyper-CSE executives—who possess supreme levels of self-confidence, self-potency, and conviction that they will prevail—will manifest this trait in their job behaviors. We develop a set of integrated propositions that describe the implications of CSE for strategic decision processes, strategic choices, and organizational performance. Finally, we propose additional avenues for research.

Purpose
This paper aims to assess the increasing challenges to governing the personal health information (PHI) essential for advancing artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning innovations in health care. Risks to privacy and justice/equity are discussed, along with potential solutions.


Design/methodology/approach
This conceptual paper highlights the scale and scope of PHI data consumed by deep learning algorithms and their opacity as novel challenges to health data governance.


Findings
This paper argues that these characteristics of machine learning will overwhelm existing data governance approaches such as privacy regulation and informed consent. Enhanced governance techniques and tools will be required to help preserve the autonomy and rights of individuals to control their PHI. Debate among all stakeholders and informed critique of how, and for whom, PHI-fueled health AI are developed and deployed are needed to channel these innovations in societally beneficial directions.


Social implications
Health data may be used to address pressing societal concerns, such as operational and system-level improvement, and innovations such as personalized medicine. This paper informs work seeking to harness these resources for societal good amidst many competing value claims and substantial risks for privacy and security.


Originality/value
This is the first paper focusing on health data governance in relation to AI/machine learning.

The study draws on the theoretical framework of the flipped approach to learning to explore the use of the approach in the Higher Education (HE) context. The study suggests that the flipped approach to learning may be helpful in the delivery of pre-sessional EAP courses remotely as it offers students opportunities to engage in communicative activities and encourages independent learning and autonomy, both of which are key practices in EAP. However, teachers may find the approach challenging if they cannot monitor students’ work or connect with them while completing the flipped activities. Only a few studies have focused on this issue to date. Further research involving more teachers and students is recommended to provide additional insights on this aspect of teaching remotely.",2022.0,0.0,2.0,{'name': 'GiLE Journal of Skills Development'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Hudson2022SwitchingTO,\n author = {Jolanta Hudson},\n journal = {GiLE Journal of Skills Development},\n title = {Switching to online learning},\n year = {2022}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '81448661', 'name': 'Jolanta Hudson'}]"

1968,a7960bfe633ef222c24c00eba213d96013d85296,"The Relationship between Emotional Intelligence and Abuse of Alcohol, Marijuana, and Tobacco among College Students","ABSTRACT This study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI), alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use. A correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between EI and the use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco among college students (n = 199). EI abilities (perception, utilization, understanding, and regulation of emotions) were measured in college students who completed the valid and reliable Schutte Self Report Inventory (SSRI), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), and the Marijuana Screening Inventory (MSI). The results demonstrated that El constructs (Perception, Utilization, Regulation, and Management of Emotion) scores were significant predictors of alcohol and marijuana use. An association between the El and cigarette smoking was not supported by this study. BACKGROUND The use of alcohol and illicit substances among youth have been studied by many (Diala, Muntaner, & Walrath, 2004; Dube, Feliti, Dong, Chapman, Giles et al., 2003; Gordon, Kinlock, & Battjes, 2004). Substance abuse in youth contributes to internalizing and other psychosocial impairment that sets the foundation for potential and subsequent drug and alcohol use in adulthood (National Survey on Drug Use and Health [NSDUH], (2006); King, Meehan, Trim, & Chassin, 2007). The National Adolescent Health Information Center (NAHIC, 2007) reported that the use of substances, such as alcohol, marijuana, and cigarettes, has tripled for adolescents and young adults in all racial and ethnic groups. Marijuana, for example, is the most frequently abused illicit drug in the United States, mostly among adolescents 12-years and older. Its use accounts for one third of the most mentioned abused drug in drug-related emergencies in emergency departments nationwide (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2007). Similarly, cigarette smoking among ages 18 to 25 is 39.5% (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2005). The early use of illicit drugs increases risky behaviors that can lead to: contracting or transmitting sexually transmitted diseases, crime and violence, and chronic substance abuse and dependence (Burrow-Sanchez, 2006; Guiao, Blakemore, & Boswell-Wise, 2004; Miller, Naimi, Brewer, & Everett-Jones, 2007; Nanda, & Konnur, 2006). In the United States between 1998 and 2001, among 18 to 24 year old college students that drank or were binge drinkers, there was a significant increase in deaths, which out proportioned the increase in that population (Hingson, Heeren, Winter, & Weschler, 2005; Weschler, et al, 2002). Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2005) reported that the leading cause of motor vehicle-crash-related deaths among adolescents is associated with alcohol. The yearly cost of substance abuse often includes multiple treatments through medical and detoxification efforts, criminal prosecutions, school dropouts, and lack of productivity (Adrian, 2001; Compton, & Volkow, 2006). Little is known regarding the total cost of substance abuse to the health care system, but the National Drug Intelligence Center (2011) reported the cost of substance use to be at $193 billion in 2007. Researchers continue to explore ways in which to understand the underpinnings of substance abuse (Burrow-Sanchez, 2006; Dooley & Prause, 2006; Hampson, Andrews, & Barckley, 2008; Hollist & McBroom, 2006) and other risk behaviors among populations. They have focused attention to the application of social theories (Cooper, May, Soderstrom, & Jarjoura, 2009) and the linkages of theoretical perspectives in human behavior. There is limited research on the theory of emotional intelligence (EI) (Bar-On, 2006; Goleman, 1995; Salovey & Mayer, 1990) as it relates to substance use and other risky behaviors among freshmen college students. …",2012.0,41.0,29.0,"{'volume': '56', 'pages': '8', 'name': 'Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Claros2012TheRB,\n author = {E.

Beyond technical, structural, or economic factors, we propose an additional factor: the degree of the top management team's (TMT) frame flexibility, i.e., their capability to cognitively expand an innovation's categorical boundaries and to cast the innovation as emotionally resonant with the organization's identity, competencies, and competitive boundaries. We argue that inertial forces generally constrict how TMTs perceive innovations, but that frame flexibility can overcome these constraints, increasing the likelihood of adoption and broadening the organization's innovation practices. We advance a theoretical model that relaxes the assumption that cognitive frames are static, showing how they become flexible via categorical positioning, and introduce a role for emotional frames that appeal to organizational members' sentiments and aspirations in innovation adoption. Managerial Summary Confronting a technological change is one of the most difficult challenges facing any incumbent firm. Technological transitions create pressure for leaders to reframe their mental models while continuing to develop existing capabilities and product category variants. Yet at key junctures in a product class and during technological change, a concrete definition of the firm's innovation boundaries and identity hold a firm hostage to its past. We show how a flexible cognitive frame—coupled with emotional framing—helps leaders and organization members become emotionally engaged in transformation efforts and, in turn, learn about executing nonincremental innovation over time. At technological transitions, perhaps there is no more important role for leaders than to expand their cognitive frames and to infuse these expanded frames with emotion.",2017.0,255.0,97.0,{'name': 'IRPN: Producer Innovation (Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Raffaelli2017FrameFT,\n author = {R.

Affective AutoTutor takes the individualized instruction and human-like interactivity to a new level by automatically detecting and responding to students' emotional states in addition to their cognitive states. Over 20 controlled experiments comparing AutoTutor with ecological and experimental controls such reading a textbook have consistently yielded learning improvements of approximately one letter grade after brief 30--60-minute interactions. Furthermore, Affective AutoTutor shows even more dramatic improvements in learning than the original AutoTutor system, particularly for struggling students with low domain knowledge. In addition to providing a detailed description of the implementation and evaluation of AutoTutor and Affective AutoTutor, we also discuss new and exciting technologies motivated by AutoTutor such as AutoTutor-Lite, Operation ARIES, GuruTutor, DeepTutor, MetaTutor, and AutoMentor. We conclude this article with our vision for future work on interactive and engaging intelligent tutoring systems.",2012.0,163.0,301.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '23:1-23:39', 'name': 'ACM Trans.

We studied the associations between these two constructs among middle school students (N = 57), considering two types of creativity: a general creative thinking, and a specific computational creativity. We did so using learning analytics, specifically, by operationalizing a log-based assessment of computational creativity. We find some evidence for an association between Computational Creativity and Computational Thinking: Demonstrating originality in an early stage of the game is associated with succeeding in this stage relatively easily, however negatively associated with progressing farther in the game. We also find that Computational Creativity is better explained by a state- rather than a trait-model. No associations were found between Creative Thinking and Computational Thinking.

Secondly, the reasoning method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were introduced into the multi system, and a kind of multi emotion decision model based on the emotion reasoning was constructed. The hierarchical structure method was used to solve the complex decision problem of the humanoid robot in the intelligent home environment. Then, based on the emotion energy theory, a mood state regulation algorithm based on the combination of HMM-based spontaneous transfer and stimulus transfer was established. In addition, on this basis, the design and implementation of humanoid robot associative memory model was realized. Finally, the theory and algorithm were integrated into the interactive platform of human-computer expression, and the validity of the model was analysed and verified. The results showed that, on this robot platform, the process of human-computer interaction and cooperation which integrated emotion evaluation, emotional decision, associative memory and emotion regulation was realized.

1988,a94af47645fad526f4b0e7b5719d142385ed2024,Mobile Games: Analyzing the Needs and Values of the Consumers,"Abstract: Mobile games are one of the largest mobile application areas and one where users are often willing to pay for services. Furthermore, the market for mobile games is expected to grow dramatically as most phones sold now are capable of running games. Despite this, there is surprisingly little research concerning user expectations from mobile games. In this exploratory study, we examine the consumers' values, needs, and objectives related to mobile games. Based on earlier literature on mobile services, we developed a preliminary set of issues and did an exploratory survey of mobile game users to find the key needs and values of mobile gamers. The results of the study are especially interesting for mobile game developers and mobile phone operators, as they shed light on the demographics and choices of mobile gamers. We argue that if mobile games are ever to be diffused in greater extent to the market, then a deeper understanding of the values and needs of the potential mobile game users must be obtained. This understanding can then be used to guide the development of new game offerings. Keywords: mobile games, values, objectives, consumers, principal component analysis, cluster analysis INTRODUCTION During the last two decades, mobile phones have diffused all over the planet, and the core services provided by the telecom operators (e.g., voice and text messaging) have become commodities. Markets for commodities are typically efficient and quickly respond to changes in supply and demand, driving down prices and making the basis of competition on price. Therefore, in order to remain competitive, many mobile operators have sought cost efficiencies through economies of scale. This has led to a high level of consolidation in the mobile phone operator market. To deviate from competition, companies usually explore ways to provide value-added services for their customers. Operators have considered mobile games1 as a good value-added service for a long time. According to several market research firms (e.g., Juniper, Gartner) the Asian mobile gaming market is growing very fast and the total number of mobile gamers is estimated at 400 million people. The value of the global mobile games market is expected to rise from $5.4 billion in 2008 to more than $10 billion in 2013 (RCR 2008). It is notable that these estimates are based only on OTA downloads through cellular networks. The logic behind these bold estimates is the expansion in the smart phone markets. The shipments of smart phones have grown rapidly during the last few years. According to Canalys.com (2008), 35.5 million smart phone devices were sold in the fourth quarter of 2007, displaying growth rates of over 50 percent during the last two years. The growth of the smart phone market creates a more fruitful basis for the diffusion of mobile games as the games played on smart phones are more sophisticated and more interesting. The recent introduction of Apple AppStore, together with iPhone3G, highlights the importance of games, as almost a third of available titles are games-over 1,700 games as of January 2009 (Rybicki 2009). Previous research on mobile games has dealt with the new possibilities of mobility, e.g., location-based games (Han et al. 2005) and support for combining dimensions of the physical world and our social surroundings into games (Peltola and Karsten 2006). Most mobile game research to date has dealt with technical aspects of the games (see, e.g., Bell et al. 2006; Fritsch et al. 2006). In addition, there is some emerging research into the business models of the software companies producing mobile games (Rajala et al. 2007). Despite the potential of mobile games for different stakeholders, the extant literature provides little empirical research on the actual consumer values regarding mobile games (Anckar and D'Incau 2002; Barnes 2002; MGAIN 2003). Therefore, in this paper, our objective is to explore the values, needs, and objectives related to the purchasing process of mobile games. …",2010.0,48.0,367.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '5-22', 'name': 'The Journal of Information Technology Theory and Application'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Penttinen2010MobileGA,\n author = {Esko Penttinen and M.

Ryan is a socially assistive robot designed to provide companionship for older adults with depression and dementia through conversation. We used two versions of Ryan for our study, empathic and non-empathic. The empathic Ryan utilizes a multimodal emotion recognition algorithm and a multimodal emotion expression system. Using different input modalities for emotion, i.e., facial expression and speech sentiment, the empathic Ryan detects users’ emotional state and utilizes an affective dialogue manager to generate a response. On the other hand, the non-empathic Ryan lacks facial expression and uses scripted dialogues that do not factor in the users’ emotional state. We studied these two versions of Ryan with 10 older adults living in a senior care facility. The statistically significant improvement in the users’ reported face-scale mood measurement indicates an overall positive effect from the interaction with both the empathic and non-empathic versions of Ryan. However, the number of spoken words measurement and the exit survey analysis suggest that the users perceive the empathic Ryan as more engaging and likable.",2022.0,87.0,15.0,"{'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing', 'pages': '2020-2032', 'volume': '14'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Abdollahi2022ArtificialEI,\n author = {Hojjat Abdollahi and M.

Evidence from a modified version of the game Paper, Rock, Scissors suggests that people do not play randomly, and not according to certain play probabilities. We investigated the relationship between game theory predictions and a cognitive model of game playing based on the detection of sequential dependencies. Previous research has shown that the sequential dependency model can account for a number of empirical findings that game theory cannot. The sequential dependency model has been implemented using both simple neural networks and ACT-R. In this paper we used simple neural networks (a description of how our findings relate to the ACT-R model is included in the Conclusion section). For simple games, such as Paper, Rock, Scissors, game theory has been able to correctly predict aggregate move probabilities. In this paper we show that this is an artifact of the symmetry of the payoffs, and that for asymmetrical payoffs the game theory solution does not predict human behavior. Furthermore, we show that the model of game playing that underlies game theory cannot be used to predict the results no matter what move probabilities are used. Finally, we show that the results can be accounted for by augmenting the network sequential dependency model so that the reward system is related to the game payoffs.",2004.0,23.0,13.0,{'pages': '255-260'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Rutledge-Taylor2004CognitiveMV,\n author = {Matthew Rutledge-Taylor and R.

1997,aa684fd6ce67c3d73ae92f74f650c5475966142a,The World of Emotions is not Two-Dimensional,"For more than half a century, emotion researchers have attempted to establish the dimensional space that most economically accounts for similarities and differences in emotional experience. Today, many researchers focus exclusively on two-dimensional models involving valence and arousal. Adopting a theoretically based approach, we show for three languages that four dimensions are needed to satisfactorily represent similarities and differences in the meaning of emotion words. In order of importance, these dimensions are evaluationpleasantness, potency-control, activation-arousal, and unpredictability. They were identified on the basis of the applicability of 144 features representing the six components of emotions: (a) appraisals of events, (b) psychophysiological changes, (c) motor expressions, (d) action tendencies, (e) subjective experiences, and (f) emotion regulation.",2007.0,23.0,985.0,"{'volume': '18', 'pages': '1050 - 1057', 'name': 'Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fontaine2007TheWO,\n author = {J.

With its pure, spectacular, and magical features, these regions attract numerous tourists. Ice and snow landscapes can provide not only visually-stimulating experiences for people, but also opportunities for outdoor play and movement. In China, ice and snow tourism is a new type of recreation; however, the establishment of snow and ice in relation to the suitability of the surrounding has not been clearly expressed. Based on multi-source data, such as tourism, weather, and traffic data, this paper employs the Delphi-analytic hierarchy process (AHP) evaluation method and a spatial analysis method to study the spatial differences of snow and ice tourism suitability in China. China’s ice and snow tourism is located in the latitude from 35°N to 53.33°N and latitude 41.5°N to 45°N and longitude 82°E to 90°E, with the main focus on latitude and terrain factors. A poor fit is concentrated at latitude 20.45°N to 35°N and longitude 100°E to 122°E; the difference is that the latitude is low and affected by the Japanese warm current. The analysis of the suitability of ice and snow tourism can be employed as a reference for the development of ice and snow tourism.",2017.0,25.0,14.0,"{'volume': '9', 'pages': '1-13', 'name': 'Sustainability'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yang2017TheSD,\n author = {J.

Hence, the goal of this study was to explore the nature of the psychotherapy relationship from the psychotherapists’ perspective using a metaphorical approach. In an online survey, a sample of N=373 Czech psychotherapists and counselors rated a set of relational metaphors in terms of how accurately they depicted their roles in their relationships with their clients. The single most endorsed metaphor for the practitioner’s role was a guide. Furthermore, the principal component analysis identified three relational components, namely, Mentor, Resource Supplier, and Remedy Distributor. The associations among these components and multiple practitioners’ variables, including demographic and practice-related variables and theoretical orientation, were explored. These three components represent general dimensions of the psychotherapy relationship that cut across various theoretical orientations and, thus, define psychotherapy relationships in a general sense.",2020.0,52.0,3.0,"{'volume': '23', 'name': 'Research in Psychotherapy : Psychopathology, Process, and Outcome'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Řiháček2020FacetsOT,\n author = {T.

Two hundred and fifty effects of the experimental induction of positive, elated and negative, depressed mood in adult, non-clinical samples were integrated. Effect sizes were generally larger for negative than for positive mood inductions. The presentation of a film or story turned out to be most effective in inducing both positive and negative mood states. The effects are especially large when subjects are explicitly instructed to enter the specified mood state. For elated mood, all other MIPs yielded considerably lower effectiveness scores. For the induction of negative mood states, Imagination, Velten, Music, Social Interaction and Feedback MIPs were about as effective as the Film/Story MIP without instruction. Induction effects covaried with several study characteristics. Effects tend to be smaller when demand characteristics are controlled or subjects are not informed about the purpose of the experiment. For behavioural measures, effects are smaller than for self-reports but still larger than zero. Hence, the effects of MIPs can be partly, but not fully due to demand effects.",1996.0,56.0,1073.0,"{'volume': '26', 'pages': '557-580', 'name': 'European Journal of Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Westermann1996RelativeEA,\n author = {R.

The best instruments for early detection of cerebral palsy (CP) with or without intellectual disability are neonatal magnetic resonance imaging, general movements assessment at 2–4 months and from 2–4 months onwards, the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination and Standardized Infant NeuroDevelopmental Assessment. Early detection of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is difficult; its first signs emerge at the end of the first year. Prediction with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers and Infant Toddler Checklist is possible to some extent and improves during the second year, especially in children at familial risk of ASD. Thus, prediction improves substantially when transient brain structures have been replaced by permanent circuitries. At around 3 months the cortical subplate has dissolved in primary motor and sensory cortices; around 12 months the cortical subplate in prefrontal and parieto-temporal cortices and cerebellar external granular layer have disappeared. This review stresses that families are pivotal in early intervention. It summarizes evidence on the effectiveness of early intervention in medically fragile neonates, infants at low to moderate risk, infants with or at high risk of CP and with or at high risk of ASD.",2021.0,177.0,46.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Journal of Clinical Medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hadders‐Algra2021EarlyDA,\n author = {M.

We examined two emotion traits, emotional variability and emotional clarity, in relation to both categorical (diagnostic interview) and dimensional (self-report) measures of major depressive disorder (MDD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) in women diagnosed with MDD only (n = 35), SAD only (n = 31), MDD and SAD (n = 26) or no psychiatric disorder (n = 38). Results of the categorical analyses suggest that elevated emotional variability and diminished emotional clarity are transdiagnostic of MDD and SAD. More specifically, emotional variability was elevated for MDD and SAD diagnoses compared to no diagnosis, showing an additive effect for co-occurring MDD and SAD. Similarly diminished levels of emotional clarity characterised all three clinical groups compared to the healthy control group. Dimensional findings suggest that although emotional variability is associated more consistently with depression than with social anxiety, emotional clarity is associated more consistently with social anxiety than with depression.

Virtual worlds present a unique site for studying how ideas about children become embedded in the artifacts adults make for them. This article argues that children’s virtual worlds are fundamentally negotiated spaces in which broader aspirations and anxieties about children’s relationships with play, technology, consumer culture, and the public sphere resurface as “configurations” of an imagined, ideal child player. The article begins with a brief overview of the children's virtual worlds phenomenon, followed by a discussion of related research on children’s play and play technologies. Findings from a case study of six commercial, game-themed virtual worlds targeted specifically to children are then presented, with a focus on how these artifacts configure their child players in highly ideological and normative ways, wherein play is narrowly defined in accordance with a neoromantic, consumerist ethos.

To address these reoccurring issues, this article breaks down and recommends 10 steps to follow in the scale development process for researchers unfamiliar with the process. Furthermore, the present research makes a unique contribution by overviewing procedures scholars should employ to develop their dimensions and corresponding items.

 significantly from its theoretical basis, analytical studies and processing 
 technology to exploratory applications in a wide range of real-life domains. 
 This paper brings new insights in the field of emotional, intelligent 
 software agents. The first part is devoted to an overview of the 
 state-of-the-art in emotional intelligence research with emphasis on 
 emotional agents. A wide range of applications in different areas like 
 modeling emotional agents, aspects of learning in emotional environments, 
 interactive emotional systems and so on are presented. After that we suggest 
 a systematic order of research steps with the idea of proposing an adequate 
 framework for several possible real-life applications of emotional agents. We 
 recognize that it is necessary to apply specific methods for dynamic data 
 analysis in order to identify and discover new knowledge from available 
 emotional information and data sets. The last part of the paper discusses 
 research activities for designing an agent-based architecture, in which 
 agents are capable of reasoning about and displaying some kind of emotions 
 based on emotions detected in human speech, as well as online documents.

The utilization of mindfulness techniques has been associated with decreased anxiety and depression, but the underlying mechanisms for this is only beginning to be understood. Previous research with adult samples has suggested that the development of emotional intelligence (EI) may be one mechanism by which mindfulness confers its benefits on wellbeing. This study is the first to examine the relation between mindfulness, EI, anxiety, and depression in an adolescent population. It was hypothesized that EI would mediate the relationships between mindfulness and anxiety, as well as mindfulness and depression. The sample consisted of 108 adolescents from a public secondary school, aged between 13 and 15 years (Mage = 13.68, SDage = 0.56, 51 males and 57 females). Participants completed an online self-report questionnaire which measured dispositional mindfulness, EI, anxiety, and depression. The results indicated that one subscale of EI – Emotional Recognition and Expression (ERE) mediated the relation between mindfulness and anxiety, while two subscales of EI – ERE and Emotional Management and Control (EMC) mediated the relation between mindfulness and depression. Future research utilizing a mindfulness intervention should be conducted to examine whether the use of mindfulness increases EI and decreases anxiety and depression in adolescents.",2018.0,135.0,26.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Foster2018DoesEI,\n author = {B.

In a typical pottery making class, students receive the teacher’s instruction on the fundamental techniques used in pottery making and have opportunities to practice. It is meaningful to construct an observation-doing-reflection process for students in a pottery making class to promote their learning experience and performance. Therefore, in this study, a Virtual Reality (VR)-based pottery making approach was applied to technology education in a junior high school to examine its effects on students’ creativity and learning engagement. A total of 97 seventh graders from three classes participated in pottery making in class. One class of 34 students was assigned to be the experimental group learning with the VR-based approach, while the other two classes were assigned to be the control groups, with 30 students learning with the paper-and-pencil approach and 33 students with the clay-based approach. The results showed that the students learning with the VR-based approach were not only more creative in terms of their products, but also had higher cognitive engagement than those in the control groups. Moreover, the VR-based approach improved the students’ behavioral, emotional and social engagement compared to the paper-and-pencil approach.",2021.0,75.0,29.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '2016 - 2032', 'name': 'Interactive Learning Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Guan2021EffectsOA,\n author = {Jueqi Guan and Liangyan Wang and Qu Chen and Kai Jin and Gwo-jen Hwang},\n journal = {Interactive Learning Environments},\n pages = {2016 - 2032},\n title = {Effects of a virtual reality-based pottery making approach on junior high school students’ creativity and learning engagement},\n volume = {31},\n year = {2021}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2090331915', 'name': 'Jueqi Guan'}, {'authorId': '47735367', 'name': 'Liangyan Wang'}, {'authorId': '2109397639', 'name': 'Qu Chen'}, {'authorId': '2090420152', 'name': 'Kai Jin'}, {'authorId': '144217709', 'name': 'Gwo-jen Hwang'}]"

2023,acb670a61a292109fa827d81749432eb316dd0b6,Accountability of AI Under the Law: The Role of Explanation,"The ubiquity of systems using artificial intelligence or ""AI"" has brought increasing attention to how those systems should be regulated. The choice of how to regulate AI systems will require care. AI systems have the potential to synthesize large amounts of data, allowing for greater levels of personalization and precision than ever before|applications range from clinical decision support to autonomous driving and predictive policing. That said, common sense reasoning [McCarthy, 1960] remains one of the holy grails of AI, and there exist legitimate concerns about the intentional and unintentional negative consequences of AI systems [Bostrom, 2003, Amodei et al., 2016, Sculley et al., 2014]. 
 
There are many ways to hold AI systems accountable. In this work, we focus on one: explanation. Questions about a legal right to explanation from AI systems was recently debated in the EU General Data Protection Regulation [Goodman and Flaxman, 2016, Wachter et al., 2017], and thus thinking carefully about when and how explanation from AI systems might improve accountability is timely. Good choices about when to demand explanation can help prevent negative consequences from AI systems, while poor choices may not only fail to hold AI systems accountable but also hamper the development of much-needed beneficial AI systems. 
 
Below, we briefly review current societal, moral, and legal norms around explanation, and then focus on the different contexts under which explanation is currently required under the law. We find that there exists great variation around when explanation is demanded, but there also exists important consistencies: when demanding explanation from humans, what we typically want to know is how and whether certain input factors affected the final decision or outcome. 
 
These consistencies allow us to list the technical considerations that must be considered if we desired AI systems that could provide kinds of explanations that are currently required of humans under the law. Contrary to popular wisdom of AI systems as indecipherable black boxes, we find that this level of explanation should often be technically feasible but may sometimes be practically onerous|there are certain aspects of explanation that may be simple for humans to provide but challenging for AI systems, and vice versa. As an interdisciplinary team of legal scholars, computer scientists, and cognitive scientists, we recommend that for the present, AI systems can and should be held to a similar standard of explanation as humans currently are; in the future we may wish to hold an AI to a different standard.",2017.0,48.0,347.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1711.01134', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Doshi-Velez2017AccountabilityOA,\n author = {F.

Sentiment classification is used widely in applications like customer feedback analysis where robustness and correctness of results are critical. In this article, we highlight that prediction accuracy alone is not sufficient for assessing the performance of a sentiment classifier; it is also important that the classifier is not biased toward positive or negative polarity, thus distorting the distribution of positive and negative messages in the predictions. We propose a measure, called Polarity Bias Rate, for quantifying this bias in a sentiment classifier. Second, we present two methods for removing this bias in the predictions of unsupervised and supervised sentiment classifiers. Our first method, called Bias-Aware Thresholding (BAT), shifts the decision boundary to control the bias in the predictions. Motivated from cost-sensitive learning, BAT is easily applicable to both lexicon-based unsupervised and supervised classifiers. Our second method, called Balanced Logistic Regression (BLR) introduces a bias-remover constraint into the standard logistic regression model. BLR is an automatic bias-free supervised sentiment classifier. We evaluate our methods extensively on seven real-world datasets. The experiments involve two lexicon-based and two supervised sentiment classifiers and include evaluation on multiple train-test data sizes. The results show that bias is controlled effectively in predictions. Furthermore, prediction accuracy is also increased in many cases, thus enhancing the robustness of sentiment classification.",2019.0,28.0,19.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '1 - 21', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Iqbal2019BalancingPE,\n author = {Mohsin Iqbal and Asim Karim and F.

Since player experience is not well understood, correlations between self-reports from players and psychophysiological data may provide a quantitative understanding of this experience. Measurements of electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR) allow making inferences about player arousal (i.e., excitement) and are easy to deploy. This paper reports a case study on HR and EDA correlations with subjective gameplay experience, testing the feasibility of these measures in commercial game development contexts.

While considerable efforts have been made to enable talking with computer like people, how to integrate the emotional expressions into the audio-visual speech synthesis remains largely a problem. In this paper, we adopt the notion of Pleasure-Displeasure, Arousal-Nonarousal, and Dominance-Submissiveness (PAD) 3-D-emotional space, in which emotions can be described and quantified from three different dimensions. Based on this new definition, we propose a unified model for emotional speech conversion using Boosting-Gaussian mixture model (GMM), as well as a facial expression synthesis model. We further present an emotional audio-visual speech synthesis approach. Specifically, we take the text and the target PAD values as input, and employ the text-to-speech (TTS) engine to first generate the neutral speeches. Then the Boosting-GMM is used to convert the neutral speeches to emotional speeches, and the facial expression is synthesized simultaneously. Finally, the acoustic features of the emotional speech are used to modulate the facial expression in the audio-visual speech. We designed three objective and five subjective experiments to evaluate the performance of each model and the overall approach. Our experimental results on audio-visual emotional speech datasets show that the proposed approach can effectively and efficiently synthesize natural and expressive emotional audio-visual speeches. Analysis on the results also unveil that the mutually reinforcing relationship indeed exists between audio and video information.",2011.0,39.0,64.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '570-582', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jia2011EmotionalAS,\n author = {Jia Jia and Shen Zhang and Fanbo Meng and Yongxin Wang and Lianhong Cai},\n journal = {IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing},\n pages = {570-582},\n title = {Emotional Audio-Visual Speech Synthesis Based on PAD},\n volume = {19},\n year = {2011}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '144202060', 'name': 'Jia Jia'}, {'authorId': '2180849', 'name': 'Shen Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2086783767', 'name': 'Fanbo Meng'}, {'authorId': '2108799406', 'name': 'Yongxin Wang'}, {'authorId': '7239047', 'name': 'Lianhong Cai'}]"

2037,adef5156cea18fa9daddb5622d36acceca1d474b,The Internet of Toys: A Posthuman and Multimodal Analysis of Connected Play,"Background The study reported in this article focuses on an exploration of the role and nature of play in young children's use of toys that connect physical and digital domains. Purpose The purpose of the article is to explore the nature of the connections that are made in play that transverses physical and virtual domains. The article draws on posthuman theory to explain some of the complexity of the play that occurs in these contexts. Research Design The research took place in the United Kingdom, and the overall study consisted of four distinct stages: (a) A survey of 2,000 parents of children aged 0–5 years, focusing on children's access to and use of tablet apps; (b) case studies of preschool children's use of apps in six families; (c) observations of children aged 3–5 years in a school using apps; and (d) content and multimodal analysis of apps. The focus of this article is on (b), although some of the survey data from the first stage of the study are also shared to provide context. Data Collection and Analysis The focus for this article is the play of a three-year-old girl, Amy. In addition to ethnographic data constructed over a 2-month period (field notes, interviews, photographs, and films), Amy's mother collected data between the researchers’ visits by making films of her daughter's use of apps. Amy also collected data herself by wearing a GoPro chestcam. The data that inform the analysis in this article are from a film created by Amy (11:05 minutes) and a video filmed by Amy's mother (5.21 minutes). Data were both inductively analyzed using multimodal (inter)action analysis and deductively analyzed using a posthumanist approach. Findings Amy's play connected digital and nondigital components in complex ways. An app and related physical object that typify the Internet of Toys provided opportunities for Amy's play to take place across physical and digital domains, and the inorganic objects embedded in the electronic toy and related app were an important element of this play, shaping Amy's responses at times. However, Amy's play was not always determined by the design of the electronic objects, and she demonstrated agency within play episodes. There were multiple connections made across a variety of domains/ dimensions, which added to the complexity of the play. Conclusions/Recommendations Young children's play increasingly connects digital and nondigital domains, and posthumanist theories can enhance understanding of how connections across these time/spaces are made.",2017.0,50.0,62.0,"{'volume': '119', 'pages': '1 - 32', 'name': 'Teachers College Record: The Voice of Scholarship in Education'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Marsh2017TheIO,\n author = {J.

In earlier studies, we found different voice quality stimuli to be consistently associated with certain affective states. In these stimuli, as in typical human productions, the different voice qualities entailed differences in loudness. To examine the extent to which the loudness differences among these voice qualities might influence the affective coloring they impart, two experiments were conducted with the synthesized stimuli, in which loudness was systematically manipulated. Experiment 1 used stimuli with distinct voice quality features including intrinsic loudness variations and stimuli where voice quality (modal voice) was kept constant, but loudness was modified to match the non-modal qualities. If loudness is the principal determinant in affect cueing for different voice qualities, there should be little or no difference in the responses to the two sets of stimuli. In Experiment 2, the stimuli included distinct voice quality features but all had equal loudness to test the hypothesis that equalizing the perceived loudness of different voice quality stimuli will have relatively little impact on affective ratings. The results suggest that loudness variation on its own is relatively ineffective whereas variation in voice quality is essential to the expression of affect. In Experiment 1, stimuli incorporating distinct voice quality features consistently obtained higher ratings than the modal voice stimuli with varied loudness. In Experiment 2, non-modal voice quality stimuli proved potent in affect cueing even with loudness differences equalized. Although loudness per se does not seem to be the major determinant of perceived affect, it can contribute positively to affect cueing: when combined with a tense or modal voice quality, increased loudness can enhance signaling of high activation states.",2013.0,40.0,24.0,"{'volume': '4', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yanushevskaya2013VoiceQI,\n author = {Irena Yanushevskaya and C.

 Online social conversations have increasingly become the means to find and view information online. In contrast to traditional web surfing models, clicks from social media result from a series of endorsements subject to user memory, past behavior and intermittently divided attention. Understanding click dynamics allows us to leverage those facets to improve relevance, forecast traffic and better manage influence in information dissemination. Unfortunately, data on clicks – even in aggregate – remain proprietary and inaccessible to researchers and scientists in many disciplines. In our work, we aim to allow the study of clicks through a proxy, allowing analysts to fully study click dynamics on Twitter. We focus on the scope of a news content publisher with a large readership and a broad domain of topics. We validate one such proxy, clicks-per-follower (CPF), based on publicly accessible data. We develop a model to compute CPI from public data. We use this method to examine how sharing affects consumption on Twitter: our findings suggest that mass retweeting of a URL does not necessarily translate into a substantial increase in clicks.

Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein Penguin Books, 2009, 312 pp, ISBN 978-0-14-311526-7This book is best described formally as a general explanation of and advocacy for libertarian paternalism, a term coined by the authors in earlier publications. Informally, it is about how leaders, systems, organizations, and governments can nudge people to do the things the nudgers want and need done for the betterment of the nudgees, or of society. It is paternalism in the sense that ""it is legitimate for choice architects to try to influence people's behavior in order to make their lives longer, healthier, and better"", (p. 5) It is libertarian in that ""people should be free to do what they like - and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so"", (p. 5) The built-in possibility of opting out or making a different choice preserves freedom of choice even though people's behavior has been influenced by the nature of the presentation of the information or by the structure of the decisionmaking system. I had never heard of libertarian paternalism before reading this book, and I now find it fascinating.Written for a general audience, this book contains mostly social and behavioral science theory and models, but there is considerable discussion of structure and process that has roots in mathematical and quantitative modeling. One of the main applications of this social system is economic choice in investing, selecting and purchasing products and services, systems of taxes, banking (mortgages, borrowing, savings), and retirement systems. Other quantitative social choice systems discussed include environmental effects, health care plans, gambling, and organ donations. Softer issues that are also subject to a nudge-based approach are marriage, education, eating, drinking, smoking, influence, spread of information, and politics. There is something in this book for everyone.The basis for this libertarian paternalism concept is in the social theory called ""science of choice"", the study of the design and implementation of influence systems on various kinds of people. The terms Econs and Humans, are used to refer to people with either considerable or little rational decision-making talent, respectively. The various libertarian paternalism concepts and systems presented are tested and compared in light of these two types of people. Two foundational issues that this book has in common with another book, Network of Echoes: Imitation, Innovation and Invisible Leaders, that was also reviewed for this issue of the Journal are that 1 ) there are two modes of thinking (or components of the brain) - an automatic (intuitive) process and a reflective (rational) process and 2) the need for conformity and the desire for imitation are powerful forces in human behavior. …",2015.0,0.0,5680.0,"{'volume': '49', 'pages': '69', 'name': 'Mathematics and Computer Education'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Arney2015NudgeID,\n author = {Chris Arney},\n journal = {Mathematics and Computer Education},\n pages = {69},\n title = {Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness},\n volume = {49},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '3189820', 'name': 'Chris Arney'}]"

Second, because the immediate environment factors into cognition and behavior, socialization efforts should involve the modification of the environment for optimal effect.

Ever since the 19th century, experimental psychologists have attempted to understand and explain human emotion. Despite an extensive amount of research conducted by psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists over the past 150 years, researchers still cannot agree on the definition of emotion itself and have continued to try and devise ways to measure emotional states. In this paper, we provide an overview of the most prominent theories in emotional psychology (dating from the late 19th century to the present day), as well as a summary of a number of studies which attempt to measure certain aspects of emotion. This paper is organized chronologically; first with an analysis of various uni-modal studies, followed by a review of multi-modal research.

Prevalence of loneliness among the elderly is increasing as well as other associated factors that make it worse. in addition, loneliness has a negative impact on our quality of life, and mental and physical health. Moreover, the assessment and identification of loneliness among the elderly are slightly ignored by the health care providers. There is no specific tool to measure the level of loneliness among elderly in Malaysia health care settings. Moreover, by measuring the loneliness level for elderly will help them and health care providers to demonstrate the positive impact of their work on the way people feel about their relationships and connections. The aim of this study was to explore the level of loneliness among elderly in nursing homes using UCLA loneliness scale.A quantitative cross-sectional design conducted in nine nursing homes chosen by a stratified random sampling method in Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia.Eighty elderly was involved and self-modified questionnaire for sociodemographic data and UCLA loneliness scale that was used to measure the level of loneliness with internal consistency (coefficient α ranging from 0.89 to 0.94) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.73).The descriptive analysis, such as frequency and percentage and Chi-Square test was analyzed using the (SPSS) version 20. 75% of elderly felt very high loneliness while 25% felt moderately loneliness. These participants were mostly came from age-group 71-80s, female, Chinese, not schooling, already loss spouse and don’t have any jobs currently. About 58.8% suffered illnesses and 62.5% faced physical limitation. However, the overall result indicates that there was no association between socio-demographic factors and level of loneliness, but all elderly experienced loneliness either moderately or very high.Early detection and lonely screening are the first stage of primary prevention for elderly. It is very advisable to apply a simple tool, UCLA Loneliness Scale to measure the level of loneliness.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, yet concise, overview of the considerations and metrics required for partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis and result reporting. Preliminary considerations are summarized first, including reasons for choosing PLS-SEM, recommended sample size in selected contexts, distributional assumptions, use of secondary data, statistical power and the need for goodness-of-fit testing. Next, the metrics as well as the rules of thumb that should be applied to assess the PLS-SEM results are covered. Besides presenting established PLS-SEM evaluation criteria, the overview includes the following new guidelines: PLSpredict (i.e., a novel approach for assessing a model’s out-of-sample prediction), metrics for model comparisons, and several complementary methods for checking the results’ robustness.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper provides an overview of previously and recently proposed metrics as well as rules of thumb for evaluating the research results based on the application of PLS-SEM.


Findings
Most of the previously applied metrics for evaluating PLS-SEM results are still relevant. Nevertheless, scholars need to be knowledgeable about recently proposed metrics (e.g. model comparison criteria) and methods (e.g. endogeneity assessment, latent class analysis and PLSpredict), and when and how to apply them to extend their analyses.


Research limitations/implications
Methodological developments associated with PLS-SEM are rapidly emerging. The metrics reported in this paper are useful for current applications, but must always be up to date with the latest developments in the PLS-SEM method.


Originality/value
In light of more recent research and methodological developments in the PLS-SEM domain, guidelines for the method’s use need to be continuously extended and updated. This paper is the most current and comprehensive summary of the PLS-SEM method and the metrics applied to assess its solutions.

The authors suggest a conceptual model to account for these findings, arguing that the happiness-success link exists not only because success makes people happy, but also because positive affect engenders success. Three classes of evidence--crosssectional, longitudinal, and experimental--are documented to test their model. Relevant studies are described and their effect sizes combined meta-analytically. The results reveal that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes, as well as behaviors paralleling success. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that positive affect--the hallmark of well-being--may be the cause of many of the desirable characteristics, resources, and successes correlated with happiness.

This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines. Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs -- categories in disguise. After explaining the ""big three"" concepts of category theory -- categories, functors, and natural transformations -- the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with selected solutions. Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.",2014.0,0.0,205.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Spivak2014CategoryTF,\n author = {David I.

They examine two factor strength indices (the explained common variance and omega hierarchical) and several model fit indices (root mean square error of approximation, comparative fit index, and standardized root mean square residual). These statistics are compared in population correlation matrices determined by known bifactor structures that vary on the (a) relative strength of general and group factor loadings, (b) number of group factors, and (c) number of items or indicators. When fit with a unidimensional measurement model, the degree of structural coefficient bias depends strongly and inversely on explained common variance, but its effects are moderated by the percentage of correlations uncontaminated by multidimensionality, a statistic that rises combinatorially with the number of group factors. When the percentage of uncontaminated correlations is high, structural coefficients are relatively unbiased even when general factor strength is low relative to group factor strength. On the other hand, popular structural equation modeling fit indices such as comparative fit index or standardized root mean square residual routinely reject unidimensional measurement models even in contexts in which the structural coefficient bias is low. In general, such statistics cannot be used to predict the magnitude of structural coefficient bias.",2013.0,40.0,534.0,"{'volume': '73', 'pages': '26 - 5', 'name': 'Educational and Psychological Measurement'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Reise2013MultidimensionalityAS,\n author = {S.

On the basis of a new process conception of emotion regulation, we hypothesized that in low-intensity negative situations, people would show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by engagement reappraisal, which allows emotional processing. However, we expected people in high-intensity negative situations to show a relative preference to choose to regulate emotions by disengagement distraction, which blocks emotional processing at an early stage before it gathers force. In three experiments, we created emotional contexts that varied in intensity, using either emotional pictures (Experiments 1 and 2) or unpredictable electric stimulation (Experiment 3). In response to these emotional contexts, participants chose between using either reappraisal or distraction as an emotion-regulation strategy. Results in all experiments supported our hypothesis.

The TCAV algorithm achieves a degree of global interpretability for DNNs through human-defined concepts as explanations. This project introduces Robust TCAV, which builds on TCAV and experimentally determines best practices for this method. The objectives for Robust TCAV are 1) Making TCAV more consistent by reducing variance in the TCAV score distribution and 2) Increasing CAV and TCAV score resistance to perturbations. A difference of means method for CAV generation was determined to be the best practice to achieve both objectives. Many areas of the TCAV process are explored including CAV visualization in low dimensions, negative class selection, and activation perturbation in the direction of a CAV. Finally, a thresholding technique is considered to remove noise in TCAV scores.

They were compared with 30 matched normal developing adolescents who were recruited from mainstream schools at Tehran. All participants were evaluated using a facial emotion recognition task. The participants needed to recognize happy, sad, angry and neutral facial expressions The ANOVA was used to analyze the differences between the two groups in terms of emotion recognition variables. Results The patients with BD showed a significant deficit in recognizing emotions in general (p=.01) which was prominent in the angry faces. Their response time to recognize the facial expressions was longer compared to the normal individuals. This difference was significant in recognizing the happy and neutral faces (p<0.05).

Why does humor exist in the first place? Why do we spend so much of our time passing on amusing anecdotes, making wisecracks, watching The Simpsons? In Inside Jokes, Matthew Hurley, Daniel Dennett, and Reginald Adams offer an evolutionary and cognitive perspective. Humor, they propose, evolved out of a computational problem that arose when our long-ago ancestors were furnished with open-ended thinking. Mother Nature -- aka natural selection -- cannot just order the brain to find and fix all our time-pressured misleaps and near-misses. She has to bribe the brain with pleasure. So we find them funny.

2078,b16f8d47157098076e1a5b5cc8e7c70b0383ff53,Balancing long-term reinforcement and short-term inhibition,"Balancing Long-Term Reinforcement and Short-Term Inhibition Christian Lebiere (cl@cmu.edu) Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15208 USA Bradley J. Best (bjbest@adcogsys.com) Adaptive Cognitive Systems 1709 Alpine Ave, Boulder, CO 80304 USA Abstract The ability to imperfectly but robustly enumerate a set of alternatives manifests itself in many human activities. However, many cognitive models have fundamental difficulties with this task, which often leads to degenerate behavior. The primary source of this problem is the conflict between mechanisms of long-term reinforcement and the need for short-term inhibition of recent items. Our analysis of a pair of pervasive domains of human activity finds that the long-term reinforcement process is balanced by a short- term inhibition. We have implemented this empirical finding in a variation of the knowledge reinforcement equation of the ACT-R architecture. This new mechanism not only prevents degenerate behavior in memory retrieval, but also emerges as a source of the power law distribution observed in the environment, supporting the proposition that the power law distribution arises from the interaction of the environment and cognition itself. Keywords: Cognitive Architectures, Bayesian Learning, Human Memory, Power Law of Learning. Introduction A key aspect of many cognitive tasks, including planning and game playing, involves sequentially examining and evaluating a number of possible options. Many everyday tasks also have that characteristic, such as attempting to name all fifty states of the United States, or all members of one’s research group. Such enumeration is seldom exhaustive and unstructured. For instance, even (or especially) chess grandmasters seldom evaluate more than a few potential moves in any given position. Also, people’s ability to enumerate large sets of objects also tends to be limited to a small number of items before repetition sets in, unless they resort to domain-specific strategies (e.g., relying on geographical or alphabetical order to name the 50 states). However, as limited as this enumeration capacity might be, it also turns out to be highly pervasive and problematic for many current computational models of cognition. Many modern cognitive architectures and frameworks, unlike earlier models such as production systems (e.g., McDermott & Forgy, 1978), do not include explicit control mechanisms such as refraction, a mechanism that temporarily prevents the reapplication of a just-performed action, such as retrieving a specific piece of information. Even more problematic, some of those architectures, e.g., ACT-R (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998; Anderson et al., 2004), include mechanisms that reinforce a piece of information after it has been accessed, making it even more likely to be accessed in the future. Young (2003) has pointed out that the lack of refraction, together with those reinforcement mechanisms, can lead to pathological behaviors such as out-of-control looping where one piece of knowledge becomes so active that it is constantly retrieved at the expense of others. This problem has also occurred in even more serious form in the development of higher-level languages that include implicit or explicit retrieval loops for checking logical conditions often involving universal quantifiers (Jones, Crossman, Lebiere, & Best, 2006; Jones, Lebiere, & Crossman, 2007). Nested loops are particularly difficult to deal with because they invalidate many of the potential attempts to deal with the problem. Of course, this kind of processing is cognitively very difficult, and people certainly don't perform it perfectly or completely, but they usually manage to accomplish the task to some extent while avoiding the pathological behavior often exhibited by the cognitive models. While modelers can often prevent such behavior by carefully crafting their models to imbed clever strategies reflecting their meta-knowledge of the task, such knowledge engineering methods lack cognitive plausibility. They also contribute to the brittleness and lack of portability of cognitive models when they are transferred to real world situations that lack the predictability, static nature, constrained scale, and limited complexity of laboratory experiments. What is needed is an understanding of the human ability to enumerate a limited set of alternatives. Specifically, we need to analyze the environmental, cognitive and neural constraints that allow us to balance the long-term desire to reinforce more commonly accessed items to facilitate future retrievals together with the short-term need to avoid iterated retrievals that lead to looping behavior. These constraints, of course, must include those that come from observing human behavior. The constraints then need to be implemented in computational form that integrates with the other architectural mechanisms to provide the proper functional characteristics that allow the cognitive models to display the same robustness and adaptivity, as is commonly exhibited by human experimental participants, without recourse to constant engineering on the part of the modeler.",2009.0,21.0,17.0,"{'volume': '31', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Best2009BalancingLR,\n author = {B.

It also proposes a conception to institutionalize the rule of law, emphasizing that the alternative three-review mechanism is both necessary and feasible, in that a top-level design of judicial review can contribute to our strivings for judicial fairness, an implementation of budget review and accountability review at the grassroots level for fiscal democracy, and the synergy of high-level and grassroots powers for a virtuous circle between the rule of law authority and democratic polity in mutual enhancement.

2080,b1d1a60a5d4da0d0c680bb2a79e0821780f8cf07,Foundations for a theory of mind for a humanoid robot,"Human social dynamics rely upon the ability to correctly attribute beliefs, goals, and percepts to other people. The set of abilities that allow an individual to infer these hidden mental states based on observed actions and behavior has been called a “theory of mind” (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). Existing models of theory of mind have sought to identify a developmental progression of social skills that serve as the basis for more complex cognitive abilities. These skills include detecting eye contact, identifying self-propelled stimuli, and attributing intent to moving objects. 
If we are to build machines that interact naturally with people, our machines must both interpret the behavior of others according to these social rules and display the social cues that will allow people to naturally interpret the machine's behavior. 
Drawing from the models of Baron-Cohen (1995) and Leslie (1994), a novel architecture called embodied theory of mind was developed to link high-level cognitive skills to the low-level perceptual abilities of a humanoid robot. The implemented system determines visual saliency based on inherent object attributes, high-level task constraints, and the attentional states of others. Objects of interest are tracked in real-time to produce motion trajectories which are analyzed by a set of naive physical laws designed to discriminate animate from inanimate movement. Animate objects can be the source of attentional states (detected by finding faces and head orientation) as well as intentional states (determined by motion trajectories between objects). Individual components are evaluated by comparisons to human performance on similar tasks, and the complete system is evaluated in the context of a basic social learning mechanism that allows the robot to mimic observed movements.

Although this latter debate did not precisely turn out to be a triumph for Chibber, his book continues to be celebrated by many as a ‘death knell to Subaltern Studies and postcolonial theory’, as a liberation from the obscurity of its ‘jargon’, imbued with poststructuralism and postmodernism, and most notably as a long awaited reinstatement of the crystal-clear substantiveness of the Enlightenment and Marxism (Nigam 2013). The endorsements of no less than Robert Brenner, Noam Chomsky and Slavoj Žižek provide an authoritative seal in this regard.

But their decision-making processes are often opaque-it is difficult to explain why a certain decision was made. We develop a formal foundation to improve the transparency of such decision-making systems. Specifically, we introduce a family of Quantitative Input Influence (QII) measures that capture the degree of influence of inputs on outputs of systems. These measures provide a foundation for the design of transparency reports that accompany system decisions (e.g., explaining a specific credit decision) and for testing tools useful for internal and external oversight (e.g., to detect algorithmic discrimination). Distinctively, our causal QII measures carefully account for correlated inputs while measuring influence. They support a general class of transparency queries and can, in particular, explain decisions about individuals (e.g., a loan decision) and groups (e.g., disparate impact based on gender). Finally, since single inputs may not always have high influence, the QII measures also quantify the joint influence of a set of inputs (e.g., age and income) on outcomes (e.g. loan decisions) and the marginal influence of individual inputs within such a set (e.g., income). Since a single input may be part of multiple influential sets, the average marginal influence of the input is computed using principled aggregation measures, such as the Shapley value, previously applied to measure influence in voting. Further, since transparency reports could compromise privacy, we explore the transparency-privacy tradeoff and prove that a number of useful transparency reports can be made differentially private with very little addition of noise. Our empirical validation with standard machine learning algorithms demonstrates that QII measures are a useful transparency mechanism when black box access to the learning system is available. In particular, they provide better explanations than standard associative measures for a host of scenarios that we consider. Further, we show that in the situations we consider, QII is efficiently approximable and can be made differentially private while preserving accuracy.",2016.0,63.0,614.0,"{'pages': '598-617', 'name': '2016 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Datta2016AlgorithmicTV,\n author = {Anupam Datta and S.

They can be classified into four groups, the first of which has been devised for use on normal subjects. Patients suffering from mental disorders score very highly on some of the variables and these high scores serve as a measure of their illness. Such scales can be very useful, but have two defects: many symptoms are not found in normal persons; and less obviously, but more important, there is a qualitative difference between symptoms of mental illness and normal variations of behaviour. The difference between the two is not a philosophical problem but a biological one. There is always a loss of function in illness, with impaired efficiency. Self-rating scales are popular because they are easy to administer. Aside from the notorious unreliability of self-assessment, such scales are of little use for semiliterate patients and are no use for seriously ill patients who are unable to deal with them. Many rating scales for behaviour have been devised for assessing the social adjustment of patients and their behaviour in the hospital ward. They are very useful for their purpose but give little or no information about symptoms. Finally, a number of scales have been devised specifically for rating symptoms of mental illness. They cover the whole range of symptoms, but such all-inclusiveness has its disadvantages. In the first place, it is extremely difficult to differentiate some symptoms, e.g., apathy, retardation, stupor. These three look alike, but they are quite different and appear in different settings. Other symptoms are difficult to define, except in terms of their settings, e.g., mild agitation and derealization. A more serious difficulty lies in the fallacy of naming. For example, the term ""delusions"" covers schizophrenic, depressive, hypochrondriacal, and paranoid delusions. They are all quite different and should be clearly distinguished. Another difficulty may be summarized by saying that the weights given to symptoms should not be linear. Thus, in schizophrenia, the amount of anxiety is of no importance, whereas in anxiety states it is fundamental. Again, a schizophrenic patient who has delusions is not necessarily worse than one who has not, but a depressive patient who has, is much worse. Finally, although rating scales are not used for making a diagnosis, they should have some relation to it. Thus the schizophrenic patients should have a high score on schizophrenia and comparatively small scores on other syndromes. In practice, this does not occur. The present scale has been devised for use only on patients already diagnosed as suffering from affective disorder of depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The interviewer may, and should, use all information available to help him with his interview and in making the final assessment. The scale has undergone a number of changes since it was first tried out, and although there is room for further improvement, it will be found efficient and simple in use. It has been found to be of great practical value in assessing results of treatment.",1960.0,2.0,29961.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '56 - 62', 'name': 'Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hamilton1960ARS,\n author = {M.

Besides the rising number of cases and fatalities with this pandemic, there has also been significant socio-economic, political and psycho-social impact. Billions of people are quarantined in their own homes as nations have locked down to implement social distancing as a measure to contain the spread of infection. Those affected and suspicious cases are isolated. This social isolation leads to chronic loneliness and boredom, which if long enough can have detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being. The timelines of the growing pandemic being uncertain, the isolation is compounded by mass panic and anxiety. Crisis often affects the human mind in crucial ways, enhancing threat arousal and snowballing the anxiety. Rational and logical decisions are replaced by biased and faulty decisions based on mere ‘faith and belief’. This important social threat of a pandemic is largely neglected. We look at the impact of COVID-19 on loneliness across different social strata, its implications in the modern digitalized age and outline a way forward with possible solutions to the same. There is no doubt that national and global economies are suffering, the health systems are under severe pressure, mass hysteria has acquired a frantic pace and people’s hope and aspirations are taking a merciless beating. The uncertainty of a new and relatively unknown infection increases the anxiety, which gets compounded by isolation in lockdown. As global public health agencies like World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) struggle to contain the outbreak, social distancing is repeatedly suggested as one of the most useful preventive strategies. It has been used successfully in the past to slow or prevent community transmission during pandemics (WHO, 2019). While certain countries like China have just started recovering from their three-month lockdown, countries like Iran, Italy and South Korea have been badly hit irrespective of these measures and those like India have initiated nation-wide shutdown and curfews to prevent the community transmission of COVID-19. Ironically however, the social distancing is a misnomer, which implies physical separation to prevent the viral spread. The modern world has rarely been so isolated and restricted. Multiple restrictions have been imposed on public movement to contain the spread of the virus. People are forced to stay at home and are burdened with the heft of quarantine. Individuals are waking up every day wrapped in a freezing cauldron of social isolation, sheer boredom and a penetrating feeling of loneliness. The modern man has known little like this, in an age of rapid travel and communication. Though during the earlier outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Spanish flu, Ebola and Plague the world was equally shaken with millions of casualties, the dominance of technology was not as much as to make the distancing felt amplified (Smith, 2006). In this era of digitalization, social media, social hangouts, eateries, pubs, bars, malls, movie theatres to keep us distracted creating apparent ‘social ties’. Humankind has always known what to do next, with their lives generally following a regular trail. But this sudden cataclysmic turn of events have brought them face to face with a dire reckoning – how to live with oneself. It is indeed a frightening realization when a whole generation or two knows how to deal with a nuclear fallout but are at their wit’s end on how to spend time with oneself.

Therefore, it is important to use sports achievements in physical education of pupils and students in order to increase physical potential of the mankind. The research aims to theoretically justify and experimentally verify a pedagogical technology of training future teachers to organize school sport. Physical training can be considered effective if a relevant technology has been introduced. This technology should consist of the following pedagogical conditions: applying sports and physical education; conducting workshops (practice-oriented training); strengthening joint efforts of subject lecturers; organizing active forms of research activities; conducting systematic monitoring and evaluation; providing lecturers and students with educational and methodological literature. Methods: pedagogical observation, modelling, interviewing, diagnostic interviews, questionnaires, expert evaluation; pedagogical experiment; methods of mathematical statistics. Three experimental groups (56, 30, 27 respondents) and three control groups (55, 30, 29 respondents) were formed. The overall results obtained from control and experimental groups during the formative experiment show positive dynamics of changes in experimental groups. The formulated conclusions verify the research hypothesis that the proposed technology can significantly increase readiness of future teachers to organize school sport provided it has been introduced into practical activities of higher education institutions.",2020.0,21.0,48.0,{'name': 'Revista Romaneasca pentru Educatie Multidimensionala'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Maksymchuk2020TrainingFT,\n author = {B.

From the literature review, it is observed that when datasets used are a combination of the MR images having a very mild cognitive impairment and mild cognitive impairment, the performance of the classifier reduces. Because the features of this kind of MR image are difficult to distinguish from normal brain images. To solve this problem, the lossless feature extraction method along with the feature reduction method having a selection approach is suggested as a solution here. In this paper, the 12 directional, rotation invariant two-dimensional discrete-time continuous wavelet transform (R-DTCWT) and a genetic algorithm (GA) are used for feature selection and feature vector size reduction. The fuzzy neural network (FNN) which is suitable for pattern recognition is used here. The FNN with and without feature reduction is evaluated for identification of combinational dataset, shows satisfactory performance over an artificial neural network (ANN), probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifiers.

Self-compassion entails three main components: (a) self-kindness—being kind and understanding toward oneself in instances of pain or failure rather than being harshly self-critical, (b) common humanity—perceiving one's experiences as part of the larger human experience rather than seeing them as separating and isolating, and (c) mindfulness—holding painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness rather than over-identifying with them. Self-compassion is an emotionally positive self-attitude that should protect against the negative consequences of self-judgment, isolation, and rumination (such as depression). Because of its non-evaluative and interconnected nature, it should also counter the tendencies towards narcissism, self-centeredness, and downward social comparison that have been associated with attempts to maintain self-esteem. The relation of self-compassion to other psychological constructs is examined, its links to psychological functioning are explored, and potential group differences in self-compassion are discussed.",2003.0,134.0,3655.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '101 - 85', 'name': 'Self and Identity'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Neff2003SelfCompassionAA,\n author = {K.

An expression that came to the fore during the overhaul process of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)—even though it can also be found in other statutes under different acceptations. At its core it consists in endowing the regulated organisation that process personal data with increased responsibility for complying with data protection mandates. Such increased compliance duties are performed through risk management tools. It addresses this topic from various perspectives. In framing the risk-based approach as the latest model of a series of regulation models, the book provides an analysis of data protection law from the perspective of regulation theory as well as risk and risk management literatures, and their mutual interlinkages. Further, it provides an overview of the policy developments that led to the adoption of such an approach, which it discusses in the light of regulation theory. It also includes various discussions pertaining to the risk-based approach’s scope and meaning, to the way it has been uptaken in statutes including key provisions such as accountability and data protection impact assessments, or to its potential and limitations. Finally, it analyses how the risk-based approach can be implemented in practice by providing technical analyses of various data protection risk management methodologies.",2020.0,0.0,12.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Gellert2020TheRA,\n author = {R.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been the European Union (EU) regulation on the topic since 2018. Organizations that operate within the territorial scope of the GDPR are expected to be compliant; otherwise, they can get high fines, and their reputation can be damaged. Thus, GDPR compliance sets challenges for the design of information systems that must be tackled starting from the requirements level.Given the difficulties of translating regulations and the drawbacks of natural language requirements, modeling languages can help requirements engineers analyze data protection. Socio-Technical Security modeling language (STS-ml) is a security modeling method that has been already extended for modeling privacy issues such as personal data, data controllers and processors, and specifying the legal basis for data processing. However, information critical for complying with GDPR principles still lacks modeling support. This article presents a proposal for extending the STS-ml to address GDPR principles. We show the need for modeling data protection requirements for each GDPR principle through a working privacy case and propose a set of five lightweight but meaningful extensions for the method. The extended language is intended to help requirements engineering practitioners with privacy requirements with little additional effort while preventing significant fines for EU organizations.",2022.0,18.0,2.0,"{'pages': '238-234', 'name': '2022 IEEE 30th International Requirements Engineering Conference Workshops (REW)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ribalta2022SocioTechnicalMF,\n author = {Claudia Negri Ribalta and René Noël and Nicolas Herbaut and Óscar Pastor and C.

We test the common caricature of realism that justice is “what the judge ate for breakfast” in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges.

2123,b5344d0c1281b91c223837334ae20d457666ca20,Global AI Ethics: A Review of the Social Impacts and Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence,"The ethical implications and social impacts of artificial intelligence have become topics of compelling interest to industry, researchers in academia, and the public. However, current analyses of AI in a global context are biased toward perspectives held in the U.S., and limited by a lack of research, especially outside the U.S. and Western Europe. 
This article summarizes the key findings of a literature review of recent social science scholarship on the social impacts of AI and related technologies in five global regions. Our team of social science researchers reviewed more than 800 academic journal articles and monographs in over a dozen languages. 
Our review of the literature suggests that AI is likely to have markedly different social impacts depending on geographical setting. Likewise, perceptions and understandings of AI are likely to be profoundly shaped by local cultural and social context. 
Recent research in U.S. settings demonstrates that AI-driven technologies have a pattern of entrenching social divides and exacerbating social inequality, particularly among historically-marginalized groups. Our literature review indicates that this pattern exists on a global scale, and suggests that low- and middle-income countries may be more vulnerable to the negative social impacts of AI and less likely to benefit from the attendant gains. 
We call for rigorous ethnographic research to better understand the social impacts of AI around the world. Global, on-the-ground research is particularly critical to identify AI systems that may amplify social inequality in order to mitigate potential harms. Deeper understanding of the social impacts of AI in diverse social settings is a necessary precursor to the development, implementation, and monitoring of responsible and beneficial AI technologies, and forms the basis for meaningful regulation of these technologies.",2019.0,131.0,48.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1907.07892', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Hagerty2019GlobalAE,\n author = {Alexa Hagerty and I.

AIs will perform complex tasks, occupy jobs traditionally performed by humans, develop groundbreaking inventions, provide familial comfort, and even offer sexual companionship. In part because the versatility of AI makes it suited to perform so many disparate roles, policymakers will need to confront the question of legal status: what are AI in the eyes of the law? Are they mere property? Are they “people” too? Are they something in between? 
This Article takes a first step in answering that question by analogizing AI to another form of sentient property: nonhuman animals. Four centuries of domestic animal rights law offer critical insights into the legal values that AI regulations ought to protect. These include protection of AIs as property (including allocation of responsibility for damage done by AIs); protecting human emotional attachments to companion and romantic AIs; limiting extreme antisocial behavior involving AIs—such as the realistic torture of physically embodied AIs—because of the psychologically harmful consequences it has for humans; and potentially protecting the AIs as intrinsically valuable. These values can be protected by a number of regulatory regimes that have analogously emerged in reaction to animal rights concerns, including anticruelty legislation, private ordering for leased AIs, federal administrative oversight, public nuisance litigation, and research or grant conditions. The practical lessons of animal rights law avoid unhelpfully abstract theorizing and offer a realistic model for regulation of artificial intelligence in the twenty-first century.",2018.0,0.0,5.0,{'name': 'Animal Law eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Chessman2018NotQH,\n author = {Christian F.

Die mimische Expression grundlegender Emotionen ist über verschiedene Kulturen hinweg sehr ähnlich und du weist auch Gemeinsamkeiten zu anderen Säugetieren auf. Dies deutet auf einen gemeinsamen genetischen Ursprung des Zusammenhangs von Mimik und Emotion. Neuere Untersuchungen zeigen aber auch kulturelle Einflüsse und Unterschiede. Die Erkennung von Emotionen aus der Mimik und auch der Prozess des mimischen Ausdrucks der eigenen Emotionen erfolgt in einem äußerst komplexen zerebralen Netzwerk. Aufgrund der Komplexität des zerebralen Verarbeitungssystems gibt es eine Vielzahl von neurologischen und psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, welche die Kopplung von Mimik und Emotionen erheblich stören können. Auch durch das Tragen von Masken wird unsere Fähigkeit zur Übermittlung und zum Erkennen von Emotionen über die Mimik eingeschränkt. Durch die Mimik lassen sich aber nicht nur „echte“ Emotionen ausdrücken, sondern auch gespielte. Damit eröffnet die Mimik die Möglichkeit sozial erwünschten Ausdruck vorzuspielen und auch Emotionen bewusst vorzutäuschen. Diese Täuschungen sind jedoch zumeist nicht perfekt und können von kurzfristigen Gesichtsbewegungen begleitet sein, die auf die tatsächlich vorhandenen Emotionen hinweisen (Mikroexpressionen). Diese Mikroexpressionen sind von nur sehr kurzer Dauer und vom Menschen häufig kaum wahrnehmbar, jedoch das ideale Anwendungsgebiet für computergestützte Analysen. Diese automatische Identifikation von Mikroexpressionen hat in den letzten Jahren nicht nur wissenschaftliche Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, sondern ihr Einsatz wird auch in sicherheitsrelevanten Bereichen getestet. Der vorliegende Artikel fasst den aktuellen Wissensstand von Mimik und Emotionen zusammen. ABSTRACT Human facial expressions are unique in their ability to express our emotions and communicate them to others. The mimic expression of basic emotions is very similar across different cultures and has also many features in common with other mammals. This suggests a common genetic origin of the association between facial expressions and emotion. However, recent studies also show cultural influences and differences. The recognition of emotions from facial expressions, as well as the process of expressing one’s emotions facially, occurs within an extremely complex cerebral network. Due to the complexity of the cerebral processing system, there are a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders that can significantly disrupt the coupling of facial expressions and emotions. Wearing masks also limits our ability to convey and recognize emotions through facial expressions. Through facial expressions, however, not only “real” emotions can be expressed, but also acted ones. Thus, facial expressions open up the possibility of faking socially desired expressions and also of consciously faking emotions. However, these pretenses are mostly imperfect and can be accompanied by short-term facial movements that indicate the emotions that are actually present (microexpressions). These microexpressions are of very short duration and often barely perceptible by humans, but they are the ideal application area for computer-aided analysis. This automatic identification of microexpressions has not only received scientific attention in recent years, but its use is also being tested in security-related areas. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge of facial expressions and emotions.",2023.0,131.0,1359.0,"{'volume': '102', 'pages': 'S115 - S125', 'name': 'Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Klingner2023FacialEA,\n author = {C.

2131,b5cb222136331144f47c4fbb8e2d7de8da612804,Emotional intelligence predicts academic performance: A meta-analysis.,"Schools and universities devote considerable time and resources to developing students' social and emotional skills, such as emotional intelligence (EI). The goals of such programs are partly for personal development but partly to increase academic performance. The current meta-analysis examines the degree to which student EI is associated with academic performance. We found an overall effect of ρ = .20 using robust variance estimation (N = 42,529, k = 1,246 from 158 citations). The association is significantly stronger for ability EI (ρ = .24, k = 50) compared with self-rated (ρ = .12, k = 33) or mixed EI (ρ = .19, k = 90). Ability, self-rated, and mixed EI explained an additional 1.7%, 0.7%, and 2.3% of the variance, respectively, after controlling for intelligence and big five personality. Understanding and management branches of ability EI explained an additional 3.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Relative importance analysis suggests that EI is the third most important predictor for all three streams, after intelligence and conscientiousness. Moderators of the effect differed across the three EI streams. Ability EI was a stronger predictor of performance in humanities than science. Self-rated EI was a stronger predictor of grades than standardized test scores. We propose that three mechanisms underlie the EI/academic performance link: (a) regulating academic emotions, (b) building social relationships at school, and (c) academic content overlap with EI. Different streams of EI may affect performance through different mechanisms. We note some limitations, including the lack of evidence for a causal direction.

Material: 304 schoolchildren (148 boys and 156 girls), seventh-graders from the general education school No 20 in Lutsk, participated in the formative pedagogical experiment. The control group consisted of 99 boys and 105 girls and the experimental group – 49 boys and 51 girls, who were classified into the main medical group for health reasons and were not involved in sports sections. Results: It was found that schoolchildren with different levels of biological development within one age-sex group differ significantly in terms of the cardiorespiratory system capacity, physical performance and physical fitness. Therefore, the authors designed the methodology for allocating educational time to develop motor skills of seventh-graders during physical education lessons depending on paces of their biological development under the conditions of three physical education lessons per week. Conclusions: this methodology of differentiated approach to allocating educational time to develop motor skills of seventh-graders is an effective means for differentiated physical education of adolescents, which is reflected in the increase in the level of physical fitness and performance in seventh-graders during the pedagogical experiment.",2019.0,114.0,61.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Sitovskyi2019DifferentiatedAT,\n author = {A.

2141,b66680f740cdc9917e7ead8bd72297b7e06aa925,Multimodal Score: an ANVIL based Annotation scheme for multimodal audio-video analysis,"1 Part of this work has been sponsored by COMMEDIA (COMunicazione Multimodale di Emozioni e Discorso in Italiano con Agente animato virtuale, CNR Project C00AA71), PF-STAR (Preparing Future multiSensorial inTerAction Research, European Project IST2001-37599, http://pfstar.itc.it ) and MIUR-FIRB Nuove tecnologie per la formazione permanente e reti nel sistema socioeconomico italiano project (MIUR-FIRB RBNE01MRXA_003). Introduction Face-to-face communication is multimodal: we communicate with voice, face, eyes, hand, body. But just a little part of these communicative instruments have been studied thoroughly: while Linguistics, since 2000 years, has studied the rules that govern verbal behaviour, not so much has been done for all other modalities. Instead, to fully understand human multimodal communication, our task would be to write down the “lexicon” and the “alphabet” of nonverbal signals (Poggi, 2001): that is, on the one hand, to find out the systematic correspondences between signals and meanings in each mode-specific communication system; on the other hand, to single out all the minimal elements that compose all signals in each communication system. To discover the elements and the rules that make up communication systems, as well as the rules of their simultaneous and sequential combination with each other, is a useful thing for both theoretical purposes and practical applications, such as, among others, the construction of Embodied Agents (Cassell et. al. 2000). But to do so, it is necessary to analyse corpora of Multimodal Communication by using precise methods of segmentation, transcription, and annotation of signals in the different modalities. In a sense, this is a somehow circular endeavour. Our first task is to construct the alphabet and the lexicon of a communication system – for instance, to find out the correspondences between particular patterns of gaze signals and their particular meanings; to discover these correspondences it is necessary to analyse numerous items of gaze, and to this goal you must use a procedure for this analysis. But once an alphabet or a lexicon is singled out, it would be much easier and clearer how to analyse further corpora, to such an extent that it could sometime be possible to provide a tool for automatic analysis of Multimodal Communication. This is why the construction of tools for the analysis and annotation of multimodal data is an endless job. In the last ten years, several tools have been proposed for this task: for example, Martin et al. (2001), Kipp (2001), Ingenhoff and Schmitz (2003) and Annual Reports of ISLE and NITE EU Projects. In this paper we present the multimodale Score implemented in ANVIL, a system for the annotation of multimodal data, which is characterized by the attention to the semantic aspect of corpora annotation and by an effort to find out, in the long run, a systematic correspondence between (aspect of the) signals and (aspect of the) meanings in order to exploit these results in future automatic annotation. To better illustrate the potentialities of Multimodal Score implemented in ANVIL we present some examples that show how it can be use in assessing the relationship of speech with gesture and visual prosody, of mouth movements with Sign language and the laying out of emotions and attitudes over speech.",2004.0,14.0,21.0,"{'volume': '', 'pages': '1-6', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Emanuela2004MultimodalSA,\n author = {M.

Conceptually, emotional intelligence should be related to students’ life satisfaction, positive attitudes towards life, and the attainment of various education goals. However, despite its growing popularity, there is relatively little empirical evidence showing these relationships. The purpose of the present study is to provide some empirical evidence to examine these effects in Hong Kong. A group of 30 university students helped generate emotional intelligence items and 20 of these items were selected empirically from the responses of another 100 university students. Then a sample of 225 six formers completed a questionnaire which measured their perceived emotional intelligence, life satisfaction, and powerlessness in their lives. Their form masters evaluated their performance in moral and social development. Attainment in intellectual education of these students was estimated by their HKCEE results. As expected, results indicated that emotional intelligence is positively related to life satisfaction, and performance in moral, social and intellectual development. It is also negatively related to powerlessness in life.

The uneven maturation of the limbic system and prefrontal cortex structures, characteristic of adolescence, provokes a decrease in subjective control and self-regulation, increased impulsivity, and emotional instability. Qualitative and quantitative morphometric changes in the brain of adolescents can cause behavioral problems, impaired control and self-regulation, a sharp change in areas of cognitive interests, the inability to understand themselves and explain their actions. These features are a predictor of the successful socialization of adolescents. Socialization is seen as a process in which the adolescent acquires the skills necessary for his entire existence in society. Psychophysiological changes in his body determine the nature and characteristics of socialization, relationships with others, the nature of actions, and social contacts. An important feature that promotes the adaptive socialization of adolescents is assertiveness. Assertiveness as personal property of behavior primarily involves the development of confidence, determination, perseverance, self-esteem, empathy, communication skills. The formation of assertive behavior significantly increases the adaptation processes of adolescents, normalizes the emotional sphere, has a positive effect on socialization, and sets the vector of social success, self-actualization, and self-realization.",2022.0,57.0,1.0,{'name': 'BRAIN.

To achieve this goal, analytical and numerical methods from evolutionary game theory are employed to identify the conditions for which enhanced cooperation emerges within the context of the iterated prisoners dilemma. Guilt is modelled explicitly as two features, i.e. a counter that keeps track of the number of transgressions and a threshold that dictates when alleviation (through for instance apology and self-punishment) is required for an emotional agent. Such an alleviation introduces an effect on the payoff of the agent experiencing guilt. We show that when the system consists of agents that resolve their guilt without considering the co-player's attitude towards guilt alleviation then cooperation does not emerge. In that case those guilt prone agents are easily dominated by agents expressing no guilt or having no incentive to alleviate the guilt they experience. When, on the other hand, the guilt prone focal agent requires that guilt only needs to be alleviated when guilt alleviation is also manifested by a defecting co-player, then cooperation may thrive. This observation remains consistent for a generalised model as is discussed in this article. In summary, our analysis provides important insights into the design of multi-agent and cognitive agent systems where the inclusion of guilt modelling can improve agents' cooperative behaviour and overall benefit.",2017.0,50.0,32.0,{'pages': '1422-1430'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Pereira2017SocialMO,\n author = {L.

2151,b7a34899b28f64ded7642087c9255d398c60c1dd,Liberty in Health Care: A Comparative Study Between Hong Kong and Mainland China.,"This essay contends that individual liberty, understood as the permissibility of making choices about one's own health care in support of one's own good and the good of one's family utilizing private resources, is central to the moral foundations of a health care system. Such individual freedoms are important not only because they often support more efficient and effective health care services, but because they permit individuals to fulfill important moral duties. A comparative study of the health care systems in Hong Kong and mainland China is utilized to illustrate the conceptual and moral concerns at stake. Both regions have implemented two-tier health care systems with a public tier of basic health care services together with a second tier of privately purchased health care. As we document, Hong Kong permits patients and doctors significantly greater opportunities to choose private health care of typically higher medical quality than their mainland counterparts. As a result, individuals are able to obtain higher quality health care while also fulfilling important moral duties for themselves and their families. In this sense, Hong Kong's health care system is morally superior to mainland China's. In each case, Confucianism's concerns regarding equality are partly satisfied through the provision of public health care services on the basic tier, while appropriate use of private resources in support of oneself and one's family is permissibly exercised on the private tier. Although it is true that inequalities in health care access and outcome are inevitable within a system that permits such individual freedoms, we argue that such inequalities are morally justifiable in terms of Confucian ethical thought.",2017.0,66.0,5.0,"{'volume': '42 6', 'pages': '\n          690-719\n        ', 'name': 'The Journal of medicine and philosophy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wu2017LibertyIH,\n author = {Jingxian Wu and Y.

2154,b7bdf9c95142dd1d1306073928131944ffae4747,Autonomic and brain responses associated with empathy deficits in autism spectrum disorder,"Accumulating evidence suggests that autonomic signals and their cortical representations are closely linked to emotional processes, and that related abnormalities could lead to social deficits. Although socio‐emotional impairments are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), empirical evidence directly supporting the link between autonomic, cortical, and socio‐emotional abnormalities in ASD is still lacking. In this study, we examined autonomic arousal indexed by skin conductance responses (SCR), concurrent cortical responses measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and effective brain connectivity estimated by dynamic causal modeling in seventeen unmedicated high‐functioning adults with ASD and seventeen matched controls while they performed an empathy‐for‐pain task. Compared to controls, adults with ASD showed enhanced SCR related to empathetic pain, along with increased neural activity in the anterior insular cortex, although their behavioral empathetic pain discriminability was reduced and overall SCR was decreased. ASD individuals also showed enhanced correlation between SCR and neural activities in the anterior insular cortex. Importantly, significant group differences in effective brain connectivity were limited to greater reduction in the negative intrinsic connectivity of the anterior insular cortex in the ASD group, indicating a failure in attenuating anterior insular responses to empathetic pain. These results suggest that aberrant interoceptive precision, as indexed by abnormalities in autonomic activity and its central representations, may underlie empathy deficits in ASD.

These parameters are described both in general and in detail for a range of specific emotions.

Design: A mixed-methods approach consisting of a single group, before and after quasi-experimental design, and individual interview. Participants: Twenty older adults with depression from four LTC facilities in Taiwan were recruited. Intervention: Each participant participated in 8 weeks of observation and 8 weeks of intervention. In the observation stage, participants received usual care or activities without any research intervention. In the intervention stage, each participant was given a Paro (Personal Assistive RobOt) to keep for 24 hours, 7 days a week. Measurements: The Geriatric Depression Scale, the UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire for older adults were administered at four time points. Individual qualitative interviews with thematic analysis followed. Results: A repeated multivariate analysis of variance and Friedmanʼs test showed no significant changes during the observation stage between T1 and T2 for depression and quality of life (p >.5). For the intervention stage, statistically significant changes in decreasing depression and loneliness and improving quality of life over time were identified. Three themes emerged from the interviews: (i) humanizing Paro through referring to personal experiences and engagement; (ii) increased social interaction with other people; and (iii) companionship resulting in improved mental well-being. Conclusions: There were significant improvements in mental well-being in using Paro. Further research may help us to understand the advantages of using a Paro intervention as depression therapy.",2020.0,56.0,41.0,"{'volume': '32', 'pages': '981 - 991', 'name': 'International Psychogeriatrics'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chen2020ASR,\n author = {Shu-Chuan Chen and W.

The dramatic proliferation of coping research has spawned healthy debate and criticism and offered insight into the question of why some individuals fare better than others do when encountering stress in their lives. We briefly review the history of contemporary coping research with adults. We discuss three primary challenges for coping researchers (measurement, nomenclature, and effectiveness), and highlight recent developments in coping theory and research that hold promise for the field, including previously unaddressed aspects of coping, new measurement approaches, and focus on positive affective outcomes.",2004.0,132.0,2789.0,"{'volume': '55', 'pages': '\n          745-74\n        ', 'name': 'Annual review of psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Folkman2004CopingPA,\n author = {S.

In this paper, we introduce data recombination, a novel framework for injecting such prior knowledge into a model. From the training data, we induce a high-precision synchronous context-free grammar, which captures important conditional independence properties commonly found in semantic parsing. We then train a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network (RNN) model with a novel attention-based copying mechanism on datapoints sampled from this grammar, thereby teaching the model about these structural properties.

In particular, it is unclear what it means to be interpretable and how to select, evaluate, or even discuss methods for producing interpretations of machine-learning models. We aim to clarify these concerns by defining interpretable machine learning and constructing a unifying framework for existing methods which highlights the underappreciated role played by human audiences. Within this framework, methods are organized into 2 classes: model based and post hoc. To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work. Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.",2019.0,113.0,953.0,"{'volume': '116', 'pages': '22071 - 22080', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Murdoch2019DefinitionsMA,\n author = {W.

In the current study we aimed to examine effects of frustration on brain activity while performing a well-learned task in participants with low and high tolerance for arousal. Prior to the functional magnetic resonance imaging session, the subjects underwent 2 weeks of Braille reading training. Frustration induction was obtained by using a novel highly difficult tactile task based on discrimination of Braille-like raised dots patterns and negative feedback. Effectiveness of this procedure has been confirmed in a pilot study using galvanic skin response and questionnaires. Brain activation pattern during tactile discrimination task before and after frustration were compared directly. Results revealed changes in brain activity in structures mostly reported in acute stress studies: striatum, cingulate cortex, insula, middle frontal gyrus and precuneus and in structures engaged in tactile Braille discrimination: SI and SII. Temperament type affected activation pattern. Subjects with low tolerance for arousal showed higher activation in the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule than high reactivity group. Even though performance in the discrimination trials following frustration was unaltered, we observed increased activity of primary and secondary somatosensory cortex processing the tactile information.

To address such variation, we focused on cognitive reappraisal and considered the effects of goals (i.e., what people are trying to achieve) and tactics (i.e., what people actually do) on outcomes (i.e., how affective responses change). To examine goals, we randomly assigned participants to either increase positive emotion or decrease negative emotion to a negative stimulus. To examine tactics, we categorized participants' reports of how they reappraised. To examine reappraisal outcomes, we measured experience and electrodermal responding. Findings indicated that (a) the goal of increasing positive emotion led to greater increases in positive affect and smaller decreases in skin conductance than the goal of decreasing negative emotion, and (b) use of the reality challenge tactic was associated with smaller increases in positive affect during reappraisal. These findings suggest that reappraisal can be implemented in the service of different emotion goals, using different tactics. Such differences are associated with different outcomes, and they should be considered in future research and applied attempts to maximize reappraisal success. Researchers have identified many types of emotion regulation strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression; Gross & Thompson, 2007). Contrasting these strategies has led to important insights about differences among emotion regulatory but has deemphasized the variability that exists within any given strategy, such as those occasioned by differing goals (i.e., what people are trying to achieve) or tactics (i.e., what people actually do). One promising target for examining within-strategy variation is cognitive reappraisal, which refers to altering emotions by changing the way one thinks. Successful reappraisal influences many aspects of emotional responding, including self-reported negative has been notable variation in reappraisal success across studies. For example, reappraisal may be impaired in those with depression Zaldivar, 2009). Variability in these findings may be due to the relative freedom that participants are given to enact reappraisal. Two potentially important sources of variation are (a) the emotion goals pursued during reappraisal and (b) the specific tactics used to reappraise. Studies of unrestricted reappraisal indicate that there may be two different emotion goals that lead to successfully regulated negative emotion (McRae et al. One route may involve the up-regulation of positive emotion (implicated neurally by activation in the ventral striatum), and the other may involve the down regulation of negative emotion (implicated by decreased activation in the amygdala and …",,23.0,300.0,,"{'bibtex': '@Misc{None,\n author = {Kateri McRae and Bethany G.

The results permit two main conclusions. First, environmental behavior depends on personal and situational variables in an interactive way. Second, when high conflict level is generated between personal dispositions and situational conditions, the predictive power of attitudes tends to be minimal, whereas in the case of consistency between them it tends to be maximal. The influence of situational variables was found to depend on the environmental action considered.

2181,b9ed5991d696a52af1cb08ea1c10f68943b4c384,The Law and Ethics of High-Frequency Trading,"Michael Lewis’s recent book FLASH BOYS has resurrected the controversy concerning “high-frequency trading” (HFT) in the stock markets. While HFT has been important in the stock markets for about a decade, and may have already peaked in terms of its economic significance, it touched a nerve with a public suspicious of financial institutions in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008-2009. In reality, HFT is not one thing, but a wide array of practices conducted by technologically adept electronic traders. Some of these practices are benign, and some even bring benefits such as liquidity and improved price discovery to financial markets. On the other hand, there are legitimate grounds for the commonly heard complaint that “HFT is not fair.” Certain HFT practices such as co-location, flash orders, and enriched data feeds create a two-tiered financial marketplace, while other practices such as momentum ignition, spoofing, and layering are merely high-tech versions of traditional market manipulation. Finally, the creation of special order types such as “Hide Not Slide” shows the exchanges allowing their HFT clients to jump the queue of price-time priority embedded in Regulation NMS and stock market practice. While the commonly-used technique of a cost-benefit analysis leads to equivocal or indeterminate results when applied to HFT trading activity in complex and often opaque markets, a more basic ethic of fairness grounded in commonly accepted rules of financial market behavior illustrates that certain HFT practices are indeed unfair. This Article draws on the legal, finance, and business ethics literature to illustrate exactly how certain forms of HFT are unfair, and proposes four core principles to guide HFT activity and its regulation.",2016.0,60.0,9.0,{'name': 'Regulation of Financial Institutions eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{McNamara2016TheLA,\n author = {Steven McNamara},\n journal = {Regulation of Financial Institutions eJournal},\n title = {The Law and Ethics of High-Frequency Trading},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '118628382', 'name': 'Steven McNamara'}]"

In this paper we present the Distributional Correspondence Indexing (DCI) method for domain adaptation in sentiment classification. DCI derives term representations in a vector space common to both domains where each dimension re ects its distributional correspondence to a pivot, i.e., to a highly predictive term that behaves similarly across domains. Term correspondence is quantified by means of a distributional correspondence function (DCF). We propose a number of efficient DCFs that are motivated by the distributional hypothesis, i.e., the hypothesis according to which terms with similar meaning tend to have similar distributions in text. Experiments show that DCI obtains better performance than current state-of-the-art techniques for cross-lingual and cross-domain sentiment classification. DCI also brings about a significantly reduced computational cost, and requires a smaller amount of human intervention. As a final contribution, we discuss a more challenging formulation of the domain adaptation problem, in which both the cross-domain and cross-lingual dimensions are tackled simultaneously.",2017.0,54.0,45.0,"{'volume': '55', 'pages': '131-163', 'name': 'J.

The static-dynamic dimension is viewed as the degree to which these factors in the decision unit's environment remain basically the same over time or are in a continual process of change. Results indicate that individuals in decision units with dynamic-complex environments experience the greatest amount of uncertainty in decision making.

In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground. According to a process model of emotion regulation, emotion may be regulated at five points in the emotion generative process: (a) selection of the situation, (b) modification of the situation, (c) deployment of attention, (d) change of cognitions, and (e) modulation of responses.

Silva (mariana.silva@ucl.ac.uk) & Anna L. Cox (anna.cox@ucl.ac.uk) UCL Interaction Centre, Department of Psychology 31/32 Alfred Place, London, WC1E 7DP, UK Keywords: Eye movements, eye tracking applications, cognition, interaction. Workshop format Abstract Tracking people’s eye movements has allowed researchers to draw conclusions about cognitive processing based on the characteristics of people’s gaze pattern. Furthermore, interactive eye tracking has allowed researchers to use eye movements as a form of communication between observers and interfaces. This workshop aims to gather researchers who use this tool and are interested in discussing the accomplishments made with eye tracking rather than the problems associated with it. An additional outcome of the workshop is to establish the future directions of eye-movement research. Introduction Eye tracking has long been used to investigate a variety of issues in cognitive science. This has been facilitated by the increasing availability, reliability and affordability of eye tracking systems. Eye movements are selective, accurate and sophisticated [1] and are highly dependent on cognitive motivations [2]. Thus, eye tracking provides sensitive, unconscious and replicable measure of ongoing cognitive processing. Eye tracking has been in a wide range of areas such as scene perception [3], visual search [4], reading [5], driving [6], speech-directed eye movements [7], and interactive eye tracking [8]. More recently, the use of eye tracking has been driven by commercial interest and used to assist in interface design and usability testing. This workshop will examine a variety of findings in research using eye tracking, establish the key role of eye tracking in current research, and explore future developments in the use of this tool. Aims and motivation This workshop is aimed at gathering a number of eye tracking experts to discuss the achievements of using such a tool rather than exploring its weaknesses or any outstanding issues. Prominent eye-movement researchers will lead the morning talks and share their experience on how eye tracking has provided answers in a variety of topics. The main goal of this workshop is to collectively review eye tracking research across many areas, identify its strengths and best practice and provide ideas for future research. This will be a full day workshop divided into two sessions. In the morning session, keynote speakers will give a talk covering their work, experience and any ongoing and future projects involving eye tracking. The afternoon session will involve interactive group discussions. Position papers submitted by workshop participants will be hosted in the workshop website and submitted to an appropriate publication. Intended audience This workshop is open to researchers in all areas using eye- movement tracking. This includes cognitive psychologists and scientists, vision experts, human factors and ergonomics experts, computer scientists, interaction design researchers, advertising experts, etc. Organizers and program committee Mariana M.

The prediction was satisfied, demonstrating directional fractionation and situational stereotypy. Tonic levels changed significantly during the experiment and also showed directional fractionation. A few individuals and stimuli, however, yielded reliable pupillary constriction, demonstrating intra-stressor stereotypy. Four factors characterized the ratings, two of which were associated with the autonomic responses. Pupillary dilatation and cardiac slowing increased as the Attention-Interest value increased. Pupillary dilatation was greatest to pictures midway on the Pleasantness-Evaluation factor, and greater to unpleasant than to pleasant stimuli. Cardiac slowing was linearly related to pleasantness, with unpleasant stimuli provoking the greatest slowing. The two responses were correlated less than measurement reliability would have allowed, demonstrating quantitative dissociation. When base-corrected scores were used the correlations again were low and highly variable among subjects and stimuli, even in direction.",1973.0,36.0,264.0,"{'volume': '10 3', 'pages': '\n          270-94\n        ', 'name': 'Psychophysiology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Libby1973PupillaryAC,\n author = {W.

Males received disproportionately high rates at 18.9%, although they represented 7.5% of Missouri nurses. Males received more severe discipline than females, with higher rates of license suspension and revocation, regardless of infractions or license level. Males surrendered licenses at higher rates. For 3 of the 28 infractions, males exceeded the number of females by a ratio of 2:1. Males committed one infraction that females did not. For three infractions, females outnumbered males by a ratio of 2:1. Females committed eight infractions not committed by males, including four murders.

The multidimensional scaling analysis of 11 Mediterranean countries along with proposed affective space structure indicated that Russel and his colleagues' proposed affective space can also be applied to places that are not perceived directly. It also showed potential for studying the affective image positioning of tourism destinations.

2208,bbc9a6de88c3b65b9a37d3ceefed2578bc24cd20,The efficacy of a brief app-based mindfulness intervention on psychosocial outcomes in healthy adults: A pilot randomised controlled trial,"Background Previous evidence suggests that mindfulness training may improve aspects of psychosocial well-being. Whilst mindfulness is traditionally taught in person, consumers are increasingly turning to mindfulness-based smartphone apps as an alternative delivery medium for training. Despite this growing trend, few studies have explored whether mindfulness delivered via a smartphone app can enhance psychosocial well-being within the general public. Methods The present pilot randomised controlled trial compared the impact of engaging with the self-guided mindfulness meditation (MM) app ‘Headspace’ (n = 38) for a period of 10 or 30 days, to a wait-list (WL) control (n = 36), using a cohort of adults from the general population. The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Wagnild Resilience Scale were administered online at baseline and after 10 and 30 days of the intervention. Results Twelve participants (MM n = 9, WL n = 3) were lost to follow-up for unknown reasons. Relative to the WL control, the MM app positively impacted self-reported satisfaction with life, stress, and resilience at day 10, with further improvements emerging at day 30 (Cohen’s d = 0.57, 1.42, 0.63 respectively). The rate of improvement was largest at the 10-day assessment point, dropping moderately by day 30. Participants that rated the MM app as easy to engage with experienced the largest self-reported benefits. Moreover, the MM app was able to protect against an unexpected increase in perceived stress that emerged in the control group. Conclusions This pilot randomised controlled trial shows that self-reported improvements in psychosocial outcomes can be achieved at low cost through short-term engagement with a mindfulness-based smartphone app, and should be followed up with more substantive studies.

2213,bbe1e553a9a8911eaa7ecf1a4debde3dde45b008,Artificial intelligence and policy: quo vadis?,"
Purpose
This paper aims to inform policymakers about key artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, risks and trends in national AI strategies. It suggests a framework of social governance to ensure emergence of safe and beneficial AI.


Design/methodology/approach
The paper is based on approximately 100 interviews with researchers, executives of traditional companies and startups and policymakers in seven countries. The interviews were carried out in January-August 2017.


Findings
Policymakers still need to develop an informed, scientifically grounded and forward-looking view on what societies and businesses might expect from AI. There is lack of transparency on what key AI risks are and what might be regulatory approaches to handle them. There is no collaborative framework in place involving all important actors to decide on AI technology design principles and governance. Today's technology decisions will have long-term consequences on lives of billions of people and competitiveness of millions of businesses.


Research limitations/implications
The research did not include a lot of insights from the emerging markets.


Practical implications
Policymakers will understand the scope of most important AI concepts, risks and national strategies.


Social implications
AI is progressing at a very fast rate, changing industries, businesses and approaches how companies learn, generate business insights, design products and communicate with their employees and customers. It has a big societal impact, as – if not designed with care – it can scale human bias, increase cybersecurity risk and lead to negative shifts in employment. Like no other invention, it can tighten control by the few over the many, spread false information and propaganda and therewith shape the perception of people, communities and enterprises.


Originality/value
This paper is a compendium on the most important concepts of AI, bringing clarity into discussions around AI risks and the ways to mitigate them. The breadth of topics is valuable to policymakers, students, practitioners, general executives and board directors alike.

Written more than two decades after Democracy and Education(Dewey's most comprehensive statement of his position in educational philosophy), this book demonstrates how Dewey reformulated his ideas as a result of his intervening experience with the progressive schools and in the light of the criticisms his theories had received. Analysing both ""traditional"" and ""progressive"" education, Dr. Dewey here insists that neither the old nor the new education is adequate and that each is miseducative because neither of them applies the principles of a carefully developed philosophy of experience. Many pages of this volume illustrate Dr. Dewey's ideas for a philosophy of experience and its relation to education. He particularly urges that all teachers and educators looking for a new movement in education should think in terms of the deeped and larger issues of education rather than in terms of some divisive ""ism"" about education, even such an ""ism"" as ""progressivism."" His philosophy, here expressed in its most essential, most readable form, predicates an American educational system that respects all sources of experience, on that offers a true learning situation that is both historical and social, both orderly and dynamic.",1938.0,0.0,9329.0,"{'volume': '3', 'pages': '917', 'name': 'American Sociological Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dewey1938ExperienceAE,\n author = {J.

2221,bc7e13b992329bcfaea9142695d5bb06de596703,Knowledge Collaboration in Online Communities,"Online communities (OCs) are a virtual organizational form in which knowledge collaboration can occur in unparalleled scale and scope, in ways not heretofore theorized. For example, collaboration can occur among people not known to each other, who share different interests and without dialogue. An exploration of this organizational form can fundamentally change how we theorize about knowledge collaboration among members of organizations. We argue that a fundamental characteristic of OCs that affords collaboration is their fluidity. This fluidity engenders a dynamic flow of resources in and out of the community---resources such as passion, time, identity, social disembodiment of ideas, socially ambiguous identities, and temporary convergence. With each resource comes both a negative and positive consequence, creating a tension that fluctuates with changes in the resource. We argue that the fluctuations in tensions can provide an opportunity for knowledge collaboration when the community responds to these tensions in ways that encourage interactions to be generative rather than constrained. After offering numerous examples of such generative responses, we suggest that this form of theorizing---induced by online communities---has implications for theorizing about the more general case of knowledge collaboration in organizations.",2011.0,128.0,870.0,"{'volume': '22', 'pages': '1224-1239', 'name': 'Organ.

In Study 1, a two-dimensional structure for the direct experience of mood (Watson & Tellegen, 1985) was tested for its fit to the responses of 1,572 subjects who each completed one of three different mood scales, including a brief scale developed to assist future research. The Watson and Tellegen structure was supported across all three scales. In Study 2, meta-mood experience was conceptualized as the product of a mood regulatory process that monitors, evaluates, and at times changes mood. A scale to measure meta-mood experience was administered to 160 participants along with the brief mood scale. People's levels on the meta-mood dimensions were found to differ across moods. Meta-mood experiences may also constitute an important part of the phenomenology of the personal experience of mood.",1988.0,0.0,878.0,"{'volume': '55 1', 'pages': '\n          102-11\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of personality and social psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mayer1988TheEA,\n author = {J.

2223,bca7b1684abd5177513a483c3734f4737e093dac,Regulating Bot Speech,"We live in a world of artificial speakers with real impact. So-called “bots” foment political strife, skew online discourse, and manipulate the marketplace. Concerns over bot speech has led prominent figures in the world of technology to call for regulations in response to the unique threats bots pose. Recently, legislators have begun to heed these calls, drafting laws that would require online bots to clearly indicate that they are not human. 
This work is the first to consider how efforts to regulate bots might run afoul of the First Amendment. At first blush, requiring a bot to self-disclose raises little in the way of free speech concerns—it does not censor speech as such, nor does it unmask the identity of the person behind the automated account. However, a deeper analysis reveals several areas of First Amendment tension. Bot disclosure laws fit poorly with the state’s stated goals, risk unmasking anonymous speakers in the enforcement process, and create a scaffolding for censorship by private actors and other governments. 
Ultimately bots represent a diverse and emerging medium of speech. Their use for mischief should not overshadow their novel capacity to inform, entertain, and critique. We conclude by urging society to proceed with caution in regulating bots, lest we inadvertently curtail a new, unfolding form of expression.",2018.0,0.0,14.0,{'name': 'CommRN: Communication Law & Policy: North America (Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Lamo2018RegulatingBS,\n author = {Madeline Lamo and Ryan Calo},\n journal = {CommRN: Communication Law & Policy: North America (Topic)},\n title = {Regulating Bot Speech},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2050491236', 'name': 'Madeline Lamo'}, {'authorId': '3014341', 'name': 'Ryan Calo'}]"

In the medical context, large volumes of data collected for healthcare purposes are contained in electronic health records (EHRs). The real-life character and sheer amount of data contained in them make EHRs an attractive resource for public health and biomedical research. However, medical records contain sensitive information that could be misused by third parties. Medical confidentiality and respect for patients' privacy and autonomy protect patient data, barring access to health records unless consent is given by the data subject. This creates a situation in which much of the beneficial records-based research is prevented from being used or is seriously undermined, because the refusal of consent by some patients introduces a systematic deviation, known as selection bias, from a representative sample of the general population, thus distorting research findings. Although research exemptions for the requirement of informed consent exist, they are rarely used in practice due to concerns over liability and a general culture of caution. In this paper, we argue that the problem of research access to sensitive data can be understood as a tension between the medical duties of confidentiality and beneficence. We attempt to show that the requirement of informed consent is not appropriate for all kinds of records-based research by distinguishing studies involving minimal risk from those that feature moderate or greater risks. We argue that the duty of easy rescue—the principle that persons should benefit others when this can be done at no or minimal risk to themselves—grounds the removal of consent requirements for minimally risky records-based research. Drawing on this discussion, we propose a risk-adapted framework for the facilitation of ethical uses of health data for the benefit of society.

This study further examines how environmental aspects (i.e., dynamism and competitiveness) moderate the effectiveness of exploratory and exploitative innovation. Results indicate that centralization negatively affects exploratory innovation, whereas formalization positively influences exploitative innovation. Interestingly, connectedness within units appears to be an important antecedent of both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Furthermore, our findings reveal that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit's financial performance in more competitive environments.

2237,bdfc7f73732e34fd61133a7d48405b526d5f3400,Integrative neurocognitive mechanism of empathy and counter-empathy,"Empathy is an essential psychological process regarding emotional experience and social interaction. According to the observers’ emotional valence, empathy can be categorized into positive empathy—positive feelings on others’ success, and negative empathy—negative feelings on others’ misfortune. Similarly, counter-empathy refers to that observers generate opposite valence of emotional responses to others’ affective state, for example, enjoy others’ misfortune or envy others’ success. Empathy has been widely studied from diverse perspectives. However, few studies have focused on the phenomena, impact factors, psychological mechanism, and theorization of counter-empathy. In this review, we briefly summarized inducing methods and three impact factors on both empathy and counter-empathy: (i) group identity—out- group or conflict group members might elicit greater counter-empathy compared with in-group members; (ii) social comparison—comparing performance between participants and other competitors could lead them to gloat over others’ loss and envy others’ gain; (iii) perspective-taking—taking others’ perspective could decrease stereotypic bias and in- group bias, both of which usually lead to counter-empathy. Therefore, we inferred perspective-taking might be a potential way to mediate or even reverse counter-empathy. Next, we reviewed the literature on psychological mechanisms, electrophysiological indices and brain networks regarding empathy and counter-empathy. Previous theories on empathy and counter-empathy were summarized as followed: (i) the Theory of Mind—mentalizing had been proved to be the key cognitive mechanism of empathy, contributing to understand others’ and own emotional states; (ii) deservedness and social comparison—when people think others’ misfortune is deserved, they would feel a sense of schadenfreude, and when they think others’ success is undeserved, they would feel envious or angry; (iii) intergroup relation—negative attitudes towards out-group members resulted from in-group bias have evolutionary meaning but also resulted in negative effects such as discrimination, stereotyping and counter-empathy. We further proposed a unified two-dimension framework based on the observer and others’ emotional valences to systematically study and understand empathy and counter-empathy. Current literatures indicate that negative emotional valence involves larger negative feedback related negativity (FRN) and activation in brain regions such as anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AI). Positive emotional valence involves smaller or no FRN and activation in brain regions such as ventral striatum (VS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Under such an integrative framework, we predicted that brain networks of positive and negative valences would be activated in an opposite manner for empathy and counter-empathy situations. When others’ feelings are negative, empathy activates negative emotion brain networks, whereas counter-empathy activates reward brain networks; on the other hand, when others’ feelings are positive, empathy activates reward brain networks, whereas counter-empathy activates negative emotion brain networks. We proposed that future studies need to further examine the reversal mechanism of empathy and counter-empathy. Moreover, research in the future should expand to the other areas of the framework and especially fill in the gap on empathy of others’ positive affect.",2017.0,83.0,7.0,"{'volume': '62', 'pages': '2500-2508', 'name': 'Chinese Science Bulletin'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fu2017IntegrativeNM,\n author = {Di Fu and Y.

Although the neural substrates of EI are virtually unknown, it is well established that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in human social-emotional behavior. We studied a unique sample of combat veterans from the Vietnam Head Injury Study, which is a prospective, long-term follow-up study of veterans with focal penetrating head injuries. We administered the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test as a valid standardized psychometric measure of EI behavior to examine two key competencies of EI: (i) Strategic EI as the competency to understand emotional information and to apply it for the management of the self and of others and (ii) Experiential EI as the competency to perceive emotional information and to apply it for the integration into thinking. The results revealed that key competencies underlying EI depend on distinct neural PFC substrates. First, ventromedial PFC damage diminishes Strategic EI, and therefore, hinders the understanding and managing of emotional information. Second, dorsolateral PFC damage diminishes Experiential EI, and therefore, hinders the perception and integration of emotional information. In conclusion, EI should be viewed as complementary to cognitive intelligence and, when considered together, provide a more complete understanding of human intelligence.",2009.0,71.0,84.0,"{'volume': '106', 'pages': '22486 - 22491', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Krueger2009TheNB,\n author = {F.

Scholars have indicated that engaging students in social interactions facilitates their deep and diverse thinking, and hence to promoting their learning outcomes. However, in traditional instruction, students generally learn in an individual learning mode and hesitate to interact with peers and teachers. To address this problem, a mobile team-based competition approach to situate students in social interactions was proposed. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted in a college curriculum design course. 88 students in a teacher education program participated in the experiment, including 42 in the experimental group learning with the proposed approach, and 46 in the control group learning with the conventional mobile individual competition approach. The results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the mobile individual competition approach in terms of learning attitude, collaborative learning tendency and professional identity. It is found that the students generally perceived the proposed learning approach to be an effective way to encourage knowledge sharing, promote collaboration awareness and improve learning attitudes and motivation.",2021.0,49.0,6.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '1158 - 1172', 'name': 'Interactive Learning Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Liu2021FromCT,\n author = {Chenchen Liu and Ping Wan and Gwo-jen Hwang and Y.

The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.

The research aims to disclose the impact of the developed system of assignments on the consolidation of knowledge of humanities in pupil-athletes in the process of training. The pedagogical experiment was conducted in Ukrainian comprehensive schools (142 participants in the experimental group and 150 participants in the control group). The diagnostic toolset includes questionnaires for identifying cognitive interest of pupils in humanities, questionnaires for teachers and parents, tests for identifying abilities to observe, concentrate attention, memorize and apply the content of educational material, tests for studying types of memory, methods of adolescents’ self-assessment, methods of unfinished sentences, notes, reading diaries, compositions. Thus, the indicator of creative nature in acquiring knowledge of humanities has increased (+ 19,1%) in the experimental group. Analyzing the results from the experiment, one can conclude that the designed system of assignments aimed at consolidating pupil-athletes’ knowledge of humanities has contributed to increasing the levels of their overall performance, responsibility and discipline.",2021.0,50.0,48.0,{'name': 'Revista Romaneasca pentru Educatie Multidimensionala'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Komogorova2021PedagogicalCO,\n author = {Maryna Komogorova and B.

Typically, one party, the sender, must choose whether and how to communicate (or signal) that information, and the other party, the receiver, must choose how to interpret the signal. Accordingly, signaling theory holds a prominent position in a variety of management literatures, including strategic management, entrepreneurship, and human resource management. While the use of signaling theory has gained momentum in recent years, its central tenets have become blurred as it has been applied to organizational concerns. The authors, therefore, provide a concise synthesis of the theory and its key concepts, review its use in the management literature, and put forward directions for future research that will encourage scholars to use signaling theory in new ways and to develop more complex formulations and nuanced variations of the theory.",2011.0,110.0,3526.0,"{'volume': '37', 'pages': '39 - 67', 'name': 'Journal of Management'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Connelly2011SignalingTA,\n author = {Brian L.

In particular, Amazon's conversational agent, Alexa, now dominates the market and is in millions of homes. This paper presents two complementary studies investigating the experience of households living with a conversational agent over an extended period of time. First, we gathered the history logs of 75 Alexa participants and quantitatively analyzed over 278,000 commands. Second, we performed seven in-home, contextual interviews of Alexa owners focusing on how their household interacts with Alexa. Our findings give the first glimpse of how households integrate Alexa into their lives. We found interesting behaviors around purchasing and acclimating to Alexa, in the number and physical placement of devices, and in daily use patterns. Participants also uniformly described interactions between children and Alexa.

 Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have emerged as a new mechanism for entrepreneurial finance, with parallels to initial public offerings, venture capital, and presale crowdfunding. In a sample of more than 1,500 ICOs that collectively raise ${\$}$12.9 billion, we examine which issuer and ICO characteristics predict successful real outcomes (increasing issuer employment and avoiding enterprise failure). Success is associated with disclosure, credible commitment to the project, and quality signals. An instrumental variables analysis finds that ICO token exchange listing causes higher future employment, indicating that access to token liquidity has important real consequences for the enterprise.

Each of 192 speakers from Wisconsin (the northern variety) and from North Carolina (the southern variety), men and women, ranging in age from children to old adults, read a set of sentences and produced a spontaneous unconstrained talk. Articulation rate in spontaneous speech was modeled using fixed-mixed effects analyses. The models explored the effects of the between-speaker factors dialect, age and gender and included each phrase and its length as a source of both between- and within-speaker variation. The major findings are: (1) Wisconsin speakers speak significantly faster and produce shorter phrases than North Carolina speakers; (2) speech tempo changes across the lifespan, being fastest for individuals in their 40s; (3) men speak faster than women and this effect is not related to the length of phrases they produce. Articulation rate in reading was slower than in speaking and the effects of gender and age also differed in reading and spontaneous speech. The effects of dialect in reading remained the same, showing again that Wisconsin speakers had faster articulation rates than did North Carolina speakers.",2010.0,70.0,160.0,"{'volume': '128 2', 'pages': '\n          839-50\n        ', 'name': 'The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jacewicz2010BetweenspeakerAW,\n author = {E.

Nevertheless, the LRFU requires only a few words for each block to maintain such history. This paper also describes an implementation of the LRFU that again subsumes the LRU and LFU implementations.

In addition, data on mediational and moderational relations from a longitudinal study are presented. The effects of attention regulation on social functioning were mediated by resiliency, and this relation was moderated by negative emotionality at the first, but not second, assessment. Negative emotionality moderated the relation of behavior regulation to socially appropriate/prosocial behavior.

These apps involve either the use of (1) photoplethysmographic recording or (2) a handheld external electrocardiographic recording device attached to the mobile phone or wristband. Objective This review seeks to explore the current state of mobile phone apps in cardiac rhythmology while highlighting shortcomings for further research. Methods We conducted a narrative review of the use of mobile phone devices by searching PubMed and EMBASE from their inception to October 2018. Potentially relevant papers were then compared against a checklist for relevance and reviewed independently for inclusion, with focus on 4 allocated topics of (1) mobile phone monitoring, (2) AF, (3) HR, and (4) HR variability (HRV). Results The findings of this narrative review suggest that there is a role for mobile phone apps in the diagnosis, monitoring, and screening for arrhythmias and HR. Photoplethysmography and handheld electrocardiograph recorders are the 2 main techniques adopted in monitoring HR, HRV, and AF. Conclusions A number of studies have demonstrated high accuracy of a number of different mobile devices for the detection of AF. However, further studies are warranted to validate their use for large scale AF screening.",2019.0,129.0,115.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'JMIR mHealth and uHealth'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Li2019TheCS,\n author = {K.

However, few studies have examined the physiological correlates, or effects of the incorporation of meditative practices. Because pupillary reactivity is a marker for autonomic changes and emotional processing, we hypothesized that the pupillary responses of mindfulness meditation practitioners (MP) and subjects without such practices (non-meditators (NM)) differ, reflecting different emotional processing. In a group of 11 MP and 9 NM, we recorded the pupil diameter using video-oculography while subjects explored images with emotional contents. Although both groups showed a similar pupillary response for positive and neutral images, negative images evoked a greater pupillary contraction and a weaker dilation in the MP group. Also, this group had faster physiological recovery to baseline levels. These results suggest that mindfulness meditation practices modulate the response of the autonomic nervous system, reflected in the pupillary response to negative images and faster physiological recovery to baseline levels, suggesting that pupillometry could be used to assess the potential health benefits of these practices in patients.",2017.0,21.0,31.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vásquez-Rosati2017PupillaryRT,\n author = {A.

2266,c066aad4fbdd01c3926f2861bb95af16ece26056,Emotional intelligence or artificial intelligence– an employee perspective,ABSTRACT Emotional intelligence as personal intelligence and artificial intelligence as a machine intelligence have been popular in the relevant literature over the last two decades. The current study integrates these two concepts and explores how emotional and artificial intelligence influences employee retention and performance with a focus on service employees in the hotel industry. Employee performance is operationalised into internal and external dimensions that captures employees’ task efficiency over both internal and external service encounters with co-workers and customers respectively. The data were collected from a variety of different ranking hotels. The results show that emotional intelligence has a significant effect on employee retention and performance; whereas artificial intelligence plays a significant moderating role in employee performance. A discussion of the findings and implications concludes this paper.,2020.0,118.0,116.0,"{'name': 'Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management', 'pages': '377 - 403', 'volume': '29'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Prentice2020EmotionalIO,\n author = {C.

Their results, based on a comprehensive set of sentiment and coin price data, suggest that the ICO market is driven by crypto-related sentiment, but is almost unrelated to general capital market sentiment. Among the crypto-related sentiment, social media channels, rather than traditional news channels, are the main source of investor sentiment. The authors find that ICO firms exploit “windows of opportunity” and avoid periods of negative sentiment. Coins listed during periods with negative investor sentiment generate negative returns in the short run.

2295,c3a9745dffecfb6cd0d62a4c36667a9f4349856a,Factor structure and measurement invariance of the Difficulties Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) in Spanish adolescents.,"BACKGROUND
Emotion dysregulation is a unifying dimension of several psychopathological symptoms such as prolonged dysphoria, labile mood, high anger, persistent fear and excessive worry. Deficits in emotion regulation (ER), or emotion dysregulation, appear to be relevant to the development, maintenance, and promising treatment target in a broad range of mental disorders. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is the most comprehensive measure of emotion dysregulation to date, but the Spanish version has not been validated in adolescents.


METHOD
A community sample of 642 Spanish adolescents aged 12-18 responded to the DERS.


RESULTS
Factor analysis suggested a six-factor solution, and strict measurement invariance across sex was achieved. Internal consistency for the subscales was moderate to satisfactory (.71-.88), except for Awareness (α = .62). We found some sex differences on subscale scores, with small effect sizes.


CONCLUSIONS
The results obtained for the Spanish version of the DERS are promising for investigating emotion dysregulation in Spanish adolescents.",2014.0,43.0,47.0,"{'volume': '26 3', 'pages': '\n          401-8\n        ', 'name': 'Psicothema'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gómez-Simón2014FactorSA,\n author = {Isabel Gómez-Simón and E.

2297,c3d3b498a94b9ea78b3b07b5577ef8079bd32c22,Voice acoustic analysis of normal Taiwanese adults.,"BACKGROUND
Because of advances in voice research, voice acoustic analysis including fundamental frequency (F0), sound pressure level (SPL), jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio (H/N ratio), and maximum phonation time (MPT) can now be easily recorded and analyzed with a computer. Because these systems are widely used in clinical practice, this study was designed to establish the normal acoustic analysis parameters in normal Taiwanese adults.


METHODS
From Mar. 2002 to Dec. 2002, 45 Taiwanese women and 45 Taiwanese men younger than 50 years old were recruited as subjects for this study. The commercially available Computer Speech Lab and Aerophone II system manufactured by Kay Elemetrics Corp. were used to record the aforementioned acoustic data under comfortable phonation. Each gender was separated equally into 3 age subgroups. Then differences between gender and age subgroups were investigated by statistics software SPSS 10.0. Our results were compared with data from previous reports.


RESULTS
The value of F0 (counting; vowel /a/) was greater for females (203.2 +/- 21.7; 213.4 +/- 25.4 Hz) than for males (118.3 +/- 17.3; 121.3 +/- 16.4 Hz). Conversely, the value of MPT was greater for males (28.0 +/- 9.4 sec) than for females (22.6 +/- 7.6 sec). There were no significant differences in average SPL and jitter between female (77.8 +/- 5.5 dB; 0.66 +/- 0.27%) and male (77.5 +/- 5.5 dB; 0.56 +/- 0.23%) subgroups. Except for shimmer and H/N ratio in the male subgroup, there were no differences in parameters within both gender subgroups with respect to age.


CONCLUSIONS
We have developed a body of normal data for various parameters of acoustic analysis in different age groups and genders. It seems that the majority of voice characteristics of adults were relatively stable and did not change with aging between 20 and 49. But the shimmer and H/N ratio were variable in different genders and age groups. However, the voice characteristics of adults older than 50 years old were not recorded in this study and therefore require further investigation.",2004.0,19.0,38.0,"{'volume': '67 4', 'pages': '\n          179-84\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2004VoiceAA,\n author = {Chen-Chi Wang and Hui-Tsu Huang},\n journal = {Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA},\n pages = {\n          179-84\n        },\n title = {Voice acoustic analysis of normal Taiwanese adults.},\n volume = {67 4},\n year = {2004}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '47074172', 'name': 'Chen-Chi Wang'}, {'authorId': '6051411', 'name': 'Hui-Tsu Huang'}]"

Second, the degree of emotion felt, and the related physiological signals, vary according to the individual. KLD calculates the difference in probability distribution shape patterns between two classes. Therefore, it is possible to analyze the relationship between physiological signals and emotion. As the result, features from EDA are important for distinguishing negative emotion in all subjects.

However, the World Wide Web is a fruitful environment for the massive diffusion of unverified rumors. In this work, using a massive quantitative analysis of Facebook, we show that information related to distinct narratives––conspiracy theories and scientific news––generates homogeneous and polarized communities (i.e., echo chambers) having similar information consumption patterns. Then, we derive a data-driven percolation model of rumor spreading that demonstrates that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades’ size. The wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of Jade Helm 15––where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., “echo chambers.” Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades’ size.",2016.0,45.0,1441.0,"{'volume': '113', 'pages': '554 - 559', 'name': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vicario2016TheSO,\n author = {Michela Del Vicario and Alessandro Bessi and Fabiana Zollo and Fabio Petroni and Antonio Scala and G.

2308,c489b6787c5af8aca97f4761343a66f3f189b35d,Emotional Expressions Reconsidered: Challenges to Inferring Emotion From Human Facial Movements,"It is commonly assumed that a person’s emotional state can be readily inferred from his or her facial movements, typically called emotional expressions or facial expressions. This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life. This research is crucial to provide consumers of emotion research with the translational information they require.",2019.0,366.0,801.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '1 - 68', 'name': 'Psychological Science in the Public Interest'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Barrett2019EmotionalER,\n author = {L.

The aim of this study is to classify seven emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, and stress) by machine learning algorithms using physiological signals. 12 college students participated in this experiment over 10 times. Total 70 emotional stimuli (10 emotional stimuli per each emotion) had been tested their suitability and effectiveness prior to experiment. Physiological signals, i.e. EDA, ECG, PPG, and SKT were acquired and were analyzed. Physiological signals were obtained prior to the presentation of emotional stimuli and while emotional stimuli were presented to participants. 28 features were extracted the acquired signals and analyzed for 30 seconds from the baseline and the emotional states. For emotion recognition, the data which is subtracted baseline values from the emotional state applied to 5 machine learning algorithm, i.e. FLD, CART, SOMs, Naive Bayes and SVM. The result showed that an accuracy of emotion classification by SVM was highest and lowest by FLD. This means that SVM is the best emotion recognition algorithm in this study. Our result can help emotion recognition studies lead to better chance to recognize not only basic emotion but also user’s various emotions, e.g., boredom, frustration, love, pain, etc., by using physiological signals.

A sample of 116 students filled in measures for emotional and academic intelligence, the Big Five, and indicators of social and academic success. Moreover, other ratings were obtained from four different raters on emotional intelligence and social success. Factor analysis revealed three emotional intelligence dimensions that were labelled as ‘Empathy’, ‘Autonomy’, and ‘Emotional Control’. Little evidence was found for a relationship between emotional and academic intelligence. Academic intelligence was low and inconsistently related to emotional intelligence, revealing both negative and positive interrelations. Strong relationships were found of the emotional intelligence dimensions with the Big Five, particularly with Extraversion and Emotional Stability. Interestingly, the emotional intelligence dimensions were able to predict both academic and social success above traditional indicators of academic intelligence and personality.

Creativity is imperative for the students’ success, but studies have not explored the relational precursors to team creativity in nursing education. Therefore, the relationship was examined between task interdependence, interaction behaviours (constructive controversy, helping behaviours and spontaneous communication) and creativity for nursing students on interdisciplinary teams in Taiwan to investigate whether high task interdependence moderates the correlations between interaction behaviours and creativity. Design Descriptive, cross‐sectional, quantitative study. Methods Participants were nursing students (N = 99) attending interdisciplinary capstone courses in 2‐ or 4‐year nursing programmes at a university for science and technology in Taiwan. Self‐report questionnaires were used to collect the students’ demographics and perceptions of their teams’ task interdependence, interaction behaviours and creativity between January 2018 and January 2019. Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed variable associations. SPSS PROCESS macro displayed moderating effects. Results Task interdependence had significant positive correlations with all three interaction behaviours and team creativity. Each interaction behaviour also had significant positive correlations with team creativity. High task interdependence negatively moderated the relationships between team creativity and (a) constructive controversy, and (b) spontaneous communication, but not (c) helping behaviours. Conclusion The empirically validated moderation model and study results suggest that nursing educators can foster creativity in their students by encouraging task interdependence and helping behaviours, and teaching students to build constructive controversy and spontaneous communication into their collaborative plans. Impact In Taiwan, nursing students must demonstrate creativity in interdisciplinary capstone courses. Their ability to do so requires them to cooperate with students in other disciplines who have unique skills or knowledge. This study provides insights into the relational factors that may improve creativity for nursing students on interdisciplinary teams.",2021.0,43.0,6.0,"{'volume': '78', 'pages': '131 - 141', 'name': 'Journal of Advanced Nursing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Liu2021ModeratingEO,\n author = {H.

They also provide a privileged environment in which to study user experience by using the same sensing data that support interaction. In this paper, using the affective interface of an Augmented Reality Art installation, we introduce a framework relating real-time emotional data to phenomenological models of user experience, in particular the concept of Flow. We propose to analyse trajectories of affect in a continuous emotional space (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance), to characterize user experience. Early experiments with several subjects interacting in pairs with the installation support this mapping on the basis of Flow questionnaires.

This essay offers a perspective on these issues by considering how emotion regulation should be defined, the various components of the management of emotion, how emotion regulation strategies fit into the dynamics of social interaction, and how individual differences in emotion regulation should be conceptualized and measured. In the end, it seems clear that emotion regulation is a conceptual rubric for a remarkable range of developmental processes, each of which may have its own catalysts and control processes. Likewise, individual differences in emotion regulation skills likely have multifaceted origins and are also related in complex ways to the person's emotional goals and the immediate demands of the situation. Assessment approaches that focus on the dynamics of emotion are well suited to elucidating these complex developmental and individual differences.

Social robots may promote the health of older adults by increasing their perceived emotional support and social interaction. This review aims to summarize the effectiveness of social robots on outcomes (psychological, physiological, quality of life, or medications) of older adults from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).


Research Design and Methods
A mixed-method systematic review of RCTs meeting the study inclusion criteria was undertaken. Eight databases were electronically searched up to September 2017. Participants' characteristics, intervention features, and outcome data were retrieved. The mean difference and standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were synthesized to pool the effect size.


Results
A total of 13 articles from 11 RCTs were identified from 2,204 articles, of which 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Risk of bias was relatively high in allocation concealment and blinding. Social robots appeared to have positive impacts on agitation, anxiety, and quality of life for older adults but no statistical significance was found in the meta-analysis. However, results from a narrative review indicated that social robot interactions could improve engagement, interaction, and stress indicators, as well as reduce loneliness and the use of medications for older adults.


Discussion and Implications
Social robots appear to have the potential to improve the well-being of older adults, but conclusions are limited due to the lack of high-quality studies. More RCTs are recommended with larger sample sizes and rigorous study designs.",2018.0,64.0,254.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': 'e37–e51', 'name': 'The Gerontologist'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pu2018TheEO,\n author = {Lihui Pu and W.

2327,c7c0fa40eedfd772aefeea5d4cdfca95faff5f4e,Resting heart rate variability predicts self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation: a focus on different facets of emotion regulation,"The Model of Neurovisceral Integration suggests that vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) represents a psychophysiological index of inhibitory control and thus, is associated with emotion regulation capacity. Over the past decade, growing empirical evidence supports this notion, showing that those with higher resting vmHRV can regulate negative emotions more adequately. However, to our knowledge, no study has previously examined how resting vmHRV may relate to everyday perceived difficulties in emotion regulation. The present study attempts to examine such relationship in 183 undergraduate students (98 female, 60 minority, mean Age = 19.34). Resting vmHRV was collected during a 5-min resting baseline period, and everyday difficulties in emotion regulation were assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Controlling for potential covariates (including both trait anxiety and rumination), results revealed a negative relationship between resting vmHRV and DERS such that lower resting vmHRV was associated with greater difficulties in emotional regulation, especially a lack of emotional clarity and impulse control, as indicated by the respective subscales of the DERS. These findings provide further evidence for the Neurovisceral Integration Model, suggesting that emotion regulation and autonomic regulation share neural networks within the brain. Moreover, the present study extends prior research by highlighting two distinct facets of emotion regulation (impulse control and emotional clarity) that should be of particular interest when investigating the link between emotion regulation, resting vmHRV, and related health outcomes including morbidity and mortality.",2015.0,44.0,299.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Williams2015RestingHR,\n author = {DeWayne P.

Participants were 238 healthy employees from two large United Kingdom companies that were randomized to a mindfulness meditation practice app or a wait-list control condition. The app offered 45 prerecorded 10- to 20-min guided audio meditations. Participants were asked to complete one meditation per day. Psychosocial measures and blood pressure throughout one working day were measured at baseline and eight weeks later; a follow-up survey was also emailed to participants 16 weeks after the intervention start. Usage data showed that during the 8-week intervention period, participants randomized to the intervention completed an average of 17 meditation sessions (range 0–45 sessions). The intervention group reported significant improvement in well-being, distress, job strain, and perceptions of workplace social support compared to the control group. In addition, the intervention group had a marginally significant decrease in self-measured workday systolic blood pressure from pre- to post-intervention. Sustained positive effects in the intervention group were found for well-being and job strain at the 16-week follow-up assessment.

2329,c7d0d680380b592f42db702978b3e6d8fa375fd4,Your Privacy Is Sealed: Effects of Web Privacy Seals on Trust and Personal Disclosures,"Online privacy is an issue of increasing national importance, and voluntary privacy seals provided by third-party organizations such as TRUSTe and BBBOnline have been proposed as a means of assuring consumer privacy. Few studies have examined privacy seal effects. This study presents results of an online experiment that evaluated consumer response to privacy seals in a naturalistic exposure setting. Findings suggest that privacy seals enhance trust in the Web site and expectations that the site would inform the user of its information practices. While concern for privacy-threatening information practices had no influence, privacy self-efficacy, confidence in ability to protect one's privacy, moderated seal effects. Implications for the continued role of privacy seals are discussed. ********** Online consumer privacy has attracted the attention of state and federal regulators and poses a significant challenge to online marketers. Concerns for the confidentiality of personal information are widespread (Cole 2001; NTIA 2000; Pew Research 2000). However, 64% of adult consumers report never seeking out instructions on how to protect one's personal information on the Internet, and 40% report knowing almost nothing about how to prevent Web sites from collecting their information (Turow 2003). Three-fourths of nonusers see the Internet as a privacy threat (Cole 2001), suggesting that online privacy invasion is a deterrent to potential Internet shoppers as well. Privacy threats may lower participation in commercial activities online and are of particular concern to new users and women (Pew Research 2000), thereby limiting the growth potential of online commerce. The debate is not merely academic since the release of consumer credit information can transform Internet users into victims of credit card and other financial fraud. A content analysis of leading e-commerce sites by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that only 20% met the agency's standards for preserving consumer privacy (FTC 2000), and more recently, violations of online privacy policies have been unveiled. Fair-practice database information and notice standards are sought by all stakeholders (FTC 2000; Milne and Rohm 2000). The FTC and industry leaders alike had hoped that voluntary third-party seal programs (e.g., TRUSTe, BBBOnline) with clear privacy policy language and iconic representation of privacy guarantees (Green et al. 2000) would provide a self-regulatory solution to adequate notice. The public demand for third-party verification (Harris Interactive 2002) and slow adoption of Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P), the automated browser privacy program by individual Web sites, suggest that use of third-party seal verification programs is likely to increase (Festa 2002). To date, little research has examined consumer response to privacy seals. Notably, Miyazaki and Krishnamurthy (2002) examined the effects of privacy seal presence, in off-line conditions, with clearly stated privacy policies. Their findings suggest that seals may have the effects desired by online retailers but pose a problem for true consumer protection. Participants had more favorable perceptions of privacy policies at Web sites that displayed seals, and seals increased anticipated disclosures and patronage for individuals who viewed online shopping as risky. The results are discouraging for consumer protection since Miyazaki and Krishnamurthy (2002) also found no differences in the privacy policies of Web sites on the basis of seal display. More recently, LaRose and Rifon (forthcoming) found that sealed sites were significantly more invasive than the unsealed sites with respect to the amount of personal information requested. Other recent evidence suggests that a majority (57%) of consumers inaccurately interpret a Web site privacy policy's presence as an indication that the Web site does not collect or share their personal information (Turow 2003). …",2005.0,38.0,249.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '339-362', 'name': 'Journal of Consumer Affairs'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Rifon2005YourPI,\n author = {Nora J.

2331,c804e668bc5103b3f0280f9c40f2c842b5648a58,Brave new world: service robots in the frontline,"
Purpose
The service sector is at an inflection point with regard to productivity gains and service industrialization similar to the industrial revolution in manufacturing that started in the eighteenth century. Robotics in combination with rapidly improving technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), mobile, cloud, big data and biometrics will bring opportunities for a wide range of innovations that have the potential to dramatically change service industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential role service robots will play in the future and to advance a research agenda for service researchers.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper uses a conceptual approach that is rooted in the service, robotics and AI literature.


Findings
The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it provides a definition of service robots, describes their key attributes, contrasts their features and capabilities with those of frontline employees, and provides an understanding for which types of service tasks robots will dominate and where humans will dominate. Second, this paper examines consumer perceptions, beliefs and behaviors as related to service robots, and advances the service robot acceptance model. Third, it provides an overview of the ethical questions surrounding robot-delivered services at the individual, market and societal level.


Practical implications
This paper helps service organizations and their management, service robot innovators, programmers and developers, and policymakers better understand the implications of a ubiquitous deployment of service robots.


Originality/value
This is the first conceptual paper that systematically examines key dimensions of robot-delivered frontline service and explores how these will differ in the future.

The system enables the robot to direct its gaze at multiple humans who are interacting with each other and with the robot. The attention mechanism of the gaze-control system is based on features that have been proven to guide human attention: nonverbal and verbal cues, proxemics, the visual field of view, and the habituation effect. Our gaze-control system uses Kinect skeleton tracking together with speech recognition and SHORE-based facial expression recognition to implement the same features. As part of a pilot evaluation, we collected the gaze behavior of 11 participants in an eye-tracking study. We showed participants videos of two-person interactions and tracked their gaze behavior. A comparison of the human gaze behavior with the behavior of our gaze-control system running on the same videos shows that it replicated human gaze behavior 89% of the time.",2014.0,53.0,87.0,"{'volume': '44', 'pages': '157-168', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Zaraki2014DesigningAE,\n author = {A.

2341,c94cf3f9b2580a1249586aa3fe6e4f3f5a5736f1,An introduction to latent class growth analysis and growth mixture modeling.,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest among researchers in the use of latent class and growth mixture modeling techniques for applications in the social and psychological sciences, in part due to advances in and availability of computer software designed for this purpose (e.g., Mplus and SAS Proc Traj). Latent growth modeling approaches, such as latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and growth mixture modeling (GMM), have been increasingly recognized for their usefulness for identifying homogeneous subpopulations within the larger heterogeneous population and for the identification of meaningful groups or classes of individuals. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of LCGA and GMM, compare the different techniques of latent growth modeling, discuss current debates and issues, and provide readers with a practical guide for conducting LCGA and GMM using the Mplus software. Researchers in the fields of social and psychological sciences are often interested in modeling the longitudinal developmental trajectories of individuals, whether for the study of personality development or for better understanding how social behaviors unfold over time (whether it be days, months, or years). This usually requires an extensive dataset consisting of longitudinal, repeated measures of variables, sometimes including multiple cohorts, and analyzing this data using various longitudinal latent variable modeling techniques such as latent growth curve models (cf. MacCallum & Austin, 2000). The objective of these approaches is to capture information about interindividual differences in intraindividual change over time (Nesselroade, 1991). However, conventional growth modeling approaches assume that individuals come from a single population and that a single growth trajectory can adequately approximate an entire population. Also, it is assumed that covariates that affect the growth factors influence each individual in the same way. Yet, theoretical frameworks and existing studies often categorize individuals into distinct subpopulations (e.g., socioeconomic classes, age groups, at-risk populations). For example, in the field of alcohol research, theoretical literature suggests different classes",2008.0,22.0,2327.0,"{'volume': '2', 'pages': '302-317', 'name': 'Social and Personality Psychology Compass'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jung2008AnIT,\n author = {Tony Jung and K.

Fifty participants screened by the Zung Self-Rating Depressive Scale (SDS) with high and low depression levels were selected. They were instructed to controlled-process different semantic representations of aversive pictures, and the amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP) evoked by the pictures was used as the measure of electrocortical response. We found that controlled-processing neutral representations of aversive pictures significantly decreased the amplitude of LPP relative to that under controlled-processing unpleasant ones in an early window in the low depression group and that this regulatory effect was impaired in the high depression group. Furthermore, a mediation analyses indicated that the regulatory efficacy of controlled-processing different semantic representations was associated with SDS score via the mediation of rumination.

Forty ex-combatants and 20 non ex-combatants were recruited for this study. Empathy levels as well as executive functions were measured. Empathy level was used to create three groups. Group 1 (G1) included ex-combatants with normal empathy scores, and Group 2 included ex-combatants with low scores on at least one empathy sub-scales. In control group (Ctrl), participants with no antecedents of being combatants and with normal scores in empathy were included. Age, gender, educational and intelligence quotients level were controlled among groups. event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while individuals performed an affective picture processing task that included positive, neutral and negative emotional stimuli, which elicit an early modulation of emotion categorization (Early Posterior Negativity (EPN)) and late evaluative process (LPP). EPN differences were found among affective categories, but no group effects were observed at this component. LPP showed a main effect of category and group (higher amplitudes in ex-combatants). There was an inverse correlation between empathy and executive functions scores and ERPs.

The study was conducted with high school students in a Central Anatolian city during the second semester of the 2018-2019 academic year. A total of 488 students, 324 girls and 164 boys, participated in the study. Regression, pearson correlation and t test were used in the analysis of the data obtained T-test results indicated that sex significantly differentiated the scores of separation anxiety while it did not differentiate the scores of restriction anxiety and expectation of rejection. Correlation analysis showed that there was a negative relationship between assertiveness level of adolescents and level of separation-individuation (restriction anxiety, separation anxiety and expectation of rejection). Regression analysis revealed that assertiveness was the negative predictor of separation anxiety, expectation of rejection and restriction anxiety. These results indicate that, for a healthy development in adolescence, a critical period in personality development, becoming assertive and escaping passiveness can have a significant contribution to the personality development of the individual.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow persons with impaired mobility to communicate and interact with the environment, supporting goal-directed thinking and cognitive function. Ideally, a BCI should be able to recognize a user's internal state and adapt to it in real-time, to improve interaction.


OBJECTIVE
Our aim was to examine studies investigating the recognition of affective states from neurophysiological signals, evaluating how current achievements can be applied to improve BCIs.


METHODS
Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a literature search using PubMed and ProQuest databases. We considered peer-reviewed research articles in English, focusing on the recognition of emotions from neurophysiological signals in view of enhancing BCI use.


RESULTS
Of the 526 identified records, 30 articles comprising 32 studies were eligible for review. Their analysis shows that the affective BCI field is developing, with a variety of combinations of neuroimaging techniques, selected neurophysiological features, and classification algorithms currently being tested. Nevertheless, there is a gap between laboratory experiments and their translation to everyday situations.


CONCLUSIONS
BCI developers should focus on testing emotion classification with patients in ecological settings and in real-time, with more precise definitions of what they are investigating, and communicating results in a standardized way.",2015.0,89.0,27.0,"{'volume': '37 3', 'pages': '\n          341-58\n        ', 'name': 'NeuroRehabilitation'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Liberati2015ExtractingNS,\n author = {G.

The prevailing assumption has been that the norm-setting role of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) will remain unchanged despite the primacy of the TRIPS Agreement and the explicit mandate of the WTO for global IP regulation. Indeed, with respect to the supply of public goods, only the WTO - not WIPO - has the formal legal mandate to promote global public welfare. In this Article, I argue that the WTO, in a hierarchical division of labor with WIPO, should be promoted as the primary locus of IP norm-setting with respect to those norms that affect the production and supply of global public goods. I advance three primary arguments to support this claim. First, the WIPO-WTO Agreement can reasonably be interpreted as creating a hierarchical relationship between the two Organizations. Second, emerging global challenges such as climate change and food security require coordinated global action and bargained-for linkages to achieve results acceptable to countries at different levels of development. Third, the WTO's organizational design offers multiple points at which norm-setting processes could be more credibly centered on the development concerns of the global South. IP norm-setting in the WTO is not without risks. Nonetheless, an organizational culture in which IP is only one of many tools to accomplish defined welfare goals, rather than the raison d'etre of an organization's existence, could force open important institutional space in which future IP norms consistent both with the interests of less developed countries and the ideals of established IP systems, can be meaningfully negotiated. At a minimum, a hierarchical relationship may facilitate inter-institutional competition between the WTO and WIPO, generating additional welfare gains for the international community in the form of greater transparency in the processes of IP norm-setting, improvements in the democratic deficit inherent in international organizations generally, as well as systemic gains from enhanced accountability in the global management of IP.",2008.0,20.0,12.0,{'name': 'LSN: International Organizations (Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Okediji2008WIPOWTORA,\n author = {Ruth L.

Differences in onset-bound processes are reflected by the degree of explosiveness or steepness of the response at onset, and differences in offset-bound processes by the degree of accumulation or intensification of the subsequent response. Whether onset- and offset-bound processes have distinctive neural correlates and, hence, whether the neural basis of emotions varies over time, still remains unknown. In the present fMRI study, we address this question using a recently developed paradigm that allows to disentangle explosiveness and accumulation. Thirty-one participants were exposed to neutral and negative social feedback, and asked to reflect on its contents. Emotional intensity while reading and thinking about the feedback was measured with an intensity profile tracking approach. Using non-negative matrix factorization, the resulting profile data were decomposed in explosiveness and accumulation components, which were subsequently entered as continuous regressors of the BOLD response. It was found that the neural basis of emotion intensity shifts as emotions unfold over time with emotion explosiveness and accumulation having distinctive neural correlates.",2017.0,92.0,29.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '1261 - 1271', 'name': 'Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Résibois2017TheNB,\n author = {Maxime Résibois and Philippe Verduyn and P.

We systematically review the available literature and offer a sound theoretical integration of differing EI perspectives (the tripartite model of EI) before considering applied practice in the form of EI training. Our review identified 36 studies assessing EI in an athletic or physical activity context. EI has most often been conceptualized as a trait. In the context of sport performance, we found that EI relates to emotions, physiological stress responses, successful psychological skill usage, and more successful athletic performance. In the context of physical activity, we found that trait EI relates to physical activity levels and positive attitudes toward physical activity. There was a shortage of research into the EI of coaches, officials, and spectators, non‐adult samples, and longitudinal and experimental methods. The tripartite model proposes that EI operates on three levels – knowledge, ability, and trait – and predicts an interplay between the different levels of EI. We present this framework as a promising alternative to trait and ability EI conceptualizations that can guide applied research and professional practice.

The complexity and intensity of the pressures on teachers and the pace of education reform are unprecedented. The aim of this research was to explore perceived control and well-being in teachers and other professionals. A mixed methods design was selected. Phase 1 consisted of an online quantitative survey (298 participants, 222 females, 76 males). Perceived control was measured using the Brief Levenson LOC and Generalised Self-Efficacy Scales, well-being was measured using the Life Orientation Test-Revised, Satisfaction with Life, Subjective Happiness and Ego Resilience Scales. Phase 2 consisted of semi-structured interviews (n = 6); thematic analysis was carried out. It was hypothesised that teachers have lower perceived control and well-being than other professionals, and that older teachers have higher internal control than younger teachers. Independent t-tests using teachers (n = 150) and non-teachers (n = 148) revealed that teachers’ mean scores were significantly different to those of non-teachers. Teachers’ perceived control and well-being were significantly lower than those of non-teachers (p > 0.001). The hypothesis that teachers have significantly lower perceived control and well-being than other professionals was supported. Four themes related to control were located in the qualitative analysis: autonomy, authenticity, connection to others and resilience. The study found that there were similarities between professions in terms of need for control over one’s work. Teachers value connections more highly; non-teachers value objectivity and independence more highly. It is suggested that non-teachers are better prepared to deal with change than teachers.

Consent or anonymisation are often treated as the paradigmatic example of compliance with data protection law, even though both are unable to attend to the full range of rights and interests at stake in data processing. Currently, where data processing may serve a realisable public interest, and consent or anonymisation are impracticable (if not impossible to obtain) the public interest conditions to processing are the rational alternative justifications for processing. However, the public interest conditions are poorly defined in the legislation, and misunderstood and neglected in practice. This thesis offers a much-needed alternative to the predominant consent-or-anonymise paradigm by providing a new understanding of the public interest concept in data protection law and to suggest a new approach to deploying the concept in a way that is consistent with the protective and facilitative aims of the legislation. Through undertaking legislative analysis new insight is provided on the purpose of the public interest conditions in data protection law, revealing critical gaps in understanding. By engaging with public interest theory and discovering the conceptual contours of the public interest, these gaps are addressed. Combined with the insight obtained from the legislative history, we can determine the reasonable range of circumstances and types of processing where it may be justifiable to use personal data based on the public interest. On this basis, and to develop a new approach for deploying the concept, other legal uses of the public interest are examined. The lessons learned suggest legislative and procedural elements that are critical to successful deployment of the public interest concept in data protection. The thesis concludes with the identification of key components to allow a clearer understanding of the public interest in this field. Further, these insights enable recommendations to be made, to reform the law, procedure and guidance. In doing so, the concept of the public interest can be confidently deployed in line with the aims of data protection law, to both protect and facilitate the use of personal data.",2017.0,0.0,2.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Stevens2017PublicIA,\n author = {L.

The Perceived Stress Scale was used to gather data from 212 students enrolled in regularly scheduled psychology classes. Of the students, 75% were in a moderate stress category; 12% in a high stress category, and 13% in a low stress category. Women students were more stressed than men; there were no statistically significant differences between traditional and nontraditional students. The most often used activities to cope with stress included talking to family and friends, leisure activities, and exercising. Less desirable coping strategies were drinking alcohol, smoking, and using illegal drugs. Suggestions for community college personnel to use in assisting students cope with stress are discussed.",2007.0,16.0,287.0,"{'volume': '31', 'pages': '703 - 712', 'name': 'Community College Journal of Research and Practice'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pierceall2007StressAC,\n author = {Emily A.

2372,cbc7eb77f4d45240c6ae1698bb591117138ce04f,Emotional practices: how masking negative emotions impacts the post‐acquisition integration process,"Research Summary: We conducted a real‐time field study of a post‐acquisition integration process. We identified two practices that contributed to integration failure. First, the practice of masking negative emotions caused members of both firms to perceive that the partner firm's members were satisfied with the integration process, even though they were not. These false perceptions of satisfaction resulted in minimal corrective actions, the escalation of the situation, and ultimately, integration failure. Second, efficiency‐driven communication practices used in inter‐firm communication exacerbated the effect of masking negative emotions on false perceptions of satisfaction by shielding both firms’ members from the other firm's members’ spontaneous emotional reactions. Our research invites scholars to consider more deeply the emotional consequences of various common organizational practices. Managerial Summary: Do you disagree with your employee, manager, or business partner? Does this disagreement make you annoyed or even angry? Yet, you decide to mask your negative emotions and discuss the disagreement with a neutral or happy face. Wrong. We find that masking negative emotions in the work environment can prevent corrective actions, escalate disagreement, and make people to develop long‐lasting negative sentiments toward the counterpart that ultimately result in dysfunctional behaviors. Our findings further reveal that commonly used organizational practices such as communicating via email may contribute to the deliberate masking of negative emotions. We suggest that managers should carefully review if and how their organization's practices prevent or enable people to share their emotions authentically to ensure timely corrective actions and proactive development of business operations.",2018.0,102.0,38.0,"{'volume': '39', 'pages': '859-893', 'name': 'Southern Medical Journal'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vuori2018EmotionalPH,\n author = {Natalia Vuori and T.

We examined the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and immediate effects of the DBT Coach, a mobile phone application (app) designed specifically to augment skills generalization through interactive coaching in DBT skills. In this pilot study, we provided the DBT Coach installed on a mobile device as an adjunct to 6 months of standard DBT, among a sample of 16 individuals with BPD and a recent history of attempted suicide and/or nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Results indicate good acceptability and usability of the DBT Coach with considerable between-person variability in the frequency of app use and a median use of only 11.5 times over the course of treatment and a 3-month follow-up period. Using a hierarchical linear modeling approach, analyses indicated the DBT Coach reduced subjective distress and urges to self-harm following app use. However, use of the DBT Coach was not related to any treatment outcomes, except for reductions in NSSI. This study is the first to examine the use of mobile technology as an adjunct in DBT and highlights some potential challenges in incorporating apps into treatment.

The first axis is that of ecological conflicts, which are by their very essence global. The second is global financial crises, which, in a first stage, can be individualized and nationalized. And the third, which suddenly broke upon us on September 11th, is the threat of transnational terror networks, which empowers governments and states.

In an age where trust and faith in God, class and progress have largely disappeared, humanity's common fear has proved the last - ambivalent - resource for making new bonds.

To address this topic a comparative study consisting of two similar prototypes of a 2D jump-and-run game was set up. Both versions of the game were made up of identical art assets and shared the same level structure. The main difference constitutes in the type of interaction. Prototype A offers less control (through an auto-jump ability) and requires input only via one hand (mouse input). Contrary, prototype B enables players to have a stronger influence on the current game situation (manual jump ability) and requires them to use both hands (mouse and keyboard input). In order to assess the arousal of the test subjects, physiological measurements were carried out via galvanic skin response (GSR). Results show that the loss of control creates less arousal than a more complex game situation.",2012.0,21.0,7.0,{'pages': '101-104'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Lankes2012ControlVC,\n author = {M.

Drawing together the threads of current research on the nature and funactions of emotional expression, of physiological reactions, and of emotional experience, this book offers a balanced survey of facts and theory. Nico Frijda discusses the motivational and neurophysiological preconditions for emotions, and the ways in which emotions are regulated by the individual. Considering the kinds of events that elicit emotions, he argues that emotions arise because events are appraised by people as favorable or harmful to their own interests. he takes an information-processing perspective: Emotions are viewed as outcomes of the process of assessing the world in terms of one's own concerns, which, in turn, modify action readiness. This analysis leads him to address such fundamental issues as the place of emotion in motivation generally and the discrepancy between the functions of the emotions and their often irrational and disruptive character.

Results indicated a positive relationship between EI and affective as well as cognitive facets of well-being, with a closer association on part of the affective aspect. The incremental validity of EI was established in that EI predicted both affect balance and life satisfaction when controlling for the Big Five.

However, the majority of the research reported in this field tends to focus on the accuracy of classification whilst neglecting the interpretability of emotion progression. In this paper, we propose a new interpretable emotion recognition approach with the activation mechanism by using machine learning and EEG signals. This paper innovatively proposes the emotional activation curve to demonstrate the activation process of emotions. The algorithm first extracts features from EEG signals and classifies emotions using machine learning techniques, in which different parts of a trial are used to train the proposed model and assess its impact on emotion recognition results. Second, novel activation curves of emotions are constructed based on the classification results, and two emotion coefficients, i.e., the correlation coefficients and entropy coefficients. The activation curve can not only classify emotions but also reveals to a certain extent the emotional activation mechanism. Finally, a weight coefficient is obtained from the two coefficients to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition. To validate the proposed method, experiments have been carried out on the DEAP and SEED dataset. The results support the point that emotions are progressively activated throughout the experiment, and the weighting coefficients based on the correlation coefficient and the entropy coefficient can effectively improve the EEG-based emotion recognition accuracy.",2019.0,34.0,82.0,"{'volume': '7', 'pages': '94160-94170', 'name': 'IEEE Access'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Qing2019InterpretableER,\n author = {Chunmei Qing and Rui Qiao and Xiangmin Xu and Yongqiang Cheng},\n journal = {IEEE Access},\n pages = {94160-94170},\n title = {Interpretable Emotion Recognition Using EEG Signals},\n volume = {7},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '37178775', 'name': 'Chunmei Qing'}, {'authorId': '2060370753', 'name': 'Rui Qiao'}, {'authorId': '9303726', 'name': 'Xiangmin Xu'}, {'authorId': '49096937', 'name': 'Yongqiang Cheng'}]"

Distress itself can be an important obstacle in patients' acceptance of treatment and their adaptation to it, consequently reducing its efficiency. Distress symptoms, in a spectrum from mild to critical, are shown to be widespread in children struggling with cancer. In recent years to alleviate this psychological condition, researchers have proposed and examined several methods such as relaxation, hypnosis, desensitization, and distraction. This study presents a new approach to explore the impact of utilizing a humanoid robot as a therapy-assistant in dealing with patients' distress. Ten children, ages 6-10, diagnosed with cancer were randomly assigned into two groups of Social Robot-Assisted Therapy (5 kids) and Psychotherapy (5 kids) at two specialized hospitals in Tehran.

Specifically, emotional states are modeled as a combination of arousal and valence dimensions according to the well-known circumplex model of affect, whereas the ANS dynamics is estimated through standard and nonlinear analysis of Heart rate variability (HRV) exclusively, which is derived from the electrocardiogram (ECG). In addition, Lagged Poincaré Plots of the HRV series were also taken into account. The affective sounds were gathered from the International Affective Digitized Sound System and grouped into four different levels of arousal (intensity) and two levels of valence (unpleasant and pleasant). A group of 27 healthy volunteers were administered with these standardized stimuli while ECG signals were continuously recorded. Then, those HRV features showing significant changes (p $<;$ 0.05 from statistical tests) between the arousal and valence dimensions were used as input of an automatic classification system for the recognition of the four classes of arousal and two classes of valence. Experimental results demonstrated that a quadratic discriminant classifier, tested through Leave-One-Subject-Out procedure, was able to achieve a recognition accuracy of 84.72 percent on the valence dimension, and 84.26 percent on the arousal dimension.",2015.0,101.0,168.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '385-394', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Nardelli2015RecognizingEI,\n author = {M.

Despite the growing amount of research on the role of leadership in the entrepreneurial process, the emergence of leaders in nascent venture teams has rarely been explored. Drawing on theories and research on leadership emergence and emotion regulation, we argue that the two aspects of emotion regulation (i.e., reappraisal and suppression) exert opposite effects on the degree to which nascent venture team members come to perceive an individual as a leader. We also theorize that team emotions arising from affective events moderate the relationship between reappraisal and leader emergence in such teams. Data from 103 nascent venture teams without prior leaders show a negative relationship between individuals’ trait disposition to suppress emotions and their emergence as leaders, and a positive relationship between their trait disposition to reappraise emotions and their emergence as leaders. Moreover, we find that negative team emotions magnify the positive association between reappraisal and leader emergence, while positive team emotions mitigate it. We discuss the implications of our findings for the literature on entrepreneurial leadership, entrepreneurial emotions, and leadership in general.",2020.0,134.0,13.0,"{'volume': '57', 'pages': '931-961', 'name': 'Journal of Management Studies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sirén2020LeaderEI,\n author = {Charlotta Sirén and Vivianna Fang He and Henrik Wesemann and Zoe Jonassen and Dietmar Grichnik and G.

We present a novel approach to this problem based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) and Multi-view Hidden Conditional Random Fields (MV-HCRF). Our approach uses a nonlinear kernel to map multimodal data to a high-dimensional feature space and finds a new projection of the data that maximizes the correlation across modalities. We use a multi-chain structured graphical model with disjoint sets of latent variables, one set per modality, to jointly learn both view-shared and view-specific sub-structures of the projected data, capturing interaction across modalities explicitly. We evaluate our approach on a task of agreement and disagreement recognition from nonverbal audio-visual cues using the Canal 9 dataset.

Not until recently was the mismatch negativity (MMN), a component of the event‐related potentials to an odd stimulus in a sequence of stimuli, utilized as an index of preattentive salience detection of emotional voice processing. However, their relationship remains to be delineated. This study combined the fMRI scanning and event‐related potential recording by examining amygdala reactivity in response to explicit and implicit (backward masked) perception of fearful and angry faces, along with recording MMN in response to the fearfully and angrily spoken syllables dada in healthy subjects who varied in trait anxiety (STAI‐T). Results indicated that the amplitudes of fearful MMN were positively correlated with left amygdala reactivity to explicit perception of fear, but negatively correlated with right amygdala reactivity to implicit perception of fear. The fearful MMN predicted STAI‐T along with left amygdala reactivity to explicit fear, whereas the association between fearful MMN and STAI‐T was mediated by right amygdala reactivity to implicit fear. These findings suggest that amygdala reactivity in response to explicit and implicit threatening faces exhibits opposite associations with emotional MMN. In terms of emotional processing, MMN not only reflects preattentive saliency detection but also stands at the crossroads of explicit and implicit perception.

Prior work in individual psychology, however, suggests that holistic experiences with technology as captured in constructs such as enjoyment and flow are potentially important explanatory variables in technology acceptance theories. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional construct labeled cognitive absorption and defined as a state of deep involvement with software. Cognitive absorption, theorized as being exhibited through the five dimensions of 
 
temporal dissociation, focused immersion, heightened enjoyment, control, and curiosity, is posited to be a proximal antecedent of two important beliefs about technology use: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. In addition, we propose that the individual traits of playfulness and personal innovativeness are important determinants of cognitive absorption. Based on the conceptual definition of this construct, operational measures for each dimension are developed. Using the World Wide Web as the target technology, scale validation indicates that the operational measures have acceptable psychometric properties and confirmatory factor analysis supports the proposed multi-dimensional structure. Structural equation analysis provides evidence for the theorized nomological net of cognitive absorption.

Humanoid robotics is a “bleeding edge” field of research, with constant flux in sensors, actuators, and processors. Code reuse and maintenance is therefore a significant challenge. We describe the main problems we faced and the solutions we adopted.

This practice has raised concerns in society and academia; however, its effects among children remain unstudied. Therefore, we investigated the effects of profile targeting on children's brand responses (i.e., brand attitude and purchase intention). We examined two types of targeting: targeting of product and of form (i.e., color). In addition, we tested three underlying mechanisms: liking the advertisement, perceived personal relevance of the advertisement, and recognizing the targeting aspect of the advertisement (targeting recognition). A between-subjects experiment among 231 children aged 9–13 years showed that targeting the product leads to more positive brand attitudes and purchase intentions. In addition, the effects were explained by ad liking and not by perceived personal relevance or targeting recognition. These findings suggest that, unlike adults, children do not process profile targeting on an elaborate critical level. Rather, the processing seems to be less elaborate.",2017.0,71.0,53.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '396 - 414', 'name': 'International Journal of Advertising'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Reijmersdal2017ProcessesAE,\n author = {E.

2409,ce0b8b6fca7dc089548cc2e9aaac3bae82bb19da,Making machine learning models interpretable,"Data of different levels of complexity and of ever growing diversity of characteristics are the raw materials that machine learning practitioners try to model using their wide palette of methods and tools. The obtained models are meant to be a synthetic representation of the available, observed data that captures some of their intrinsic regularities or patterns. Therefore, the use of machine learning techniques for data analysis can be understood as a problem of pattern recognition or, more informally, of knowledge discovery and data mining. There exists a gap, though, between data modeling and knowledge extraction. Models, de- pending on the machine learning techniques employed, can be described in diverse ways but, in order to consider that some knowledge has been achieved from their description, we must take into account the human cog- nitive factor that any knowledge extraction process entails. These models as such can be rendered powerless unless they can be interpreted ,a nd the process of human interpretation follows rules that go well beyond techni- cal prowess. For this reason, interpretability is a paramount quality that machine learning methods should aim to achieve if they are to be applied in practice. This paper is a brief introduction to the special session on interpretable models in machine learning, organized as part of the 20 th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational In- telligence and Machine Learning.

However, the GAD-7 was not yet validated in the general population and thus far, normative data are not available. Objectives:To investigate reliability, construct validity, and factorial validity of the GAD-7 in the general population and to generate normative data. Research Design:Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted in Germany between May 5 and June 8, 2006. Subjects:Five thousand thirty subjects (53.6% female) with a mean age (SD) of 48.4 (18.0) years. Measures:The survey questionnaire included the GAD-7, the 2-item depression module from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and demographic characteristics. Results:Confirmatory factor analyses substantiated the 1-dimensional structure of the GAD-7 and its factorial invariance for gender and age. Internal consistency was identical across all subgroups (α = 0.89). Intercorrelations with the PHQ-2 and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were r = 0.64 (P < 0.001) and r = −0.43 (P < 0.001), respectively. As expected, women had significantly higher mean (SD) GAD-7 anxiety scores compared with men [3.2 (3.5) vs. 2.7 (3.2); P < 0.001]. Normative data for the GAD-7 were generated for both genders and different age levels. Approximately 5% of subjects had GAD-7 scores of 10 or greater, and 1% had GAD-7 scores of 15 or greater. Conclusions:Evidence supports reliability and validity of the GAD-7 as a measure of anxiety in the general population. The normative data provided in this study can be used to compare a subject's GAD-7 score with those determined from a general population reference group.",2008.0,55.0,2687.0,"{'volume': '46', 'pages': '266-274', 'name': 'Medical Care'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Löwe2008ValidationAS,\n author = {B.

Surveillance has become a normalized mode of interpersonal relation that urges the person as consumer to manage others around her using surveillant products and services.

These models frequently intersect and hybridize as market logics overlap with intimate spheres: the surveillant consumer thus acts as an emotional manager of the experience of everyday surveillance.

Next, we describe four deep belief network (DBN) models and show that these models generate robust multimodal features for emotion classification in an unsupervised manner. Our experimental results show that the DBN models perform better than the state of the art methods for emotion recognition.

Finally, the “strong” version posits that properly designed regulation may induce cost-saving innovation that more than compensates for the cost of compliance. In this paper, we test the significance of these different variants of the Porter Hypothesis using data on the four main elements of the hypothesised causality chain (environmental policy, research and development, environmental performance and commercial performance). The analysis is based upon a unique database which includes observations from approximately 4200 facilities in seven OECD countries. In general, we find strong support for the “weak” version, qualified support for the “narrow” version, and qualified support for the “strong” version as well.",2011.0,107.0,718.0,{'name': 'Nonprofit Organizations eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Lanoie2011EnvironmentalPI,\n author = {P.

This article aims to systematically review the experience of carers of persons with personality disorders. MethodThe PRISMA systematic review method was followed, and empirical studies written in English, published between 1996 and 2011, and cited in major electronic databases were searched. Studies meeting the following selection criteria were included: (1) carers or families of persons with personality disorders; (2) intervention involving the carers or families; (3) burden or related construct used. Studies were required to meet either criteria 1 and 3 or criteria 2 and 3. Reference lists were scanned, and experts were consulted for further studies. ResultsSix studies met inclusion criteria, representing data on 465 carers. Five of the six studies focused on carers of persons with borderline personality disorder. The findings indicated that carers experience elevated objective and subjective burden, grief, impaired empowerment, and mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. Scores on objective and subjective burden were half a standard deviation above the mean compared to carers of inpatients with other serious mental illnesses. ConclusionsThis study is the first to report data on a large, aggregated sample of carers of persons with personality disorders. Significant gaps in the literature remain, and it is recommended that future research focus on the burden and support needs of carers of persons across different personality disorders, that attention be paid to the gender balance of patients, and that data be reported in a way to allow meta-analysis.",2013.0,62.0,70.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '248–258', 'name': 'Harvard Review of Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bailey2013BurdenAS,\n author = {Rachel C.

In this article, we adopt the perspective that conceptualizes new technologies as social experiments, stressing their experimental character to deal with the inherent uncertainty that affects their behavior. We suggest that the kind of experiments performed when evaluating robots in specific contexts of use are explorative experiments, i.e., investigations carried out in the absence of a proper theory or theoretical background that diverge from the traditional notion of controlled experiments. Considering this epistemological shift, we apply the ethical framework proposed by van de Poel for experimental technologies to the case of robotics, and we discuss its implications on the design of robots. To make our discussion more concrete, we reference the field of robots for search and rescue, which offers a challenging opportunity to test socioethical approaches to the development of robots and their interactions with environments and humans.",2018.0,11.0,21.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '30-36', 'name': 'IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Amigoni2018EthicsFR,\n author = {F.

This capacity helps us to perceive or predict the subsequent actions of people, interact effectively with them and to be sympathetic and sensitive toward them. Hence, one should expect that a machine needs to have a similar capability of understanding people's feelings in order to correctly interact with humans. Current research on emotion recognition has focused on the analysis of facial expressions. However, recognizing emotions requires also understanding the scene in which a person is immersed. The unavailability of suitable data to study such a problem has made research in emotion recognition in context difficult. In this paper, we present the EMOTIC database (from EMOTions In Context), a database of images with people in real environments, annotated with their apparent emotions. We defined an extended list of 26 emotion categories to annotate the images, and combined these annotations with three common continuous dimensions: Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. Images in the database are annotated using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform. The resulting set contains 18,313 images with 23,788 annotated people. The goal of this paper is to present the EMOTIC database, detailing how it was created and the information available. We expect this dataset can help to open up new horizons on creating systems able of recognizing rich information about people's apparent emotional states.",2017.0,31.0,28.0,"{'pages': '2309-2317', 'name': '2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kosti2017EMOTICEI,\n author = {Ronak Kosti and J.

In the current study, our purpose was to build up a mediation model that could explain how the depression caused by perceived work stress (PWS) would be reduced by lowering subjective well-being (SWB). A total random sample of 1214 teachers was recruited and measured by Subjective Well-Being Scale, Taiwan Depression Scale, and perceived work stress from students, parents, and peers. The whole data were analyzed by ANOVA, Pearson correlations, and structure equation modeling (SEM). Results showed that 1) PWS differed by positions of teachers. 2) PWS from students, parents, and peers had significantly caused Depression. 3) SWB successfully mediated the effects of the PWS and Depression. The current results further provided an empirical proof of how PWS lower teachers' well-being in psychology, social, and emotion of SWB.

To investigate these issues, we asked participants to rate the angry level of neutral and angry prosodies before and after sound intensity modification in Experiment 1, and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) for mismatching emotional prosodies with and without sound intensity modification and for matching emotional prosodies while participants performed emotional feature or sound intensity congruity judgment in Experiment 2. It was found that sound intensity modification had significant effect on the rating of angry level for angry prosodies, but not for neutral ones. Moreover, mismatching emotional prosodies, relative to matching ones, induced enhanced N2/P3 complex and theta band synchronization irrespective of sound intensity modification and task demands. However, mismatching emotional prosodies with reduced sound intensity showed prolonged peak latency and decreased amplitude in N2/P3 complex and smaller theta band synchronization. These findings suggest that though it cannot categorically affect emotionality conveyed in emotional prosodies, sound intensity contributes to emotional significance quantitatively, implying that sound intensity should not simply be taken as a control parameter and its unique role needs to be specified in vocal emotion studies.",2012.0,51.0,21.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Chen2012TheCO,\n author = {Xuhai Chen and Jianfeng Yang and Shuzhen Gan and Yufang Yang},\n journal = {PLoS ONE},\n title = {The Contribution of Sound Intensity in Vocal Emotion Perception: Behavioral and Electrophysiological Evidence},\n volume = {7},\n year = {2012}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2108923337', 'name': 'Xuhai Chen'}, {'authorId': '2109722454', 'name': 'Jianfeng Yang'}, {'authorId': '7355753', 'name': 'Shuzhen Gan'}, {'authorId': '49307385', 'name': 'Yufang Yang'}]"

To accomplish such efficacious interaction, the next-generation AEI need comprehensive human emotion models for training. Unlike theory of emotion, which has been the historical focus in psychology, emotion models are a descriptive tools. In practice, the strongest models need robust coverage, which means defining the smallest core set of emotions from which all others can be derived. To achieve the desired coverage, we turn to word embeddings from natural language processing. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, our experiments show that with as few as 15 discrete emotion categories, we can provide maximum coverage across six major languages--Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In support of our findings, we also examine annotations from two large-scale emotion recognition datasets to assess the validity of existing emotion models compared to human perception at scale.

Eight first class professional male rugby union players maintained diaries over a 28-day period. The diaries included a stressor checklist, an open-ended coping response section, and a Likert-type scale evaluation of coping effectiveness. Total reported stressors and coping strategies were tallied and analyzed longitudinally. The most frequently cited stressors were injury concerns, mental errors, and physical errors. The most frequently cited coping strategies were increased concentration, blocking, positive reappraisal, and being focused on the task.

To do so, we argue, the legal reaction should be grounded in an empirical analysis and proceed case-by-case, bottom-up, as a series of responses to concrete research questions. The ambition of this report has been to commence and facilitate that process. We extensively document and evaluate the market practice of the corporate use of AI, map the scholarly debates about (consumer) law and artificial intelligence, and present a list of twenty five research questions which, in our opinion, require attention of regulators and academia. The report is divided into four sections. The first explains our understanding of the concepts of “artificial intelligence” (a set of socio-technological practices enabled by machine learning and big data) and “consumer law” (various legal instruments concretizing the principles of the weaker party protection, non-discrimination, regulated autonomy and consumer privacy). The second section documents the ways in which the business uses artificial intelligence in seven sectors of the economy: finance and insurance, information services, energy and “smart solutions”, retail, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and legal services. For each analyzed sector we study the gains for the businesses stemming from the deployment of AI, the potential gains, but also challenges for consumers, as well as third party effects. In the third section, we repeat the analysis through the lens of four general “uses” of AI by businesses in various sectors: knowledge generation, automated decision making, advertising and other commercial practices and personal digital assistants. Finally, in the fourth section, we present the questions which we believe should be addressed in the next stage of the research. We cluster them into: normative questions about regulatory goals, technological and governance questions about regulatory means, and theoretical questions about concepts and preconceptions.",2018.0,63.0,25.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': ""@Inproceedings{Jablonowska2018ConsumerLA,\n author = {A.

But it is not clear whether and how the two kinds of emotional meanings are linked. The present study is focused on exploring the emotional connotations of musical timbre of isolated instrument sounds through the perspective of emotional speech prosody. The stimuli were isolated instrument sounds and emotional speech prosody categorized by listeners into anger, happiness and sadness, respectively. We first analyzed the timbral features of the stimuli, which showed that relations between the three emotions were relatively consistent in those features for speech and music. The results further echo the size-code hypothesis in which different sound timbre indicates different body size projections. Then we conducted an ERP experiment using a priming paradigm with isolated instrument sounds as primes and emotional speech prosody as targets. The results showed that emotionally incongruent instrument-speech pairs triggered a larger N400 response than emotionally congruent pairs. Taken together, this is the first study to provide evidence that the timbre of simple and isolated musical instrument sounds can convey emotion in a way similar to emotional speech prosody.",2018.0,60.0,11.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Liu2018EmotionalCO,\n author = {Xiaoluan Liu and Yi Xu and K.

The idea that conceptual metaphors actually influence reasoning has been corroborated by Thibodeau and Boroditsky, who showed that, when crime is metaphorically presented as a beast, readers become more enforcement-oriented than when crime is metaphorically framed as a virus. Recently, Steen, Reijnierse and Burgers replied that this metaphorical framing effect does not seem to occur and suggested that the question should be rephrased about the conditions under which metaphors do or do not influence reasoning. In this paper, we investigate whether presenting the COVID-19 pandemic as a war affects people’s reasoning about the pandemic. Data collected suggest that the metaphorical framing effect does not occur by default. Rather, socio-political individual variables such as speakers’ political orientation and source of information favor the acceptance of metaphor congruent entailments: right-wing participants and participants relying on independent sources of information are those more conditioned by the COVID-19 war metaphor, thus more inclined to prefer bellicose options.",2020.0,61.0,39.0,"{'volume': '16', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Panzeri2020DoesTC,\n author = {F.

The primary objective of this study was to explore the major issues for farmers in adopting biogas plants. The sample size was identified through the snowball sampling method. A total of 51 respondents of biogas plant adopters participated in this study. The structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data through respondents. The formulated suppositions were assessed by partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that all independent variables are significant and positively correlated with adopting biogas technology, reducing energy crises, and attaining cost-saving purposes. The results further indicated that the low cost and clear policy positively and significantly attract farmers to adopt biogas plants. The selected variables and their adopted moderation have a significant and positive impact on this conceptual model. The findings further indicate that major maintenance and day-to-day operations of biogas plants are expensive due to a lack of skilled operators, untrained or partially trained owners, and the unavailability of technicians. The results suggested that the government needs to plan a clear policy, provide short operation courses and technical support with skilled technicians to biogas plant owners, and launch a media campaign about maintenance to develop biogas plants.",2022.0,72.0,15.0,{'volume': '10'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Ali2022EvaluatingBO,\n author = {Shahid Ali and Q.

The BSL-95 items are based on criteria of the DSM-IV, the revised version of the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Personality Disorder, and the opinions of both clinical experts and borderline patients. The BSL-95 includes 95 items. In order to reduce patient burden and assessment time, a short version with 23 items (BSL-23) was developed. Methods: The development of the BSL-23 was based on a sample of 379 borderline patients, considering the items from the BSL-95 that had the highest levels of sensitivity to change and the highest ability to discriminate borderline patients from other patient groups. In a second step, the psychometric properties of the BSL-23 were investigated and compared with the psychometric properties of the BSL-95 in 5 different samples, including a total of 659 borderline patients. Results: In all of the samples, a high correlation of the sum score was found between the BSL-23 and the BSL-95 (range: 0.958–0.963). The internal consistency was high for both versions (BSL-23/Cronbach’s α: 0.935–0.969; BSL-95/Cronbach’s α: 0.977–0.978). Both BSL-23 and BSL-95 clearly discriminated borderline personality disorder patients from patients with an axis I diagnosis (mean effect sizes were 1.13 and 0.96 for the BSL-23 and BSL-95, respectively). In addition, comparisons before and after 3 months of dialectical behavior therapy revealed a numerically larger effect size for the BSL-23 (d = 0.47) compared to the BSL-95 (d = 0.38). Conclusion: The results indicate that the BSL-23 is an efficient and convenient self-rating instrument that displays good psychometric properties comparable to those of the BSL-95. The BSL-23 also demonstrated sensitivity to the effects of therapy.",2008.0,20.0,488.0,"{'volume': '42', 'pages': '32 - 39', 'name': 'Psychopathology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Bohus2008TheSV,\n author = {M.

In addition, the reliability and validity of the smartphone addiction scale (SAS) was demonstrated. Methods A total of 197 participants were selected from Nov. 2011 to Jan. 2012 to accomplish a set of questionnaires, including SAS, K-scale, modified Kimberly Young Internet addiction test (Y-scale), visual analogue scale (VAS), and substance dependence and abuse diagnosis of DSM-IV. There were 64 males and 133 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years (M = 26.06; SD = 5.96). Factor analysis, internal-consistency test, t-test, ANOVA, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of SAS. Results Based on the factor analysis results, the subscale “disturbance of reality testing” was removed, and six factors were left. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of SAS were verified (Cronbach's alpha = 0.967). SAS and its subscales were significantly correlated with K-scale and Y-scale. The VAS of each factor also showed a significant correlation with each subscale. In addition, differences were found in the job (p<0.05), education (p<0.05), and self-reported smartphone addiction scores (p<0.001) in SAS. Conclusions This study developed the first scale of the smartphone addiction aspect of the diagnostic manual. This scale was proven to be relatively reliable and valid.",2013.0,20.0,1084.0,"{'volume': '8', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kwon2013DevelopmentAV,\n author = {Min Kwon and Joon-Yeop Lee and W.

The authors bring our analysis and theoretical discussion beyond the widely applied technology acceptance models to examine the introduction of electronic tools too focused on technology functionality and short time analysis sights. Organizational and socioeconomic aspects together with the functionality of new concrete technological tools influence the innovation processes including work transformations. Based on the model of innovation proposed by Ebbers and Van Dijk (2007) the article focuses on the analysis of employees' resistance and support in innovation processes of the introduction of public government electronic tools. The authors apply the model to the case of the introduction of the Electronic Records System (ERS) (an electronic tool for the document management of unemployed persons) in a public organization in Germany. The analysis reveals that technology driven innovation ignoring work habits and transformations leads to employees` resistance to change. A conceptual redefinition of Ebbers and Van Dick's model based on the analysis results of the ERS including an extension of the resistance and support concepts as well as indicators is proposed.,2014.0,20.0,14.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '1-17', 'name': 'Int.

This work proposes multilevel thresholding based on optimization technique for the extraction of region of interest and compression of DICOM images by an improved prediction lossless algorithm for telemedicine applications. The role of compression algorithm is inevitable in data storage and transfer. Compared to the conventional thresholding, multilevel thresholding technique plays an efficient role in image analysis. In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO), and Fractional Order Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (FODPSO) are employed in the estimation of the threshold value. The simulation results reveal that the FODPSO-based multilevel level thresholding generate superior results. The fractional coefficient in FODPSO algorithm makes it effective optimization with fast convergence rate. The classification and blending prediction-based lossless compression algorithm generates efficient results when compared with the JPEG lossy and JPEG lossless approaches. The algorithms are tested for various threshold values and higher value of PSNR indicates the proficiency of the proposed segmentation approach. The performance of the compression algorithms was validated by metrics and was found to be appropriate for data transfer in telemedicine.

2476,d3b739b233ee18e24248f32cff20a42f59311625,Induction and Profiling of Strong Multi-Componential Emotions in Virtual Reality,"Psychological theories of emotion have often defined an emotion as simultaneous changes in several mental and bodily components. In addition, appraisal theories assume that an appraisal component elicits changes in the other emotion components (e.g., motivational, behavioural, experiential). Neither the componential definition of emotion nor appraisal theory have been systematically translated to paradigms for emotion induction, many of which rely on passive emotion induction without a clear theoretical framework. As a result, the observed emotions are often weak. This study explored the potential of virtual reality (VR) to evoke strong emotions in ecologically valid scenarios that fully engaged the mental and bodily components of the participant. Participants played several VR games and reported on their emotions. Multivariate analyses using hierarchical clustering and multilevel linear modelling showed that participants experienced intense, multi-componential emotions in VR. We identified joy and fear clusters of responses, each involving changes in appraisal, motivation, physiology, feeling, and regulation. Appraisal variables were found to be the most predictive for fear and joy intensities, compared to other emotion components, and were found to explain individual differences in VR scenarios, as predicted by appraisal theory. The results advocate for upgraded methodologies for the induction and analysis of emotion processes.",2018.0,76.0,42.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '189-202', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Meuleman2018InductionAP,\n author = {B.

We review randomized controlled psychotherapy trials to find those that are empirically supported with respect to acute symptom reduction and the prevention of subsequent relapse and recurrence. Methods: We searched the PsycINFO and PubMed databases and the reference sections of chapters and journal articles to identify appropriate articles. Results: One hundred twenty‐five studies were found evaluating treatment efficacy for the various mood disorders. With respect to the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and behavior therapy (BT) are efficacious and specific and brief dynamic therapy (BDT) and emotion‐focused therapy (EFT) are possibly efficacious. CBT is efficacious and specific, mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy (MBCT) efficacious, and BDT and EFT possibly efficacious in the prevention of relapse/recurrence following treatment termination and IPT and CBT are each possibly efficacious in the prevention of relapse/recurrence if continued or maintained. IPT is possibly efficacious in the treatment of dysthymic disorder. With respect to bipolar disorder (BD), CBT and family‐focused therapy (FFT) are efficacious and interpersonal social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) possibly efficacious as adjuncts to medication in the treatment of depression. Psychoeducation (PE) is efficacious in the prevention of mania/hypomania (and possibly depression) and FFT is efficacious and IPSRT and CBT possibly efficacious in preventing bipolar episodes. Conclusions: The newer psychological interventions are as efficacious as and more enduring than medications in the treatment of MDD and may enhance the efficacy of medications in the treatment of BD.

Drawing on interviews with 17 parent bloggers, we explore how parents define the borders of their digital selves and justify what is their “story to tell.” We find that bloggers grapple with profound ethical dilemmas, as representing their identities as parents inevitably makes public aspects of their children’s lives, introducing risks that they are, paradoxically, responsible for safeguarding against. Parents thus evaluate what to share by juggling multiple obligations—to themselves, their children in the present and imagined into the future, and to their physical and virtual communities. The digital practices of representing the relational self are impeded more than eased by the individualistic notion of identity instantiated by digital platforms, thereby intensifying the ambivalence of both parents and the wider society in judging emerging genres of blogging the self.",2017.0,75.0,181.0,"{'volume': '15', 'pages': '110 - 125', 'name': 'Popular Communication'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Blum-Ross2017SharentingPB,\n author = {Alicia Blum-Ross and S.

In this study, we analyzed how much information is needed to decode a vocally expressed emotion using affect bursts, a gating paradigm, and linear mixed models. We showed that some emotions (fear, anger, disgust) were significantly better recognized at full-duration than others (joy, sadness, neutral). As predicted, recognition improved when greater proportion of the stimuli was presented. Emotion recognition curves for anger and disgust were best described by higher order polynomials (second to third), while fear, sadness, neutral, and joy were best described by linear relationships. Acoustic features were extracted for each stimulus and subjected to a principal component analysis for each emotion. The principal components were successfully used to partially predict the accuracy of recognition (i.e., for anger, a component encompassing acoustic features such as fundamental frequency (f0) and jitter; for joy, pitch and loudness range). Furthermore, the impact of the principal components on the recognition of anger, disgust, and sadness changed with longer portions being presented. These results support the importance of studying the unfolding conscious recognition of emotional vocalizations to reveal the differential contributions of specific acoustical feature sets. It is likely that these effects are due to the relevance of threatening information to the human mind and are related to urgent motor responses when people are exposed to potential threats as compared with emotions where no such urgent response is required (e.g., joy).",2018.0,59.0,7.0,"{'volume': '13', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Schaerlaeken2018UnfoldingAD,\n author = {S.

Research yielded emotional intelligence as potential variable to explain emotional upheavals in working domains; subjective well-being. Connection between emotional intelligence and contemporary domain of positive psychology, especially in the spectrum of subjective well-being are debateable for researchers. Present research conducted to explore association between subjective well-being and emotional intelligence among the teachers of public colleges of Lahore. Sample of the research consisted of 716 teachers; 324 male and 392 females conveniently selected from 20 colleges; 10 male and 10 female colleges of District Lahore. Data were collected through administering Emotional Quotient Inventory: Adult Version (Bar-On, 1997) consisted of 117 items divided into five components. Measure of Happiness Questionnaire was adopted to gauge the subjective well-being of teachers. Reliability of the instruments was confirmed in SPSS by calculating Cronbach’s Alpha scores; .955 and .795 respectively. Data was collected from the respondents after getting permission from heads of the institutions. Normality of the data were calculated in SPSS by using Shapiro-Wilk’s test, p>.05, n<2000. Findings report a large positive correlation between teachers’ emotional intelligence and their subjective well-beings, and there exists a significant small correlation between emotional intelligence and gender. Research recommends that heads of the institutions need to arrange trainings, conduct seminars and ensure presence of motivational speakers to enhance male and female college teachers’ well- being focusing their emotions towards constructive tasks.

The symbolic approach views cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation. Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter Gardenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist approaches. Symbolic representation is particularly weak at modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the symbolic approach. Gardenfors's theory of conceptual spaces presents a framework for representing information on the conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions. The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be applied to the development of artificial systems capable of solving cognitive tasks. Gardenfors also shows how conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning concept formation, induction, and semantics.

The aim of this study was to investigate voice loudness and gender effects on jitter and shimmer in healthy young adults because previous descriptions have been inconsistent.


METHOD
Fifty-seven healthy adults (28 women, 29 men) aged 20-40 years were included in this cross-sectional single-cohort study. Three phonations of /a/ at soft, medium, and loud individual loudness were recorded and analyzed using PRAAT software (P. Boersma & D. Weeninkk, 2006). Voice loudness and gender effects on measured sound pressure level, fundamental frequency, jitter, and shimmer were assessed through the use of descriptive and inferential (analysis of variance) statistics.


RESULTS
Jitter and shimmer significantly increased with decreasing voice loudness, especially in phonations below 75 dB and 80 dB. In soft and medium phonation, men were generally louder and showed significantly less shimmer. However, men had higher jitter measures when phonating softly. Gender differences in jitter and shimmer at medium loudness may be mainly linked to different habitual voice loudness levels.


CONCLUSION
This pragmatic study shows significant voice loudness and gender effects on perturbation. In clinical assessment, requesting phonations above 80 dB at comparable loudness between genders would enhance measurement reliability. However, voice loudness and gender effects in other age groups, in disordered voices, or when a minimal loudness is requested should be further investigated.",2008.0,31.0,128.0,"{'volume': '51 5', 'pages': '\n          1152-60\n        ', 'name': 'Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Brockmann2008VoiceLA,\n author = {Meike Brockmann and C.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether middle school students have enough trust in AI machines, to explore their internal psychology, and to evaluate the intervention effect of AI in middle school students' one-to-one psychological intervention system. Subjects and Methods 76 eighth grade students from two parallel classes in the same grade were randomly assigned to the same teacher. The research tools used include two sets of autonomic nerve detectors produced by South Korean medicore company and two sets of self-developed artificial intelligence one-to-one psychological intervention systems, including two artificial intelligence robots Xiaoxin and two emotional bracelets. 36 students in the intervention group received one-on-one intervention of artificial intelligence robot Xiaoxin, and t-test was conducted on physical stress, psychological stress, stress index, sympathetic nerve activity, stress resistance and average heart rate. Test participants can effectively alleviate psychological stress and prevent depression. The data showed that the DASS-21 comprehensive score of subjects participating in the test was 1.7 times that of subjects not participating in the test. In contrast, without participation, they are more likely to show depression, anxiety and stress, and tend to be passive in simple coping styles. The improved method can effectively alleviate the psychological pressure of employees and improve the ability to actively deal with pressure. Results Except for the four indexes of nerve stress and sympathetic nerve activity, P < 0.001. After the intervention, the average heart rate, physical stress and stress index decreased significantly, while the anti stress ability increased significantly. Statistical analysis shows that the one-to-one intervention of artificial intelligence robot Xiaoxin can effectively alleviate students' physical stress and stress index, and improve students' stress resistance.

The above results show that emotional arousal plays a partial mediating role in the influence of anger on the fluency and novelty of malicious creativity and general creativity, but it has no mediating role in the influence of anger on the harmfulness of malicious creativity. Conclusion Artificial intelligence one-to-one psychological intervention system is effective. Among the 38 students in the intervention group, this shows that most students have a high sense of trust in the artificial intelligence robot Xiaoxin. This sense of trust is enough to make the artificial intelligence one-to-one psychological intervention system play the role of psychological intervention. We should fully understand the important position of artificial intelligence robot in emotional factors, actively improve its role psychological ability, pay special attention to its impact on life attitude and healthy behavior, and be a healthy self-manager, coordinator and collaborator. According to the psychological characteristics of these groups, we should actively and flexibly organize colorful activities, strive to create a relaxed and harmonious living atmosphere, create a friendly and mutually beneficial emotional artificial intelligence relationship, encourage and guide these groups, adjust their psychology to the best state, and promote the healthy development of their good cognition and life.",2022.0,0.0,0.0,"{'name': 'International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology', 'pages': 'A62 - A63', 'volume': '25'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2022EFFECTOA,\n author = {Erdong Wang and Wen-Lung Chang and J.

Over the past few years, there have been attempts of state regulation of artificial intelligence, both in Russia and in other countries of the world. Artificial intelligence poses new challenges to various areas of law: from patent to criminal law, from privacy to antitrust law. Among the current approaches, the most optimal is the creation of a separate legal regulation mechanism that creates a clear distinction between areas of responsibility of developers and users of systems with artificial intelligence and the technology itself. Today, the development of the legal framework for the existence of artificial intelligence can be conditionally divided into two approaches: the creation of a legal framework for the introduction of applied systems with artificial intelligence and stimulate their development; regulation of the sphere of creating artificial “super intelligence”, in particular, compliance of the developed technologies with generally recognized standards in the field of ethics and law. A separate area should be the introduction of uniform ethical principles for all developers and users of systems with artificial intelligence. The most optimal in this aspect is the approach implemented within the framework of the Asilomar principles. In these circumstances, the appeal to the problem of legal regulation of artificial intelligence is becoming more relevant than ever. This paper presents the results of a detailed analysis of existing approaches to the legal regulation of artificial intelligence.",2019.0,0.0,13.0,{'name': 'International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{None,\n booktitle = {International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering},\n journal = {International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering},\n title = {On Methods to Legal Regulation of Artificial Intelligence in the World},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}",[]

Neuroticism has been studied most extensively and is consistently associated with passive and ineffective coping mechanisms. Conscientiousness has emerged as an equally powerful predictor of coping; however, it is related to active, problem-focused response strategies. Extraversion is less broadly related to coping but tends to be correlated with social support seeking, positive reappraisal, and problem-focused coping. Openness is largely unrelated to many traditional coping inventories, but appears to reflect a more flexible, imaginative, and intellectually curious approach to problem solving. Finally, Agreeableness is only modestly related to coping. These results demonstrate the value of using well-articulated taxonomic schemes as a framework for trait-based research.",1996.0,80.0,617.0,"{'volume': '64', 'pages': '737-774', 'name': 'Journal of Personality'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Watson1996AdaptationalSA,\n author = {D.

We compared privacy policies from large companies, companies that are members of self-regulatory organizations, and non-member companies and found that many of them are silent with regard to important consumer-relevant practices including the collection and use of sensitive information and linkage of tracking data with personally-identifiable information. We evaluated these policies against self-regulatory guidelines and found that many policies are not fully compliant. Furthermore, the overly general requirements established in those guidelines allow companies to have compliant practices without providing transparency to users. Few companies disclose their data retention times or offer users the opportunity to access the information collected about them.

Latent class growth modeling, incorporating a time-varying covariate and a series of predictors assessed at the onset of the season, was used to chart out distinct longitudinal trajectories of affective states. Results provided evidence for 3 trajectories of positive affect and 3 trajectories of negative affect. Two of these trajectories were deflected by team selection, a seasonal turning point occurring after the 1st measurement point. Furthermore, the trajectories of positive and negative affective states were predicted by theoretically driven predictors assessed at the start of the season (i.e., self-determination, need satisfaction, athletic identity, and school identity).

To examine the effect of HRV biofeedback on symptoms of anxiety and stress, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted from PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. Methods The search identified 24 studies totaling 484 participants who received HRV biofeedback training for stress and anxiety. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. Results The pre-post within-group effect size (Hedges' g) was 0.81. The between-groups analysis comparing biofeedback to a control condition yielded Hedges' g = 0.83. Moderator analyses revealed that treatment efficacy was not moderated by study year, risk of study bias, percentage of females, number of sessions, or presence of an anxiety disorder.

After each video, the participants were scanned while performing a 3-back working memory task having either words or faces as stimuli. Task-related neural activity in bilateral PFC showed a predicted pattern: an Emotion × Stimulus crossover interaction, with no main effects, with activity predicting task performance. This highly specific result indicates that emotion and higher cognition can be truly integrated, i.e., at some point of processing, functional specialization is lost, and emotion and cognition conjointly and equally contribute to the control of thought and behavior.

2518,d7840b8c9f1a457ab33c57d30ee9ed78a866b8ad,Decision-Theoretic Planning: Structural Assumptions and Computational Leverage,"Planning under uncertainty is a central problem in the study of automated sequential decision making, and has been addressed by researchers in many different fields, including AI planning, decision analysis, operations research, control theory and economics. While the assumptions and perspectives adopted in these areas often differ in substantial ways, many planning problems of interest to researchers in these fields can be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and analyzed using the techniques of decision theory. This paper presents an overview and synthesis of MDP-related methods, showing how they provide a unifying framework for modeling many classes of planning problems studied in AI. It also describes structural properties of MDPs that, when exhibited by particular classes of problems, can be exploited in the construction of optimal or approximately optimal policies or plans. Planning problems commonly possess structure in the reward and value functions used to describe performance criteria, in the functions used to describe state transitions and observations, and in the relationships among features used to describe states, actions, rewards, and observations. Specialized representations, and algorithms employing these representations, can achieve computational leverage by exploiting these various forms of structure. Certain AI techniques -- in particular those based on the use of structured, intensional representations -- can be viewed in this way. This paper surveys several types of representations for both classical and decision-theoretic planning problems, and planning algorithms that exploit these representations in a number of different ways to ease the computational burden of constructing policies or plans. It focuses primarily on abstraction, aggregation and decomposition techniques based on AI-style representations.",1999.0,157.0,1263.0,"{'volume': '11', 'pages': '1-94', 'name': 'J. Artif. Intell.

We propose solutions for the rst two problems, and a partial remedy for the third. Building on prior work for algorithmic acceleration that is not based on approximation, we introduce a new algorithm that eeciently, searches the space of cluster locations and number of clusters to optimize the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) measure. The innovations include two new ways of exploiting cached suucient statistics and a new very eecient test that in one K-means sweep selects the most promising subset of classes for reenement. This gives rise to a fast, statistically founded algorithm that outputs both the number of classes and their parameters. Experiments show this technique reveals the true number of classes in the underlying distribution , and that it is much faster than repeatedly using accelerated K-means for different values of K.",2000.0,16.0,2640.0,{'pages': '727-734'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Pelleg2000XmeansEK,\n author = {D.

A sample of 520 university teachers was used, of which 339 (65.2%) were women. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to measure burnout, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used to measure perceived stress. A sociodemographic data questionnaire produced by the authors was also applied, which consisted of questions about age, sex, experience in the teaching profession and the participants’ teaching areas. The results indicated that university teachers over 60 years old exhibited lower levels of perceived stress, as did teachers with more teaching experience (30 years or more), and those with less experience (less than 10 years). Women exhibited higher levels of perceived stress than men. Women also scored higher levels of Emotional Exhaustion in the burnout dimensions, whereas teachers will less experience (under 10 years) and teachers with more experience (more than 30 years) had the lowest scores in this dimension. Through an examination of the relation between perceived stress and the burnout dimensions, we concluded that perceived stress was directly proportional to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization; and was inversely proportional to personal accomplishment.

2529,d865f534e39081fe506e30ff029ebdafa6c350ac,An FDA for Algorithms,"The rise of increasingly complex algorithms calls for critical thought about how best to prevent, deter, and compensate for the harms that they cause. This paper argues that the criminal law and tort regulatory systems will prove no match for the difficult regulatory puzzles algorithms pose. Algorithmic regulation will require federal uniformity, expert judgment, political independence, and pre-market review to prevent - without stifling innovation - the introduction of unacceptably dangerous algorithms into the market. This paper proposes that a new specialist regulatory agency should be created to regulate algorithmic safety. An FDA for algorithms.Such a federal consumer protection agency should have three powers. First, it should have the power to organize and classify algorithms into regulatory categories by their design, complexity, and potential for harm (in both ordinary use and through misuse). Second, it should have the power to prevent the introduction of algorithms into the market until their safety and efficacy has been proven through evidence-based pre-market trials. Third, the agency should have broad authority to impose disclosure requirements and usage restrictions to prevent algorithms’ harmful misuse.To explain why a federal agency will be necessary, this paper proceeds in three parts. First, it explains the diversity of algorithms that already exist and that are soon to come. In the future many algorithms will be “trained,” not “designed.” That means that the operation of many algorithms will be opaque and difficult to predict in border cases, and responsibility for their harms will be diffuse and difficult to assign. Moreover, although “designed” algorithms already play important roles in many life-or-death situations (from emergency landings to automated braking systems), increasingly “trained” algorithms will be deployed in these mission-critical applications.Second, this paper explains why other possible regulatory schemes - such as state tort and criminal law or regulation through subject-matter regulatory agencies - will not be as desirable as the creation of a centralized federal regulatory agency for the administration of algorithms as a category. For consumers, tort and criminal law are unlikely to efficiently counter the harms from algorithms. Harms traceable to algorithms may frequently be diffuse and difficult to detect. Human responsibility and liability for such harms will be difficult to establish. And narrowly tailored usage restrictions may be difficult to enforce through indirect regulation. For innovators, the availability of federal preemption from local and ex-post liability is likely to be desired. Third, this paper explains that the concerns driving the regulation of food, drugs, and cosmetics closely resemble the concerns that should drive the regulation of algorithms. With respect to the operation of many drugs, the precise mechanisms by which they produce their benefits and harms are not well understood. The same will soon be true of many of the most important (and potentially dangerous) future algorithms. Drawing on lessons from the fitful growth and development of the FDA, the paper proposes that the FDA’s regulatory scheme is an appropriate model from which to design an agency charged with algorithmic regulation.The paper closes by emphasizing the need to think proactively about the potential dangers algorithms pose. The United States created the FDA and expanded its regulatory reach only after several serious tragedies revealed its necessity. If we fail to anticipate the trajectory of modern algorithmic technology, history may repeat itself.",2016.0,5.0,132.0,{'name': 'Information Privacy Law eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Tutt2016AnFF,\n author = {A.

 The complexity and diversity of today's media landscape provides many challenges for researchers studying news producers.These producers use many different strategies to get theirmessage believed by readers through thewriting styles they employ, by repetition across different media sources with or without attribution, as well as other mechanismsthat are yet to be studied deeply. To better facilitate systematic studies in this area, we present a large political news data set, containing over 136K news articles, from 92 news sources, collected over 7 months of 2017. These news sources are carefully chosen to include well-established and mainstream sources, maliciously fake sources, satire sources, and hyper-partisan political blogs. In addition to each article we compute 130 content-based and social media engagement features drawn from a wide range of literature on political bias, persuasion, and misinformation. With the release of the data set, we also provide the source code for feature computation. In this paper, we discuss the first release of the data set and demonstrate 4 use cases of the data and features: news characterization, engagement characterization, news attribution and content copying, and discovering news narratives.

The emotional states induced by the stimuli were examined via a questionnaire rated on an 11-point scale, from +5 (pleasant) to −5 (unpleasant), through 0 (neutral), after the 5-min experiments. Results from 757 subjects revealed that Δ[oxy-Hb] in the PFC exhibited a weak, but significant, correlation with emotional change, with the given continual and mild stimuli similar to that experienced in response to the intense pleasant/unpleasant stimuli.

Despite the importance of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction, and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each theory type.

As a “lived experience,” entrepreneurship represents a cumulative series of interdependent events that takes on properties rooted in affect and emotion. Unique characteristics of entrepreneurial experiences are examined. The entrepreneur is presented as actor in an unscripted temporal performance who continually encounters novelty. A model and set of propositions are presented linking pre–venture experience, key events, experiential processing, learning, affective outcomes, and decision making. It is argued that the entrepreneur and venture emerge as a function of ongoing experience, with the venture creating the entrepreneur as the entrepreneur creates the venture.",2012.0,123.0,292.0,"{'volume': '36', 'pages': '11 - 40', 'name': 'Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Morris2012FramingTE,\n author = {Michael H.

To address these problems, we adopt an agent model where emotion and cognition are conceived as two integrated aspects of intelligent behavior and we present affective-emotional mechanisms that support the adaptation to changing environments and a controlled use of resources. These mechanisms produce an attention field that constrains the input to reasoning processes and also regulate the activation period of those processes.

Contrary to expectation, the effect was independent of the similarity between the report arid the estimated risk. An account of a fatal stabbing did not increase the frequency estimate of a closely related risk, homicide, more than the estimates of unrelated risks such as natural hazards. An account of a happy event that created positive affect produced a comparable global decrease in judged frequency of risks. As a society, we have never been more concerned with the assessment, the management, and the regulation of risk. Because public reaction to hazards from pesticides, nuclear power, or food additives appears to influence the regulation and management of these technologies, it is important to understand how the lay person perceives and evaluates risks. This is particularly true for hazards such as terrorism, nuclear power, or genetic engineering for which the available statistical data are very limited and where the assessments of the risks are based on subjective and intuitive judgments. Indeed, psychologists and other researchers have shown increasing interest in the manner in which people perceive and estimate the severity of various risks. Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, and Combs (1978) asked lay people to estimate the number of deaths per year that are due to various hazards. These investigators found that the subjective estimates were consistent across several methods of elicitation and correlated reasonably well (median r = .7) with actuarial estimates of frequency.

For this purpose, we trained and tested classifiers to distinguish whether a user is depressed or not using features extracted from his/ her activities in the network and tweets. The results showed that the more features are used, the higher are the accuracy and F-measure scores in detecting depressed users.

Such activities can include disabling or destroying surveillance cameras, mapping paths of least surveillance and disseminating that information over the Internet, employing video cameras to monitor sanctioned surveillance systems and their personnel, or staging public plays to draw attention to the prevalence of surveillance in society.

However, the role of individual differences in determining such different pupillary responses has not been assessed in this regard. Thus, we designed a pupillometry study with affective picture viewing in which we investigated for the first time whether self-reported measures of mindfulness and emotional regulation related to the pupil response. We collected pupil dilation data from 29 participants viewing a set of IAPS images with positive, neutral, and negative valence, presented in randomized order. For each image, we also collected subjective emotional experiences on three dimensions: valence, arousal, and dominance. Moreover, participants completed a battery of questionnaires assessing trait mindfulness and emotional regulation abilities. We found significant effects of image valence on both subjective ratings and pupillary response to the three different categories. We also found that emotional regulation affected the pupil minimum and maximum dilation in response to emotional stimuli, pleasant or unpleasant, while mindfulness reduce the time for recover pupil dilation after the first contraction in response to the stimulus onset. Overall, these results suggest that mindfulness had physiological effects on autonomic response and emotional regulation.",2022.0,28.0,0.0,"{'name': '2022 IEEE International Conference on Metrology for Extended Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering (MetroXRAINE)', 'pages': '471-476'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Simione2022PupilDA,\n author = {Luca Simione and Alisha Vabba and A.

Assessing entrepreneurs' regretful thinking,"New business formation is a formidable and daunting task, which may require personal perseverance and self-efficacy. If this is indeed the case, will entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs differ on such attributes? Also, if high levels of perseverance and self-efficacy help entrepreneurs to overcome setbacks, snags, and obstacles, do these positive attributes co-occur with significant personal costs, such as the tendency to experience regretful thinking? This study uses a random sample of 217 patent inventors in the medical industry (surgery devices) to address these questions. Results indicate that entrepreneurs score significantly higher on self-efficacy and on two distinct aspects of perseverance—perceived control over adversity and perceived responsibility regarding outcome of adversity—than did non-entrepreneurs. Also, although entrepreneurs report the same number of regrets, their regrets are stronger and are qualitatively different from those reported by non-entrepreneurs. These findings suggest that perseverance and self-efficacy do indeed co-occur with regretful thinking. Finally, post hoc analysis reveals that the higher the overall perseverance scores of patent inventors, the higher their annual earnings. We conclude by examining the implications for theory, researcher, and practice.

We use direct measures of local air pollution regulation to estimate their effects on abatement investment. Refineries not subject to these regulations are used as a comparison group. We study a period of sharply increased regulation between 1979 and 1992. Initial compliance with each regulation cost 3 million per plant and a further 5 million to comply with increased stringency. We construct measures of total factor productivity using Census of Manufacturers output and materials data that report physical quantities of inputs and outputs for the entire population of refineries. Despite high costs associated with the local regulations, productivity in the Los Angeles Air Basin refineries rose sharply between 1987 and 1992, which was a period of decreased refinery productivity in other regions.

However, confusion exists within the literature about the precise definition of telepresence. Furthermore, there is a need for a plausible and parsimonious model of telepresence. This paper identifies three types of telepresence extant in the literature: simple telepresence, cybernetic telepresence, and experiential telepresence. The third definition is the most interesting. This paper reviews the origins of experiential telepresence and the theoretical approaches commonly used to explain it. One can term these technological approaches, which emphasize the role of control/display technology, and psychological approaches, which identify experiential telepresence with known psychological phenomena. Finally, the paper presents and discusses an integrative approach to telepresence featuring a structured attentional resource model.

To address this problem, the University of Oldenburg's TrustSoft Graduate School aims to provide a holistic view of trustworthiness in software - one that considers system construction, evaluation/analysis, and certification - in an interdisciplinary setting. Component technology is the foundation of our research program. The choice of a component architecture greatly influences the resulting software systems' nonfunctional properties. We are developing new methods for the rigorous design of trustworthy software systems with predictable, provable, and ultimately legally certifiable system properties. We are well aware that it is impossible to build completely error-free complex software systems. We therefore complement fault-prevention and fault-removal techniques with fault-tolerance methods that introduce redundancy and diversity into software systems. Quantifiable attributes such as availability, reliability, and performance call for analytical prediction models, which require empirical studies for calibration and validation.

However, we actually hold considerable sway over our emotions: We influence which emotions we have and how we experience and express these emotions. The process model of emotion regulation described here suggests that how we regulate our emotions matters. Regulatory strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have quite different outcomes than strategies that act later. This review focuses on two widely used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing how we think about a situation in order to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It involves inhibiting the outward signs of emotion. Theory and research suggest that reappraisal is more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases the experience and behavioral expression of emotion, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease the experience of emotion, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding in both the suppressors and their social partners.",2001.0,20.0,1187.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '214 - 219', 'name': 'Current Directions in Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Gross2001EmotionRI,\n author = {J.

But automating ethical decision-making raises novel questions for engineers and designers, who will have to make decisions about how to accomplish that task. For example, some ethical decision-making involves hard moral cases, which in turn requires user input if we are to respect established norms surrounding autonomy and informed consent. The author considers this and other ethical considerations that accompany the automation of ethical decision-making. He proposes some general ethical requirements that should be taken into account in the design room, and sketches a design tool that can be integrated into the design process to help engineers, designers, ethicists, and policymakers decide how best to automate certain forms of ethical decision-making.",2016.0,33.0,28.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '787 - 809', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Millar2016AnEE,\n author = {J.

However, the specific neural mechanisms that underlie these difficulties remain understudied. This study aimed to use pupillometry as an index function of parasympathetic nervous system activation, to investigate the mechanisms underlying emotional regulation difficulties in individuals with PTSD. Method A total of 87 trauma-exposed mothers (34 with PTSD and 53 non-PTSD controls) completed an eye tracking assessment in which pupillary dilation in response to emotionally valenced stimuli was measured. The participants also completed two self-report measures of emotional regulation, namely the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale and the Emotional Regulations Questionnaire. Linear mixed-effect modelling was used to assess potential group differences. Results The PTSD group exhibited increased pupillary dilation to positively valenced stimuli compared to the non-PTSD group. However, no significant associations between the self-report measures and pupillary response to emotionally valenced stimuli were found. Conclusion Increased pupillary dilation in PTSD may reflect impaired parasympathetic nervous system processes. The lack of association of these measures with self-reported emotion regulation may suggest reporting biases. Larger studies with more generalised populations are required to consolidate these preliminary findings.",2021.0,38.0,2.0,"{'volume': '23', 'pages': '127 - 135', 'name': 'The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ginton2021InvestigatingPT,\n author = {Lee Ginton and E.

It may be argued, however, that successful adaptation depends not so much on any one regulatory process, but on the ability to flexibly enhance or suppress emotional expression in accord with situational demands. We tested this hypothesis among New York City college students in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Subjects' performance in a laboratory task in which they enhanced emotional expression, suppressed emotional expression, and behaved normally on different trials was examined as a prospective predictor of their adjustment across the first two years of college. Results supported the flexibility hypothesis. A regression analysis controlling for initial distress and motivation and cognitive resources found that subjects who were better able to enhance and suppress the expression of emotion evidenced less distress by the end of the second year.

Difficulties in emotion regulation have been proposed to be at the core of these cardinal symptoms of MDD. It remains unclear, however, what underlies emotion regulation difficulties. Cognitive theories of depression have focused on cognitive processes and recent studies suggest that cognitive biases and deficits in cognitive control may help explain affective symptoms of this disorder. Specifically, it is proposed that cognitive biases and deficits affect emotion regulation ability thereby setting the stage for maintained negative affect and diminished levels of positive affect.

Theoretical definition, categorization of affective state and the modalities of emotion expression are presented. To achieve this study, an SER system, based on different classifiers and different methods for features extraction, is developed. Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) and modulation spectral (MS) features are extracted from the speech signals and used to train different classifiers. Feature selection (FS) was applied in order to seek for the most relevant feature subset. Several machine learning paradigms were used for the emotion classification task. A recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier is used first to classify seven emotions. Their performances are compared later to multivariate linear regression (MLR) and support vector machines (SVM) techniques, which are widely used in the field of emotion recognition for spoken audio signals. Berlin and Spanish databases are used as the experimental data set. This study shows that for Berlin database all classifiers achieve an accuracy of 83% when a speaker normalization (SN) and a feature selection are applied to the features. For Spanish database, the best accuracy (94 %) is achieved by RNN classifier without SN and with FS.",2019.0,45.0,77.0,{'name': 'Social Media and Machine Learning'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Kerkeni2019AutomaticSE,\n author = {Leila Kerkeni and Y.

To address these questions, we adapted the auditory gating paradigm to estimate how much vocal information is needed for listeners to categorize five basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness) and neutral utterances produced by male and female speakers of English. Semantically-anomalous pseudo-utterances (e.g., The rivix jolled the silling) conveying each emotion were divided into seven gate intervals according to the number of syllables that listeners heard from sentence onset. Participants (n = 48) judged the emotional meaning of stimuli presented at each gate duration interval, in a successive, blocked presentation format. Analyses looked at how recognition of each emotion evolves as an utterance unfolds and estimated the “identification point” for each emotion. Results showed that anger, sadness, fear, and neutral expressions are recognized more accurately at short gate intervals than happiness, and particularly disgust; however, as speech unfolds, recognition of happiness improves significantly towards the end of the utterance (and fear is recognized more accurately than other emotions). When the gate associated with the emotion identification point of each stimulus was calculated, data indicated that fear (M = 517 ms), sadness (M = 576 ms), and neutral (M = 510 ms) expressions were identified from shorter acoustic events than the other emotions. These data reveal differences in the underlying time course for conscious recognition of basic emotions from vocal expressions, which should be accounted for in studies of emotional speech processing.",2011.0,108.0,122.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'PLoS ONE'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pell2011OnTT,\n author = {M.

Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. Objective The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, “Depression in College Students,” as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants’ comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy.

We hypothesize that this information is useful for differentiating between players and for understanding why human player behavior is attributed intentionality which we argue is a prerequisite for believability. To investigate these hypotheses we describe an experiment comparing 400 games in the Mario AI Benchmark testbed, played by humans, with equivalent games played by an approximately game theoretically rationally playing AI agent. The player actions’ deviations from the rational agent’s actions are subjected to feature extraction, and the resulting features are used to cluster play sessions into expressions of different play styles. We discuss how these styles differ, and how believable agent behavior might be approached by using these styles as an outset for a planning agent. Finally, we discuss the implications of making assumptions about rational game play and the problematic aspects of inferring player intentions from behavior.

Each acoustic dimension has specific weights depending on the nature of the expressed affects. The quantity of expressive information carried by each dimension separately (using Praat algorithms), as well as the processing implied to carry it (global value vs. contour) has been perceptively measured for a set of natural mono-syllabic utterances (Audibert et al, 2005). It has been shown that no parameter alone is able to carry the whole emotion information, F0 contours or global values revealed to bring more information on positive expressions, voice quality and duration conveyed more information on negative expressions, and the intensity contours did not bring any significant information when used alone. These selected stimuli, expressing anxiety, disappointment, disgust, disquiet, joy, resignation and sadness were resynthesized with an LF-ARX algorithm, and evaluated in the same perceptive protocol extended to the three voice quality parameters (source, filter and residue). The comparison of results between natural, TD-PSOLA resynthesized and LFARX resynthesized stimuli (1) globally confirms the relative weights of each dimension (2) diagnoses local minor artifacts of resynthesis (3) validates the efficiency of the LF-ARX algorithm (4) measures the relative importance of each of the three LF-ARX parameters.",2006.0,15.0,13.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Audibert2006ExpressiveSS,\n author = {N.

Perhaps triggered by the success of computer games, VEs are seen as an emergent and engaging new way by which children can learn experimental sciences and other disciplines. Inhabiting these IVEs can be agents or intelligent characters that are responsible for events that happen in the environment and make it not predictive or completely controlled. However, to build such environments, in particular, if populated by synthetic characters, one needs to carefully address the problem of how do the learners respond to the characters in the virtual environment. Do learners like the characters? Do learners identify themselves with characters in virtual environments? This relation between learners and characters in virtual environments can be studied in several perspectives. In this paper, we will focus primarily on the issue of empathy as one desirable aspect of the affective interaction between learners and synthetic characters. In particular, we will defend that in order for such affective relations to happen, characters should be created and designed taking into account what we call the proximity factor. This is based on the fact that children are found to respond more empathically to those that are perceived as similar to the self than those who are perceived as dissimilar (Barnett 1987). This appears to be the case when similarity is defined in terms of a shared characteristic, such as sex (Bryant 1982), race or in terms of shared personal experiences (Bryant 1982). Thus, designing characters aiming at pedagogical empathic interactions, we should carefully address how close the learner will feel with the synthetic characters developed in terms of situation, behavior or even physical appearance. In order to illustrate this factor in eliciting emotional reactions to synthetic characters, we will present a specific system called FearNot!. FearNot! was developed to address the difficult and often devastating problem of bullying in schools. By using role-playing and synthetic characters in a 3D environment, FearNot! allows children from age 8 to 12 to experience a virtual scenario where they can witness (in a third-person perspective) bullying situations. To build empathy into FearNot, we have considered the following components: agent's architecture, the characters' embodiment, the environment itself, and emotionally charged situations. All these elements were built to allow for a stronger proximity with the user and the system. In this paper, we will focus primarily on this problem and report some results achieved in the evaluation executed with 127 children and 95 adults on the system.",2005.0,33.0,187.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '235 - 266', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Paiva2005LEARNINGBF,\n author = {Ana Paiva and João Dias and Daniel Sobral and R.

2625,e03227e2077c9acbd71d3c4b99a9144f203e2261,Discussion: What Does the Public Think? Examining Plastic Surgery Perceptions through the Twitterverse.,"www.PRSJournal.com 275 P surgeons expend great effort at improving the public’s knowledge of our specialty, as demonstrated by the #DoYourHomework campaign of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, which aims to correct misconceptions of the rigor of our training, the breadth and depth of our specialty, and the improved quality of our patients’ lives. Our own sterling, hard-won board certification is often confused with those of other boards not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties. Having an accurate understanding of what a board-certified plastic surgeon is and does can be crucial to a patient’s safety.1 To measure the public’s perception of plastic surgery in objective terms, Kalandar et al. turned to Twitter and analyzed a selection of tweets containing the keyword or hashtag #PlasticSurgery.2 The tweets were randomly chosen from August 1, 2014, to December 30, 2016. The authors categorized the public’s perceptions and attitudes toward plastic surgery by breaking down the tweets by author, specialty, topic, content, information accuracy, source, retweet rate, emotion, and tone.2 Citing the bias of surveys, including those demonstrating the public’s association of plastic surgery with cosmetic surgery, the authors turned to Twitter to study the public’s attitudes. Their study did not investigate other popular social media apps,3 although Facebook has over 2 billion users,4 Instagram has 800 million,5 and Twitter has just 330 million.6 As with any study, an analysis is only as good as its data, and, unfortunately, 15 percent of Twitter users are suspected of being bots and fake accounts.7,8 Through personal communication, I know of two fake accounts that fraudulently assumed the identities, photographs, and biographies of plastic surgeons, both in positions of leadership. Even Twitter’s retweet rate is unreliable, because bots can be programmed to automatically retweet any post a user tweets9 or any post that contains a particular keyword or hashtag, such as #PlasticSurgery.10 A single individual can open up and control multiple accounts under discrete names and hidden identities, allowing actions that appear to be from many users to actually be generated by only one. Because Twitter is so widely gamed,11–13 it is associated with misinformation and disinformation and is thus a treacherous medium to use for a scientific study.14,15 To rate its accuracy, the authors ranked a post’s information according to its source, with the “most accurate” rank assigned to peer-reviewed journals and medical societies and a “low accuracy” rank assigned to blogs and medical spas. Although this categorization may be generally reliable, it overlooks the inaccessibility of peer-reviewed journal articles to the nonsubscribing public and the many accurate blogs written by plastic surgeons to communicate procedure and patient safety information in lay language. The content of an article, rather than the type of source, would be the best indication of accuracy. The authors state that the public wants fewer posts about celebrity plastic surgery and more about education and patient safety by board-certified plastic surgeons, citing the article by Branford et al.16 However, that finding was based on Twitter polls that did not distinguish answers by plastic surgeons from answers by the lay public. The response rate, as defined by the number of responses received divided by the total number of times the poll was seen (“impressions”), was unknown, as was the proportion of plastic surgeons answering. In fact, a study that surveyed actual aesthetic plastic surgery patients3 found that articles about plastic surgery were the least popular types of social media posts, with 79 percent of respondents not interested in posts of scientific articles available for a fee (i.e., peer-reviewed journal articles). Moreover, scientific articles may be difficult for the lay person to understand.",2018.0,20.0,3.0,{'name': 'Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Furnas2018DiscussionWD,\n author = {H.

In financial markets, informational asymmetries are particularly pronounced. Borrowers typically know their collateral, industriousness, and moral rectitude better than do lenders; entrepreneurs possess ""inside"" information about their own projects for which they seek financing. Lenders would benefit from knowing the true characteristics of borrowers. But moral hazard hampers the direct transfer of information between market participants. Borrowers cannot be expected to be entirely straightforward about their characteristics, nor entrepreneurs about their projects, since there may be substantial rewards for exaggerating positive qualities. And verification of true characteristics by outside parties may be costly or impossible. Without information transfer, markets may perform poorly. Consider the financing of projects whose quality is highly variable. While entrepreneurs know the quality of their own projects, lenders cannot distinguish among them. Market value, therefore, must reflect average project quality. If the market were to place an average value greater than average cost on projects, the potential supply of low quality projects may be very large, since entrepreneurs could foist these upon an uninformed market (retaining little or no equity) and make a sure profit. But this argues that the average quality is likely to be low, with the consequence that even projects which are known (by the entrepreneur) to merit financing cannot be undertaken because of the high cost of capital resulting from low average project quality. Thus, where substantial information asymmetries exist and where the supply of poor projects is large relative to the supply of good projects, venture capital markets may fail to exist. For projects of good quality to be financed, information transfer must occur. We have argued that moral hazard prevents direct information transfer. Nonetheless, information on project quality may be transferred if the actions of entrepreneurs (""which speak louder than words"") can be observed. One such action, observable because of disclosure rules, is the willingness of the person(s) with inside information to invest in the project or firm. This willingness to invest may serve as a signal to the lending market of the true quality of the project; lenders will place a value",1977.0,9.0,5823.0,"{'volume': '32', 'pages': '371-387', 'name': 'Journal of Finance'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Leland.1977INFORMATIONALAF,\n author = {H.

The present study was conducted to find out the association between assertiveness, self-esteem, academic achievement and stress among the students. 
Methodology: Correlational design was employed for the present research. Participants of the study comprised 120 high school students with an equal number of male and female students and the age range of 12 to 19 years. The scales used for data collection are namely-Rathus assertiveness schedule (RAS), Rosenberg self-esteem (RSE), perceived stress scale (PSS), and academic achievement scale. 
Main Findings: Correlation coefficient and hierarchical regression were employed as statistical techniques. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated in step one that gender and residence predicted 15.50 percent of the total variance in self-esteem while in step two assertiveness predicted 00.30 percent of change in self-esteem. The findings also reported that gender and residence predicted 04.00 percent of the total variance in academic achievement while in step two, assertiveness predicted 01.40 percent of a total change in academic achievement. In another finding, gender and residence predict 19.60 percent of a total change in stress while in step two assertiveness predicted 00.30 percent of change in stress.

facets of mindfulness. However, to date, all of these have been validated by comparing 
the mindfulness questionnaire with other self-report measures of theoretically related

other approaches to validation are warranted. Therefore, we sought to determine 
whether individuals who describe themselves as more mindful evidence lower levels of 
stress reactivity. Thirty-six university students completed the Kentucky Inventory of 
Mindfulness Skills and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Results indicated 
that those individuals who described themselves as more mindful show smaller 
cardiovascular increases in response to the stress task (heart rate r = −0.38, diastolic 
blood pressure r = −0.43). This study supports the validity of the Kentucky Inventory of

This exploratory research into the information sources from which destination brand image evolves provides insights which have the potential to improve tourism destination brand development strategies. In-depth interviews with 21 international backpackers on Australia’s northern New South Wales coast indicate that mainstream media play little or no part in the formation of respondents’ image of the coastal destination of Byron Bay. Rather, word of mouth and autonomous independent information sources were the key media through which respondents formed their image of this iconic Australian tourist destination. Findings also show the importance of destination experience in the image formation process and suggest that destination marketing organizations (DMOs) can and should go beyond traditional mainstream media to communicate their brand message.

Meta-analyses showed that depression is associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and it might be an etiological factor for AD. Since late-life depression is often connected with cognitive impairment and dementia is usually associated with depressive symptoms, a simple diagnostic approach to distinguish between the disorders is challenging. Several overlapping pathophysiological substrates might explain the comorbidity of both syndromes. Firstly, a stress syndrome, i.e., elevated cortisol levels, has been observed in up to 70% of depressed patients and also in AD pathology. Stress conditions can cause hippocampal neuronal damage as well as cognitive impairment. Secondly, the development of a depression and dementia after the onset of vascular diseases, the profile of cerebrovascular risk factors in both disorders and the impairments depending on the location of cerebrovascular lesions, speak in favor of a vascular hypothesis as a common factor for both disorders. Thirdly, neuroinflammatory processes play a key role in the etiology of depression as well as in dementia. Increased activation of microglia, changes in Transforming-Growth-Factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) signaling, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as reduction of anti-inflammatory molecules are examples of common pathways impaired in dementia and depression. Fourthly, the neurotrophin BDNF is highly expressed in the central nervous system, especially in the hippocampus, where it plays a key role in the proliferation, differentiation and the maintenance of neuronal integrity throughout lifespan. It has been associated not only with antidepressant properties but also a reduction of cognitive impairment and therefore could be involved also in AD. Another etiologic factor is amyloid accumulation, as plasma amyloid beta-42 independently predicts both late-onset depression and AD. Higher plasma amyloid beta-42 predicts the development of late onset depression and conversion to possible AD. However, clinical trials with antibodies against beta amyloid recently failed, i.e., Solanezumab, Aducanumab, and Crenezumab. An overproduction of amyloid-beta might simply reflect a form of synaptic plasticity to compensate for neuronal dysfunction in different kind of neurological and psychiatric diseases of multiple etiologies. The tau hypothesis, sex/gender specific differences, epigenetics and the gut microbiota-brain axis imply other potential common pathways connecting late-life depression and dementia. In conclusion, different potential pathophysiological links between dementia and depression highlight several specific synergistic and multifaceted treatment possibilities, depending on the individual risk profile of the patient.",2020.0,179.0,75.0,"{'volume': '11', 'name': 'Frontiers in Pharmacology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Linnemann2020PathwaysCL,\n author = {C.

During recent decades, self-regulated learning (SRL) has become a major research field. SRL successfully integrates the cognitive and motivational components of learning. Self-regulation is usually seen as an individual process, with the social aspects of regulation conceptualized as one aspect of the context. However, recent research has begun to investigate whether self-regulation processes are complemented by socially shared regulation processes.


AIMS
The presented study investigated what kind of socio-emotional challenges students experience during collaborative learning and whether the students regulate the emotions evoked during these situations. The interplay of the emotion regulation processes between the individual and the group was also studied.


SAMPLE
The sample for this study was 63 teacher education students who studied in groups of three to five during three collaborative learning tasks.


METHOD
Students' interpretations of experienced social challenges and their attempts to regulate emotions evoked by these challenges were collected following each task using the Adaptive Instrument for the Regulation of Emotions.


RESULTS
The results indicated that students experienced a variety of social challenges. Students also reported the use of shared regulation in addition to self-regulation. Finally, the results suggested that intrinsic group dynamics are derived from both individual and social elements of collaborative situations.


CONCLUSION
The findings of the study support the assumption that students can regulate emotions collaboratively as well as individually. The study contributes to our understanding of the social aspects of emotional regulation in collaborative learning contexts.",2009.0,36.0,249.0,"{'volume': '79 Pt 3', 'pages': '\n          463-81\n        ', 'name': 'The British journal of educational psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Järvenoja2009EmotionCI,\n author = {H.

Although students’ openness and attention to peers’ ideas are claimed to play important roles in their creativity in group settings, there is little empirical research that tests this assumption. This study examined the moderating effect of attention to peers’ ideas in the relation between openness and creativity in electronic brainstorming. Participants were 91 undergraduate students who took about 10 min to complete a creative idea generation task during electronic brainstorming. Regression analyses found that students who were characterized by high openness were more creative, but only when they showed more attention to peers’ ideas. This suggests that electronic brainstorming can be useful for enhancing the creativity of some students.",2019.0,30.0,11.0,"{'volume': '30', 'pages': '344 - 352', 'name': 'Interactive Learning Environments'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Pi2019TheRB,\n author = {Zhongling Pi and Jiumin Yang and Weiping Hu and Jianzhong Hong},\n journal = {Interactive Learning Environments},\n pages = {344 - 352},\n title = {The relation between openness and creativity is moderated by attention to peers’ ideas in electronic brainstorming},\n volume = {30},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '17963996', 'name': 'Zhongling Pi'}, {'authorId': '2193352', 'name': 'Jiumin Yang'}, {'authorId': '2146242035', 'name': 'Weiping Hu'}, {'authorId': '118409143', 'name': 'Jianzhong Hong'}]"

Art therapy (AT) is an experiential treatment that addresses images rather than words. This study investigates the possibility of an IRT-AT combination. Systematic literature review and field research was conducted, and the integration of theoretical and practice-based knowledge resulted in a framework for Imagery Rehearsal-based Art Therapy (IR-AT). The added value of AT in IRT appears to be more readily gaining access to traumatic experiences, living through feelings, and breaking through avoidance. Exposure and re-scripting take place more indirectly, experientially and sometimes in a playlike manner using art assignments and materials. In the artwork, imagination, play and fantasy offer creative space to stop the vicious circle of nightmares by changing theme, story line, ending, or any part of the dream into a more positive and acceptable one. IR-AT emerges as a promising method for treatment, and could be especially useful for patients who benefit least from verbal exposure techniques.

Since deficits in emotion recognition are closely related to caregiver burden or social interactions, researchers have fundamental interest in FER performance in patients with dementia. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the performance profiles of six facial emotions (i.e., fear, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, and happiness) and neutral faces measured among Korean healthy control (HCs), and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and FTD. Additionally, the neuroanatomical correlates of facial emotions were investigated. Methods: A total of 110 (33 HC, 32 MCI, 32 AD, 13 FTD) older adult participants were recruited from two different medical centers in metropolitan areas of South Korea. These individuals underwent an FER test that was used to assess the recognition of emotions or absence of emotion (neutral) in 35 facial stimuli. Repeated measures two-way analyses of variance were used to examine the distinct profiles of emotional recognition among the four groups. We also performed brain imaging and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on the participants to examine the associations between FER scores and gray matter volume. Results: The mean score of negative emotion recognition (i.e., fear, anger, disgust, and sadness) clearly discriminated FTD participants from individuals with MCI and AD and HC [F(3,106) = 10.829, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.235], whereas the mean score of positive emotion recognition (i.e., surprise and happiness) did not. A VBM analysis showed negative emotions were correlated with gray matter volume of anterior temporal regions, whereas positive emotions were related to gray matter volume of fronto-parietal regions. Conclusion: Impairment of negative FER in patients with FTD is cross-cultural. The discrete neural correlates of FER indicate that emotional recognition processing is a multi-modal system in the brain. Focusing on the negative emotion recognition is a more effective way to discriminate healthy aging, MCI, and AD from FTD in older Korean adults.",2017.0,103.0,32.0,"{'volume': '9', 'name': 'Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Park2017BehavioralAN,\n author = {Soowon Park and Taehoon Kim and S.

Biomarker discovery is an important topic in biomedical applications of computational biology, including applications such as gene and SNP selection from high-dimensional data. Surprisingly, the stability with respect to sampling variation or robustness of such selection processes has received attention only recently. However, robustness of biomarkers is an important issue, as it may greatly influence subsequent biological validations. In addition, a more robust set of markers may strengthen the confidence of an expert in the results of a selection method.


RESULTS
Our first contribution is a general framework for the analysis of the robustness of a biomarker selection algorithm. Secondly, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the recently introduced concept of ensemble feature selection, where multiple feature selections are combined in order to increase the robustness of the final set of selected features. We focus on selection methods that are embedded in the estimation of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful classification models that have shown state-of-the-art performance on several diagnosis and prognosis tasks on biological data. Their feature selection extensions also offered good results for gene selection tasks. We show that the robustness of SVMs for biomarker discovery can be substantially increased by using ensemble feature selection techniques, while at the same time improving upon classification performances. The proposed methodology is evaluated on four microarray datasets showing increases of up to almost 30% in robustness of the selected biomarkers, along with an improvement of approximately 15% in classification performance. The stability improvement with ensemble methods is particularly noticeable for small signature sizes (a few tens of genes), which is most relevant for the design of a diagnosis or prognosis model from a gene signature.

To ensure that a study is adequately powered to yield informative results with an ANOVA, researchers can perform an a priori power analysis. However, power analysis for factorial ANOVA designs is often a challenge. Current software solutions do not allow power analyses for complex designs with several within-participants factors. Moreover, power analyses often need η p 2 or Cohen’s f as input, but these effect sizes are not intuitive and do not generalize to different experimental designs. We have created the R package Superpower and online Shiny apps to enable researchers without extensive programming experience to perform simulation-based power analysis for ANOVA designs of up to three within- or between-participants factors. Predicted effects are entered by specifying means, standard deviations, and, for within-participants factors, the correlations. The simulation provides the statistical power for all ANOVA main effects, interactions, and individual comparisons. The software can plot power across a range of sample sizes, can control for multiple comparisons, and can compute power when the homogeneity or sphericity assumption is violated. This Tutorial demonstrates how to perform a priori power analysis to design informative studies for main effects, interactions, and individual comparisons and highlights important factors that determine the statistical power for factorial ANOVA designs.",2021.0,24.0,152.0,"{'volume': '4', 'name': 'Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Lakens2021SimulationBasedPA,\n author = {D.

In particular, we describe the Empathic Companion, an animated interface agent that accompanies the user in the setting of a virtual job interview. This interface application takes physiological data (skin conductance and electromyography) of a user in realtime, interprets them as emotions, and addresses the user's affective states in the form of empathic feedback. The Empathic Companion is conceived as an educational agent that supports job seekers preparing for a job interview. We also present results from an exploratory study that aims to evaluate the impact of the Empathic Companion by measuring users' skin conductance and heart rate. While an overall positive effect of the Empathic Companion could not be shown, the outcome of the experiment suggests that empathic feedback has a positive effect on the interviewee's stress level while hearing the interviewer question.",2005.0,30.0,306.0,"{'volume': '19', 'pages': '267 - 285', 'name': 'Applied Artificial Intelligence'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Prendinger2005THEEC,\n author = {H.

This naturally leads to calls for regulation, but I argue that it is too early to attempt a general system of AI regulation. Instead, we should work incrementally within the existing legal and regulatory schemes which allocate responsibility, and therefore liability, to persons. Where AI clearly creates risks which current law and regulation cannot deal with adequately, then new regulation will be needed. But in most cases, the current system can work effectively if the producers of AI technology can provide sufficient transparency in explaining how AI decisions are made. Transparency ex post can often be achieved through retrospective analysis of the technology's operations, and will be sufficient if the main goal is to compensate victims of incorrect decisions. Ex ante transparency is more challenging, and can limit the use of some AI technologies such as neural networks. It should only be demanded by regulation where the AI presents risks to fundamental rights, or where society needs reassuring that the technology can safely be used. Masterly inactivity in regulation is likely to achieve a better long-term solution than a rush to regulate in ignorance.

The combination of big data and artificial intelligence, referred to by some as the fourth industrial revolution,1 will change radiology and pathology along with other medical specialties. Although reports of radiologists and pathologists being replaced by computers seem exaggerated,2 these specialties must plan strategically for a future in which artificial intelligence is part of the health care workforce. Radiologists have always revered machines and technology. In 1960, Lusted predicted “an electronic scannercomputer to examine chest photofluorograms, to separate the clearly normal chest films from the abnormal chest films.”3 Lusted further suggested that “the abnormal chest films would be marked for later study by the radiologists.”3 Lusted’s intuitions were prescient: interpreting radiographs is pattern recognition; computers can recognize patterns and may be helpful because some roentgenographic analyses can be automated. Nearly 60 years after Lusted’s prediction, Enlitic, a technology company in Silicon Valley, inputted images of normal radiographs and radiographs with fractures into a computerized database.4 Using deep learning, a refined version of artificial neural networks, the",2016.0,7.0,430.0,"{'volume': '316 22', 'pages': '\n          2353-2354\n        ', 'name': 'JAMA'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Jha2016AdaptingTA,\n author = {S.

Occupational research has identified health-adverse features of modern work with the help of theoretical models. One such model, effort-reward imbalance, has been developed by this author and his group and has been widely tested in epidemiological and experimental studies. The model claims that stressful experience at work is elicited by a lack of reciprocity between efforts spent at work and rewards received in return, where rewards include money, promotion prospects, job security, and esteem. Results demonstrate elevated risks of coronary heart disease among employees exposed to effort-reward imbalance. Moreover, in ambulatory and experimental investigations, elevated heart rate and blood pressure and altered secretion of stress hormones were observed under these conditions. Although additional scientific evidence is needed, available findings call for practical measures towards improving quality of work, most importantly at the level of single companies and organisations. This conclusion is supported by first results from intervention studies that are guided by this theoretical approach. In view of the burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to unfavourable working conditions, such efforts are well justified and need to be extended in order to promote healthy work.",2010.0,48.0,134.0,"{'volume': '23 3', 'pages': '\n          279-85\n        ', 'name': 'International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Siegrist2010EffortrewardIA,\n author = {J.

In this article, the authors review the specific contribution that social anthropology has made to this field of research. They propose that social anthropology has contributed to this field through the description of systems that have regulated both cooperation and competition in traditional societies: (1) hunter-gatherer societies, where generalized reciprocity dominates; (2) prestige economies, which includes the exchange of valuables in specific spheres, primitive money, agonistic institutions in tribes; and last, (3) ‘moral economies’ in peasant communities, where cooperation and competition coexist but never at the cost of putting at risk the reproduction of the community itself or of some of its members. The three systems share the basic mechanism of reciprocity that allows for the maintenance of equality, as well as the very language for regulating competition in unequal prestige or moral economies. This pervasive presence of reciprocity as a moral norm would reveal its basic role in human evolution, and, likely, its co-evolution with ritual forms of social exchange.",2017.0,53.0,19.0,"{'volume': '33', 'pages': '11-14', 'name': 'Anthropology Today'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Molina2017CooperationAC,\n author = {J.

Despite its importance, emotion perception of social interactions from a 3rd-person perspective is poorly understood. Here we investigated whether emotion recognition of fear and anger is facilitated by mere congruency (the contextual figure exhibits the same emotion as the target) or by functional relations (the contextual figure exhibits a complementary emotion to the target). Furthermore, we examined which expression channel, face or body, drives social context effects. In the 1st 2 experiments (Studies 1a and 1b), participants in an online survey platform (N = 146) or university students (N = 34), viewed interacting figures displaying fear or anger, presented either as faces, bodies, or both. Participants were instructed to categorize the target figure's emotions while the other figure served as context. Results showed that fear recognition was facilitated by an interacting angry figure more strongly than by an interacting fearful figure. Moreover, this effect occurred when participants viewed the figures' bodies (with or without the faces), but not when they viewed the figures' faces alone. A 3rd online experiment (Study 2) established that this context effect was stronger when participants (N = 464) watched the figures interacting (facing each other) than when figures were not interacting (facing away from each other), suggesting that social context influences emotion perception by revealing the interactants' relation.

For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory.",2008.0,159.0,1303.0,"{'volume': '59', 'pages': '279-300', 'name': 'Annual Review of Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Waal2008PuttingTA,\n author = {F.

The prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents has increased in the past 20–30 years; the increase is attributed to disrupted family structures, and families’ unrealistic educational and vocational aspirations for their children. Assertive communication is the skill to speak and communicate in a manner that respects and look upon the rights and opinions of others while also standing up for your own rights, needs and personal boundaries. The purpose of the researchers was to find the relationship between mental health and level of assertiveness among adolescents. 80 college going students were randomly selected as the sample for research from Amity University Lucknow. Rathus assertiveness scale and Mental Health Inventory by Srivastava A. were used for assessing assertiveness and mental health among adolescents. Analysis was done using t-test to find gender differences among adolescents and Pearson r was used for assessing relation between both the variables. The result showed no significant gender difference among adolescents on assertiveness and mental health, but both the genders were found to be low assertive.

2679,e4e4dee53bf80872f0a6a3a7de13921bb0fb22bd,Using Psychological Artificial Intelligence (Tess) to Relieve Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background Students in need of mental health care face many barriers including cost, location, availability, and stigma. Studies show that computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a less-intensive and more cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although CBT is one of the most effective treatment methods, applying an integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment improvement. Integrative psychological artificial intelligence (AI) offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable, convenient, lasting, and secure support grows. Objective This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using an integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce self-identified symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students. Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 75 participants were recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All participants completed Web-based surveys, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks later (T2). The 2 test groups consisted of 50 participants in total and were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks (n=24) or 4 weeks (n=26). The information-only control group participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National Institute of Mental Health’s (NIMH) eBook on depression among college students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the study. Results A sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0% attrition from the test group and less than 1% attrition from the control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years, with 70% of participants being female (52/74), mostly Asian (37/74, 51%), and white (32/74, 41%). Group 1 received unlimited access to Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group 2 received unlimited access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only control group was provided with an electronic link to the NIMH’s eBook. Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that group 1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found between the control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of anxiety as measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, whereas the control group did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did impact scores. Conclusions This study offers evidence that AI can serve as a cost-effective and accessible therapeutic agent. Although not designed to appropriate the role of a trained therapist, integrative psychological AI emerges as a feasible option for delivering support.

Its receptor is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS) and in β-cells in the pancreatic Islets. We have already demonstrated that the intracerebroventricular administration of DHA or GW9508, a GPR40/FFAR1 agonist, suppresses formalin-induced pain behavior. It also attenuates complete Freund's adjuvant-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, suggesting that these effects occur by increasing β-endorphin release from propiomelanocortin neurons. Furthermore, we found that the brain GPR40/FFAR1 signaling may involve in the regulation of the descending pain control system, whereas the deletion of GPR40/FFAR1 might exacerbate mechanical allodynia in postoperative pain. Therefore, it is possible that the brain n-3 fatty acid-GPR40/FFAR1 signaling may play a key role in the modulation of the endogenous pain control system and emotional function.

Its goal is to predict a set of dependent variables from a set of independent variables or predictors. This prediction is achieved by extracting from the predictors a set of orthogonal factors called latent variables which have the best predictive power. These latent variables can be used to create displays akin to PCA displays. The quality of the prediction obtained from a PLS regression model is evaluated with cross‐validation techniques such as the bootstrap and jackknife. There are two main variants of PLS regression: The most common one separates the roles of dependent and independent variables; the second one—used mostly to analyze brain imaging data—gives the same roles to dependent and independent variables.

What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they've found have much to teach us. In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others.

Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving. Purpose: To test a new brief resilience scale. Method: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients. Results: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without fibromyalgia.

A major task of such regulators is the investigation of complaints against practitioners. However, processing a complaint often lasts several months and is particularly costly. Hence, we worked with international regulators from different countries (the UK, US and Australia), to develop the first decision support tool that aims to help such regulators process complaints more efficiently. Our system uses state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to process complaints and predict their risk level. Our tool also provides additional useful information including explanations, to help the regulatory staff interpret the prediction results, and similar past cases as well as non-compliance to regulations, to support the decision making.",2021.0,56.0,9.0,{'pages': '81-91'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Lertvittayakumjorn2021SupportingCI,\n author = {Piyawat Lertvittayakumjorn and I.

Tellegen (1985) proposed a consensual structure of affect based on J. A. Russell's (1980) circumplex. The authors' review of the literature indicates that this 2-factor model captures robust structural properties of self-rated mood. Nevertheless, the evidence also indicates that the circumplex does not fit the data closely and needs to be refined. Most notably, the model's dimensions are not entirely independent; moreover, with the exception of Pleasantness-Unpleasantness, they are not completely bipolar. More generally, the data suggest a model that falls somewhere between classic simple structure and a true circumplex. The authors then examine two of the dimensions imbedded in this structure, which they label Negative Activation (NA) and Positive Activation (PA). The authors argue that PA and NA represent the subjective components of broader biobehavioral systems of approach and withdrawal, respectively.

One of the most basic forms of meditation is concentration meditation, in which sustained attention is focused on an object such as a small visual stimulus or the breath. In age-matched participants, using functional MRI, we found that activation in a network of brain regions typically involved in sustained attention showed an inverted u-shaped curve in which expert meditators (EMs) with an average of 19,000 h of practice had more activation than novices, but EMs with an average of 44,000 h had less activation. In response to distracter sounds used to probe the meditation, EMs vs. novices had less brain activation in regions related to discursive thoughts and emotions and more activation in regions related to response inhibition and attention.

The traditional view of environmental regulation held by virtually all economists until that time was that requiring firms to reduce an externality like pollution necessarily restricted their options and thus by definition reduced their profits. After all, if profitable opportunities existed to reduce pollution, profit-maximizing firms would already be taking advantage of them. Over the past twenty years, much has been written about what has since become known simply as the Porter Hypothesis. Yet even today, we continue to find conflicting evidence concerning the Porter Hypothesis, alternative theories that might explain it, and oftentimes a misunderstanding of what the Porter Hypothesis does and does not say.

The article begins by contextualizing these parental practices within the literature on surveillance, with particular attention to online surveillance and the increasing importance of affect. It then gives a brief overview of work on pregnancy mediation, monitoring on social media, and via pregnancy apps, which is the obvious precursor to examining parental sharing and monitoring practices regarding babies and infants. The examples of parental monitoring and parental mediation will then build on the idea of “intimate surveillance” which entails close and seemingly invasive monitoring by parents. Parental monitoring and mediation contribute to the normalization of intimate surveillance to the extent that surveillance is (re)situated as a necessary culture of care.

The Affect Grid is potentially suitable for any study that requires judgments about affect of either a descriptive or a subjective kind. The scale was shown to have adequate reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity in 4 studies in which college students used the Affect Grid to describe (a) their current mood, (b) the meaning of emotion-related words, and (c) the feelings conveyed by facial expressions. Other studies are cited to illustrate the potential uses of the Affect Grid as a measure of mood. In this article, we introduce the Affect Grid, a scale designed as a quick means of assessing affect along the dimensions of pleasure-displeasure and arousal-sleepiness. The Affect Grid is potentially suitable for any study that requires judgments about affect of either a descriptive or a subjective kind. The Affect Grid is a single-item scale. Our aim was for an instrument that would be short and easy to fill out and that could, therefore, be used rapidly and repeatedly. Currently available scales of affect are multiple-item checklists or questionnaires that are too time-consuming or too distracting for some purposes. In particular, they do not lend themselves to continuous or quickly repeated observation. They are awkward in dealing with the rapid fluctuations of affect that occur, for example, in response to music, or for all we know, to many everyday emotion-laden events. In repeated-meas ures designs, subjects tiring of the same checklist may eventually become less conscientious or, in longitudinal studies, drop out of the study. Researchers who have wanted something quick and simple have sometimes resorted to homespun measures—with resulting uncertainty as to precisely what is being measured and how well. The Affect Grid is shown in Figure 1. The subject is asked to take several minutes beforehand to learn precisely how to use it. General instructions for this purpose are given in the Appendix.1 Once the subject understands these general instructions, he or she can then be given the Affect Grid together with whatever specific instructions are appropriate, such as ""Please rate",1989.0,48.0,1778.0,"{'volume': '57', 'pages': '493-502', 'name': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Russell1989AffectG,\n author = {J.

Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.",2016.0,54.0,58.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{López2016MethodFI,\n author = {Juan Miguel López and Jordi Virgili-Gomá and R.

It is considered as the new electricity that is revolutionizing the world. AI is heavily invested in both industry and academy. However, there is also a lot of hype in the current AI debate. AI based on so-called deep learning has achieved impressive results in many problems, but its limits are already visible. AI has been under research since the 1940s, and the industry has seen many ups and downs due to over-expectations and related disappointments that have followed. The purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture of AI, its history, its potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of humans. We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the decades. After fundamentals, we explain the importance of massive data for the current mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most common representations for AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main application areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the development of AI. The book provides a general introduction to computer vision, and includes an exposure to the results and applications of our own research. Emotions are central to human intelligence, but little use has been made in AI. We present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the topic. We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding, explaining why such achievement seems impossible on the basis of present knowledge,and how AI could be improved. Finally, a summary is made of the current state of AI and what to do in the future.

The outward expression of emotion has been frequently associated with better health outcomes, whereas suppressing emotion is thought to contribute to worse physical health. However, work has typically focused on trait expressive tendencies and the possibility that individual differences in the ability to express specific emotions may also be associated with health has not been widely tested.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional study of community dwelling adults.


METHODS
One hundred and twenty-eight participants aged 18-88 years completed questionnaires assessing demographics and health status, before attending a testing session in which resting heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed. Participants then completed a performance-based test of expressive regulatory skill in which they were instructed to enhance and suppress their emotional expressions while they watched film clips validated to elicit amusement, sadness, and anger. Participants rated subjective emotional experience before and after each clip, and their degree of expressivity was scored using FACS-based Noldus FaceReader.


RESULTS
Missing data resulted in a final sample size of 117. Linear regressions controlling for age, sex, diagnoses, and trait emotion revealed that greater ability to enhance sad expressions was associated with higher HRV while the ability to enhance expressions of joy was associated with lower symptom interference. In parallel models, the ability to flexibly regulate (both enhance and suppress) expressions of joy and sadness was also associated with lower symptom interference.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings suggest that the ability to regulate expressions of both sadness and joy is associated with health indices even when controlling for trait affect and potential confounds. The present findings offer early evidence that individual differences in the ability to regulate the outward expression of emotion may be relevant to health and suggest that expressive regulatory skills offer a novel avenue for research and intervention. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject The tendency to outwardly express felt emotion generally predicts better health, whereas expressive suppression typically predicts worse health outcomes. Most work has been based on trait assessments; however, the ability to regulate the expression of felt emotion can be objectively assessed using performance-based tests. Prior work in mental health suggests that the ability to flexibly up- and downregulate the expression of emotion predicts better outcomes.

 Player classification allows for considerable improvements on both game analytics and game adaptivity. With this paper we aim at reversing the ad-hoc tendency in player classification methods, by proposing an approach to player classification that can be integrated across different games and genres and is particularly suited to be used by game designers. This paper describes our generic method of interaction-based player classification, which consists of three components: (i) intercepting player interactions, (ii) finding player types through fuzzy cluster analysis and (iii) classification using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). To showcase our method we developed Blindmaze, a simple web-based hidden maze game publicly available, featuring a bounded set of interactions. All data collected from a game is interaction-based, requiring minimal implementation effort from the game developers. It is concluded that our method makes player classification even more available by making it generic and re-usable across different games.

Definitions and a Call for Research","The idea that television advertising will move to a situation where individuals watching the same programming will view different messages target to them has been around for some time, yet such expenditures have been slow to take off. Part of the reason of this is that that growth in the number of people with simultaneous internet access and television and mobile screens has been gradual. However, we are clearly approaching the point where this technology is poised to take off. In this article, I would like to explore the reason why it appears inevitable that addressable television is going to enter a period of growth while calling for research on the topic. While research on the topic of addressable advertising has been relatively sparse, I would suggest that readers take a good look at an article by Malthouse, Maslowska and Franks (2019) that suggests that addressable/programmatic advertising will grow, but that it will be contingent on three factors: distribution, ad inventory and data. The terminology used in this space can be highly confusing to anyone who does not follow media planning. Thus, I will start with some nomenclature and define the terms ‘Over-the-top’ or OTT programming, connected television (CTV), addressable advertising, and programmatic advertising. The term OTT can be defined as referring to programming content or ads that are streamed via the internet to a device where it can be viewed, such as a television, mobile phone, or tablet. CTV has been defined as a television set that’s connected to the internet and facilitates the delivery of streaming video content (see Loredo 2018). When a television is connected, this means that the viewer is using the services of a wireless service provider as well as a streaming service, whether it is Hulu, Netflix, or a ‘traditional’ television network that offers streaming. Viewing can be done on any type of screen as long as it is linked to the internet. Addressable television advertising refers to the ability of the programmer to show different ads to different households during the same program. This technology opens the door to some of the same type of use of data and customized communication we see in digital. For example, if a digital marketer knows a consumer has been doing a home search in a certain area and price range, the consumer may find listings of house in their Facebook or other social media feed. Finally, programmatic advertising is defined by Malthouse, Maslowska, and Franks (2018) as an approach that is marked by purchasing individual exposures informed by whatever data may be available about the device, cookie, household, etc. Often the media sale takes place on an ad exchange in real time through an automated auction, the message may be personalized, and sometimes the behavioural responses to the exposure can be tracked (e.g. clicks, conversions).

In addition, we examined the influence of perceived stress on the relationship between EI and well-being. Female students from the School of Health Sciences (n = 264) completed an ability measure of emotional intelligence. After 12 weeks, participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale and Subjective Happiness Scale. Participants with higher EI reported less perceived stress and higher levels of life satisfaction and happiness. The results of this study suggest that perceived stress mediates the relationship between EI and well-being indicators, specifically life satisfaction and happiness. These findings suggest an underlying process by which high emotional intelligence may increase well-being in female students in nursing and allied health sciences by reducing the experience of stress.

Most research in the area of automated emotion recognition is based on facial expressions or speech signals. Although the influence of the emotional state on body movements is undeniable, this source of expression is still underestimated in automatic analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method to recognise seven basic emotional states—namely, happy, sad, surprise, fear, anger, disgust and neutral—utilising body movement. We analyse motion capture data under seven basic emotional states recorded by professional actor/actresses using Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor. We propose a new representation of affective movements, based on sequences of body joints. The proposed algorithm creates a sequential model of affective movement based on low level features inferred from the spacial location and the orientation of joints within the tracked skeleton. In the experimental results, different deep neural networks were employed and compared to recognise the emotional state of the acquired motion sequences. The experimental results conducted in this work show the feasibility of automatic emotion recognition from sequences of body gestures, which can serve as an additional source of information in multimodal emotion recognition.",2019.0,56.0,55.0,"{'volume': '21', 'name': 'Entropy'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Sapinski2019EmotionRF,\n author = {T.

This effect can be additionally enhanced with a physical robotic embodiment.

We examined this phenomenon by comparing fearful and neutral images carefully matched in the domains of luminance, image contrast, image color, and complexity of content. The pupil was more dilated after viewing affective pictures, and this effect was (a) shown to be independent of the presentation time of the images (from 100–3,000 ms), (b) not diminished by repeated presentations of the images, and (c) not affected by actively naming the emotion of the stimuli in comparison to passive viewing.

2750,eb828833b3de547c8a8dab3f4465635c041d8129,Cryptocurrency & Robots: How to Tax and Pay Tax on Them,"New technologies, such as blockchain, cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin), and artificial intelligence are rapidly changing how transactions occur in the United States. While scholars have started to examine how a number of areas of law should adapt, very little work has been done on what these changes mean for taxation. Yet these developments could have a huge impact on tax revenues. For example, some approaches to taxing transactions using cryptocurrency could result in these transactions being conducted abroad, beyond the reach of the U.S. taxing authorities. And if robots replace large segments of the labor force, this could drastically shrink federal and state income tax bases. 
The approach to taxing new technologies is a careful balance of capturing value and not disincentivizing growth. For example, if governments decide to levy a “robot tax” to replace revenues the income tax is no longer generating, they may accidentally stifle innovation in that jurisdiction. 
At the same time, these new technologies also provide tools that governments can harness to levy taxes far more effectively than they currently do. For example, using blockchain technology to track the history of income and company shares allows for the potential of an integrated tax system, which combines the currently separate corporate and personal taxes into one unified taxation regime. The effects of this transition are a removal of many distortions and behavioral inefficiencies. 
Just because technology can be used to levy taxes far more creatively does not mean that it should be. But given the rapid rate at which technological change is occurring, governments cannot afford to sit back and make these decisions by inertia. Rather, the main argument of this is that governments should: (i) recognize and adapt to shifting tax bases; and (ii) use technology such as blockchain to better target the populations and behaviors desired to be taxed. The paper recommends specific examples of how to better tax and use technologies, such as blockchain, to reform current taxation schemes. 
There is also ample discussion of whether cryptocurrency will be regulated as a security (as per the Howey test and recent SEC enforcement actions), a discussion of foreign jurisdictions' approaches to cryptocurrency regulation and taxation, and recommendations to the SEC and IRS on how they should adjust their taxation of cryptocurrency.",2017.0,0.0,10.0,{'name': 'LSN: Public Tax Law - U.S. (Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Ahmed2017CryptocurrencyR,\n author = {Samina Ahmed},\n journal = {LSN: Public Tax Law - U.S. (Topic)},\n title = {Cryptocurrency & Robots: How to Tax and Pay Tax on Them},\n year = {2017}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '66484321', 'name': 'Samina Ahmed'}]"

Although recent progress in studying SSRL with LA and AI has provided holistic insights into the temporal and cyclical processes of SSRL, few studies have investigated SSRL processes at a granular level. To address these limitations, we utilise AI techniques to explore the sequences of group-level deliberation as a process and its pattern through cognitive and emotional regulation triggering events in the context of face-to-face collaborative learning. This study involved ten triads of secondary students ($\mathrm{N}=30$) working on a collaborative learning task and receiving regulation-triggering events during their learning. Results from Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) identified two distinct types of deliberation sequences with different approaches to regulation and collaboration practices: 1) the plan and implementation approach (PIA) focused on analysing, discussing, and collaborating; and 2) the trials and failures approach (TFA) focused on random idea testing. Interestingly, we found that most groups maintain the same approach in response to triggering events, emphasizing the importance of supporting learners to recognize and react to the emerging needs of regulation.",2023.0,7.0,0.0,"{'name': '2023 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)', 'pages': '158-160'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dang2023ClusteringDS,\n author = {Belle Dang and Andy Nguyen and Sanna Järvelä},\n booktitle = {International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies},\n journal = {2023 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)},\n pages = {158-160},\n title = {Clustering Deliberation Sequences Through Regulatory Triggers in Collaborative Learning},\n year = {2023}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2181844584', 'name': 'Belle Dang'}, {'authorId': '2248071292', 'name': 'Andy Nguyen'}, {'authorId': '2248242831', 'name': 'Sanna Järvelä'}]"

This is due to the training of physical education teachers to work with children with special educational needs during specially organized courses, whose fragmentation has not greatly increased the level of teachers’ qualifications. The research aims to scientifically justify theoretical and methodological foundations, develop and experimentally verify the methodology of training future physical education teachers for professional activities under the conditions of inclusive education, taking into account the specifics of their psychological, theoretical and practical readiness for it. Pedagogical conditions for training future physical education teachers for professional activities under the conditions of inclusive education are defined as follows: prioritizing the content of programmes and teaching methodology; improving the content, forms, methods and means required to master normative, psychological, pedagogical and correctional theoretical and practical and scientific foundations of inclusive education, as well as didactic and correctional and developmental technologies during the classes dedicated to professional teaching methodologies; consolidating professional knowledge and practical skills of students based on the simulation modelling and reflection on pedagogical experience of future physical education teachers under the conditions of inclusive education with the relevant update of the content of teaching placements. The experimental work involved 444 students majoring in physical education and sport (222 students in the experimental and the control groups). Given the summarized data of final tests, it becomes clear that the students in the EG tend to have a high level of such readiness (at the ascertaining stage – 28.6%, at the formative stage – 47.0%, the difference being 18.4%). The results of the experiment prove the effectiveness of introducing the developed methodology of training future physical education teachers for professional activities under the conditions of inclusive education.",2021.0,42.0,85.0,{'name': 'BRAIN.

With technological improvements in information and communication technologies, a highly anticipated key contributor to improve the customer experience and satisfaction in service episodes is through the application of video analytics, such as to evaluate the customer's emotions over the full service cycle. Currently, emotion recognition from video is a challenging research area. One of the most effective solutions to address this challenge is to utilize both the audio and visual components as two sources contained in the video data to make an overall assessment of the emotion. The combined use of audio and visual data sources presents additional challenges, such as determining the optimal data fusion technique prior to classification. In this paper, we propose an audio–visual emotion recognition system to detect the universal six emotions (happy, angry, sad, disgust, surprise, and fear) from video data. The detected customer emotions are then mapped and translated to give customer satisfaction scores. The proposed customer satisfaction video analytics system can operate over video conferencing or video chat. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified through numerical results.",2018.0,68.0,27.0,"{'volume': '48', 'pages': '266-278', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Seng2018VideoAF,\n author = {K.

The Effect of the CEO's Emotional Traits on Firm Risk,"Except for some recent survey and experimental studies, strategic management research has tended to neglect the influence of emotions on managers' strategic choices. This paper analyses the influence of the stable, long-term emotional traits of CEOs on an actual business outcome: risk taking. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 51 Spanish banks and savings banks. Our results show that CEO affective traits influence banks' risk taking. Specifically, our analyses show that managers' negative affective traits are related to lower risk taking as reflected in a lower variability in performance, a lower level of credit risk and a less risky composition of the loan portfolios of the banks they manage. Positive affective traits do not seem to influence the level of risk.

Distinctions should be made between immersion, presence, involvement, emotional response, degree of interest. An analogy with colour science is pursued, specifically the difference between wavelength distribution and perception of colour - where the former is like 'immersion' the latter is like 'presence' (a human response). On top of this colours may be experienced as interesting, emotion-producing and so on. Just as the emotional experience engendered by a colour is not the same as the perception of the colour, which is not a simple function of the wavelength distribution, so involvement, interest or emotional response in a virtual reality is not the same as presence, which is not the same as immersion.",2003.0,4.0,535.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Slater2003ANO,\n author = {M.

A corpus of 1,627 articles from 9 political publishers, three each from the mainstream, the hyperpartisan left, and the hyperpartisan right, have been fact-checked by professional journalists at BuzzFeed: 97% of the 299 fake news articles identified are also hyperpartisan. We show how a style analysis can distinguish hyperpartisan news from the mainstream (F1 = 0.78), and satire from both (F1 = 0.81). But stylometry is no silver bullet as style-based fake news detection does not work (F1 = 0.46). We further reveal that left-wing and right-wing news share significantly more stylistic similarities than either does with the mainstream. This result is robust: it has been confirmed by three different modeling approaches, one of which employs Unmasking in a novel way.

Despite the huge advancements in social robotics, the research on robots in tourism has been extremely limited – a gap that is partially filled by this paper. It investigates the costs and benefits of the adoption of RAISA by travel, tourism, and hospitality companies (hotels, restaurants, event organisers, theme and amusement parks, airports, car rental companies, travel agencies and tourist information centres, museums and art galleries and others). Specifically the paper looks at how RAISA influence the competitiveness, service quality, human resource management, service operations processes and standards, hospitality facilities layout, operating costs and revenues, and investigates the conditions under which the adoption of RAISA would be of benefit of the company. The paper acknowledges that the adoption of RAISA is dependent on the labour and technology costs, customers’ readiness and willingness to be served by a robots, cultural characteristics of both customers and service providers, the technological characteristics of RAISA solutions and other factors. The paper elaborates on the practical challenges to be faced by tourist companies when introducing RAISA (e.g. related to resistance to change, reengineering of service processes) and provide recommendations to both tourism companies and robot manufacturers how to deal with these challenges.",2017.0,43.0,203.0,{'name': 'TransportRN: Tourism & Transportation (Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Ivanov2017AdoptionOR,\n author = {Stanislav Ivanov and C.

Different from other corpora, we propose a novel multimodal corpus for emotion expression recognition, which uses gradual annotations with a focus on contextual emotion expressions. Our dataset was collected from Youtube videos using a specific search strategy based on restricted keywords and filtering which guaranteed that the data follow a gradual emotion expression transition, i.e. emotion expressions evolve over time in a natural and continuous fashion.

2784,edf0181624b7ff77dce86a12b3b4f830cb55958c,Racing all over the place: A dispersion model of international regulatory competition,"There is a large body of literature, both within academic International Relations and in popular discourses, about globalization and regulatory convergence, either through regulatory races to the bottom or the upwards harmonization of regulatory standards. Neither pattern is well supported by empirical findings with respect to industries that can easily move offshore in search of lower regulatory standards. Rather, global patterns of regulation in these industries tend toward dispersion rather than conversion either upward or downward. There is as yet, however, little work in the International Relations literature on how to understand these patterns of global regulatory dispersion, in which states attract offshore business by establishing differentiated regulatory niches. One of the key models of regulatory dispersion in the economics literature was developed by Charles Tiebout in the context of the provision of municipal services, but several International Relations scholars have noted that the assumptions of the model are not appropriate to international regulatory competition. This article develops a model of international regulatory heterogeneity that draws on Tiebout’s, and that describes patterns of regulatory dispersion in industries that engage in international regulatory arbitrage. It explains both specific patterns of dispersion and mechanisms for increasing average regulatory levels over time.",2015.0,65.0,13.0,"{'volume': '21', 'pages': '171 - 193', 'name': 'European Journal of International Relations'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Barkin2015RacingAO,\n author = {J.

Patients adhere to only 50% of drugs prescribed for chronic diseases in developed nations. Digital health has paved the way for innovative smartphone solutions to tackle this challenge. However, despite numerous apps available claiming to improve adherence, a thorough review of adherence apps has not been carried out to date. Objective The aims of this study were to (1) review medication adherence apps available in app repositories in terms of their evidence base, medical professional involvement in development, and strategies used to facilitate behavior change and improve adherence and (2) provide a system of classification for these apps. Methods In April 2015, relevant medication adherence apps were identified by searching the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store using a combination of relevant search terms. Data extracted included app store source, app price, documentation of health care professional (HCP) involvement during app development, and evidence base for each respective app. Free apps were downloaded to explore the strategies used to promote medication adherence. Testing involved a standardized medication regimen of three reminders over a 4-hour period. Nonadherence features designed to enhance user experience were also documented. Results The app repository search identified a total of 5881 apps. Of these, 805 fulfilled the inclusion criteria initially and were tested. Furthermore, 681 apps were further analyzed for data extraction. Of these, 420 apps were free for testing, 58 were inaccessible and 203 required payment. Of the 420 free apps, 57 apps were developed with HCP involvement and an evidence base was identified in only 4 apps. Of the paid apps, 9 apps had HCP involvement, 1 app had a documented evidence base, and 1 app had both. In addition, 18 inaccessible apps were produced with HCP involvement, whereas 2 apps had a documented evidence base. The 420 free apps were further analyzed to identify strategies used to improve medication adherence. This identified three broad categories of adherence strategies, reminder, behavioral, and educational. A total of 250 apps utilized a single method, 149 apps used two methods, and only 22 apps utilized all three methods. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically review all available medication adherence apps on the two largest app repositories. The results demonstrate a concerning lack of HCP involvement in app development and evidence base of effectiveness. More collaboration is required between relevant stakeholders to ensure development of high quality and relevant adherence apps with well-powered and robust clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of these interventions. A sound evidence base will encourage the adoption of effective adherence apps, and thus improve patient welfare in the process.",2018.0,40.0,156.0,"{'volume': '6', 'name': 'JMIR mHealth and uHealth'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ahmed2018MedicationAA,\n author = {Imran Ahmed and N.

This article proposes a relational approach to the study of political-legal institutions in China. To understand the order and exercise of power by various political-legal institutions, the relational approach emphasizes the spatial positions of actors or institutions (the police, courts, lawyers, etc.) within the broader political-legal system and their mutual interactions. We suggest that the changing ideas of the Chinese leadership about the role of law as an instrument of governance have shaped the relations between various legal and political institutions. The interactions of these political-legal institutions (e.g. the “iron triangle” of the police, the court and the procuracy) further reveal the dynamics of power relations at work.",2019.0,76.0,17.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '1 - 18', 'name': 'Asian Journal of Law and Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Wang2019OrderingPU,\n author = {Juan Wang and Sida Liu},\n journal = {Asian Journal of Law and Society},\n pages = {1 - 18},\n title = {Ordering Power under the Party: A Relational Approach to Law and Politics in China},\n volume = {6},\n year = {2019}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1996137662', 'name': 'Juan Wang'}, {'authorId': '47130077', 'name': 'Sida Liu'}]"

The control-process view holds that people have a goal in mind and try to move toward it (or away from it), monitoring the extent to which a discrepancy remains between the goal and one's present state and taking steps to reduce the discrepancy (or enlarge it). Dynamic systems models tend to emphasize a bottom-up self-organization process, in which a coherence arises from among many simultaneous influences, moving the system toward attractors and away from repellers. We suggest that these differences in emphasis reflect two facets of a more complex reality involving both types of processes. Discussion focuses on how self-organization may occur within constituent elements of a feedback system—the input function, the output function, and goal values being used by the system—and how feedback processes themselves can reflect self-organizing tendencies.",2002.0,105.0,302.0,"{'volume': '6', 'pages': '304 - 315', 'name': 'Personality and Social Psychology Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Carver2002ControlPA,\n author = {C.

Ratings of 54 English and 52 Swedish patients on a 65 item comprehensive psychopathology scale were used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness in the combined sample. Ratings on these 17 items for 64 patients participating in studies of four different antidepressant drugs were used to create a depression scale consisting of the 10 items which showed the largest changes with treatment and the highest correlation to overall change. The inter-rater reliability of the new depression scale was high. Scores on the scale correlated significantly with scores on a standard rating scale for depression, the Hamilton Rating Scale (HRS), indicating its validity as a general severity estimate. Its capacity to differentiate between responders and non-responders to antidepressant treatment was better than the HRS, indicating greater sensitivity to change.

I also discuss how co-evolution of human capabilities and technologies can be enhanced for lifelong and ongoing learning needs. and self-regulated learning, STEM - - Learning in Technology Enhanced Learning Embedding computational thinking in Dutch primary teacher The proposed presentation addresses the gradually growing role of computational thinking (CT) in the Dutch primary teacher training curriculum. Over recent years, CT has gained the status of ‘desired newcomer’ in primary education, as a subset of digital literacy. However, teachers often feel ill-equipped to teach CT. It stands to reason that the marginal role for CT in primary teacher education is at least partly to blame. The research question central to this study is, therefore, ‘How do student characteristics relate to the knowledge, skills, and attitude that Dutch pre-service primary school teachers have towards CT?’. A survey was conducted among some 200 Dutch pre-service teachers. The results show significant differences between institutes for teacher training and the way they teach CT, but also between groups of students: female students and students less proficient in mathematics especially appear to be less confident in teaching CT. Moreover, even though the concept of CT is generally familiar to students, many of them are not aware of the newly formulated core objectives pertaining to CT in primary education. This implies that institutes for teacher training should find common ground in teaching CT didactics as well as stimulate students’ confidence in this field. a response to the need for well-trained reflective science and engineering professionals and the subsequent question of teachers about how reflection can be designed and embedded in a meaningful way, especially in technical programs. Within this project, eight technical education teams from two Dutch universities of applied sciences are working on improving the use of reflection in their curriculum. Among other things, teachers are professionalized in their guidance skills, to improve the guidance of reflective activities of their students. Throughout the project, there are also several research activities being performed and one of them focuses on answering the following three research questions: 1) How do technical students value current reflection activities in their study program?; 2) On which level do technical students reflect according to their own judgement?; and 3) To what extent do technical students have and inclination and need for self-reflection? A questionnaire was used to answer these questions. Data of 943 students (year 1-4; 8 technical programs) were gathered, results are now being analyzed. The results will be shared during the presentation and give further direction to optimize reflection activities within higher education programs. This study illustrates how primary and secondary school students’ (N=65) skills for collaborative learning and regulation develope when participating in collaborative STEAM-activities. Participants from 4th, 6th and 8th grades participated in STEAM-project for 3-5 weeks. Questionnaire and group learning diary data was collected regularly throughout the STEAM-project. Qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics are used to capture the development of collaborative learning skills and attitudes. Preliminary results indicate that in general, engaging in a STEAM-project affected positively both to collaborative learning skills and attitudes. Also, it is evident that even the 4th graders can plan, monitor and assess their progress and learning when they are guided and supported to do that. Preliminary results also indicate that STEAM-project offered possibilities to learn various knowledge and skills. This study supports the current field of practice-based educational research by increasing our shared regulation of learning among primary and secondary school students. In addition, this study provides practical examples of conducting STEAM- project which guides the children to develop their collaboration and regulation skills. Following the rapid developments in educational technology, many higher education institutes are starting to innovate education to offer flexible and personalised education. This changes what is required of teachers by asking them to support novel ways of teaching and developing their students’ digital literacy (Uerz, Volman, & Kral, 2018). However, research has shown that teachers often lack the knowledge, skills, and self-confidence to improve their courses through the use of educational technology, indicating a need for professional development in this field (Tondeur et al., 2012). In the context of higher education, little is known about what constitutes successful professional development in this specific area. Therefore, there is a practical demand to identify building blocks for arranging effective professional development programmes. This study presents the results of a practical literature review focusing on all aspects related to professional development of higher education teachers in the context of educational innovation with technology. The literature review resulted in a large number of building blocks, which were narrowed down based on interviews with experts in the field of professional development. The findings will be used to develop a toolkit to help design professional development programmes in higher education aimed at educational innovation with technology. ""What teaching approaches do HE teachers use in their classes?"" in education, Professional Development, Teaching approaches In order to investigate how HE teachers use need-supporting and need-thwarting teaching approaches in their classes, a qualitative, descriptive study was conducted. Twelve classes of four HE teachers were video recorded. In response to the lack of a validated coding scheme for need-supportive and need-thwarting teaching approaches in HE, an appropriate coding scheme was developed consisting of 26 deductive and 9 inductive codes. The total number of coded teaching approaches was N=1508. Teachers showed 12 different forms of structure, 6 different forms of relatedness, 8 different forms of autonomy, 6 ways of control and 3 forms of non-relatedness. Teachers used structure, relatedness and autonomy approaches in a ratio of 2:1:1. In addition, the need- thwarting approaches constituted 11% of the total number of approaches used. The control approaches were mostly used when informing students about the way of testing. After identifying the different need-supportive and need-thwarting teaching approaches and the relative distribution of approaches in the instructional patterns, a higher order cluster analysis was performed to identify more frequent combinations of teaching approaches. This analysis resulted in 5 clusters. Insights in student drop social field research and 4D-mapping perspective (CANCELLED) influenced their study in a positive and/or negative way. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse these field maps. This study shows the impact of the quality of the semester planning (week schedules, tasks and deadlines, evaluations, classes, etc.) on students’ wellbeing and learning. The sculptures also illustrate the very low status that students take in relation to all other roles which suggests the need to transform the relationship between course leaders and students. This research also demonstrates a possible value of social field research and 4D-mapping to get further insight in educational systems. ICT proficiency, previous CT experience, and overall support for technology integration on readiness, beliefs, and CT teaching practices. The current study reveals that teachers are interested in teaching CT. However, they hold a widespread misconception (Fessakis & Prantsoudi, 2019), confusing CT with programming or technology use. ICT proficiency is indeed associated with beliefs about CT and readiness for teaching CT. Readiness for teaching CT, beliefs about CT, and previous CT experience are the strongest predictors for CT teaching practices. In line with Cuny et al.

The main objective of this work is to confirm whether individuals with SAD contribute to the finding of spectral power between theta and beta ratio (THBR) activity. The second objective is to compare the individual differences between resting-state brain oscillations and recovery from social performing task for SAD and healthy control (HC) groups. From 10 healthy participants (5 SAD and 5 HC), resting-state EEG during (eyes open, eyes closed) and during recovery from social performing task (self-presentation) was recorded. Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) for SAD was administered to determine the severity level of social anxiety in all participants. As a result, findings reported here suggests that increased THBR and FMT may reflect a reduced frontal cortical activity over subcortical oscillations. In accordance with several findings, THBR was found to correlate negatively with the self-reported score of SIAS in SAD group but correlate positively with HC group. As we hypothesized, SAD individuals showed less FMT comparing to the HC group which indicates that FMT is a neurophysiological correlate on anxiety state more than anxiety trait. These results are steady with previous studies and support the concept that slow wave/ fast wave and FMT may provide a useful tool in the study of affect and the neural mechanism of emotion regulation. Together, our findings interpreted to suggest that THBR and FMT are possible neurobiological markers for SAD and can differentiate between state and trait SAD during resting state and social stressors.",2020.0,32.0,5.0,"{'pages': '107-112', 'name': '2020 10th IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Al-Ezzi2020EEGFT,\n author = {Abdulhakim Al-Ezzi and N.

It is clearly an emotional process due to its complex and uncertain nature, and involves individuals’ emotion regulation, yet the current research lacks an effective conversion path from emotion to digital business model innovation (BMI). Drawing on theories and research on emotion regulation and business model innovation, we investigate how emotion regulation of entrepreneurs (i.e., cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) influence digital BMI. Data from 126 new ventures show that entrepreneurs’ reappraisal positively affects digital BMI, while entrepreneurs’ suppression exerts opposite effects on digital BMI. Moreover, we find that environmental dynamism moderates this relationship.

To answer this profound political as well as theoretical question, Jie Chen explores attitudinal and behavioral orientation of China's new middle class to democracy and democratization. Chen's work is based on a unique set of data collected from a probability-sample survey and in-depth interviews of residents in three major Chinese cities, Beijing, Chengdu and Xi'an--each of which represents a distinct level of economic development in urban China-in 2007 and 2008. The empirical findings derived from this data set confirm that (1) compared to other social classes, particularly lower classes, the new Chinese middle class-especially those employed in the state apparatus-tends to be more supportive of the current Party-state but less supportive of democratic values and institutions; (2) the new middle class's attitudes toward democracy may be accounted for by this class's close ideational and institutional ties with the state, and its perceived socioeconomic wellbeing, among other factors; (3) the lack of support for democracy among the middle class tends to cause this social class to act in favor of the current state but in opposition to democratic changes. The most important political implication is that while China's middle class is not likely to serve as the harbinger of democracy now, its current attitudes toward democracy may change in the future. Such a crucial shift in the middle class's orientation toward democracy can take place, especially when its dependence on the Party-state decreases and perception of its own social and economic statuses turns pessimistic. The key theoretical implication from the findings suggests that the attitudinal and behavioral orientations of the middle class-as a whole and as a part-toward democratic change in late developing countries are contingent upon its relationship with the incumbent state and its perceived social/economic wellbeing, and the middle class's support for democracy in these countries is far from inevitable.

The choice may relate to the further existence of people on Earth. In the context of most challenging political, economic and social crises, the tandem of natural and human sciences produces unexpected results, despite the crises accompanying these processes. This article presents a model of the society and a model of the human in the systemic parametrical aspect. The human is considered as part of the “society” system. The research suggests applying the systems parametric method developed by Prof. A. Uyemov in the 1960s. Humanity creates increasingly frequent bifurcation conditions for human life. As an adaptive mechanism, the human has to develop survival strategies and well-being strategies. The paper presents some aspects of the adaptive mechanisms of the 21st century man. It also considers some threats arising out of environmental variability. Cyborgization is one of such threats. The research includes dual system modelling of the “society” system based on the complementarity principle.

Arguing that the child represents a limit case of adult normative discourses about both rights and digital media practices, this article harnesses the radical potential of the figure of the child to rethink (human and children’s) rights in relation to the digital. In doing so, we critique the implicitly adult, seemingly invulnerable subject of rights common in research and advocacy about digital environments.

As a validation test, we show that our technique yields estimates of CEO effects more in line with what would be expected from accepted theory about CEO influence on performance. We do this by examining the CEO effects in subsamples of low-, medium-, and high-discretion industries. Finally, we show that our technique generates substantially different�and we argue more logical�estimates of the effects of many individual CEOs than are obtained through customary analyses.

Our decision tasks distinguish between a person’s desire to achieving the social optimum, equality or advantageous relative standing. Most people appear to disregard relative payoffs, instead typically making choices resulting in higher social payoffs. While we do not find a strong general correlation between happiness and concern for relative payoffs, we do observe that a willingness to lower another person’s payoff below one’s own (competitive preferences) seems correlated with unhappiness.",2001.0,41.0,392.0,{'name': 'Behavioral & Experimental Economics'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Charness2001RelativePA,\n author = {G.

To explore how digital technologies are changing the way companies do business, MIT Sloan Management Review and Deloitte surveyed more than 4,800 respondents and interviewed 19 business and thought leaders. The central question the authors asked: How are companies using digital technologies such as social media, data and analytics, mobile devices and cloud computing to compete and operate differently? Using results from these quantitative and qualitative data, the authors provide insights on the state of digital business and what managers need to know and do to navigate and benefit from these trends. A key concept behind this research is digital business maturity. The authors asked survey respondents to imagine an ideal organization transformed by digital technologies and capabilities that improve processes, engage talent across the organization, and drive new and value-generating business models and then to rate their company against that ideal on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the closest to the ideal). Forty-five percent of respondents placed their companies in the middle or developing group (ratings 4-6), while 29% put their companies in the higher maturing category (ratings 7-10). The remaining 26% placed their companies in the lower early group (ratings 1-3). Perhaps the main insight is that the key drivers of digital transformation are not the digital technologies themselves but business factors in particular, strategy, culture and talent development. Effective digital strategies are less about acquiring and implementing the right technology than about reconfiguring the business to take advantage of the information these technologies enable. The authors found that the objectives of a companys digital strategy also differ depending on digital maturity. The vast majority of companies surveyed want to use digital technologies to improve customer interactions. What differentiates the most mature companies, however, is a willingness to use digital to transform their business more broadly. Respondents expressed a strong preference for working for a digitally mature company. However, a surprisingly high number of employees were dissatisfied with how their companies were reacting to digital trends overall",2015.0,1.0,157.0,"{'volume': '56', 'pages': '37-44', 'name': 'MIT Sloan Management Review'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Kane2015IsYB,\n author = {Gerald C.

There is also keen interest in using these technologies to regulate and optimize the emotional experiences of spaces, such as workplaces, hospitals, prisons, classrooms, travel infrastructures, restaurants, retail and chain stores. Developers frequently claim that their applications do not identify people. Taking the claim at face value, this paper asks, what are the privacy implications of emotional AI practices that do not identify individuals? To investigate privacy perspectives on soft non-identifying emotional AI, the paper draws upon the following: over 100 interviews with the emotion detection industry, legal community, policy-makers, regulators and NGOs interested in privacy; a workshop with stakeholders to design ethical codes for using data about emotions; a UK survey of 2068 citizens on feelings about emotion capture technologies. It finds a weak consensus among social stakeholders on the need for privacy, this driven by different interests and motivations. Given this weak consensus, it concludes that there exists a limited window of opportunity to societally agree principles of practice regarding privacy and the use of data about emotions.",2020.0,56.0,55.0,"{'volume': '7', 'name': 'Big Data & Society'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{McStay2020EmotionalAS,\n author = {Andrew McStay},\n journal = {Big Data & Society},\n title = {Emotional AI, soft biometrics and the surveillance of emotional life: An unusual consensus on privacy},\n volume = {7},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2745471', 'name': 'Andrew McStay'}]"

The consistent findings from this literature review are as follows: (1) environmental monitoring and enforcement activities generate substantial specific deterrence, reducing future violations at the targeted firm; (2) environmental monitoring and enforcement activities generate substantial general deterrence, reducing future violations at facilities other than the targeted one; and (3) environmental monitoring and enforcement activities generate not only reductions in violations but also significant reductions in emissions.

Beyond childhood trauma, there is increasing evidence that bullying, social exclusion, and discrimination during adolescence and adulthood may increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder, and that such forms of traumatization may also underlie the elevated psychosis risk among migrants or persons with a visible minority status. In this umbrella review, we systematically assess meta-analyses regarding trauma and social adversity. A systematic literature review yielded 11 meta-analyses that met inclusion criteria and could be summarized quantitatively with a random effect model. Furthermore, six meta-analyses were evaluated qualitatively. Heterogeneity and publication bias were apparent in several meta-analyses. We observed that most significant social risk factors for psychosis were vulnerability for racist discrimination [OR = 3.90 (3.25–4.70)], migration [OR = 2.22 (1.75–2.80)], and childhood adversities [OR = 2.81 (2.03–3.83)]. Furthermore, social factors increasing the risk for psychosis were variation/impairment of parental communication, aversive adult life events, bullying, and factors associated with social isolation and discrimination. In spite of these environmental risk factors, there is a lack of evidence regarding treatment of trauma and psychosis, although some psychotherapeutic and art therapy approaches appear to be promising.

Few studies, however, have considered variables that might moderate this relationship. The current study attempts to fill this gap in the literature by examining two possible moderators of the effects of entrepreneurial self-efficacy on firm performance: dispositional optimism and environmental dynamism. Results indicate that these factors do indeed moderate the effects of entrepreneurial self-efficacy; in fact, a three-way interaction between self-efficacy, optimism, and environmental dynamism was observed with respect to firm performance. Consistent with predictions, in dynamic environments, the effects of high entrepreneurial self-efficacy on firm performance were positive when combined with moderate optimism, but negative when combined with high optimism. In stable environments, in contrast, the effects of self-efficacy were relatively weak, and were not moderated by optimism. Overall, results suggest that high self-efficacy is not always beneficial for entrepreneurs and may, in fact, exert negative effects under some conditions.

Theory from affective science and affective neuroscience can be used to systematically integrate affect into cognitive architectures, particularly in areas where cognitive system behavior is known to be associated with physiological structure and behavior. I introduce a unified theory and model of human behavior that integrates physiology and primal affect with cognitive processes in a cognitive architecture. This new architecture gives a more tractable, mechanistic way to simulate affect-cognition interactions to provide specific, quantitative predictions. It considers affect as a lower-level, functional process that interacts with cognitive processes (e.g., declarative memory) to result in emotional behavior. This formulation makes it more straightforward to connect these affective representations with other related moderating processes that may not specifically be considered as emotional (e.g., thirst or stress). An improved understanding of the architecture that constrains our behavior gives us a better opportunity to comprehend why we behave the way we do and how we can use this knowledge to recognize and construct a more ideal internal and external environment.",2019.0,71.0,5.0,"{'volume': '12', 'pages': '318-328', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Dancy2019AHC,\n author = {Christopher L.

Aesthetic responses to visual art involve sensory, cognitive and visceral processes. Neuroimaging studies have yielded a wealth of information regarding aesthetic appreciation and beauty using visual art as stimuli, but few have considered the effect of expertise on visual and visceral responses. To study the time course of visual, cognitive and emotional processes in response to visual art we investigated the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited whilst viewing and rating the visceral affect of three categories of visual art. Two groups, artists and non-artists viewed representational, abstract and indeterminate 20th century art. Early components, particularly the N1, related to attention and effort, and the P2, linked to higher order visual processing, was enhanced for artists when compared to non-artists. This effect was present for all types of art, but further enhanced for abstract art (AA), which was rated as having lowest visceral affect by the non-artists. The later, slow wave processes (500–1000 ms), associated with arousal and sustained attention, also show clear differences between the two groups in response to both type of art and visceral affect. AA increased arousal and sustained attention in artists, whilst it decreased in non-artists.

A decentred analysis has several strands, and seeing the nature and problems of regulation from a decentred perspective can be very stimulating. It opens up the cognitive frame of what 'regulation' is, enabling commentators to spot regulation in previously unsuspected places. It can prompt policy thinkers in academia and government to consider a wide range of different configurations of state, market, community, associations and networks to deliver public policy goals. But a decentred understanding of regulation also raises quite fundamental questions of the nature and understanding of regulation, the consequent role of the state, and our understanding of law. It means we can no longer escape the need to address the question of just what it is that is being 'decentred', of what it is that we want the concept of 'regulation' to do, and what some of the implications of that decision might be.

Though the amalgamation of AI and HRM is attracting many researchers still many facets of the field are yet to be explored. The current study suggests a collaborative approach by highlighting the complementary role of HRM in effective utilization of AI and adds to the existing literature. The dependency of AI and HR on each other suggests that the organizations should focus on implementing the AI as a supporting tool for HR and not overrule the role of HR.

By and large, the literature has analyzed the impact of environmental regulation on innovation and on productivity generally in separate analyses and mostly focusing on the USA. The few existing studies focusing on Europe investigate the effect of environmental regulation either on green innovation or on performance indicators such as exports. We instead look at overall innovation and productivity impact that are the most relevant indicators for the “strong” PH. This approach allows us to account for potential opportunity costs of induced innovations. As a proxy of environmental policy stringency we use pollution abatement and control expenditures (PACE), which represent one of the few indicators available at the sectoral level. We remedy upon its main drawback, that of potential endogeneity of PACE, by adopting an instrumental variable estimation approach. We find evidence of a positive impact of environmental regulation on the output of innovation activity, as proxied by patents, thus providing support in favor of the “weak” PH in line with most of the literature. On the other front, we find no evidence in favor or against the “strong” PH, as productivity appears to be unaffected by the degree of pollution control and abatement efforts.",2014.0,79.0,672.0,{'name': 'SRPN: Production Issues (Topic)'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Rubashkina2014EnvironmentalRA,\n author = {Yana Rubashkina and M.

Second, the authors argue that the available evidence does not show an unambiguous causal relation to emotions, and appraisals appear as consequences of emotions as well as antecedents.

emerging across the financial services industry, helping consumers choose

the potential to lower the cost and increase the quality and transparency of

for regulators who are accustomed to assessing human intermediaries. A welldesigned 
robo advisor will be honest and competent, and it will recommend 
only suitable products. Because humans design and implement robo advisors, 
however, honesty, competence, and suitability cannot simply be assumed. 
Moreover, robo advisors pose new scale risks that are different in kind from 
the risks involved in assessing the conduct of thousands of individual actors. 
This Essay identifies the core components of robo advisors, key questions that 
regulators need to be able to answer about them, and the capacities that 
regulators need to develop in order to answer those questions. The benefits to 
developing these capacities almost certainly exceed the costs, because the same 
returns to scale that make an automated advisor so cost-effective lead to 
similar returns to scale in assessing the quality of automated advisors.",2018.0,18.0,72.0,{'name': 'Consumer Law eJournal'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Baker2018RegulatingRA,\n author = {T. Baker and B.

The research aims to theoretically justify and experimentally verify the effectiveness of military-and-patriotic education of young people using physical culture and sports based on ethnopedagogy, following neuropedagogical criteria of their psychophysical readiness for homeland defenсe. The authors of the research offer to introduce the specialized course on martial arts of Ukraine, which refers to the worldview and mindset of Ukrainians underlying the Ukrainian military (combat) culture, as well as strengthening and enhancement of neuropsychological properties and symptom complexes of character. The control group pupils (25) were taught based on the traditional system (they acquired and improved their knowledge, abilities and skills in preliminary military training). The experimental group pupils (25) purposefully studied the specialized course on the martial arts of Ukraine. Such methods as surveys, questionnaires, tests, interviews and observations were used to conduct neuropsychological diagnostics of young people’s readiness for homeland defenсe.

In this paper, we focus on the challenging issue of recognizing the emotion content of music signals, or music emotion recognition (MER). Specifically, we formulate MER as a regression problem to predict the arousal and valence values (AV values) of each music sample directly. Associated with the AV values, each music sample becomes a point in the arousal-valence plane, so the users can efficiently retrieve the music sample by specifying a desired point in the emotion plane. Because no categorical taxonomy is used, the regression approach is free of the ambiguity inherent to conventional categorical approaches. To improve the performance, we apply principal component analysis to reduce the correlation between arousal and valence, and RReliefF to select important features. An extensive performance study is conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the regression approach for predicting AV values. The best performance evaluated in terms of the R 2 statistics reaches 58.3% for arousal and 28.1% for valence by employing support vector machine as the regressor. We also apply the regression approach to detect the emotion variation within a music selection and find the prediction accuracy superior to existing works. A group-wise MER scheme is also developed to address the subjectivity issue of emotion perception.",2008.0,44.0,445.0,"{'volume': '16', 'pages': '448-457', 'name': 'IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Yang2008ARA,\n author = {Yi-Hsuan Yang and Yu-Ching Lin and Ya-Fan Su and Homer H.

A more accurate means of prognostication in breast cancer will improve the selection of patients for adjuvant systemic therapy.


METHODS
Using microarray analysis to evaluate our previously established 70-gene prognosis profile, we classified a series of 295 consecutive patients with primary breast carcinomas as having a gene-expression signature associated with either a poor prognosis or a good prognosis. All patients had stage I or II breast cancer and were younger than 53 years old; 151 had lymph-node-negative disease, and 144 had lymph-node-positive disease. We evaluated the predictive power of the prognosis profile using univariable and multivariable statistical analyses.


RESULTS
Among the 295 patients, 180 had a poor-prognosis signature and 115 had a good-prognosis signature, and the mean (+/-SE) overall 10-year survival rates were 54.6+/-4.4 percent and 94.5+/-2.6 percent, respectively. At 10 years, the probability of remaining free of distant metastases was 50.6+/-4.5 percent in the group with a poor-prognosis signature and 85.2+/-4.3 percent in the group with a good-prognosis signature. The estimated hazard ratio for distant metastases in the group with a poor-prognosis signature, as compared with the group with the good-prognosis signature, was 5.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 9.0; P<0.001). This ratio remained significant when the groups were analyzed according to lymph-node status. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that the prognosis profile was a strong independent factor in predicting disease outcome.


CONCLUSIONS
The gene-expression profile we studied is a more powerful predictor of the outcome of disease in young patients with breast cancer than standard systems based on clinical and histologic criteria.",2002.0,22.0,6199.0,"{'volume': '347 25', 'pages': '\n          1999-2009\n        ', 'name': 'The New England journal of medicine'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Vijver2002AGS,\n author = {M.

This has left many in the plastic surgery community calling for the development of more structured oversight and guidance regarding video sharing on social media. To date, no official guidelines exist for plastic surgeons to follow. Little is known about the ethical implications of social media use by plastic surgeons, especially with regard to video sharing. A systematic review of the literature on social media use in plastic surgery was performed on October 31, 2016, with an emphasis on ethics and professionalism. An ethical analysis was conducted using the four principles of medical ethics. The initial search yielded 87 articles. Thirty-four articles were included for analyses that were found to be relevant to the use of social media in plastic surgery. No peer-reviewed articles were found that mentioned Snapchat or addressed the ethical implications of sharing live videos of plastic surgery on social media. Using the four principles of medical ethics, it was determined that significant ethical concerns exist with broadcasting these videos. This analysis fills an important gap in the plastic surgery literature by addressing the ethical issues concerning live surgery broadcasts on social media.

Despite the apparent simplicity of this tripartite model, the structure of SWB remains in question.

Supporting evidence for each of these models is reviewed, strengths and weaknesses are evaluated, and commonalities and discrepancies among approaches are described. The authors demonstrate how current ambiguities concerning the tripartite structure of SWB have fundamental implications for conceptualization, measurement, analysis, and synthesis. Given these ambiguities, it is premature to propose a definitive structure of SWB.

However, the theories used to explain possible effects are often invoked at a very broad level without explication of specific mechanisms by which the affordances of TUIs may be important for learning processes. Equally problematic, we lack theoretically grounded guidance for TUI designers as to what design choices might have significant impacts on learning and how to make informed choices in this regard. In this paper, we build on previous efforts to address the need for a structure to think about TUI design for learning by constructing the Tangible Learning Design Framework. We first compile a taxonomy of five elements for thinking about the relationships between TUI features, interactions and learning.We then briefly review cognitive, constructivist, embodied, distributed and social perspectives on cognition and learning and match specific theories to the key elements in the taxonomy to determine guidelines for design. In each case, we provide examples from previous work to explicate our guidelines; where empirical work is lacking, we suggest avenues for further research. Together, the taxonomy and guidelines constitute the Tangible Learning Design Framework. The framework advances thinking in the area by highlighting decisions in TUI design important for learning, providing initial guidance for thinking about these decisions through the lenses of theories of cognition and learning, and generating a blueprint for research on testable mechanisms of action by which TUI design can affect learning.",2013.0,145.0,156.0,"{'volume': '25', 'pages': '1-20', 'name': 'Interact.

In this review article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential data sources exist; evaluate the need for machine learning; and examine the potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide clinical care; use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely phenotype complex disease; and the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence.

The views presented at that time were simple wire frame models. The advance of computer graphics knowledge and technology, itself tied to the enormous increase in processing power and decrease in cost, together with the development of relatively efficient and unobtrusive sensing devices, has led to the emergence of participatory immersive virtual environments, commonly referred to as ""virtual reality"" (VR) (Fisher 1982; Fisher et. al. 1986; Teitel 1990; see also SIGGRAPH Panel Proceedings 1989,1990). Ellis defines virtualisation as ""the process by which a human viewer interprets a patterned sensory impression to be an extended object in an environment other than that in which it physically exists"" (Ellis, 1991). In this definition the idea is taken from geometric optics, where the concept of a ""virtual image"" is precisely defined, and is well understood. In the context of virtual reality the ""patterned sensory impressions"" are generated to the human senses through visual, auditory, tactile and kinesthetic displays, though systems that effectively present information in all such sensory modalities do not exist at present. Ellis further distinguishes between a virtual space, image and environment. An example of the first is a flat surface on which an image is rendered. Perspective depth cues, texture gradients, occlusion, and other similar aspects of the image lead to an observer perceiving",1994.0,42.0,203.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Slater1994BodyCI,\n author = {M.

While task performance metrics are commonly used to objectively and quantitatively analyse productivity systems; with play systems, the quality of the experience, not the performance of the participant is important. This research presents three experiments that examine users' physiological signals to continuously model user emotion during interaction with play technologies. Modeled emotions are powerful because they capture usability and playability, account for user emotion, are quantitative and objective, and can be represented continuously. 
In Experiment One we explored how physiological signals respond to interaction with play technologies. We collected a variety of physiological measures while observing participants playing a computer game in four difficulty conditions, providing a basis for experimental exploration of this domain. 
In Experiment Two we investigated how physiological signals differ between play conditions, and how physiological signals co-vary with subjective reports. A different physiological response was observed when playing a computer game against a co-located friend versus a computer. When normalized, the physiological results mirrored subjective reports. 
In Experiment Three we developed a method for modeling emotion using physiological data. A fuzzy logic model transformed four physiological signals into arousal and valence. A second fuzzy logic model transformed arousal and valence into five emotions: boredom, challenge, excitement, frustration, and fun. The modeled emotions' means were evaluated with test data, and exhibited the same trends as the reported emotions for fun, boredom, and excitement, but modeled emotions revealed differences between three play conditions, while differences between reported emotions were not significant. 
Mean emotion modeled from physiological data fills a knowledge gap for objective and quantitative evaluation of entertainment technologies. Using our technique, user emotion can be analyzed over an entire experience, revealing variance within and between conditions. This continuous representation has a high evaluative bandwidth, and is important because the process , not the outcome of playing determines success. The continuous representation of modeled emotion is a powerful evaluative tool, that when combined with other approaches, forms a robust method for evaluating user interaction with play technologies.",2005.0,0.0,22.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Mandryk2005ModelingUE,\n author = {R.

However, there are several concerns focusing on the issues of security and privacy in EHR system. The EHR data contains the EHR owner’s sensitive personal information, if these data are obtained by a malicious user, it will not only cause the leakage of patient’s privacy, but also affect the doctor’s diagnosis. It is a very challenging problem for the EHR owner fully controls over own EHR data as well as preserves the privacy of himself. In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving access control (PPAC) scheme for EHR. To achieve fine-grained access control of the EHR data, we utilize the attribute-based signcryption (ABSC) mechanism to signcrypt data based on the access policy for the linear secret sharing schemes. Employing the cuckoo filter to hide the access policy, it could protect the EHR owner’s privacy information. In addition, the security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is provably secure under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption and the computational Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption in the standard model. Furthermore, the performance analysis indicates that the proposed scheme achieves low costs of communication and computation compared with the related schemes, meanwhile preserves the EHR owner’s privacy. Therefore, the proposed scheme is better suited to EHR system.",2018.0,50.0,28.0,"{'volume': '18', 'name': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ming2018EfficientPA,\n author = {Yang Ming and Tingting Zhang},\n journal = {Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)},\n title = {Efficient Privacy-Preserving Access Control Scheme in Electronic Health Records System},\n volume = {18},\n year = {2018}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '1390428818', 'name': 'Yang Ming'}, {'authorId': '2146320319', 'name': 'Tingting Zhang'}]"

He believed everyone should own an iPad. But he refused to let his kids use the device. It seemed as if the people producing tech products were following the cardinal rule of drug dealing: never get high on your own supply. Greg Hochmuth, one of Instagram’s founding engineers, realized he was building an engine for addiction. “There’s always another hashtag to click on,” Hochmuth said. “Then it takes on its own life, like an organism, and people can become obsessive.” Instagram, like so many other social media platforms, is bottomless. Facebook has an endless feed; Netflix automatically moves on to the next episode in a series; Tinder encourages users to keep swiping in search of a better option. Users benefit from these apps and websites, but also struggle to use them in moderation. According to Tristan Harris, a “design ethicist,” the problem isn’t that people lack willpower; it’s that “there are a thousand people on the other side of the screen whose job it is to break down the self-regulation you have.” In many respects, substance addictions and behavioral addictions are very similar. They activate the same brain regions, and they’re fueled by some of the same basic human needs: social engagement and social support, mental stimulation, and a sense of effectiveness. Strip people of these needs and they’re more likely to develop addictions to both substances and behaviors. Behavioral addiction consists of six ingredients: compelling goals that are just beyond reach; irresistible and unpredictable positive feedback; a sense of incremental progress and improvement; tasks that become slowly more difficult over time; unresolved tensions that demand resolution; and strong social connections.

2886,f6b579548544c2fe812f8d59cfcd9acdf4da930f,The Judicial Reform in China: The Status Quo and Future Directions,"This article shows that Chinese adjudication is in a dilemma: on one hand, the judicial discretion is extensive; on the other hand, public opinion supervision is adopted to control the discretion. In fact, the public opinion and judicial discretion could co-exist and compliment one another. There is no objective and stable framework regulating both. There are attempts aiming to completely negate the judicial discretion, such as computer sentencing. A strange logic of judicial reform exists in China: either eliminating the judicial discretion through such mechanical methods as computer sentencing in the hope to guarantee judgment in conformity with the law; or resorting to the arbitrary external power intervention or public opinion supervision to constrain the judicial discretion, resulting in a new form of discretion.In the author's opinion, the critical nexus of institutional designing of good governance is an independent judiciary following the principle of procedural fairness. Therefore it is necessary for China to first establish the courts' authority through judicial reforms, laying the institutional foundation of rule-of-law. Then comes the supervising and checking of the legality of the government power. More importantly, an independent judiciary functions as a neutral arbiter of conflicting interest groups and a third-party enforcer of contracts, which enhances the predictability of market transactions and safeguards fair competition.Compared with structural shift of political power, judicial reform is relatively less difficult and more practical. If judicial reform dooms to fail, how is it possible for a comprehensive political reform to succeed? It is admitted that the judicial reform is subject to the overall power arrangements, nevertheless, it is still probable that we resort to judicial reform, as a breakthrough or reference, a gradual switch on the transformation of political power structure, centering on fundamental requirements of rule-of-law. This roadmap, of course, has preconditions, that is, that the ruler has adequate practical rationality and that society reaches consensus on rule-of-law.",2013.0,2.0,14.0,"{'volume': '20', 'pages': '185 - 220', 'name': 'Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ji2013TheJR,\n author = {Weidong Ji},\n journal = {Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies},\n pages = {185 - 220},\n title = {The Judicial Reform in China: The Status Quo and Future Directions},\n volume = {20},\n year = {2013}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2239637973', 'name': 'Weidong Ji'}]"

Challenges in balance and error-coping accumulate. We introduce the concept of deep player behavior models by applying machine learning techniques to individual, atomic decision-making strategies. We discuss their potential application fields in personalized challenges, autonomous game testing, human agent substitution, and online crime detection. Results from a pilot study that was carried out with the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Lineage II depict a benchmark between hidden markov models, decision trees, and deep learning. Data analysis and individual reports indicate that deep learning can be employed to provide adequate models of individual player behavior with high accuracy for predicting skill-use and a high correlation in recreating strategies from previously recorded data.",2018.0,65.0,32.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2018 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Pfau2018TowardsDP,\n author = {Johannes Pfau and Jan David Smeddinck and R.

Antonio Damasio contends that rational decisions are not the product of logic alone - they require the support of emotion and feeling. Drawing on his experience with neurological patients affected with brain damage, Dr Damasio shows how absence of emotions and feelings can break down rationality. He also offers a new perspective on what emotions and feelings actually are: a direct view of our own body states; a link between the body and its survival-oriented regulation on the one hand, and consciousness on the other. Written as a conversation between the author and an imaginary listener, Descartes' Error leads us to conclude that human organisms are endowed from their very beginning with a spirited passion for making choices, which the social mind can then use to build rational behaviour.",1994.0,0.0,5530.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': ""@Inproceedings{Damasio1994DescartesEE,\n author = {A.

However, current games are still lacking in the affective realism of the game characters, and the social complexity and realism of their interactions. To achieve the next leap in the level of engagement and effectiveness, particularly in the arena of serious games, gaming research needs to focus on enhancing the social and affective complexity and realism of the game characters, their interaction, and the game narrative as a whole. To achieve these goals, games and game development tools will need to provide functionality to support the recognition of user and game character emotions, real-time adaptation and appropriate responses to these emotions, and more realistic expression of emotions in game characters and user avatars. To support these functionalities, the games will need to construct affective models of the players, and include computational models of emotion within the game characters. In this paper, we discuss these functionalities, and suggest a set of requirements for an affective game engine, capable of supporting the development of more affectively realistic, engaging, and effective games. The discussion is organized around the functional requirements and the computational tasks necessary to support them. We emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate semantic primitives, and discuss how existing methods and techniques in affective computing and computational affective modeling contribute to the development of affective game engines and game development tools.",2009.0,48.0,112.0,{'pages': '299-306'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Hudlicka2009AffectiveGE,\n author = {E.

The results show that customers without holding any membership have higher evaluations of casino service quality; nevertheless, casino members tend to choose the casino which they hold membership with as their first choice. The mediation testing indicates that including customer satisfaction in the model increases the variance in customer loyalty only in the case of casino members.

Nowadays, these two fields are gaining popularity when working together. We have consider that it is important to know what approaches are the most used when using video games and EEG, so we have performed a systematic review through the literature about these two fields together to find the most relevant techniques. Once identified a list of techniques, we briefly explained for what they can be used. Also, we have made a ranking of these techniques by their popularity to get some perspective about them all. After the process, we have concluded that the used techniques are really diverse and that approaches used to BCI and cognitve analysis are very similar between them.",2018.0,35.0,8.0,{'pages': '483'},"{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Cabañero-Gómez2018ComputationalEA,\n author = {Luis Cabañero-Gómez and R.

This is a problem because certain failures are critical to the design intent of the game, and, as such, are desirable, whereas other failures detract from the play experience and are meant to be avoided. In this paper, we taxonomize several classes of failure in the player’s experience, offering a diagnostic tool that distinguishes in-loop failures from out-of-loop failures. By classifying both games and specific failure instances, the Taxonomy of Failure extends present vocabularies for: game designers making design choices, scholars critiquing the usability of games, educators teaching games, data analysts segmenting players, and game developers creating more adaptive games.",2020.0,54.0,11.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Aytemiz2020ADT,\n author = {Batu Aytemiz and Adam M.

Yet empirical evidence linking achievement and frustration tolerance is lacking. To facilitate work on this important topic, we developed and validated a novel behavioral measure of frustration tolerance: the Mirror Tracing Frustration Task (MTFT). In this 5-min task, participants allocate time between a difficult tracing task and entertaining games and videos. In two studies of young adults (Study 1: N = 148, Study 2: N = 283), we demonstrated that the MTFT increased frustration more than 18 other emotions, and that MTFT scores were related to self-reported frustration tolerance. Next, we assessed whether frustration tolerance correlated with similar constructs, including self-control and grit, as well as objective measures of real-world achievement. In a prospective longitudinal study of high-school seniors (N = 391), MTFT scores predicted grade-point average and standardized achievement test scores, and-more than 2 years after completing the MTFT-progress toward a college degree. Though small in size (i.e., rs ranging from .10 to .24), frustration tolerance predicted outcomes over and above a rich set of covariates, including IQ, sociodemographics, self-control, and grit. These findings demonstrate the validity of the MTFT and highlight the importance of frustration tolerance for achieving valued goals.

Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects.

We investigate the use of magnitude estimation for judging the relevance of documents for information retrieval evaluation, carrying out a large-scale user study across 18 TREC topics and collecting over 50,000 magnitude estimation judgments using crowdsourcing. Our analysis shows that magnitude estimation judgments can be reliably collected using crowdsourcing, are competitive in terms of assessor cost, and are, on average, rank-aligned with ordinal judgments made by expert relevance assessors. We explore the application of magnitude estimation for IR evaluation, calibrating two gain-based effectiveness metrics, nDCG and ERR, directly from user-reported perceptions of relevance. A comparison of TREC system effectiveness rankings based on binary, ordinal, and magnitude estimation relevance shows substantial variation; in particular, the top systems ranked using magnitude estimation and ordinal judgments differ substantially. Analysis of the magnitude estimation scores shows that this effect is due in part to varying perceptions of relevance: different users have different perceptions of the impact of relative differences in document relevance. These results have direct implications for IR evaluation, suggesting that current assumptions about a single view of relevance being sufficient to represent a population of users are unlikely to hold.",2017.0,47.0,89.0,"{'volume': '35', 'pages': '1 - 32', 'name': 'ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Maddalena2017OnCR,\n author = {Eddy Maddalena and Stefano Mizzaro and Falk Scholer and A.

Consequently, the current situation needs a change of principles of ecological control. In our case, the indicators of functional health of child population and levels of its vegetative disorders appear as integral bioindicators of individual health (dynamic stability of functional-vegetative homeostasis) and characterize the ecological dynamics in regions of compact settlement. Environmental certification of children functional health could define the region with a pre-crisis or crisis state of the environment. Vegetative levels (vegetative coefficients, k-V of functional-vegetative homeostasis testify to vegetative health (norm), or prevalence of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Permanent functional voltage distorts the pathogenesis of functional-vegetative adaptation and requires specific monitoring in the form of ""Functional-ecological expertise"" (FEE) of selected staff. The basis of the FEE methodology developed by us is ""Functional-vegetative diagnostics"" (FVD) by the method of V.G. Makats. The diagnostic complex ""BIOTEST-12M"" (Diagnostic complexes VITA-01-M and computerized system VITA-01-Biotest) serves as the technical tool of the FVD. Indicators of - vegetative coefficients (k-V = ΣSA: ΣPSA; (levels of vegetative balance, sympathetic, or parasympathetic activity) act as integral bioindicators of internal homeostasis and its dependence on the conditions of the environment. The criterion of FEE is a systemically dependent comparison of inhibition of the functional activity of the organism (parasympathetic activity (PA), vegetative equilibrium (VE) and sympathetic activity (SA) and can be calculated for children in particular region. This, we suggested the integral characteristic of territorial ecological state and the levels (zones) of ecological pressure.

Research should thus explore multimodal corpora and real-life databases (e.g. news, natural conversations). In order to collect reliable emotion annotations, one also needs to understand how people perceive emotional expressions in audio channels (vocal cues, content, and grammatical issues), and in visual channels (facial expressions, body movements, gaze, and spatial behavior). We designed EmoTV1, a corpus of video clips recorded from French TV channels containing interviews. In order to study the influence of the modalities on the perception of emotions, two annotators used the Anvil tool to annotate this corpus for three conditions: 1) audio without video, 2) video without audio, 3) video with audio. The annotators segmented the emotions perceived. Their classification resulted in a set of 14 labels: anger, despair, disgust, doubt, exaltation, fear, irritation, joy, neutral, pain, sadness, serenity, surprise and worry. The annotators also used two classical appraisal dimensions: intensity and valence (negative/positive emotion). Our work, described in this paper, lists the advantages and drawbacks of the corpus, describes how to gather a relevant corpus of video clips and define a scheme for annotating emotions.

Before I was two years old I had developed an intense involvement with automobiles. The names of car parts made up a very substantial portion of my vocabulary: I was particularly proud of knowing about the parts of the transmission system, the gearbox, and most especially the differential. It was, of course, many years later before I understood how gears work; but once I did, playing with gears became a favorite pastime. I loved rotating circular objects against one another in gearlike motions and, naturally, my first ""erector set"" project was a crude gear system. 
 
I became adept at turning wheels in my head and at making chains of cause and effect: ""This one turns this way so that must turn that way so . . . "" I found particular pleasure in such systems as the differential gear, which does not follow a simple linear chain of causality since the motion in the transmission shaft can be distributed in many different ways to the two wheels depending on what resistance they encounter. I remember quite vividly my excitement at discovering that a system could be lawful and completely comprehensible without being rigidly deterministic. 
 
I believe that working with differentials did more for my mathematical development than anything I was taught in elementary school. Gears, serving as models, carried many otherwise abstract ideas into my head. I clearly remember two examples from school math. I saw multiplication tables as gears, and my first brush with equations in two variables (e.g., 3x + 4y = 10) immediately evoked the differential. By the time I had made a mental gear model of the relation between x and y, figuring how many teeth each gear needed, the equation had become a comfortable friend. 
 
Many years later when I read Piaget this incident served me as a model for his notion of assimilation, except I was immediately struck by the fact that his discussion does not do full justice to his own idea. He talks almost entirely about cognitive aspects of assimilation. But there is also an affective component. Assimilating equations to gears certainly is a powerful way to bring old knowledge to bear on a new object. But it does more as well. I am sure that such assimilations helped to endow mathematics, for me, with a positive affective tone that can be traced back to my infantile experiences with cars. I believe Piaget really agrees. As I came to know him personally I understood that his neglect of the affective comes more from a modest sense that little is known about it than from an arrogant sense of its irrelevance. But let me return to my childhood. 
 
One day I was surprised to discover that some adults---even most adults---did not understand or even care about the magic of the gears. I no longer think much about gears, but I have never turned away from the questions that started with that discovery: How could what was so simple for me be incomprehensible to other people? My proud father suggested ""being clever"" as an explanation. But I was painfully aware that some people who could not understand the differential could easily do things I found much more difficult. Slowly I began to formulate what I still consider the fundamental fact about learning: Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of models. If you can't, anything can be painfully difficult. Here too I was developing a way of thinking that would be resonant with Piaget's. The understanding of learning must be genetic. It must refer to the genesis of knowledge. What an individual can learn, and how he learns it, depends on what models he has available. This raises, recursively, the question of how he learned these models. Thus the ""laws of learning"" must be about how intellectual structures grow out of one another and about how, in the process, they acquire both logical and emotional form. 
 
This book is an exercise in an applied genetic epistemology expanded beyond Piaget's cognitive emphasis to include a concern with the affective. It develops a new perspective for education research focused on creating the conditions under which intellectual models will take root. For the last two decades this is what I have been trying to do. And in doing so I find myself frequently reminded of several aspects of my encounter with the differential gear. First, I remember that no one told me to learn about differential gears. Second, I remember that there was feeling, love, as well as understanding in my relationship with gears. Third, I remember that my first encounter with them was in my second year. If any ""scientific"" educational psychologist had tried to ""measure"" the effects of this encounter, he would probably have failed. It had profound consequences but, I conjecture, only very many years later. A ""pre- and post-"" test at age two would have missed them. 
 
Piaget's work gave me a new framework for looking at the gears of my childhood. The gear can be used to illustrate many powerful ""advanced"" mathematical ideas, such as groups or relative motion. But it does more than this. As well as connecting with the formal knowledge of mathematics, it also connects with the ""body knowledge,"" the sensorimotor schemata of a child. You can be the gear, you can understand how it turns by projecting yourself into its place and turning with it. It is this double relationship---both abstract and sensory---that gives the gear the power to carry powerful mathematics into the mind. In a terminology I shall develop in later chapters, the gear acts here as a transitional object. 
 
A modern-day Montessori might propose, if convinced by my story, to create a gear set for children. Thus every child might have the experience I had. But to hope for this would be to miss the essence of the story. I fell in love with the gears. This is something that cannot be reduced to purely ""cognitive"" terms. Something very personal happened, and one cannot assume that it would be repeated for other children in exactly the same form. 
 
My thesis could be summarized as: What the gears cannot do the computer might. The computer is the Proteus of machines. Its essence is its universality, its power to simulate. Because it can take on a thousand forms and can serve a thousand functions, it can appeal to a thousand tastes. This book is the result of my own attempts over the past decade to turn computers into instruments flexible enough so that many children can each create for themselves something like what the gears were for me.",1981.0,0.0,7844.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Papert1981MindstormsCC,\n author = {S.

Our approach leverages on the recent success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on face recognition problems. Unlike the settings often assumed there, far less labeled data is typically available for training emotion classification systems. Our method is therefore designed with the goal of simplifying the problem domain by removing confounding factors from the input images, with an emphasis on image illumination variations. This, in an effort to reduce the amount of data required to effectively train deep CNN models. To this end, we propose novel transformations of image intensities to 3D spaces, designed to be invariant to monotonic photometric transformations. These are applied to CASIA Webface images which are then used to train an ensemble of multiple architecture CNNs on multiple representations. Each model is then fine-tuned with limited emotion labeled training data to obtain final classification models. Our method was tested on the Emotion Recognition in the Wild Challenge (EmotiW 2015), Static Facial Expression Recognition sub-challenge (SFEW) and shown to provide a substantial, 15.36% improvement over baseline results (40% gain in performance).",2015.0,46.0,300.0,{'name': 'Proceedings of the 2015 ACM on International Conference on Multimodal Interaction'},"{'bibtex': '@Article{Levi2015EmotionRI,\n author = {Gil Levi and Tal Hassner},\n journal = {Proceedings of the 2015 ACM on International Conference on Multimodal Interaction},\n title = {Emotion Recognition in the Wild via Convolutional Neural Networks and Mapped Binary Patterns},\n year = {2015}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '36813724', 'name': 'Gil Levi'}, {'authorId': '1756099', 'name': 'Tal Hassner'}]"

Therefore, this study explores the role of smartphone use with respect to these aspects. Participants were 215 Italian students attending middle school. By applying partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), the results confirm that self-regulation affects the QoL of students, but its role varies according to the degree of smartphone addiction. In conclusion, we confirm the relevance of the relationship between self-regulation and smartphone addiction in teaching students to be aware of their time spent using smartphones.

If fragmentation does not change the prices of goods, then it must increase the value of output of any country where it occurs and that of the world. 2. If fragmentation does change prices, then fragmentation can lower the welfare of a country by turning its terms of trade against it. 3. Even in a country that gains from fragmentation, it is possible (but not necessary) that some factor owners within that country will lose. 4.

During game play, the computer game was dynamically modified by the player’s biometric information to increase the cinematically augmented “horror” affordances. These included dynamic changes in the game shaders, screen shake, and the creation of new spawning points for the game’s non-playing characters (zombies), all these features were driven by the player’s biometric data. To evaluate the usefulness of this biofeedback device, we compared it against a control group of players who also had sensors clipped on their fingers, but for the second group the gameplay was not modified by the biometric information of the players.

In the course of a computer-mediated negotiation, participants received information about the emotional state (anger, happiness, or none) of their opponent. Consistent with a strategic-choice perspective, Experiment 1 showed that participants conceded more to an angry opponent than to a happy one. Experiment 2 showed that this effect was caused by tracking--participants used the emotion information to infer the other's limit, and they adjusted their demands accordingly. However, this effect was absent when the other made large concessions. Experiment 3 examined the interplay between experienced and communicated emotion and showed that angry communications (unlike happy ones) induced fear and thereby mitigated the effect of the opponent's experienced emotion.

Grounding our arguments in psychological literature on the effects of mood on information processing, motivation, and decision heuristics, we develop hypotheses about how mood can significantly affect individuals' use of structured decision protocols. In support of our hypotheses, results from an experimental study of complex decision-making suggest that, in situations where a structured decision protocol is the usual method of decision-making, individuals in moderately negative moods are significantly more likely than those in moderately positive moods to: (1) carefully execute all the steps of a structured decision protocol, (2) execute the steps of a structured decision protocol in the correct order, and (3) rely on the outcome of the structured decision protocol as the primary basis for the decision. We discuss these findings in terms of their implications for both organizational decision models and psychological models of mood and decision-making. In general, our findings help establish mood as an important variable in models of organizational decision-making and help shed light on often conflicting findings about the benefits of positive vs. negative mood for individual decision-making.",1999.0,81.0,149.0,"{'volume': '10', 'pages': '181-198', 'name': 'Organization Science'}","{'bibtex': ""@Article{Elsbach1999TheEO,\n author = {Kimberly D.

Two large samples of undergraduate students completed mindfulness questionnaires and measures of other constructs. Psychometric properties of the mindfulness questionnaires were examined, including internal consistency and convergent and discriminant relationships with other variables. Factor analyses of the combined pool of items from the mindfulness questionnaires suggested that collectively they contain five clear, interpretable facets of mindfulness. Hierarchical confirmatory factor analyses suggested that at least four of the identified factors are components of an overall mindfulness construct and that the factor structure of mindfulness may vary with meditation experience. Mindfulness facets were shown to be differentially correlated in expected ways with several other constructs and to have incremental validity in the prediction of psychological symptoms. Findings suggest that conceptualizing mindfulness as a multifaceted construct is helpful in understanding its components and its relationships with other variables.",2006.0,72.0,6176.0,"{'volume': '13', 'pages': '27 - 45', 'name': 'Assessment'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Baer2006UsingSA,\n author = {R.

The Internet of Things (IoT) environment exhibits the value added application services to the customer with the provision of the effective collection and processing of information. In the extension of the IoT, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is evolved for the patient healthcare monitoring and processing. The data collected from the IoMT are stored and processed with the cognitive system for the data transmission between the users. However, in the conventional system subjected to challenges of processing big data while transmission with the cognitive radio network. In this paper, developed a effective cognitive 5G communication model with the recommender model for the IoMT big data processing. The proposed model is termed as Ranking Strategy Internet of Medical Things (RSIoMT). The proposed RSIoMT model uses the distance vector estimation between the feature variables with the ranking. The proposed RSIoMT model perform the recommender model with the ranking those are matches with the communication devices for improved wireless communication quality. The proposed system recommender model uses the estimation of direct communication link between the IoMT variables in the cognitive radio system. The proposed RSIoMT model evaluates the collected IoMT model data with the consideration of the four different healthcare datasets for the data transmission through cognitive radio network. Through the developed model the performance of the system is evaluated based on the deep learning model with the consideration of the collaborative features. The simulation analysis is comparatively examined based on the consideration of the wireless performance. Simulation analysis expressed that the proposed RSIoMT model exhibits the superior performance than the conventional classifier. The comparative analysis expressed that the proposed mode exhibits ~3 – 4% performance improvement over the conventional classifiers. The accuracy of the  developed model achieves 99% which is ~3 – 9% higher than the conventional classifier. In terms of the channel performance, the proposed RSIoMT model exhibits the reduced recommender relay selection count of 1 while the other technique achieves the relay value of 13 which implies that proposed model performance is ~4-6% higher than the other techniques.",2022.0,0.0,2.0,"{'volume': '14', 'pages': '239-256', 'name': 'Int.

With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.",2018.0,102.0,216.0,"{'volume': '21', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fiske2018YourRT,\n author = {A.

This book sets out to examine and assess the variety of theories of information in society currently available. Frank Webster sceptically examines what thinkers mean by an information society, and looks closely at different approaches to informational developments. He provides critical commentaries on the major postwar theories: Daniel Bell's ideas on a post-industrial information society, Anthony Giddens' thoughts on the growth of surveillance and the expansion of the nation state, Herbert Schiller's insistence that information both expresses and consolidates the interests of corporate capitalism: Jurgen Habermas' account of the diminishment of the public sphere; Jean Baudrillard's thoughts on postmodernism and information, and Manuel Castells' depiction of the 'informational city'. Each theorisation is subjected to close scrutiny and is tested against empirical evidence to assess its worth. The author concludes that, while there has undoubtedly been an information explosion, it is premature to conceive of an information society. We should rather emphasise the 'informatisation' of established relations.",2015.0,220.0,753.0,"{'volume': '', 'name': ''}","{'bibtex': '@Inproceedings{Webster2015TheoriesOT,\n author = {F.

In addition to the millions of individuals who have been infected with the disease, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggests that this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes; however, researchers are rarely able to track these changes with frequent, near-real-time sampling or compare their findings to previous years of data for the same individuals. Objective By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students who have been participating in a longitudinal study for the past 2 years, we sought to answer two overarching questions. First, have the behaviors and mental health of the participants changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous time periods? Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media? Methods Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models. Results During the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19–related news. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P=.03) were significantly associated with COVID-19–related news. Conclusions Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.",2020.0,25.0,456.0,"{'volume': '22', 'name': 'Journal of Medical Internet Research'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Huckins2020MentalHA,\n author = {Jeremy F.

ADHD and ASD diagnosis mainly rely heavily on traditional clinical assessments from the last few decades. These traditional methods are based on massive data collection from multiple respondents’ responses and the extent of various behavioral descriptors, which are then recognized by the researcher while forming a diagnostic criterion. However, opting for traditional diagnostic methods, there is a high possibility of being misdiagnosed, which may lead to the administration of unnecessary long-term pharmaceutical treatment. That may lead to reduction in functioning and an increase in the risk of developing additional social and clinical issues. Moreover, such diagnostic procedures are also time-consuming and costly. In this sense, rapid and advanced criteria are required to be accurate and cost-effective. Consequently, this study emphasizes the application of machine learning (ML) tools and deep learning (DL) techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and Deep Learning APIs (Application Programming Interface), for the early diagnosis and treatment of ADHD and ASD symptoms. From this investigation, it can be concluded that diagnostic techniques based on ML reduce the intervention time and increase the accuracy with simultaneous understanding of the techniques and algorithms applied to different types of Image data.

However, much of the marketing literature focuses on customer brand engagement and often in a consumer market setting. This paper advances this literature in two ways by (1) focusing on employees, not customers, as important stakeholders who frequently engage with brands on social media, and by (2) observing brand engagement in a business-to-business context. We develop a conceptual framework based on a theory of word choice and verbal tone to understand the content of engagement observations (i.e., reviews) that breaks into five content dimensions—activity, optimism, certainty, realism, commonality—and four calculated dimensions—insistence, embellishment, variety, and complexity. Then, we examine over 6,300 job reviews authored by employees of B2B firms to explore the differences in the way employees engage with both highly-ranked, and -rated brands versus low-ranked and -rated brands. We find that there are significant differences in nearly all the theoretical dimensions, yet the effect sizes are much larger between high versus low review ratings compared to high versus low B2B brand ranking.

2963,fdd025e077a36166b10120b448d0c4e4009824a9,Model-Agnostic Interpretability of Machine Learning,"Understanding why machine learning models behave the way they do empowers both system designers and end-users in many ways: in model selection, feature engineering, in order to trust and act upon the predictions, and in more intuitive user interfaces. Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety of users and models. We also outline the main challenges for such methods, and review a recently-introduced model-agnostic explanation approach (LIME) that addresses these challenges.",2016.0,23.0,640.0,"{'volume': 'abs/1606.05386', 'name': 'ArXiv'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Ribeiro2016ModelAgnosticIO,\n author = {Marco Tulio Ribeiro and Sameer Singh and Carlos Guestrin},\n journal = {ArXiv},\n title = {Model-Agnostic Interpretability of Machine Learning},\n volume = {abs/1606.05386},\n year = {2016}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '78846919', 'name': 'Marco Tulio Ribeiro'}, {'authorId': '34650964', 'name': 'Sameer Singh'}, {'authorId': '1730156', 'name': 'Carlos Guestrin'}]"

This study demonstrated that such a narrative, based on the concepts of denial and reaction formation, is even more effective if presented as an introductory statement before the film begins. It significantly reduced both physiological and self-report evidence of stress reaction. Moreover, the amount of stress reaction and the capacity of the narrative to reduce stress reaction depended upon personality. Ss high in disposition to deny threat as measured by various MMPI scales did indeed deny affective disturbance more than low deniers, while showing greater autonomic evidence of stress reaction.

The introduction of new intervention techniques in psychiatry has created a need for instruments to evaluate and compare the efficacy of various treatments. Scales that were initially constructed for diagnostic and classificatory purposes have therefore been used to assess treatment effects although it is sometimes doubtful whether they are sensitive enough for that purpose. In 1971, an interdisciplinary group of 15 psychiatrists, psychologists and clinical pharmacologists was formed under the auspices of the Swedish Medical Research Council to study the problem of evaluating change in psychiatric disorders with treatment. An attempt was made to reach agreement on the standardization of measuring techniques. Inquiries were made to all psychiatric university departments in Scandinavia and to the companies producing psychotropic drugs. These revealed a large number of widely differing and overlapping rating scales in current use. None of the scales examined met the requirements of the group and it was felt that no single scale in use could be elaborated or refined sufficiently to adequately measure change over the range of psychiatric syndromes. It was therefore decided to construct a new scale covering psychopathological variables likely to be changed by treatment. Such a scale should be capable of being used either in full, to cover the range of psychopathology or used as a pool of items from which subscales could be drawn for particular psychiatric syndromes.",1978.0,0.0,1250.0,"{'volume': '57', 'name': 'Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Åsberg1978ACP,\n author = {M.

Based on survey data, we show that anger and fear are connected to distinct behaviors online. Angry people are more likely to engage in debates with people having both similar and opposing views. They also seek out information confirming their views more frequently. Anxious individuals, by contrast, tend to seek out information contradicting their opinions.

In the field of affective computing, there is currently some loosely connected research concerning either of these phenomena, but a holistic computational model of affect in sound is still lacking. In turn, for tomorrow’s pervasive technical systems, including affective companions and robots, it is expected to be highly beneficial to understand the affective dimensions of “the sound that something makes,” in order to evaluate the system’s auditory environment and its own audio output. This article aims at a first step toward a holistic computational model: starting from standard acoustic feature extraction schemes in the domains of speech, music, and sound analysis, we interpret the worth of individual features across these three domains, considering four audio databases with observer annotations in the arousal and valence dimensions. In the results, we find that by selection of appropriate descriptors, cross-domain arousal, and valence regression is feasible achieving significant correlations with the observer annotations of up to 0.78 for arousal (training on sound and testing on enacted speech) and 0.60 for valence (training on enacted speech and testing on music). The high degree of cross-domain consistency in encoding the two main dimensions of affect may be attributable to the co-evolution of speech and music from multimodal affect bursts, including the integration of nature sounds for expressive effects.",2013.0,42.0,218.0,"{'volume': '4', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Weninger2013OnTA,\n author = {F.

We consider both the possibility that the EU's AI regulation will incentivise changes in products offered in non-EU countries (a de facto Brussels Effect) and the possibility it will influence regulation adopted by other jurisdictions (a de jure Brussels Effect). Focusing on the proposed EU AI Act, we tentatively conclude that both de facto and de jure Brussels effects are likely for parts of the EU regulatory regime. A de facto effect is particularly likely to arise in large US tech companies with AI systems that the AI Act terms""high-risk"".

Despite significant progress towards the development of empathic social agents, current social robots have yet to reach the full emotional and social capabilities. This paper presents our recent effort on incorporating an automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system based on deep neural networks into the spoken dialog of a social robot (Ryan) to extend and enrich its capabilities beyond spoken dialog and integrate the user's affect state into the robot's responses. In order to evaluate whether this incorporation can improve social capabilities of Ryan, we conducted a series of Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) experiments. In these experiments the subjects watched some videos and Ryan engaged them in a conversation driven by user's facial expressions perceived by the robot. We measured the accuracy of the automated FER system on the robot when interacting with different human subjects as well as three social/interactive aspects, namely task engagement, empathy, and likability of the robot. The results of our HRI study indicate that the subjects rated empathy and likability of the affect-aware Ryan significantly higher than non-empathic (the control condition) Ryan. Interestingly, we found that the accuracy of the FER system is not a limiting factor, as subjects rated the affect-aware agent equipped with a low accuracy FER system as empathic and likable as when facial expression was recognized by a human observer.",2018.0,43.0,7.0,"{'pages': '783-789', 'name': '2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Mollahosseini2018StudyingEO,\n author = {A.

Nevertheless, this construct has not been fully updated with the latest technological advancements. In this perspective, we will show how diverse technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), wearable biosensors, smartphones, or biofeedback techniques, can be applied to the understanding, assessment, and intervention of ER. After providing a brief overview of the currently available technological developments, we will discuss the benefits of incorporating new technologies in ER field, including ecological validity, intervention personalization, and the integration of understudied facets of ER, such as the implicit and interpersonal dimension.",2019.0,131.0,41.0,"{'volume': '10', 'name': 'Frontiers in Psychology'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Colombo2019NewTF,\n author = {D.

Stress was directly related to increased symptomatology and decreased grade point average, whereas mastery beliefs were directly associated with reduced depression and anxiety. Satisfaction with social support was related to anxiety through an interaction with mastery. Neither mastery nor satisfaction with support appeared to act as a stress-buffer through a statistical interaction with stress to moderate effects of high stress. However, earlier analysis of some of the same data showed that total stress, the best predictor of each outcome in this study, was reduced by the combination of strong situation-specific mastery beliefs and high satisfaction with support for subjects who faced many stressors. The combined findings show that situation-specific mastery beliefs reduced appraisal of stress and were associated with better psychological adjustment.",1992.0,32.0,121.0,"{'volume': '70', 'pages': '291 - 303', 'name': 'Psychological Reports'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Felsten1992InfluencesOS,\n author = {G.

Individuals with ASD are characterized by having atypical visual attention patterns, especially in social scenes. Gaze-following is considered to be a key element in understanding social scenarios, and it is reasonable to use stimuli with gaze-following to identify the children with ASD. Thus in this paper, we first construct a dataset of eye movements in gaze-following scenes for children with ASD (i.e., GazeFollow4ASD dataset), including 300 images with gaze-following information inside them and the corresponding eye movement data collected from 8 children with ASD and 10 healthy controls. We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) model to extract discriminative features and classify children with ASD and healthy controls on single images. The proposed model shows the best performance among all compared methods on all datasets.",2020.0,22.0,11.0,"{'pages': '423-427', 'name': '2020 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)'}","{'bibtex': '@Article{Fang2020IdentifyingCW,\n author = {Yi Fang and Huiyu Duan and Fangyu Shi and Xiongkuo Min and Guangtao Zhai},\n journal = {2020 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)},\n pages = {423-427},\n title = {Identifying Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Based on Gaze-Following},\n year = {2020}\n}\n'}","[{'authorId': '2112786740', 'name': 'Yi Fang'}, {'authorId': '19269060', 'name': 'Huiyu Duan'}, {'authorId': '1931825703', 'name': 'Fangyu Shi'}, {'authorId': '2246414', 'name': 'Xiongkuo Min'}, {'authorId': '144826390', 'name': 'Guangtao Zhai'}]"

ER refers to the management and modification of one's own and other people's emotions for a specific purpose. Our study shows how differences in managers' attention to ER influence the extent to which they can mobilize resources to pursue market opportunities. We show how their ER of the self helps them mobilize human capital resources by creating psychic benefits, whereas their ER of others helps mobilize social capital by facilitating legitimacy judgments. Our emerging theory explains how the capacity for ER constitutes an important foundation of dynamic managerial capabilities and how it is linked with other key conceptual underpinnings of the construct, namely managerial human and social capital. Managerial Summary Strategic change processes can be full of ups and downs and have been likened to an emotional roller coaster. In this context, senior managers do not only to have to cope with their own emotions to deal with challenging situations; they also have to pay attention to the emotions of other stakeholders such as employees and investors to maintain or gain these stakeholders' support. Our field study identifies and explains the systematic behaviors that senior managers can use in strategic change contexts to regulate their own emotions as well as those of other stakeholders in order to productively address and overcome difficult business conditions.",2018.0,63.0,84.0,{'name': 'Strategic Management Journal'},"{'bibtex': ""@Article{Huy2018ExploringTA,\n author = {Q.
